Just as we were about to leave the building, the power went off in the entire area of what is called the Heights. When we walked out side the door we immediatly sighted 8/10 large dull red glowing lightes at about a 45 degree angle from the eastern horizon and they appeared to be quite low in altitude over the parking lot of said resteraunt.  These large red lights appeared to have an aura about them possibly because of blowing dust.  The lights were stationary and not moving.  My wife and I observed these lights for about five seconds and she rushed back into the building to bring out more witnesses.  Within the time she returned into the building and came back out with 2 other witnesses, the lights started to dim in unison like the dimmer switch on a houshold room light and totally disappeared from sight.  There was no Physical or definite outline of any type of structure or airframe.  There were no clouds in the sky and stars could be clearly seen where the lights had been but in no correlation to any star groups or constellations.  The lights were the size of ones thumbnail. Unfortunatly the other two witnesses saw nothing by the time they came out of the darkened building. The lights were not in any kind but rather a ragged line from north to south.<n>

This object had no sound, was completely green in color.  It moved slowly across our nighborhood.  We watched it go over and then waited for the sound but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came from the northeast sky and continued to the southwest sky.  It was going very slow.  It was a darkish lime green color with no flashing lights.  At first we thought it was a jet, but no sound or flashing lights came from this object.  We watched it continue across the sky for approximatley 3 to 4 minutes.  It had a circular shape but could possible be oblong or V shape.  We thought it could possibly be the STEALTH, but we realized that in order for the quietness it would have needed to be going a certain speed.  This was going slower than a normal plane. When looking at the object, we were unsure exactly how large it was, because of the depth of the darkness compared to the shape.  No vibrations, no sound, no humming, nothing but complete silence.  We had children trick or treating in our yard with friends, and our first instinct was to get the children inside.  We were very unsure of what this was.  My husband and I felt that you should know this.  We plan on contacting NASA also.<n>

Eight adults and two children witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I was outside looking at our Grandchildren TrickorTreating when all of a sudden we noticed a object that was coming across the sky above the tree tops.  It was a big bright lime green object and we could not tell what shape it was exactly because of the darkness.  To me it was more like an egg shape, but my husband says he remembers it to be more of a rectangular object.  We all watched it closely and quietly because the object made no sound.  This made us feel very eerie and our first reaction and instinct was to get the children inside.  We watched though and it went over our heads slowly and quietly.  It went above the tree tops and into the sky ahead and we watched it as far as we could see.  It never picked up any speed or slowed down.  The green color was the oddest thing about the incident because the object was so mystifying.  There we no flashing lights on it like a plane or helicopter would be.  It was all green.  We are in a flight path for the Hartsfield Airport, but approximately 60 miles out. (N to S path).  This object came across the sky from a different direction than other planes and helicopters.  There were eight adults  and two children witnessing this object.  We were simply amazed at the quietness.  At first we thought that it could be the Stealth Bomber, but this object was going too slow and there were no flashing lights front side or rear like a normal aircraft would be.  Last week my mother in law heard about a sighting similar around the Peachtree Dekalb Airport.  This was on the local news channel and it told of an object that made no sound as it went over and was green in color.<n>

Object was approx.25-30 mi.west of our location. it hovered in the sky at about 30-35 deg above horizon. it did not appear to have any particular shape, but according to the lights configuration it appeared to be disk shaped. it appeared to move at high speed in various directions. lights were multi-colored, very bright (strobe-like) and flashed intermittently. in relation to all previously viewed-known aircraft, this was determined by all witnesses to not be commonly known but rather, obviously ufo. typical aircraft, while having red and clear (white) strobes as required by FAA regulations; this craft had many, close quartered multi-colored lights. red, green, blue, yellow were the most observed. It moved further to the west after 30 minutes of viewing time. Object was both viewed by naken-eye and high powered Bushnell field glasses until it moved far enough out of view to make distinguishable viewing impossible.<n>

Well that’s my story I have other sightings but none as dramatic as this one thanks for reading this.<n>

Then I realized that it didn&#39;t move at an angle like a star would.  Then I thought it was a rocket, but it didn&#39;t make any noise.  My brother yelled for our Mom and his wife to come out and see this! and he told me to get my camera.  My sister and her friend pulled up and got out of the car as I was running to get the camera.  I dashed out and took a picture from in front of my house and ran to the side yard to take a second one.  We all saw this firey rather long narrow object for well over a minute.  It descended at a slow steady rate of speed toward the earth.  I was so struck by what I saw that I didn&#39;t even think to really focus on the object that was higher in the sky and very bright.  We are pretty normal people who were gathered for a family Halloween Party.  We are ages 22 to 56.  I was struck most by the slow steady, non-angular movement of this thing.<n>

Just outside of Rochelle I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked to the right through my windshield.   Off in the distance over the cornfields was a bright orange glowing ball floating down.  It floated down for a second and then seemed to change shape from a glowing ball into a cone.  However, the glow was not visible on the cone shaped part of the object.  The object grew smaller until it disappeared.   It&#39;s height in relation to a tower off in the distance made it seem twice it&#39;s height.  I could not judge it&#39;s distance from me.  What I believe I was seeing was not the object changing shape, but the object slipping into a V-Shaped opening in the sky, which made it appear to be changing shape as it entered it...and eventually disappeared into.  This whole sighting happened in about 3-4 seconds.<n>

It took me a while but I finally got sight of a orange round object slowly traveling across the sky over the mountains. It was lighter in color toward the top and I could make out blochy looking designs around the top area of its shape. The orange glow of it was rather faint. There were a number of poeple around us looking at it in wonder trying to figure out what it was also. Then after a bit it disappeared over the mountains toward the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then sighting actually took place more toward the outskirts of the city and no telling how many actually saw it besides the small crowd around us. There was no sound emitting from the object but that might have been covered up by the sounds of the traffic. There was air traffic around including some comerical flights from a major airport.<n>

It was a report of a &#34;Dimensional Porthole&#34; opening in which I saw Kennedy&#39;s head w/eyes closed and a gray behind him..Just heads...Here in Mass. we still seem to have at least one plane and occupant missing, last heard from in Southern MA, and 2 people missing from boats in area between where Kennedys&#39; plane went down and Martha&#39;s Vineyard. Third body was found. His boat was found also.  Anyway, now The 767 today went down in the same area...45 miles South of Nantucket...Nantucket and Martha&#39;s Vineyard are in close proximity close to Southern Mass and Rhode Island. This, coupled with the fireball of last Wednesday, seems to put this part of the Eastern North American Coast into some sort of area that is not very healthy...to say the very least..guess we might even add Payne Stewart&#39;s wayward 35A to this list on the Eastern seaboard.  Just had to tell you.. Also, remember I told you 2 years&#39; ago, I heard a voice upon awakening say &#34;Soon this planet shall not be as you remember it&#34;..well, 3 weeks ago, 3 days in a row, upon awakening, a voice said  &#34;Stay where God can find you&#34;.  I have to repeat that I believe in God, but am no means fanatic and do not attend church at all regularly, not for years... Just want to add to the strange happenings that are occurring.  Take care of yourselves.....<n>

No bridge over us and we could hear no engine sound other than the truck engine even with the truck windows open. the windows were bright but opaque. The object flew over us at 10-15 miles an hour in a straight line. My partner was sitting in the passenger seat, and was talking on the CB radio with some other drivers on the road who also saw the object. I am a retired Army sergeant who taught aircraft recognition. I have never seen this configuration on any aircraft.We have been driving truck together for 5 years. I was 50, she 49. The object was also seen by two ladies driving from Portland Or, to Lubbock TX, who were also on the CB radio, and 3 other truck drivers.<n>

My father is retired, 68 years of age and was a heavy construction mechanic for 35 years. Dad designed and built numerous pieces of equipment used in the highway construction industry. Also, Dad is an atheist, no religious background of any kind! My mother, 62 years of age, was a part time cook and a full time mother, Catholic, and a strong belief in God. My parents live approximately 15 miles south of Tracy, California and have resided there for 22 years. They have a walnut orchard and it is located very close to interstate I-5 and Highway 132. On or around October 30, 1999, at about 8:00 p.m. both my parents where in the backyard sitting in their hot-tub. My mother looks to the south behind their orchard and observes two enormously large, what appeared to be circular objects with blinking red lights hovering approximately 500 feet in the air. The craft were spaced about 200 feet apart. They hovered in this position for between 60 and 90 seconds and there was no sounds at all heard coming from these craft. One craft then sped North over there home and the other went due East. When the craft left the area, they left at an unbeliveable speed, no sound what so ever heard, and the red lights that where observed changed to white when they departed. Both my parents are at a loss to explain what they witnessed and are even fearful to come forward to tell their story. They have never seen anything like this before and do not want to be percieved as crazy! But, this event forever changed their belief as to what may exist in our planet. They do not know if what they observed was alien, or, was some type of top secret military aircraft.<n>

Very fast. Lights changed position as it went out of view over eastern horizon. It really went fast. No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my back patio which faces west. Looking up into the very clear sky (we are having Santa Ana&#39;s today) Dim lights in a boomerang shape flew right over my house. It seemed to be very high. I would guess 10,000 feet or so. I stood to watch it fly in an easterly direction. It flew straight. As it flew east it appeared that the lights changed positions and reformed in another boomerang shape before it went over the horizon. There was no sound. At first I thought it might be something from Miramar ( the air base near our home - about 8 miles south of us) but it was going too fast for any kind of airplanes. The lights seemed to be very dim - almost like a reflection. It was actually very graceful looking. It went extremely fast.<n>

It looked like something falling out of the sky smoking. Nothing was visible.We never saw anything come out. It looked like a contrail after it fully appeared. I dropped them of and went back home I immediately told my husband to come out on the back porch to see if he could tell me what it was that I saw. He looked and he said it is a cloud , but it was not moving like the oter clouds. I told him that at first I thought it was a meteorite. We then decided it was some sort of contrail but there was no aircraft in sight. We continued to watch and he saw a nikel colored object fly out of it. I did&#39;nt see it at first then I kept watching and I saw it fly back into it , then a few seconds later it shot back out and flew all around this contrail or what ever it was. Then it disappeared for a few minutes. We kept watching and it flew back out and disappeared . We never saw it again. I was scared by this . I don&#39;t know what it was, neither did my husband . It started out as some sort of weird contrail and then it became stationary, then this nikel colored object flew all around and in and out of it for about 15 minutes. Very weird. When this object was flying you could hear no sound or see any contrail coming out of it. I don&#39;t know what it was I have never seen anything like it. My husband is a floor covering installer and I own my own cleaning service. I can assure you we are not a couple of ufo nuts . Until now my husband has been a skeptic. I believe there is something going on with all these sightings, but I am not so sure it is from somewhere else, but what-ever it is I would feel safer knowing that our Government knew about it. But I also feel that as a tax paying citizen that I have a right to know what it is. Also about an hour after we saw this we heard jets flying, we looked out and they were headed in the same direction as to where we saw the &#34;thing&#34; for lack of a better word. I would not have thought that strange until they turned around and went back several times , like they were doing a grid search . Thats about it I hope you can explain what this was to me I am really worried about it. Thank you.<n>

After exploring some dirt roads off of highway 375 a large orange light suddenly illuminated before us. It got brighter and seemed to &#34;jump&#34; from side to side. Then it quickly dimmed and appeared instantly in a new spot quite distant in the sky.  Very interesting experience.  The observers are my friends that I have known for years. This is no joke.<n>

Highly ironic because I live where you can always see  planes all the time at 5:55 in the sky.Just about a week earlier before the sighting we had an earthquake wich is highly rare for phoenix.The whole event of seeing the ship seemed strange like you were watching some kind of sourcery or magic show.It was very unatural and not of this dimension.As it moved away from us it apeared to go 2 moves forward and then onemove backwards like stretching out a ruuberband.It almost looked like it was emmitting some kind of magnetic aura about it.6 months earlier using the jon bro technique i photographed a rod as big as a city.towards california.phoenix is a definite hot spot r! ight now for ufos.I dont know why phoenix but it semms to be a cental geographically locacation for dispursment of craft.<n>

It first appeared to be an airplane without any discernable features or a shiny balloon. It was moving too fast to be a balloon and an airplane has discernable features. It moved across the sky at, what appeared to be a high rate of speed, for about 3 minutes, when it slowed and seemed to hover in a small area. After about 30 seconds, it rose slowly into the clouds.<n>

It could have not possbibly been an aircraft of this earth so instead of heading home I took a right and proceeding to follow it. I followed it for about 40 seconds to a minute before it took a path downard and then  postioned itself to where the pointed part of the teardrop was facing at a 45 degree angel and just zoomed by a an incredible speed, and then dissapeared. Neeless to say I was amazed and not scared at all.  This is my 5 ufo encounter, but first to be put online, and I&#39;m an amateur ufologist, and this really blew my mind away.<n>

A point of light streaking upward quite a distance to the east of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a big event all in all, but thought it might be useful if someone closer saw more detail.  Aproximately 01:50 Thurs. morning, 10-28-99, I was driving eastbound on 120th St. (gravel road in the country, 2 miles south of Augusta). About 10 degrees to the south of due east I saw a white point of light streak up at about 15 degrees to the south of vertical. My impression was that it was also moving away. (Mostly up, but a slightly southeasterly heading. My first thought was that it reminded me of a reverse shooting star. It didnt seem to have a tail other than a tracer effect due to the speed it traveled. It went from just above the horizon to gone (about 60 degrees up) in about 1 1/2 seconds. Again, not a major event, but might lend credence if someone way east of me saw it before it departed. I&#39;m an experienced pilot and know nothing earthly moves that fast. I&#39;d like to take it for a spin just the same. KK<n>

I was looking at Orion this evening when I noticed this thing it was almost straight down from the first star in Orions belt.  I&#39;m still observing it does seem to be getting somewhat higher but still a white light flashing red and blue.

I noticed a bright light moving from the south to the north first appearing  at about a60 degree elevation from the horizon as I faced west. The light appeared elliptical in shape from my perspective, consisting of a  bright golden glow with 3 distinct equidistant points of light within the elliptical shape. Size and distance were difficult to judge. It moved very quickly  across my field of view. The lights did not resemble any aircraft lights I am familier with. After watching it for about 15 seconds, the glow began to slowly dim, taking 3 or 4 seconds to become completly dark leaving only the 3 point lights visible. The brightness of the point lights diminished slightly, but remained visible for several seconds until dissappearing behind trees. No sounds were audible during observation. Light were last observed heading north/northeast.<n>

Dazed deer present.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55253.html|37|ndxe199910| A man and his two kids see a clear UFO less than a mile away during an autumn evening in Austin, Texas.  Dazed deer present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it&#39;s low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn&#39;t in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it&#39;s surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two &#34;nipples&#34; on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can&#39;t estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he&#39;d gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at &#34;them&#34;.  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn&#39;t want to signal them, and I said that I wasn&#39;t sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, &#34;I don&#39;t know if they are good or bad, and I don&#39;t want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.&#34;  I was also thinking, &#34;Man, if only my kids weren&#39;t here, I&#39;d get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I&#39;m trapped under these circumstances.&#34;  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, &#34;If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees&#34;, so without hesitating much, that&#39;s what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we&#39;ve retold it several times, but I certainly don&#39;t want them to forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the drawing somewhere in a box in the attic or inside a book, but I can&#39;t remember where exactly, and it&#39;s been over 7 years now since the incident.  If I ever run into it, I&#39;ll scan it and send it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still keep my eye out in the sky, so if I ever catch anything again, I&#39;ll also send it your way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I looked up and saw what I first thought was a satellite, although it seemed to be too large, moving from due west to due east.  I watched it for a total of 15 minutes, noticing the following events: Repetitively stopping and starting, speeding up and slowing down. A final stop, a pause, then a change of direction to the northwest.  It then took off at a higher speed than any noticed before. I then got up because my break was over.

I held my left thumb up to see if it covered the object. It was bigger than it so i extended my arm and held up two fingers, then three and it was bigger than them.So i watched it a couple seconds.It was moving at a steady but slow speed towards Laurel, coming out of the south, I could not see if it had solid form because it was too far from me .Ichecked my speedometer  so i could see how far i was from Laurel.,Ms. when i got there it showed i was 5miles when i stopped. the sky was clear and alot of stars could be seen.It was oval shaped and no sound.<n>

It made very small quick action heading changes a few times, no more than a few deg&#39;s though as it continued north. Object had a series of white lights in diamond formation pointing down, with one VERY strong strobe type light to the rear...All lights were white. The whole craft look as if trianglar the size of a DC 10....No noise was detectable, and moved to slowly to keep a conventinal aircraft airborne Although I&#39;ve been inactive for a longtime, I do hold a Com.

I am an artist and I would be willing to draw a picture of what I saw. I have a Masters in Writing. I consider my self to be level-headed. Frankly, I don&#39;t know what I saw. But I know this...it was not a plane or helicopter it was just too big. I have lived near OHare airport for the past 20 years. I know planes.

When I went outside, i could not believe my eyes because it was so big and so bright that I kept telling myself, &#34;no this is not for real&#34; I was looking out toward the northwest from 31st  street and it was about 2 football fields big and looked like a blimp it was white and oval shaped with orange running lights circling around it and bright red and yellow lights around variuos parts of this object. I thought okay, the white sox are playing and a blimp is flying around but, the object was to low and I know they wouldn&#39;t allow a blimp to fly at night in the crowded aerospace around O&#39;hara airport. It moved quite slow as if, it wanted to be seen. It was traveling toward the west. I also noticed that there was silence, as if you could hear a pin drop. I apologize for not reporting this as soon as it happened because my wife claims that it wasnt a UFO. We were living in a townhome off of 31st and Ogden Ave. in westmont ILL. at the time this event occurred.I was working for Worldcom at the time.She was working for Security Link.

We anchored on the Western Coast of Chesapeake Bay.  As night fell, our vantage from the boat was Eastward and we saw a range of approaching aircraft landing lights, presumably heading toward Andrews AFB.  The glidepath seemed to be just above us, the aircraft further out were highest on the path and as they approached, the lights lowered and became brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With conventionally powered binoculars,  I looked at one that didn&#39;t appear to be moving toward the top of the the range and it looked like Saturn, a disk with a globe in it.  I assumed it was Saturn.  Its brightness was the same as the other lights at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke at 4:30 the following morning and noticed the light seemed to still be there, upon looking within binoculars,  I saw it was exactly the same shape.  I know that had it been a planet, it should now be in Western sky.  A satelite wouldn&#39;t emit that much light and if it reflected the Sun&#39;s light, which it could, it couldn&#39;t reflect it back to my position at both 20:00 hours and 4:30 hours when the sun would be have moved 90 degrees relative to our position.  The only answer was a huge, self illuminating object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was dark out, save for a basically full moon. I could tell its shape by an outline of white lights emanating from its periphory. It was in a relatively remote area, between Roy Wa. and Spanaway Wa. on a stretch of road that traverses the Fort Lewis military reservation. As I was driving, it seemed to come straight towards me, at a very low altitude. My instinct was to pull to the side of the road, almost to get out of its way. Then it turned immediatly to its right (my left), and dissappeared. It was so low, it almost appeared to go into the tall trees that border the road. I have been traveling this route, which is in the immediate traffic area of Mchord air force base, for quite some time, and have seen a lot of different types of aircraft, but this thing was bigger than any jumbo jet. Its travel path was very strange during the short time I saw it. Its turning characteristic seemed very abrupt, very unlike conventional aircraft. Just thought this might be significant, in light of some other recent sightings.<n>

They did not appear to be flying toward a certain destination.  The objects were located throughout the sky, widely separated from each other and doing their own  maneuvers. They were not in sinc with eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Ocober 25, 1999 I observed from my car some moving lights in the sky that sometimes flashed red and white and didn&#39;t think much of it. I saw approximately five.  I saw the objects in the southeastern sky. I was located approximately 3 miles north of Moravia,NY just to the south of Owasco Lake. It was approximately 7:05 pm.  On October 26, 1999 my fiance was the one to spot the lights at approximately the same time, 7:05.  He had been in a tree stand hunting deer when he first noticed.  He did not know that I had seen them the previous night. I always pick him up on the side of the road when he is done hunting just as it gets dark. On this night, he was already out of the woods when I arrived and was looking up at the sky.  I knew at that moment he was seeing what I saw the night before.  As I pulled over, he waved for me to get out of the car.  We both saw approximately 20 lights, some flashing red and white throughout the southeastern sky.  The azimuth was anywhere from 90 degrees to 180 degrees.  The altitudes of the lights were anywhere from 15 degrees to 60 degrees approximately.  When we looked at any one specific light, you could tell it was moving compared to the stars.  It would flash and appear to stop and then move straight upward from its stopping point.  Then it would disappear (the light) and reappear very close to where it disappeared a second or two ago.  Eventually in a minute or two, another light, a different one would catch the corner of our eyes and we would focus on that.  At one time, you could see approximately five lights without turning your head to a different azimuth.  The five lights would be at different altitudes, but all of them flashed either red or white.  They did not flicker like stars, they flashed. When an object flashed, it did not flash in a certain time interval.  It flashed randomly.  When the objects moved, they would only move in their own section of the sky.  I did not see an object streak across the whole southeastern part of the sky.  When it moved, it e! ither mo ved straight up from where it was stopped (about two or three finger widths at one time). Some of them would then disappear from view completely.  Many of the objects moved in circular or curved paths. The total distance of the paths of any objects I could see for long enough without disappearing was about five to ten fingerwidths.  None of them were going in a straight path parallel to the horizon. As we traveled back home, approximately six miles away from that area, we could still see the objects, but not as many. I called someone that lived in Moravia to view the objects. They saw them too.  I also called someone in Locke, which is just south of Moravia a few miles to view the objects.  They saw them too.  It was approximately 8:30 pm when we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Under most circumstances, in a case in which objects are allegedly witnessed for 90 minutes, we would first address the possibility that the witness was observing celestial bodies.  However, in this instance, a similar event was reported from the Dayton, OH, area, at approximately the same time.  We are awaiting those latter reports at the time of this writing.))<n>

WE had noticed and mentioned  that there was a lot of jets in the sky, All in the East sky near the horizon. Approx. 6-8. When we got out of our vehicle in the parking lot of the store, we noticed what looked to be two small yet very bright stars, If you were looking at the sky as a painting you could say that they were about 2&#34; apart. I hope that this is a reasonable discription. I know that it was many miles apart in reality. The jets were leaving a short trail behind them and seem to be moving very fast. They were very high in the sky and seemed to be about the same heighth in the sky as the two still objects. As one of the jets got closer to the first object, the one on the left just disapeared and the one on the right moved to my left and away from the jet at a much greater speed than the jet ( many times faster )<n>

I was watching a plane high in the air spraying a chemtrail. It had passed over me but I continued to watch the trail. Then out of nowhere was a hugh cylinder. It looked like it was falling. My first thought was a large plane was going to crash but then I could see no wings or tail. It fell for about 4 seconds and then it just took off to the south and in 3 seconds it was gone. The top of this craft was white and the bottom a rust color. It had no markings and it was very big. It looked like a cylinder or a cigar. The front and back had rounded corners or edges. The sky was cloudless except for the chemtrails which were spreading into a cloudbank. I have seen many objects or craft before but this one was a surprize right in the middle of the day. There was no sound and I estimated it to be about 3 to 5 thousand feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if anyone else saw the object as I was looking up at the chemtrails.<n>

The colors were so bright I thought it might be a distant blimp putting on a light show. It turned out to be moving accross the sky at the same rate as the other stars, and according to my rangefinder, I was focused at infinite settings, beyond the moon. I shot about 45 minutes of this on video tape. It was, as far as I can tell, a star that was flashing many colors, something I&#39;ve never seen or heard of before.<n>

Then they lit up the street like they were looking for something ( the light was red ) then they came lower and I saw in to the ships...the beings were green small bodies long necks BIG heads.......then the went up out of site.............it was cool maybe it&#39;s @ area 51 now i dont know<n>

It remain|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10330.html|61|ndxe199910| I was out with my dogs and watched a red light object moving slowly from so. to so. west and stopping and moving very slow.   It remained motionless in the air for about 5 to 6 min.  Then it just kept coming down as if to meet the ground and at a slow pace then going up and then it kept coming down as if to land.   The light was a red vibrating light not the sort as an airplane would have and not going off and on.   I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore an it was well below the tree tops and it just seemed to keep on a steady course of coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape seem to appear round and a red light that was vibrating like from deeper red to pinkish and just kept doing that.   At first I thought it was an airplane but the more I watched it it wasn&#39;t moving like airplanes would move.  It would stop in a area then start up again and moving downward.   Once it started back up and then it just kept coming down as toward the ground.  When I first saw it,  it was due south then it was goin south/west.   It appeared to be slowly falling to the ground,   and there was no noise at all.   You would hear an airplane in the sky if it were,   and the light was very different.  It was almost like a strob light affect.   I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it any longer then came into the house to contact you.   One other detail I have three Shih Tzu&#39;s and they were just standing next to me the whole time and just smelling the air as if there was something there.   And this is odd because I have a seven month old pup who never stands still when I take them out at night,  they stood the whole time with me some twenty minutes not moving.    I had to force them to come into the house when I could no longer see it.<n>

My husband was awakened as I slapped his chest with my hand as I was standing on the brakes trying to stop the car. The fireball came from the east and moved horizontal to the west. I was on hwy 21 going south and I watched it cross over I-77, clearing the tree line and one of the foothills that we have in our area. The Fireball was about the size of those blue plastic kiddy pools. The fire trail behind it looked to be about 8ft long. It appeared so fast but it took a bit longer to disappear because the viewing area was not blocked by objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not scare very easily, I am a retired Nurse and I am trained to be observant, however this thing had me so upset that I sat in the middle of the road for several minutes before I could calm down enough to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly thought that it was going to hit us when I first got a glimpse of the fire from my peripheral vision! . The fireball looked so close but it had to be several miles up or the heat of it would have started fires along its path, as it zipped by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It blocked out the stars, and was low enough that I could see its shape, just like something totally black against a nite sky, ie: just black enough to be darker than the sky. It had absolutely no sound. I said to my cousin, &#34;Look at that.  What in the hell is that?&#34;  She looked up and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  She seemed less concerned, interested, at the moment as she was watching for her daughter and husband and saying hi to friends from the school, other parents, etc.  I was visiting there.  But I was so in awe of it I kept looking at it.  It just floated over us and all the people leaving the game and over the football field and stands. The back of it had a huge round what I would call like a fire burner that I have seen in the past on the back of fighter jets.  Don&#39;t know if those still exists or not, as I haven&#39;t seen one in years.  It was round with firelight.  NO SOUND AT ALL, tho, that I could hear.  Even hot air balloons have a kind of swooshing sound as they use the &#34;burner&#34;, or whatever, to push hot air up into the balloons, which I have heard at the annual balloon race in St. Louis.  I kept calling my cousin&#39;s attention to it and she would look up and comment so I know she saw it, and we did talk about it later, but she was preoccupied watching the traffic, etc.  Two things really amazed me---I was incredibly in an awestruck state of mind, and I felt no fear, but alot of curiousity.  AND noone, with all those people around us, seemed to notice or be looking up or anything.  I am amazed that I didn&#39;t call out to look at that---but I was so in awe--almost trancelike, tho I was in no tr! ance, observing it in amazement. It drifted off.  I saw no lights on it other than what I call like the big fire red burner on the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLEASE NOTE:  I don&#39;t know how to email you about the report I just submitted to make a correction I couldn&#39;t figure out how to make after you showed me the report.

I was on my porch smoking and I noticed three egg shaped lights in the formation of a triangle flying very fast...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were on the patio smoking.  he is the one that said &#34; hey honey, look at that!&#34;.  I looked at it just as it was flying directly above my head.  As I stared at it, I tried to analys what it was.  It all happened quickly but my first view was three egg shaped lights moving together in the shape of a triangle.  I thought well It must be military jets in formation or somthing.  i thought that because they were at a very fast speed.  I didnt realize they were seperate until the two back end lights of the triangle seperated for about 2 seconds.  then I was tripping out.  Then it seemed to go up higher into the sky until it became small and we could not see it anymore.  My boyfriend and I looked at eachother and he pointed out two regular airplanes flying above us.  &#34; see, those are planes, those are flying much slower.  What the hell was that?&#34;  We then realized we can hear those planes flying.  we did not hear a sound when we saw that thing.  I dont believe in aliens but I can definately say it was some sort of ufo.  That&#39;s for sure.<n>

I told my wife to look at the object and she did. I put the baby down and went to get my binoculars which is a 7x35 extra wide Switf sportking.I looked at the object and it was disc or round i couldn&#39;t see because i wasn&#39;t holding the binoculars steady., so i braced them against a pole  and  i could see that the object looked like it was changeing shape to a triangle type then it went behind trees. The sky was very blue and clear.<n>

Both Objects were illuminating a yellowish amber color light. from the entire craft.  I returned into my home, got my brother and father to come outside and witness this sighting, and objects were clearing visible to the naked eye. Still moving in the pattern originnaly observes.  All three of us agree this was unidentifiable.We Also confirmed this sighting was viewing the objects thru high power binoculars.  And agree that these were not balloons, airplanes, or a blimp.  These were crafts that were being propelled somehow. However, no sound, or contrail was visible or heard. It was slight moisture in the air, a contrail would have been formed if this a jet.<n>

Im a normal, level headed person, and what i saw that night absolutely freaked me out beyond belief. Me and two friends were just hagning outside my house, when all of a sudden i looked up and saw the most bizzare thing I have ever seen.  This blueish/purple ball with spinning rotating neon rings was just hovering just over the trees in a manner i have never seen. It didnt look like a convential ufo, or a blimp, or plane, and it was eerily silent.  It looked like something from another world!  The thought that it was some type of conventional aircraft never even crossed my mind. I instantly just knew I was looking at something completely out of place. The three of us just freaked out. My friends went to chase it, and I ran inside to get my dad. By the time I came out, they lost it. We were about to go inside, when we saw a a blimp that said &#39;sanyo&#39;. Traveling in normal blimp fasion, headed westward over I-88.  We then brushed this off as what we saw all along, feeling stupid for waking up my dad, and thinking we saw a ufo.  The wierd thing is we never mentioned it again. 5 years have passed since then, and Im not convinced that what we originally saw was a blimp. Common sense and logic say that it was a blimp that we first saw, but  I know what I saw, and still believe we saw two different objects that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was near a small private airport in Baldwin WI watching several loads of jumpers deploy from 11,000 ft. agl when I noted the bright light about 45 degrees above horizon and bearing about 240 degrees from Baldwin.  This object DID NOT MOVE over an hour and one half of repeated observations. I called this in to your people and also called the nearest FAA Flight Service station in Princeton MN.  I do not know what this was but it was like a star visible at noontime !  There were no clouds.  I am certain the object was well above 11,000 feet agl since the jump planes were clearly below it in altitude when jumpers deployed.  I am certainly no &#34;kook&#34; but this was a very odd pheonmenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former private pilot and current skydiving student.  Age 56.  Hold both M.D. and Ph.D.(chemistry) degrees.  I have never seen anything like this before.  Surely this must be a planet or star (?) but the brightness of this silver-white thing was such that it was visible to the naked eye.  I watched it using 8 x 24 binoculars.  It never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  During the telephoned report from Wisconsin, we explored the possibility that the object witnessed might have been the planet, Venus.  The witness was going to attempt to triangulate the object&#39;s position, and look on other days in approximately the same area of the sky.))<n>

It moved steadily E like a satellite except it was way too low for a satellite sighting and was as bright as Jupiter and a littel bigger. No other lights present or around it. It curved a little to the Northeast as I watched it for 3 to 5 minutes, gaining in intensity somewhat a few times as it moved away, also similar to a satellite sighting. This was brigher, lower, and moving in an elliptical path, first approaching from the north, then heading east, and then moving away to the northeast of Iowa City. I knew I would not have time to go back to the house to get my binoculars. I was walking just 50 feet from my house when I spotted the object.<n>

As if it had intelligence, realizing that I saw it, it just SHOT across the sky, in a WSW direction.  I watched, expecting to see it complete it&#39;s journey, but almost as soon as it started to speed up to go, it was like it hit a speed that I cannot describe, and just simply DISAPPEARED!!  I was left with a tingling feeling, and an emotional impact that I just did not expect!  I almost cried!  I saw this, I KNOW I did!!!  What an experience!<n>

We were playing music and and singing by the bonfire. No one was intoxicated. Someone pointed and said, &#34;there&#39;s a UFO&#34;.  Everyone stopped playing music and stood up. I saw, without my glasses unfortunately, a column-shaped object vertically and silently glide across the sky. It appeared to have 3 muted lights lined up vertically along the column.  The sky was very clear with a bright full moon except for a few light wisps of fog.  The object was seen for around 30 seconds before it went behind the fog.  It never came back out! There were different descriptions of the object seen. One person said that she saw a column of 4-6 hazy lights that was traveling at an angle. Another person (who might file a report too) said that she saw a grey- colored vertical rectangle, that was backlit and that had a triangular shaped exhaust coming off the back. Everyone was very matter-of-fact about the whole thing.<n>

Several witnesses saw lights around the perimeter - I could only see that it appeared to be &#34;backlit.&#34;  The night had been cloudy but was clear when the object was seen.  As it moved to the south, it disappeared behind/into a cloud and was not seen again.<n>

Couldn&#39;t tell what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at a housewarming party a group of us were standing out in the driveway at approx 17:30 - 18:00.  Someone pointed up and asked what this object was.  It looked like a jet and it&#39;s contrails...but the contrails were not growing and it seemed like the object was not moving.  It looked a bit like a pair of flourescent tubes just sitting idle in the sky.  I did notice during the day that there was a good amount of contrail activity that day, but this looked much brighter than contrails.  Like I mentioned earlier there seemed to be no evidence of any movement/growth or any trace of fading contrails.  Then everyone just went back to conversation.  I looked back up a few minutes later and the object was completely gone.  There was absolutely no trace of anything have been there.  Normally you would see some faded contrails or something to show that something was there.  The object appeared to be quite a distance away, so it may very well have been a jet and contrails.  I just thought it looked a little odd, because there was no evidence of movement, and it just seemed brighter than contrails.  Then upon looking again, it was just gone.  This may not be anything, but I thought I&#39;d report it to see if this may add to someone else&#39;s report.  I do NOT have any further information, since I didn&#39;t really watch it for any extended period of time.  I just looked as someone pointed it out for a couple of minutes, then looked up a couple of minutes later to see nothing was there.  I will leave an e-mail address, but feel I will not be able to supply too much more information...so please do NOT release the e-mail information.  THANKS!<n>

No helicopter sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 06:30 hrs. Sat. 23 Oct 99 I was having a dream. I was looking up at a starlit night. I focused in on a triangular craft. (I saw a triangular craft 4 Apr 97) This craft started to bank and go in a small circle. (97 sighting - craft made no noise) I wanted to listen to the sound it was making. It sounded like a whosh of some sort. Much like the scarob in the game Riven. There was no engine sound, just the whosh like air was being fanned out of the way. The UFO in my dream got closer as it circled counter clockwise. Then it shot off. Later that morning after waking up I went out to the kitchen and my daughter asked me if I heard that sound. I was a bit surprised. She defined the same sound that I had in my dream with exact detail. Even the circling. It was such an unusual sound that my daughter ran outside to see if she could see anything. She heard the same sound from far off in the distance about a minute later. Keep in mind that she is 15 and still a little scared of the dark. But the sound was so loud and strange, she managed to go out back to search for it. We lived in this house for 12 years and NEVER heard anything like that. I&#39;ve worked with trains, helicopters and lots of sound equipment and I never heard this sound.<n>

The objects were moving too fast to be aircraft and too slowly to be meteorites. I phoned local ATC and reported the incident (I have never done such a thing before) and they told me that two Pilots reported the same sight at about the same time and there was nothing on radar. The object disappeared from view behind a tree abd then disappeared altogether. If this can be explained - I would sure like to know because I am totally freaked out by what I saw. There was total silence and the the objects were not very high , but not very low either - I cannot gauge in actual feet, but could roughly show the flight path in the sky.<n>

At the end of the 5 minutes it appeared to &#34;roll&#34; up on its side and turned toward the north.  The weather was clear with some high white clouds. It appeared to go north and disappeared into the clouds.  Iwould guess it was over the City of Orange or Anaheim in the area of Disneyland<n>

It was in the west, moving southwest. I was along the east bank of the Great Miami river.  It was clear where I was but morning fog lingered to the south. There there were clouds to the south as well. It appeared to be at normal airplane altitude but moving slowly. Its appparent speed was that of a jet at high altitude but it seemed to be much lower. It appeared as long as my thumb is wide, veiwed at arm&#39;s length. The ends seemed brighter than its length, the ends seemed shiny, the length grey-white. It was moving into the low clouds. I knew that it would disappear before I could get a camera or antoher witness. I kept thinking that my mind was playing tricks on me.  I thought my perspsective would change or angle of view, or something, would change.... that it would turn out to be an airplane or even a blimp. If it was a blimp or dirigible I would have seen more detail (GOODYEAR or FUJI, cockpit etc.) It looked like nothing more or less than a slow flying tube w/ rounded, mirrored end.  Definitely an UNIDENTIFIED flying object.<n>

Descended 15 degrees in approximately 3 seconds. Object was observed in the city limits, however, I do not believe there was enough light to diminish an ionization trail. It was exceptionally bright, and lacking a standard color format, it was the color of a BLUE Christmas tree light. I am an aviation historian, and amateur radio operator, and I specialize in &#34;bouncing&#34; signals off of Meteor trails. I know of no substance that burns in this color, so will discount a Leonids meteor, which was prevalant at this time. Object was quite large, and no signs of diminshment in size, such as a meteor would display.<n>

Anyway I was curious and went to your archives and lo and behold a posting of 3/9/2004 drew my attention. I believe it was from Va. The report read that the person saw a large rectangular craft.......had a starry looking underside and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> well this really blew me away because in Oct. of 1990 I saw something that was very similiar. I was living in Ripley Tn at the time. My dog woke me up about 1:00 a.m. barking his head off. Thinking that maybe something was wrong with my horses I grabbed a flashlight and went outside to investigate. Seeing that the horses were fine, I found the dog barking in the back yard and looking up. At the time I didn&#39;t think to look up, but did hear a low hum like you&#39;d hear from power lines only a bit deeper and louder. I got the dog around to the front yard and sat on the front porch steps to have a cig.Anyway I looked up to the sky since it was a clear and starry night and noticed a huge patch of stars that seemed to be very close.(meanwhile the dog is still whining and distressed and I keep hearing this low humming noise) all of a sudden this patch of stars starts moving and then I could see this huge rectangular outline ariund the whole thing. It must have been the lenth of at least 2 football fields and was at least as 3/4 the width of a football field. To tell the truth I was pretty shaken at this point but I couldn&#39;t move...... this thing wasn&#39;t that high only ,maybe 300 feet. Then it started sorta of floating to the South towards Memphis. It seemed to have come from the North. The humming stopped,a few of the star like lights flashed and it just moved on. I had never seen anything like this in my life.Finally when it was out of sight I went back inside and my daughter who was 12 at the time yelled out Mom, why were you out so long? I just told her at the time I was checking the horses. I can tell you this....I laid awake a long time that night pondering all this and the next morning felt sort of addled but I know what I saw and have never forgot it. The only people I&#39;ve ever shared this with was my daughter when she was grown, my mom and my husband of 7 years. But when I found someone who&#39;d seen something so similiar and so recent I just had to share this. I hope you put this in the recent postings so that! if anyone else has seen something like this,maybe they&#39;ll come forward to. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest! I am 48 years old and not an avid ufo seeker though I do like to stargaze and if a ufo shows up fine but since this happened have had 2 more sightings one 3 years afo of the classic triangle of lights and another in March of a phere shaped objuect seen in broad daylight. My husband was with me and saw the last two himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up and saw a bright object traveling from the north in a southern direction approx 10 deg. easr of straight up. I watched it for approx 15 seconds. I could not see any flashing lights and my first thought was it is a satalite.  It seemed quite high and I got the impression that it was reflecting sunlight because it had the same shine as the moon which was approx 20 deg  west of the object. At that point the object stopped and stayed in that position.  I went inside and got my 7x50 glasses and my wife to come out and see it. She said she could see a small flashing on the left side but I could not see any other lights At that piont it was approx 20 deg to my s/sw.  I thought at the time it must be very large to be so bright because I got the sense it was very high also. I kept checking on it till 0130am 10/22/99 and went in.  It did not change its position other than to move in relation to the stars and the moon during that time.  At 0430am10/22/99 I went out to look at it again and it had moved to approx 35 to 40 deg above the horizin in the west.  The morning star, Venus was comming up in the east at that time and the brightnes of venus was very close to the brightnes of the object the previous night. The object and the morning star were approx 150 deg apart at that time (0430am). I have seen many satalites and this was at least 2 to 3 times brighter and larger.  The object and the planet Venus were approx on the some latitude.<n>

The light traveled at a very high rate of speed visible for only a second or two and was followed by a tail like a meteor as it streaked by. I calculate that the light was very large, measuring the size of my small finger nail at arms length. The light which appeared to be in our atmosphere was heading west in a horizontal position at about 40 degrees off the horizon. I went outside immediately to check the sky for conditions or meteor shower activity and found it to be a clear sky no cloud cover and saw no meteor activity in a twenty minute time period. The light had to have been very bright to have shown so distinct and bright against several backyard lights that I had on at the time.

The lights were white and there seemed to be only one light going around portholes fairly fast so it appeared to be more than one. It moved slowly in a horizontal direction then went low behind some trees. I watched for a long time for it to reappear and it didn&#39;t. The howling also subsided. That&#39;it.<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane as I could see another airplane in the sky.  This light seemed to follow us.  I walked around the block and kept glancing over my shoulder and sure enough the light was there.  Then I thought well it&#39;s just a star, but how could it be following us.  I was so dumbfounded than when I reached my house I sort of stood in the back yard with the dog and stared at the object in the sky.  I thought well this is a star.  So I took another walk around the block. To my amazement the bright white light seemed to follow us always to the right of us.  Was this only a star and it wasn&#39;t really moving, but we were.  Then as I got halfway into my second loop around, another bright light came towards us. I came so very close and I kept looking up in the sky thinking I would hear the sound of an engine or something, but nothing.  There were blue and green lights also and then just as it seemed to reach us, it took off over the horizon.  There was no one else around at the time and when I came home I felt exhausted and quite sure no on would believe me but I did relate the story to my two daughters.  The strangest part of all was that I was not scared and I usually scare very easily.<n>

Then it moved radically toward the west. It seemed to go either into or behind a cloud where it remained visible and appeared to stop. It then moved from behind the cloud headed west, then turned back to the north which was strange in that thats where it originally came from. For a long time I was able to see the object as a white dot. That was the most notable characteristic , the pure white color. Through binoculars you could sort of make out a swept wing type of design but I cant be sure of that. The object moved in a strange way unlike either a plane or a baloon. There was no contrail. Neither my wife nor I could explain what we had seen.<n>

The object looked almost rectangular, it&#39;s width appeared 1/3 that of it&#39;s length. Upon closer inspection, I could see that the object was a very bright white. It&#39;s ends were rounded. Upon arriving at a middle school, the object was still visible. Three additional adults joined me, to witness the sighting. During the time we watched it, two airliners flew above and below, and were dwarfed by it&#39;s size. Slowly the craft moved South, and entered the end of a long narrow cloud. We waited several minutes, but the object never emerged. Upon speaking to a friend later about the incident, he confirmed that he too had seen such an object at approximately the same time of day, and location as I had.<n>

Consisted of one large, very bright white light with 2 smaller white lights. No sound.  Few houses near road; fairly secluded area.  Pulled off at clearing, unable to see anything further.  I am an R.N.  I have had two previous sightings as a child.  My daughter was driving another car ahead of me and it appeared to be a large fireworks to her (she was not wearing her glasses).  It appeared much too large to be a fireworks to me, nor did it arc as it would have needed to to be launched over the trees.<n>

My view was unobstructed. All other lights in the sky were pinpoint sharp except for this almost aquamarine colored spherical orb. It was hazy while plane lights nearby and stars were sharp. The orb which caught my attention in my vertical peripheral vision was only seen by me for between 6 to 8 seconds. Perhaps if I had been looking at the sky initially I might have had a longer viewing time.<n>

At the side of the road on both sides are fir trees about 50ft. tall. I saw the fireball for about 4 sec. The tail of the fireball went all the way across the freeway when the ball was on the west side of the road. Not knowing the elevation of the fireball because there was nothing to refrence it to the tail could of been 100s or 1000s of feet long. my co-worker called me on the radio right after I saw the ball. We talked about the fireball and he saw the same thing I did.<n>

Smaller bright lights appeared and disappeared near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving to church Wed. night with family just after sundown.  I saw a bright orange glowing object at about 30 deg. above horizon due west.  It was the color of the setting sun so at first I thought it was a sundog or jet trail reflecting sunlight.  It was brighter than Venus would be in the same position and about 3 times as large.  It was also elongated.  I called it to the family&#39;s attention and we watched it for about 3 minutes until we arrived at church.  My 9 year old daughter said she saw a small bright light shoot out of it.  I just laughed it off, thinking still that it must be some atmospheric phenom.  After parking at church we all got out of our vehicle to watch the object.  It appeared to be moving very slowly up and to the south.  Suddenly a small bright white light, similar to jet landing lights, appeared in the south and quickly moved to intercept the larger light at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed.  My daughter said it was the same thing that had been &#34;shot out&#34; earlier.  As the small light approached the larger light my wife exclaimed &#34;It disappeared!&#34; but I could see that the small light was actually at the front of the object, very close to it like it was matching the larger one&#39;s speed.  After about a minute it did actually disappear.(maybe into the larger light) Then as light faded in the sky the brighter light started to fade and accellerate on the same course. It faded away about a minute later.  If it weren&#39;t for the small bright lights I would be able to explain the whole thing away as natural phenom, but together it was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

My wife left at this point, and I ran in the house I grabbed my binoculars.  I was able to view it from my back yard(facing east) for a few moments before it disapeared from my line of sight(My house is on the backside of a slope, facing away from Boise City.) Through binos, object still appeared as a gold colored light, ball shaped)  Unable to determine elevation, but would guess it was flying around 5-10 thousand feet.  No noise was noticed.  Total time of observation was approx 2 to 3 minutes. Object never strayed off of straight line projectory. Incident occurred approx 1/2hr before sunup.<n>

I was facing SW and out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright purple sphere that looked very far away come in a perfectly straight line across the sky. Went just under the moon and continued in a perfectly straight line moving at about well if I put a measuring tape up in front of me to use as a guide I would have to say it moved across that measureing tape about 1 to 2 feet per second in a perfectly straight line. I have never seen anything like it. I was out with a friend and there were several other people there as well that saw the object move across the sky and to my surprise 2 of them said, oh we see stuff like that all the time. I am originally from South FL now a transplant to the area and have been looking up for 30 years and never saw anything like that. But I can tell you that after I saw this purple glowing sphere move across the sky the way it did and it looked very far away I became a believer that we are not alone. I had been listening to the Art Bell show ever since I moved to the west coast and stumbled on his program and have been hooked ever since and when I heard this info on the Art Bell show tonight and I have access to a computer at home now I decided to send this report in.

It moved south, heading north at no more then 10 miles an hour. as it passed over head we were able to see a full leading edge. It glowed like malting metal. It reminded me of a red hot wood burning stove, that cherry orange red.The object dipped in all directions like when a gyro first starts to spin or when its about to fall over. very hula hoopish.

We arrived at an observation point that included a small parking lot and a roofed scenic looking area.  It oversaw Canyon Lake and its surrounding mountains.  We all proceeded to leave the vehicle and stepped out to the railing that protected one from a fall down the observation point&#39;s steep rocky terrain.  It was a very clear night with no wind.  It was warm enough where you would not need a jacket.  We then began looking towards the horizon line above the mountains where we noticed a formation of lights that encircled the canyon area.  Some of them were actually inside of the canyon.  We didn&#39;t say much at first because they were about a 1/2 mile to a mile away and shape and dimension were lost especially at night time.  We then pointed them out to each other speculating as to the nature of these lights.  Helicopters?  Airplanes?  There is after all an airport due west in Phoenix about 30-50 miles away.  We slowly began to realize that these UFOs were not moving in any conventional manner. we counted from between 10 to 12 of these objects.  And they began moving in a westerly direction right towards us.  The closer they got the more detail we could interpret.  Some of the craft appeared to be &#34;scanning&#34; the ground below with a white light beam and thats when we realized exactly what we were looking at.  There appeared to be about 10-11 &#34;disc/saucer&#34; type craft and one or two &#34;flagship&#34; type craft.  One ship appeared to our right and we could make out its very large size and the fact that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.  This was one of the flagship type.  It was large, football field size, octogonal with a series of lights (white, blue and red) that went at differing patterns on the bottom and sides of the ship.  The craft underneath was whitish/tanish and the foreward area was very dark and shaped like a &#34;boomerang&#34;.  (My speculation is that it protects the ship through high radiation activities and is! dark be cause it is thick lead plating.)  It had several compartments underneath and a &#34;command&#34; area of some sort.  It had no markings of insignias.  It moved 20-35 MPH and soon disappeared behind some mountains.  We became shocked into a half fear half awe state.  Another ship may have noticed this and came up from behind a &#34;Prudential&#34; looking mountain and emitted a blue light beam at us.  It then generated a great wind or force of some sort that coupled with the blue light had a very calming effect on us.  It seemed to energize us and we could feel our &#34;chi-energy&#34; accelerate.  We began doing &#34;tai-chi&#34; type physical movements while they seemed to communicate with us telepathically.  The images and messages to seemed to be sharing with us we later verified the same experiences.  It then stopped after about perhaps 5-10 minutes.  Then another ship that appeared to be &#34;scanning&#34; to the left of us stopped its strobing light beam, elevated and turned towards us very deliberately.  It began moving at us and we proceeded to reenter our car.  It slowly came right over our car.  We rolled down our windows and studied it while it went past.  This description matches the flagship from above.  Definitely octogonal with a series of lights and ducts or compartment passageways evident underneath with a &#34;command&#34; center complete with &#34;boomerang&#34; shaped forward area.  And again it made absolutely no sound. Somesort of anti-gravity drive to be sure.  Our car was not on and we had no other electronical devices so performance interference was not monitored.  It then went behind us and disappeared behind some mountains in the east.  The other remaining craft all slowly disappeared before sunrise.  We explored the areas that we could access and found no traces of their visit.  Perhaps they were searching for a mineral or have a base nearby.  Maybe they were sightseeing. We KNOW they were NOT any terrestrial technologies responsible for these ships. We returned every weekend after and experienced many more UFO encounters but have ! never th ought to bring a camera and two of us no longer live in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems to be serious-minded.

They were very bright according to the witness,like aircraft landing lights (he stated he was an Army brat and familiar with most types of helicopters and aircraft. The three lights formed a triangular formation and every few seconds they would rotate from two lights across the top and one at the bottom and then one light on top and two across the bottom. The witness stated his wife also observed the lights when she pulled over and he observed a third witness, that he did not make contact with, also pull over. He watched the lights for approximately 7 minutes when he stated the top left light appeared to break from the formation and move downwards, towards him and then turn to his left (west), and then dim out. The light remaining in the upper right position of the formation then moved down to level with the third light. After one or two minutes, the third light reappeared and moved back into a position below and between the other two lights, creating a triangle again. He stated at the time he could see lights from other aircraft to the east (the witness was approximately 5 miles west of JJefferson County Airport in Broomfield, CO, and approximately 15 miles west of Denver International Airport. He did not feel any of the aircraft reacted to the lights which he estimated to be approximately 12 - 13 miles north of him, at an estimated altitude of 15,000 - 20,000 feet. He then stated all three lights headed eastward and faded from sight. Follow up by COMUFON Investigators.<n>

Stopped and two more appeared in other same vacinity different angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:35 am, on way to work on Everson-Goshen Rd, between VanDyk Rd. and Pole Rd. looked to east and saw what looked like a jet trail coming straight down towards the earth, but stopped well before it would have impacted. From angle I was at, it was in line with Mt. Baker, but to the north. Sky totally clear and sun not yet visible.  Continued traveling down E. Pole road westerly and continued looking in rear view mirror and second one appeared. It was slightly farther to north of first one and started about the same height but came down at an angle so that if it would have continued it would have formed the letter V, but it stopped well before that. Was shorter than the first one.  Had cell phone and called aunt who lives on E. Pole Rd. As I passed her home, she was outside looking.  As I reached the Guide-Meridian Rd. a third streak had appeared.  It was shorter than either of the first two, but farther to south.  They all seemed to be approximately the same distance away. I entered a fog bank west of the Guide Meridian on the W. Pole Rd and continued to the Aldrich Rd.  Shortly after turning south bound on the Aldrich Rd., I could again see the streaks, but only the last one to appear was still there. Again went into foggy area.  On reaching the Aldrich and Smith Rd. intersection, all the streaks were gone.  There was no wind on ground level so seemed odd to me that they would dissapear that quickly.  It only takes me about 10-15 minutes to get the Guide Meridian and Pole Rd. intersection to the Aldrich and Smith Rd intersection.  When I got to work, I called the local new radio station, KGMI.  They said they had no other calls. Asked around at my work located just west of the Smith and Aldrich intersection on the south side of the Smith Rd. Three or four of the crew leaders had seen the same thing I did form thier upstairs office windows.  One had commented that &#34;there goes Haleys Commet tail and all&#34;.  They watched for 10 - 15 minutes All said they have never seen anything like that.  Also that it looked like a jet trail, but a jet trail would not stop in mid air and start up again somewhere else.  Some said it may have been military manuvers from Whidbey Isl. That doesn&#39;t seem likely.  Some think it was space junk enterin and burning up.<n>

But after watching it for 10 minutes, I realized it was not moving, and there where no other lights with it (i.e. red or green flashing lights, which would indicate some sort of aircraft).

I heard my husband calling the cat to let it out the door near the room where I was sleeping.  The door closed with a familiar bang and a short time later I heard my husband talking quite loudly in the hallway.  It sounded like he was talking with my daughter and I changed my position in bed, straining to hear what they were talking about, wondering if I should get up and perhaps reassure my daughter for some reason.  Their voices were loud but the tonality wasn&#39;t stressed or upset so I just continued to listen very carefully trying to hear what they were talking about.  There was qite a bit of loud opening and closing of doors  and a very loud thump on the wall behind my pillow which confused me.  I tried to figure out what would make such a sharp loud bang on the wall.  I at first though maybe our dog could have somehow made the noise but quickly realized the dog could not have hit the wall because of a low stack of firewood that would prevent the dog from getting close to the wall.  I then wondered why the dog wasn&#39;t barking.  If someone was in our yard the dog is slightly aggresive and would surely bark.  At the same time I started wondering about a very, very loud mechanical whirring noise outside my window.  It was a noise I recognized as hearing before but had never been able to really identify or explain.  It was much louder than usual.  Near this same time my body felt suddenly electrified as if a force field or some kind electromagnetic field was emanating from and enveloping me.  It was a light buzzy type of feeling I somehow felt responsible for but then I felt a discrete circle of electricity, like a hula hoop, pass up my body up past my head and then back down my body again.  It was a very powerful force and made every small hair on my body stand on end as it passed up and down me just once.  As it passed over my head I felt a little worried that it would pull me right out of my body and did my best to hold on tight.! I was actively trying to figure out what was going on and streams of rational explanations ran through my mind and were discarded.  As my eyes shifted to follow the pattern of exposure to the strange electric field I noticed a dark ephmeral figure at my bedside.  It was about even with where my hands were folded on my chest and I had the impression it was holding me in place.  I stared wide-eyed at it, not particularly frightened but angry that it was violating my personal space.  I immediately noted a much larger figure directly  looming over my head from behind me.  I could just see the edges of its presence and thought it odd that it could get between my pillows and the bedroom wall.  I wanted to  push the smaller bedside creature away from me but knew I couldn&#39;t move my hands or legs, so , instinctually, I raised my head in its direction, gave a little snarl and bit at it!  Even at the point of doing it I realized what a strange funny thing that was to do and was a little amused at myself.  It was very irritating to have these things so close to me but I didn&#39;t really seem to have much choice.  I was still trying to figure out what was happening to me.  I started to think back to some experiences I had had years ago and recalled that a psychic had told me I was being crowded by spirits who wandered towards me because I was so bright.  The psychic had helped me send the spirits away and told me if and when I meditated to stay in the Christlight.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this experience had anything to do with spirits but I was comforted to know I could perhaps look for the Christlight to protect myself.  At the time I couldn&#39;t remember the term &#39;Christlight&#39; and instead started mentally asking for the Godlight and then I asked  Christ to protect me a couple of times and finally and suddenly the creatures were gone.  One of the most striking things about this experience was the distinct way the whirring sound from outside slowly moved away when the creatures left.  As the sound from outside receeded I was left froz! en in ab solute stunning silence.  I laid there for only a moment impressed with the incredible absence of sound and  awestruck by how deafeningly loud things had been just moments ago, and then realizing I was able to move again I lept out of bed and ran into the hallway to check on my family.  They were all absolutely sound asleep.  I tried to wake my husband (who sleeps in a seperate room) to find out why he had been talking to my daughter earlier but he was really sound asleep and wouldn&#39;t reply to me.  I checked the children again and even looked outside for the dog, who was also asleep in her doggie bed.  I walked around the house and looked out the windows and opened the front door to see if I could hear anything like the whirring noise but all was silent. I was a little frightened at this time but I decided whatever had just happened was beyond my control and there for some reason just wasn&#39;t much point in being scared about it.  I went back to bed, turned on all the lights in my room, noted it was just after 5am, and laid there trying and make sense of the whole experience.  I relfected back onto the very vivid dream I had been having just before I had woken up and all this had taken place.  I wondered if the dream had anything to do with the experience I had just had.  In the dream I had been participating in some kind of a game show.  It was sunny and bright.  I was required to dress in a bright yellow pantsuit with little fuzzy white socks and white clogs like nurses sometimes wear.  I remember dressing and thinking the fuzzy socks were funny but that I needed to wear them to be eligible for the game show.  I was very happy and peaceful throughout the dream.  Anyway, after dressing I drove to a large marble office type building with a large airy anteroom and lots of glass windows and large smooth marble pillars.  A smiling man in a normal looking business suit greeted me warmly and put his arm on my shoulders to guide me to my first task.  He was talking to me and kind of giving me a little orientation so I would know what was coming next and I could do my best to win the game.  It didn&#39;t seem like a usual game show.  There were no lights or cameras and no audience just a few people here and there walking about in the background.  I noticed there was a gentleman just ahead of me in line for the tasks.  The first task my guide said apologetically was to spin horizontally about six inches off the marble floor of the room.  He put his arm around me and placed a little yellow piece of plastic the shape of small ruler but different ( I can&#39;t describe it but could draw it) in front of us and we kind of fell forward like we would hit the floor but instead began to spin over the yellow object.  I was smiling.  It only lasted a couple of seconds and then we ju! st stood up and the guide told me I had done very well, much better than the fellow before me.  I was quite proud of myself.  Next we turned to where another man was holding a large book.  He put the book very close to my face and then slowly drew it away from me.  I didn&#39;t think I could read or recognize what he was showing me but everyone seemed pleased.  Behind him was a very large blue screen with white letters or symbols being quickly flashed on it.  I was allowed to look at the screen for a few moments and then I was taken to another large screen and allowed to sit down and watch the symbols being scanned onto it.  The letters or symbols were moving very quickly similar to scanning rapidly through text on a computer screen.  I didn&#39;t feel that I could understand any of what I was being shown because it was moving so fast, but again it seemed they thought I was doing a good job.  In my dream this game show thing went on for three days because I kept doing a better job than the other contestants.  Finally on the third day I was used to the routine and the guide and people working there were like old friends.  On that third day, at the point after the spinning session, when the man showed me the book, I recognized the particular book he showed this time and I recognized words on the cover of the book and being normal english letters.  The book cover included the word &#39;Fisher&#39; and I knew it from the scientific supply company from which I sometimes order supplies in my &#39;real life&#39;.  I was very interested to see this book and I wanted to look at it longer.  It suddenly struck me that what I was being shown was very important if only I could understand it.  I felt that book had valuable information related to my field of biology in it and I wanted very badly to have a longer look at it.  Instead I was directed to the seat and the usual blue screen where I studied the flashing symbols until I was done for the day.  I felt that they didn&#39;t realize that I couldn&#39;t understand the information on the screen because it ! was movi ng so fast.  I then thought maybe the information was somehow being absorbed by me but then reconvinced myself that they had just made a slight error in their planning and that they really didn&#39;t know I wasn&#39;t able to read the symbols so quickly.  I felt that they thought they were doing a very good job, a good thing.  This third day I was told I was the winner and I would be getting my prize in a few days.  I was very happy and wondered what my prize would be.  I knew it would be something really good. I woke from the dream feeling very proud of myself and contented and excited about the prize.  Then I started having the experience already  discussed at the beginning of this letter.  I feel strongly that the dream and the experience following are related. I am not a very religous person or someone who has spent more than a casual amount of time investigating the psychic world etc.  I have had some other strange experiences that could be considered both paranormal and otherworldly in the past and my interest in these matters has stemmed from a desire to explain what I have experienced.  On your web-page introduction the question &#34;Why me?&#34; grabbed me by the shirt front.  I am an open minded, creative, intelligent person but mostly no different from anyone I know.  I certainly don&#39;t look remarkable though not hideous.  42 years old, married 20 years, mother of two, student of genetics and developmental biology soon to be a college professor.  Can you help me discover the purpose behind this phenomenon and help me figure out, why me?  I apologize for the somewhat jumbled nature of this letter.  I am relieved to get it written down at least.<n>

Too fast and too silent for any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost posted this to a newsgroup last night, but I didn&#39;t want my e-mail address to be floating around or have people write me or flame me.  I found this site this morning so here is where I will post it: I was outside with my mother while she smoked and I began to look up at the stars.  After a short while, I was facing NW but looking almost straight up when I noticed what I first thought was an owl flying around.  Then I realized that the flight pattern - tight figure 8&#39;s and circles - and speed it was flying at would be impossible for a bird or plane.  I watched it further and noted the shape, it had the chevron shape - almost like a boomerang - but the color was kind of like what a gray or silver car would look like by starlight alone.  The size or altitude was hard to tell because there were no buildings or mountains around it, it was almost straight up from my house. I told my mother about it and it took her sometime to finally see it.  By this time, the object&#39;s erratic flight had placed it almost directly above the house.  She ran inside to get some small binoculars, we have no video camera and it was too dim for a photograph.  While she was inside, I noticed a plane approaching the object from the north.  The plane must have been very high up because I did not hear it but I could see lights.  When the plane got to within what to me was about 8-10 inches, the object began to move towards the south while still flying it circular patterns.  It made a final 2 circles and then turned and sped away in a straight line to the south.  I watched it for as long as I could but I eventually lost in the glare of the LA lights. You may contact me if you think it is necessary.<n>

There were at least two Silhouettes of beings with large heads in each craft. Their eyes were red and fiery and were like slits. The craffs did not land but came close to the ground. All of a sudden, a thunderlike sound w as heard, and the crafts disappeared. They were going at about 110 kms an hour. A tril was left when the crafts were going to the landing position close to the ground.

I at first thought it was the same plane that made it doubling back along it&#39;s own contrail, but the shape of the craft was so radically different than anything I had ever seen, I was amazed. Then the strange craft made a high speed right angled turn followed almost instanly by another, and then disappeared completely in the clear blue sky right next to the contrail! 5 or 10 minutes later, a nieghbor boy [about 14 or 15] stopped by, and I excitedly started telling him about what my wife and I had just seen.  The lingering contrail was still there, as I pointed out to him where we had just seen the strange craft, and he looked and said &#34;I see them!&#34;  I replied &#34;Them? Whadda ya mean,*Them*?  He said &#34;Now there is like 3 or 4 of them.&#34;  I quickly stepped over to where he was and low and behold, I saw 4 metallic spheres, in the same area where I had seen the single angular craft just minutes earlier, even as we watched, the spheres covorted lower and closer to us, and then the young man said look, there are more over there!  Off to the right we spotted several more spheres, and within a minute or so the entire area to the east and south east of us was literally filled with the spheres. I was, with great difficulty able to count 12 but there could have been a few more, as they were each moving independantly this way and that. During this time, a small conventional aircraft came into site and we were able to compare the airplane&#39;s look and sound with the spheres which were heigher and completely silent.  A little later a sea gull flow under the strange spheres and we could compare the gull with the spheres.  I estimate the spheres came as low as about 1,000 feet, and perhaps 500 to 600 feet from being directly overhead.  Some were heigher and some where lower and when one would &#34;wink out&#34; it was as if someone flipped off a switch.  They would disappear instantly and reappear [or not] in a different location. About two years earlier I had seen in broad daylight a single metallic like sphere in this same location, and this one appeared to be about 100 feet off the ground at about 150 yards and appeared at this distance to be about the size of a volkswagen bug.  When this sphere &#39;departed&#39; it too, just &#39;winked out&#39;.   It both these sightings there were indications, that the occupants or &#39;controllers&#39; of these stuctures or craft, were able to read our thoughts and/or hear our conversations and that they acted/reacted accordingly!  Also this most recent sighting corrosponded almost exactly to a dream I had several years ago!  In the &#39;dream&#39; though I was the only witness and the craft were *landing*....yikes!<n>

My brother and I noticed some people behind us were pointing to the sky.  Up in the sky there was a blackish boomerang like object that seemed to be stationary as if it hovering there.  We then paid attention to the next play of the game and when that one was over we looked up again and so on.  Everytime I looked at it it appeared to be stationary and not moving as mentioned in the other report of this event.  Eventually i got caught up in the game and stopped paying attention to the object in the sky.  I do know that the people seated around me saw the object too and maybe even more in other parts of the stadium.  So I hope if any other people remember this event that they will report it too, because my report is not too specific.  It is a little bit hazy because it happened about 7 years ago, but i know it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

When I looked up I saw nothing initially and then spotted a gray boomerang or chevron shaped object high above our heads. The object spun horizontally on the axis of it&#39;s left &#34;wing&#34; for a some seconds and then became stationary. It remained motionless for a time and then slowly turned vertically with it&#39;s edge facing downward, front or back edge I couldn&#39;t discern. The object took the form of a straight line showing a flat profile with no apparent fuselage or cockpit. These maneuvers took place over a three minute period and the motions were very slow but deliberate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was raised in a neighborhood that is in the flight path of NAS Jax and that has afforded me the opportunity to observe various types of military and civilian aircraft from blimps and balloons to C130 transports and P-3s. Given my familiarity with aircraft this object was utterly foreign to me. The skies were cloudy that day and the color of the object was somewhat darker than the gray clouds. There were no features that could be seen with the naked eye or with binoculars and no external or internal light sources. Since it was overcast it couldn&#39;t be determined if the object had any reflective properties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a breeze in the stadium but whether there was any upper level winds I couldn&#39;t say. I couldn&#39;t judge with any accuracy the altitude of the object but the banner planes and the helicopter circling the stadium at approximately 700 feet didn&#39;t seem to notice the object. For some reason I had the impression that the object was slowly rising and thought it may have been debris from the banner planes, perhaps a letter L that had detached and was caught in an updraft. However the seemingly rigid structure it displayed when turning and spinning discounted that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention that my brother was also observing the object with the naked eye and with binoculars and he perceived that the object was ribbon-like and pliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was completely counter to what I saw and I suspect that he wanted me to dismiss the object just as everyone around us had. Most of the fans in our area had not noticed the object and those who had spotted it initially now ignored it and were caught up in the game. I continued to observe the object for a full fifteen minutes during which time the object resumed a horizontal stationary position over the stadium with the chevron pointed north. After several minutes it slowly began to move in a northerly direction. As it progressed I noticed a commercial jet heading northwest, presumably departing from JIA. I guessed that the jet was still climbing and had not yet reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet. I guesstimated that it may have been at perhaps 26,000 to 28,000 feet and tried to determine the altitude of the object in relation to the plane. At one point I lost the object in the gray clouds and I believe it entered the clouds rather than was camouflaged against them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane however remained in view and didn&#39;t pass into any cloud cover. If the object did go into a cloud bank that would seem to indicate that it was at a higher altitude than the plane. The two were many miles apart and didn&#39;t pass very close to one another but I could determine that at their respective positions that the object was larger than the commercial plane passing nearby. I can&#39;t begin to imagine the dimensions of the object if my interpretation was correct. The object held it&#39;s course and eventually I lost it in the clouds. There was no mention of it in any evening newscasts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There must have been many witnesses to this event.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.  PD))<n>
10/17/99 14:00|Charlotte|NC|Cigar|10 mins|Cigar shaped craft seen over my home town being chased by a formation of fighter pilots.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13200.html|134|ndxe199910| Cigar shaped craft seen over my home town being chased by a formation of fighter pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no outstanding credentials that might account for what i saw but here it is. One sunny clear afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina, I was driving in my car. I was on my way home from my ex-girlfriend&#39;s house. She lives in a town close to Charlotte. So I&#39;m traveling on the outskirts of Charlotte on a rural road. There are farms and fields all around. I&#39;m driving along and I notice a formation of what appear to be F-16 fighter pilots. It&#39;s not everyday you see a squadron over a populated area. And at such a low altitude. I&#39;m no pilot, but i would have guessed their altitude to be approximately 5000 feet. Anyway, i&#39;m watching these pilots fly off to the west and out of my view. I drive a few more miles down the road, thinking of what they could possibly be doing out of charlotte and then i see them again. Only this time they&#39;re flying back from the west heading east. By this time I&#39;m thinking, &#34;Hey wouldn&#39;t it be cool if there was a UFO in the area.&#34;  Well by now I&#39;m getting really close to my neighborhood (about 3 miles). I approach the crest of this hill and on my way down the other side of the hill, I look a few miles down the road. There it was. I huge cigar-shaped craft. This craft resembled the fuselage of a regular passenger aircraft but it was much bigger and longer than your average airplane. At first i thought i was seeing things, thinking that it may be a blimp, but this was no blimp. Blimps are oblonged shaped, looking much like an egg in shape. So now I&#39;m about 2 miles from my neighborhood. Keep in mind this is a very populated area of south Charlotte. At this point I&#39;m driving like moron trying to avoid an accident while watching this craft.. I watch it ( at first it was motionless) but it starts to head east very slowly. i watch it until it disappears over the into the trees. I continue driving, trying to look for it as i approach the aboretum (a.k.a. a very large shpping area). I turn right onto Highway 51 in the direction the craft disappeared to and i was thinking, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m goi! ng to se e it again.&#34; But to my reluctance i did not. Finally I get to my neighborhood. I immediately called my ex to tell her what i saw. After i told her about it she said she saw those fighter pilots for a while flying over her town of Monroe, NC. Now I&#39;m stading outside, talking to her on the phone. Suddenly i hear what sounds like thunder(even louder). I look up to see an F-16 doing an intense maneuver directly over my neighborhood. I waited 5 more minutes to see it again. But i never did see the cigar shaped craft again that day. Later that night, I talked to some of my friends. After i told them what had happened they said that earlier in the day some people had called a one of the local rock stations to and were reporting UFOS over Charlotte. To this day I wonder about UFOS and after what I saw would like to know what the military was doing over the skies of my town.<n>

After watching for several minutes determined it was moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approxiametely 07:55 a friend came into my house and told me our buddy was outside looking at a bright light in the sky. I saw him standing on the street in front of my house looking east. When I joined him I saw a very bright object/light which appeared stationary low down in the eastern sky. Only by standing where the roof of a house was visible beside it could we see that it was moving. I ran inside and got my camera, a nikkon 35mm and slowly took 8 pictures using different f stop settings. The last picture should have shown the light just disappearing behind the roof of a neighbors house. When I had the pictures developed later that day there was nothing visible in the sky on any of them. I was using a 200 mm telephoto lens and the light was very bright. I do not know why it did not show up although I am by no means a great photographer. I noticed all the pictures showed a sky which appears overcast when in fact it was not. To the naked eye the object appeared out of round. Through the lens of the camera it appeared tear drop shaped with two points instead of a rounded head and a pointed trailing end. When I turned away after it was out of sight I clearly saw the planet Venus visible about 45% to the right or south of this observation. The sky was clear blue and no stars were visible. My two friends had noticed this light as they left a nearby hockey arena and said they watched it on the drive over to my house.<n>

Usually between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. in only selected areas we frequently travel. The areas are remote wooded and recently logged areas on the west side of the mountain. About 2 months ago we had my husbands mother babysit our son.We were in the woods and called her to say we would be home in 30 minutes,at about 10 p.m. on our way out of the woods we saw the same orange light but was closer than normal, we got out of the truck to watch it in the distance moving about for what we thought was about 2 minutes.The light disappeared and we got back in the truck and headed home.When we got on the highway my husband asked what time it was and it was after 12:00.At 11:00 my mother in law called my sister in law to ask if she had seen or heard from us,and she hadn&#39;t she then called our cell phone and could not get through.We arrived at my mother in laws house at 12:30 and could not account for the lost time.Last night My mother in law was watching our son for the night we went spot-lighting bucks in the cut timber ridges where my husband has been hunting.On the way in we noticed that the wildlife behavior was very odd,they paided us no attention at all.We have been doing this in this same area for years and have never seen this behavior before such as:an owl sitting in the road and not moving when we approached it in the truck we stopped beside it and it flew into the side of the truck.Very exsessive amounts of small game like skunks,rabbits,coons,opposum,and rodents all traveling in the same direction out of the cut timber.At the same time about 3:30 a.m. we observed a female deer acting very strange as we passed by she came to the truck and looking behind her into the clear cut acting confused,we assumed a buck was pushing her towards the road so we shinned the hard wood hollow looking for the buck,not seeing him we eased down the road to give him a few minutes to come into the clear cut. We drove up the road and turned around to come back to find she was the only doe we saw which is not usual for we usually see 15-30 does a night.She was in the same spot still confused, we shined behind her! for the buck to find nothing on the first pass of the spotlight,upon the second pass of the spotlight we saw a red-eyed deer.We have never observed a red-eyed deer most deer eyes reflect green.When the hit the red-eyed deer he moved swiftly over the ridge and out of site.We waited a few more minutes to see if he would return to the doe.Afer about 5 minutes we he did not return so we down an adjacent road to see if he had circled the ridge.When shinning the back side of the same ridge on the first couple of passes of the spotlight we saw nothing driving slowly while still shinning the spotlight we spotted the red-eyed deer.My husband looked through the scope of the gun to see if it was a buck.It was about 200yds. off the road it was very hard to locate the deer in the cut timber.When my husband got a good look at it,it had a enormously massive rack not usually found in this region.He got out of the truck and fired one shot at the deer and I saw another red-eyed deer to the left of the first.He shot the red-eyed buck it dropped to the ground. He looked at the one on the left through his scope and it was also a massive buck. He shot at it also and it too dropped to the ground but was trying to get up so he fired a second shot then it was also lifeless.We sat in the truck for 45 minutes because my husband felt somthing wasn&#39;t right we shinned the spotlight on the deer 3 different times to see if the deer were still laying there.My husband still could not concieve the idea of the two abnormally large deer.After the third time checking they were still there,we decided to turn the truck around we came back to retrieve the bucks.We were about to get out of the truck, when my husband turned to get his gun and out of the back window he saw the same mysterious orange light in a distance moving very rapidly in figure eights and looping in the sky.My husband said there&#39;s your light.I turned to see the light moving while he cranked the truck because of unusual movement of the light.Scarred to death he floored the truck while! I watch ed the light,half way to the road it started coming towards us very rapidly.I screamed go It&#39;s coming after us.My husband driving as fast as possible while I was still looking at it coming My husband let out an ungodly scream and bowed out of the seat he felt an electrical serge in his back and was screaming everything was black and white.A few feet from the road I turned to see that the light had stopped where he had shot the red-eyed bucks.We keept going towards the main highway as fast as we could and scarred to death.As I looked to the left once we were on the highway the light  had followed us, traveling 100ft. above tree level never leaving our side approximatly a mile away. Panicing trying to get away from it we were going about 90mph.But even through the curves it never left our side for about 5 miles.About 3/4 of a mile before approaching a steep ridge the highway went over, it started angling towards us appearing to intercept us at the base of the ridge.Pushing the truck as fast as it would go,screaming and crying more terrified than we have ever been. At the base of the ridge it was directly above us we felt enormous static electricity we heard a loud bang on the truck like someone had thrown a baseball at it.My husband screamed radio the police as I turned the police issued radio which will radio to Sequathcie, Grundy, Marion, and Bledsoe Counties as I keyed it made a popping sound and went dead.  At the same time the electrical systems in the truck began to fail.  The truck headlights, interior lights, gages, electric fuel pump, and engine began to fail which caused the truck to start missing.  I saw the windshield wipers beating on the windshield and there was a bright glowing light inside the truck.  Suddenly a calmness fell over us and I held both of my husband&#39;s hands as we starred at each other confused and terrified at the same time the truck felt as though it was being levitated less than a foot off the road at the same instance my husband grabbed the steering wheel as the truck was s! till mis sing we were coming out of the light now much slower than what we entered about a 1/4 of a mile back.  As soon as we left the light the truck began to function normally again.  Still terrifed and panicking we drove about 3/4 of a mile as fast as the truck would go to our friend&#39;s house for help.  As we turned into our friend&#39;s road I looked back and and saw that the light had dissappered.  As we skidded into our friend&#39;s driveway we jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door.  As my husband was beating on the door he noticed that all the lights were on, all the vehicles were there and that his Friend&#39;s two house dogs did not come to the door barking like they always have.  Terrified he beat on the door harder and began to scream to be let in.  Panicking he reached to where his friend always kept his spare house key and it wasn&#39;t there.  He tried the door knob and it was unlocked.  He ran into there house screaming his friend&#39;s name and yelling for help.  Although four adults and two loud house dogs live in the house there was total silence.  He ran to his truck and grabbed the cell phone and tried to call his frien&#39;s number hoping he would answer but it would not go through.  Immediatly he called his sister&#39;s home for her to pick us up because we were extremly disoriented.  His sister answered and he began to scream hurry come out here and get us out of here theyr&#39;e after us.  the phone kept cutting in and out but he finally got her to understand where he was at.  His sister and her roommate called us back from her roommate&#39;s cell phone as they were franticly coming up the mountain not knowing what was going on they had called back to let us know they were coming as fast as they could and trying to find out what was going on, but when he tried to warn them to watch out for the orange light the phone died.  He tried calling back several times but it would not go through.  About six minutes after he had called them they slid into the yard expecting the worst.  We ran screaming and jumped into the ba! ck seat of his sister&#39;s car.  She could tell how mortfied we were and immeditly back out of the yard and hauled ass back towards the highway to take us home.  We were so shook up that we were babbling and could not get them to understand what had happened.  As we pulled onto the highway my husband yelled &#34;There it is!!!!&#34; as he pointed at the bright light in the sky that was now white. His sister and her roommate(who is an EMT) both saw the light following the car a great distance up in the sky.  His sister who had heard us talking about the orange lights before knew immedialy what had happened to us.  She began to drive over 100 mph to get to the only convience store that was open at this hour approxmalty 4:45 a.m.  We pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the doors.  We sat there for about 20 minutes trying to explain what had happened the whole time all four of us were watching the light that followed us.  It moved side to side, up and down, and it would fluctuate between bright and dim, always returning to bright.  then we decided to go to our house which is about a mile from the store the white light followed us at the same distance since we had been with them.We pulled into the driveway and sat in the car the light was still at the same distance in front of us and I turned around looked out the back window and saw an identical light as in front of us approaching us from behind but keeping the same amount of distance as of the one infront of us.We decided the best place to be was a public area so we went back to the store we sat there for about another 10 minutes and decided to go back off the mountain to his sister&#39;s and stay.But my husband was begging us not to go back towards where the incident had occured.We got about 4 miles from the store which was about a mile and a half where the light was over the truck.When his sister&#39;s roomate who was watching the light all the way from the store which up until this point had remained the same distance,started to scream &#34;turn around it&#39;s coming @#$%!! !!!&#34; we made a u turn and the light shot back up to where it had been the whole time. we went back to the store and sat for about 5 minutes and his sister and her roomate were now terrified of the situation also.We drove back to our house again and no one would get out of the car because the light was still following us.We finally decided to brave it and go to his sister&#39;s house as fast as her car would possibly go.Once we hit the road we never slowed down but the light traveled the same distance beside the car as it had been.as we drove down the mountain it stayed above the mountain but still beside us and always in view.When we got to their house which is at the base of the mountain it was still above the mountain but in plain view over the valley, we went into the house about 5 minutes later his sister went out to her car and said that the light was gone.we stayed there and colmed down and tried to figure out what had happpened. we couldn&#39;t figure any other reason of them chasing us other than the red-eyed deer. so we waited until daylight and went back to the clear cut to see if the deer were still there because we couldn&#39;t understand the relationship between the red-eyed deer and the orange light chasing us or if there was any at all. We needed to see the deer to prove to ourselves that there was no connection.When we got to where the red-eyed deers were laying we saw nothing from the road.But my husband knew exactly where they were laying so his sister,my husband, and I walked into the clear cut to where we had seen them laying.But we found nothing no hair no blood and no tracks as if they were never there.We spread out and searched for deer tracks and walked for 2 hours over a 15 acre area and found no tracks that were equivilant to the massive deer we saw.As we were walking we found a deer carcuse not visible from the road which was laying on it&#39;s back without any meat, flesh,hair,or blood anywhere around it but suspiciously ALL bones were still intact. we left the clear cut and are now wondering what ha! ppens ne xt?<n>

Witness was in his home on Fort Mountain on 16Oct99 at about 10:30PM.  The weather was fair, calm, about 65 degrees, CAVU.  His home overlooks the valley between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain to the north at about 2600 feet elevation.  The witness observed a glowing orange sphere hovering over the valley to the northwest about 1 mile distant.  The sphere seemed to be floating slowly to the east (left to right) and was estimated to be about the size of a basketball held at arm&#39;s length.  The sphere then contracted to about the size of a baseball AAL, then returned to basketball size AAL.  It then vansihed after about 5 seconds.  The witness indicated that it appeared to be solid, and the glow was about moon bright. The witness was found to hold an Art degree from a major college in New York, is in good health and with good vision for distance. Further that the witness is a well respected member of the Fort Mountain community, whose neighbors vouch for his reliability. A check for other witnesses proved negative and conversations with local law enforcement and other authorities proved likewise. This occurrence is consistent with other events observed and reported on Fort Mountain in the last two years.  MUFONGA and ISUR personnel have also observed unusual events in this area in 1998, and several past investigations have been conducted.  This other information will be added to the NUFORC data base at a future date. Note on terrain:  This area is part of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountain chain (western end), and is very rugged country for Georgia, elevations ranging from about 2000 to 3000+.  The remote Cohutta Wilderness area is immediatetly adjacent Fort Mountain to the north and northeast. Fort Mountain has an unusual &#39;rock wall&#39; formation running around it&#39;s military crest.  This unusual structure is 3 to 4 feet high in places, constructed of more or less smooth stones (piled) with highly unusual pit like rock nests within the wall at intervals. Personnel from the university system in Georgia have studied this formation and several bizarre &#39;legends&#39; have been associated with the wall. Past events reported to MUFONGA and ISUR in this mountain area include a V shaped craft flying at treetop level, a domed disc emitting strange ray like beams from a portal on the fuselage, and orbs and spheres similar to the 16Oct99 report. A detailed report of the 16Oct99 event is being compiled for MUFON HQ and for the ISUR database.<n>

It would look like they were going to crash into each other and then they would not at the last second.  They moved very fast out of my field of vision in 10 seconds.  We were not believers until we witnessed this.  There were probably 100 lights.  It was eerily silent.<n>

Went from a standstill(hover?) position and then streaked off in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of the 16th of October I went outside to feed the dog in the backyard. It was a clear night and visibility was very good. I just happened to look up and as I did noticed a &#34;movement&#34; that quickly became a flash of whitish light. This &#34;light&#34; was almost directly over our neighborhood and house! Since I am not a trained &#34;spotter&#34; I cannot accurately judge the altitude and speed of the object but it seemed to be at least a hundred feet in the air in a hover position(?). As I looked up it flashed and streaked off into the night with a triangular shape at the head of AN ELONGATING TRAIL OF LIGHT! The best comparison I could make is when Voyager goes to warp on Star Trek. Yeah, I know it&#39;s strange and my wife looks at me funny but it seems this area is becoming a hotbed for sightings. Many odd things to see around here if you watch. I firmly believe that what I saw was a man-made(?) object with propulsion. I have seen many meteor showers and the little green lights they bring. Definitely not the same type of thing. Also, no sound whatsoever.<n>

On Saturday, October 16, 1999, I was scheduled to work late, and I did not get home until around 9:30-9:40 p.m.  As I got out of my car, I looked in the sky over my house (to the north west).  I saw something (I guess I thought it was a plane at first)that looked a little odd.  I walked out the my back yard to get a better view.  I saw 3 craft.  They  were triangular in shape and were traveling fairly close together.  They had very little lighting, but the shapes were quite clear.  They seemed to be flying fairly low, but I couldn&#39;t begin to estimate their distance.  I watched for 2-3 minutes in awe.  They seemed to have some movement, but they didn&#39;t seem to really travel across the sky.  After a couple of minutes, I ran inside to get my husband so he could see, but when I finally got him out there, the crafts were gone.  I happened to mention this to my parents on the following day, even though I knew they would think I was probably crazy.  Instead, they told me that their best friend (now deceased) had witnessed the exact same thing two months prior to my sighting.  He lives about 70 miles north of me, so it not quite in the same vicinity.  Both sightings included the three craft that were dull, black with white lights on each corner of the triangle.  This is fairly vague information, but until I listened to Art Bell tonight, I hadn&#39;t really considered reporting what I had seen.  I have forgotten most of the specifics, but I did want this to be on some type of record.  I had never really doubted the idea of UFOs, but I never thought I would actually see something which couldn&#39;t easlily be explained.<n>

It was saucer-like shape with a very bright glow in the middle.  It had red and green lights circulating around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my deck and was on the phone with a friend of mine.  I saw an object that seemed as though it was not moving.  It was just becoming dusk and the reason I noticed this object is because it looked like it was twinkling.  As I continued the conversation on the phone, approximately 25 minutes, dusk turned to nightfall and the object was getting to be more defined.  It seemed like it was moving very slowly towards the north.  At the same time, there was jets flying a southernly pattern.  They were very high--you could not hear their engines and they were going in the opposite direction of this object.  The interesting part of these jets is I counted the time it took these jets to pass the same area that this object moved in.  The jets took approximately 12 seconds.  This object, at this point, was up to about 40 minutes.  The object briskly moved to the south for a very short period of time, probably 30 seconds, and then went back to its northerly path.  The movements were quite sharp in direction.  It did not turn, but it just moved in the other direction for a period of time.  When comparing the distances between these passenger jets probably 30K feet, this object seemed a lot further away.  I finally told myself that I was really experiencing something that I never have before and went and brought out my telescope to see it more clearly.  I set the telescope up and saw it very clearly.  It was a saucer-like shape with a darker space in the middle, outlined in white with red and green circulating lights that seemed to be flashing/twinkling.  I called my wife who came out and looked in the telescope and she saw the same thing I did.  I asked her to call NASA at Moffet Field, but we couldn&#39;t get through.  We then called the FAA who switched us to the Oakland Tower.  They gave us your number.  We called Channel 5--KPIX News Room and asked if anyone had reported anything out of the ordinary in the sky.  The gentleman told me that yes there had been some reports and he said he thought it was t! he re-en try of a satellite.  I told him I had the object in the sights of my telescope and that unless there building satellites that look like flying saucers that hover in the sky, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a satellite.  He told me he would check into it.  I watched the 11 o&#39;clock and there were no reports of anything, which of course, I really didn&#39;t expect anyway.  My wife and I have never seen anything like this before.  We are in our 40&#39;s and don&#39;t typically follow this type of thing.  However, this did catch my attention and I know what I saw.  I continued to follow this object till it went out of my line of sight/horizon and it&#39;s attributes remained the same.<n>

The circle looked as if it may have been the exhaust of a missile/rocket (very white as viewed from below).  There were vapours/gases streaming from 5 o&#39;clock position.  Interesting contrail in the sky at end of sighting looked as if something was trying to make physical contact with object i.e air to air missile.  Contrail was convaluted all over a small area of sky.  Heard in the paper the next week that there was a minuteman missile succesfully shot down by anti-missile......was this what we all saw?  7 witnesses on deck at b-b-q all saw phenomenon (I thought for the first minute that we were actually seeing a fireball coming straight for us, thankfully not) Please contact and give verification that it was the missile test please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time is an estimate by NUFORC.

We were only about 100-200 ft from my house down our driveway, and standing in the middle of the road.  We noticed a light approaching from the north, just white, but very bright.  We contiued to watch it for a few minutes and it came closer and closer.  We couldn&#39;t hear anything but we were pretty sure it was a helicopter with its landing lights on or somthing.  As it came even closer the light shut off, and all we could see were a few green lights. We both just stood and watched in amazment as it came right over us probably only about 100 ft up in the air.  We could feel the air around us moving and a wind picked up, but still hardly ANY SOUND. All we could hear was a chopping sound like a helicopter would make but only faintly. It was like a slow &#34;Cha&#34; &#34;Cha&#34; &#34;Cha&#34; sound and it felt like I was being watched. We both ran as fast as we could back to the house and went inside to tell my brother.  He didn&#39;t belive us and didn&#39;t hear anyhting. To this day I think it was some sort of high tech stealth helicopter, but it scared the crap out of me and my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Object might have been a helicopter, altered for use by special operations forces.  Such aircraft are specially designed to be unusually quiet.  However, it seems unlikely that the military would operate the craft over populated areas.  PD))<n>

Since the first evening my mom pointed out two strange lights in the evening sky that eventually took off at light speed, up and at an angle.  Not something a plane can accomplish, especially back in the mid seventies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were to white lights, kind of moving back and forth, slowly.  It would move to the right, stop, move back to it&#39;s origanl position, then to the left, and then back to it&#39;s position again.  It would do this all the time for nights at a time, when it was a clear starry night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally one night when I watching it, it just shot up at an angle at unbelieveable speed and it was gone.  I never experianced it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen lights that illuminated, in a strobe like matter, starting with a large bright white light, to a green, red, blue, back to a brillant white again.  Seen that all the time.  Mainly in the fall months when the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most favorite happened in the late 90&#39;s when I used to go out almost every night just to see what I could see.  I was getting ready to head in for the evening when suddenly a black, triangler object, about the size of a small plane hovered like a kite over my head. It was triangler shaped, black, thin, it had 3 round orange lights at each corner.  It was completely silent.  When it finished going over, and I couldn&#39;t see the underneth any more, it turned on its side, so I could until it was out of sight..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The light was coming down from the clouds as if the source of the light was just a few feet above the bottom of the clouds.  They hovered in the same spot for at least 30 seconds, rotating the whole time.  There were three other people in the car with me that saw it.  It was absolutely amazing!!  The only that that bothers me about it and makes other people critical about it when I tell them, is the fact that for about 2 months after I had strange dreams.  In the dreams, I was lying on a metal table in a dark room.  The walls were grey, and there was one lamp shining down at my body from behind my head.  I saw at least five humanoid silhouettes standing around me, and I could hear them talking, and I could tell that they were talking about me, but it sounded like mumbling, so I couldn&#39;t tell what they were saying.  One of them on my left side leaned over to get a closer look at me, and his face went into the light a little, so I could see him pretty good.  I could tell it was a male because of his presentation, and he had some male human characteristics.  Immediately after his face went into the light, he was scolded by the person standing next to him, then I seemed to be able to understand their language by telepathy, and I could hear them telling him that they would have to send me back because now I know what they look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Missing time later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approxamately 23:00 hours on Oct. 15, 1999, I went to the back door to determine why our dog was whining. I walked out on back porch and sat down on the top step.As I was petting the dog, I looked due south and observed three green lights that formed a triangle. The triangle was about 150 ft. away and about 10 ft. off the ground. The object appeared to be about 10 ft. wide. The center of the triangle was bright but translucent. As I stared at it the lights moved towards me and simply disappeared in a blur. The lights made no sound whatsoever. Our dog could not wait to get inside the house. At approximately 00:05 hours I sat down at the computer to play solitare and the next thing I remembered was looking at my watch and seeing it was 01:45 hours. I was extremely tired and could not remember anything from the time I sat down. After calling my boyfriend who was at work, I went to go to bed and discovered that my feet were very dirty. I went and showered before going back to bed. I called my boyfriend because we had both seen a green light shining thorough our patio door some weeks ago.<n>

Please email me back dont call unless you provide me with a number, i want you to see this footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought his story should be shared  Friday, October 15,1999  My first UFO,  I finally have seen a UFO tonight at approx. 8:30 PM CDT. 10-15-99.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ( friend #1, friend #2 and I ) were taking Friend #3 home this evening and on the way there, we stopped on a country road West of Ellis to chat, listen to tunes and watch the traffic go by on Interstate 70. Me being a star hound and watching the skys alot, had my head out the window looking around at the sky and Jupiter and watching for Saturn to rise above the horizon. There was a thin haze of clouds going over but thin enough to tell where Jupiter was and I could barely see Saturn through the clouds, just above the horizon. It was cool and windy so no one was getting out of the van. As I scanned the sky I saw what started to look like a meteor heading South and it got very bright and I started to have a thought that it was heading straight towards us because the flame of it looked peculiar and flared to an odd shape, just in one place and didn&#39;t look like it was heading in any one direction, then it dimmed and started heading South. When I first saw it, I told the guys something like, OOH YOU GUYS, like I was seeing an odd sort of slow motion meteor hitting the atmosphere and then as I saw it looking like a satellite and heading in a straight line South. I told them that I thought it was a satellite that had just turned or I had just caught the glimpse of sunlight shining off a panel on the craft and grabed my binoculars and started to watch it race along the way satellites do when, I swear to my honor and Gods, that it turned 180% and came back to the North for a short distance and turn back South again and stopped. I was telling my friends about this as it happened. It sat there motionless for several minutes and then as suddenly as it stopped, it started off to the West and stopped and turned and went back and forth in several different directions, going only short distances and then would move a short distance more, stopping at points and turning the other way and I watched it do that for at least five or six minutes when it quit moving. It was blended into the sky just as a star and didn&#39;t move ! at all so I had to prop my head up with one hand so I could hold still on the object with my binoculars and did that for several more minutes. I would approximate that after five to eight minutes of spotting this object, three jets then came from the West, of the first two, one banked and seemed to take the heading towards Great Bend direction and stayed low, the other turned and flew straight toward the direction I was watching this object and the third jet also coming from the West seemed to turn and go up toward that area of sky I had been watching. By this time friend #1 and friend #3 had got out of the van and saw the jets flying in there directions and I pointed to the one that was flying toward the area I was looking at. We watched as the two jets looked like they were climbing very quickly and then made a loop and started heading back to the West when the cool got the better of us and we got back in the van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stuck my head out the window a few more times that evening before we left the place we were sitting and will continue to watch the skies for all the celestrial events, the stars, constellations, and satellites and hopefully more UFO type objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always said, &#34;I will believe it when I see it,&#34; and tonight is the night that I can say that I have seen it. So help me God !<n>

We just happened to be having a conversation about ufo phenomenon. She did not believe me when I told her of some of the things that I had seen in the past. I told her what you look for in the sky. I was explaining to her how they move and etc.. while looking up in the sky. All of a sudden there was a craft that flew overhead. It was totally silent! It was a chevron shaped craft with five lights below. These weren&#39;t like landing lights, they were actually large, round in shape and I could see them pretty good. Anyways, the craft was flying about 500 ft overhead heading south with great speed. Then it pulled up and eventually went straight up. As it went straight up I lost sight of it. Needless to say, my wife believes in U.F.O.&#39;s now. To me it was part of living in Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We lost sight of it rto the south, then it came to the north a long about the same flight path, very fast and smooth, no sound.  We thougth it might have been a spotlight, but there were no clouds and it did not repeat.  There were bright lights out over a soccer field and we thought it might have been a reflection or something, but again, the night sky was clear, you could see stars where the ufo passed, so there would be nothing for the light to reflect on.  Very cool.  First ufo sighting for us.  I&#39;m a believer!<n>

There was no, what I call the batman wing in the center. There was no sound and no lights. It looked like it had heat waves around it. If you put 2 boards end to end to form a vee, this is the shape. It drifted very slowly across the sky.I would say it was the size of a passenger plane very low to the ground. People ask how I saw it at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell them if they hold something dark up to the sky at night you can see its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s about the only way to describe it.

The above took place in very small time frame with no engine sound the only reason i noticed these ufos was the fact i just happened to be looking up as they came into view or they would have passed with out my knowledge.

No cloud,no trees, just into thin air. other witnesses confirm similar activity. also have recently noticed military activity, blk helicopter,military jets in formation etc. not sure if it is some sort of plane or what. i am a skeptic but open minded. thought you should know to compare if any other reports. like to know the truth.<n>

I was baout 10 miles east and a little north of I-70 on 39th streeet. My wife and I had just come out of Independence Center heading for Oak Grove our home. We always take 39th street to 7 highway south. We just passed Salsa Rd. I was looking to my left when I spotted a white light about 9 o&#39;clock high and I couldnt rememebr if there was a tower in that direction. It was very cloudy and very dark, so I looked back forward then my curiousity took over and got the better of me so I looked back and saw two windows, then looked back down the road and at first I thought that the blimp was up, but then it hit me that because of the lightening, rain and wind that nothing would be up and flying. Now I looked back and left and paid closer attention to the windo3ws. This time the first thing that struck me was how wide they were but the odd thing was just how narrow they were. They didnt seem that high off the ground and hanging in a cloud. They were 6&#34; to 8&#34; long and about 1/2&#34; high and very bright but not like headlights. I saw no beam, but more like a room light up with bright lights, where you cant see out but people can see in. I thought I saw movement behind the lights but that could have just been my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched them for about 3 to 5 minutes before I turned on to 7 highway south and lost sight of them. I felt a little fear as I watched them and I dont know why I never asked my wife to look at it.

As I walked toward the building, some very bright lights caught my attention, because the October sky was already dark at around 6:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw these objects that looked like the size of basketballs, almost burning but not burning out.  A combination of about 6 to 8 possibly all like floating close together. They had trails behind them, they were almost golden like but, extremely bright and they made a sizzeling type noise. They floated by rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were people that had walked to their cars so they had there backs to this scene, I turned to try to say something to them, but I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off the objects, they were so beautiful.  I&#39;m surprised that the brightness didn&#39;t get their attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man and woman farther down the mall were  walking to their car.  I saw the man look up and see these objects too.  They floated East and disappeared quickly. The whole time period was only about 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry to report this so late, but when I went to look for a website, I couldn&#39;t find one, or maybe I just wasn&#39;t too familiar with looking for sites on the web.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget what I saw.

I thought it to be a satellite at first,until it did a very quick zig zag.  Than it was a dark red disk that huvered in the sky.  I could see that in the center was a black dot surrounded by a dark red circle surrounded by a black cirle,which was surrounded by another dark red circle,which was perferated in 4 equal parts.  It just sat there for about a minute and a half before turning back into a bright white light again and zipped out of sight horizontally!<n>

It was just east of due north and 60 dagrees above the horizon and it appeared to be falling at a downward angle drifting eastward of straight down.  I was at first convinced it was a door from a jet plane, then realized it was much too reflective-mirror-like to be a painted surface.  As I started to calculate where it would land, it stopped dead in the air, instantly.  I then realized several things; it was much larger and farther away than I originally thought, and the shape of it was in reality 2 pyramids base to base, with mirrored surfaces.  The diamond shape appeared to be revolving, in place, at about 60 cycles per second (a rough guess), and was oriented vertically,straight up and down.  Just as I was trying to guess the size of it (about the size of my index fingernail held at arms length) some of the few small clouds that were in the sky drifted in front of it, it then started &#34;falling&#34; again.  It was then I realized it was not falling at all, but it was moving across the sky as a satellite would at night, it sparkled and moved in that easterly direction, getting slightly smaller, until the tree line at the horizon obscured it.  When it was gone I was dumbstruck and tried to reason that I had seen a large satellite in the middle of the day?  If so, it had to have been huge, and have the ability to stop instantly, and the diamond shape was absolutely unmistakable, it was easily seen with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was large in shape (saucer-like), white in color, had a band of flashing lights through the center, and traveled faster then a blimp would.  The sighting lasted about 3-4 minutes.  Three people witnessed it. There was only one aircraft traveling across the sky.  The night sky was very calm that night, with no obstructions of what we had seen. I was able to take a picture of the object as it felw by.  The aircraft did not make any loud sounds. This occurance happened between 12:30 and 12:40 am on October 15, 1999.<n>

We thought maybe it was a plane since it was too fast to be a helicopter.  We have planes flying over almost all night long and this particular object just didn&#39;t seem right.  It had one continuous light, none blinking,; it din&#39;t follow the usual flight path of the usual plane and it seemed to fly very close and between other planes flying by.  Eventually it took off, not away into the horizon, but up into the sky. p.s.--I would also like to know more about the tenth planet and the so-called three asteroids heading toward earth.<n>

Slow movement to west, then east, then high velocity NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was in the morning (06:01) shortly before dawn.  I looked out the window to see if the neighbour had left for work yet and saw what I thought was a plane.  I looked closer because it was different somehow.  I looked closer and it was a single light source, soft, big, and constant, kind of hazy; not like the small, sharp, blinking lights of a plane known to the public.  It was moving across the sky parallel to the neighbours house.  I just went smoothly west.  The light was bright but not blinding.  It was about ten times the size of the larger stars in the sky.  It took about 3/4 of a second to go from one colout to another.  It shifted or slid from side to the other.  It did not have a deffinate line between the colours but it was more blended.  It passed behind the tree but was still visible due to thin leaves and sparse branches.  It continued for a minute or so and stopped dead, non-moving, then began to retrace its path, exactly.  It stayed in one place for about half a second.  The light never changed its pattern from left to right, or the colour.  About 1/3 of the distance I saw it travel, it became a tapered streak of light, coloured by all of the aforesaid colours.  It was gone and the streak accross the sky dissappeared with it.  I have perfect 20/20 vision and could not have mistaken it.  The sky was as clear as it could have been, no clowns or smoke.  I believed in this contact with other people and other sightings before but became fully aware afterwards.<n>

Aproximately around 4:30 or 5:00 am we saw something out of the ordinary.  Three &#34;lights&#34; which looked like stars, were moving in a triangular shape across the sky. I&#39;ve seen satellites before, and these were kind of similar.  no flashing, no sound, just a silent flight from behind us in the south, toward where we were facing to the northeast. Total flight time horizon to horizon was around three minutes.  There was several other aircraft in the sky, jets and helicopters.  It was by far the oddest thing I&#39;ve seen in the night sky.  I don&#39;t know if it was alien, I just would like to know what it was.  At first i thought it was a large aircraft with white lights on the nose and the tips of the wings.  But when it flew past the stars, I could see them between the three lights.  I assume it was three objects flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--The report may allude to a formation of three (presumed) satellites, which were being reported from many sources at about this time.  We presume that the objects are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system for pinpointing the location of ships around the world, but that is an assumption.  In years past, NORAD and the Space Command have reported to NUFORC what these three objects are.  However, Terence Dickinson, of the Toronto (Ontario) Star, was able to identify a similar formation that was reported during the summer of 1996.  He found that the objects were almost certainly satellites put up by the U. S. Navy.  Our gratitude to Mr. Dickinson for his research.))<n>

Noticed to the southwest and southeast numerous flashing bright blue lights coming from the ground and sky. Lasted for approximately 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on December 15, 1999 when my cousin and I were traveling eastbound on I-40 from CA-Tucumcari,NM. About 5 miles out of Clines Corners, NM is when we noticed the lights. At 3:00am, I noticed a bright blue thin-&#34;beam&#34; coming out of the southwest. I only saw one flash at first and dismissed it as a spotlight coming from Albuquerque. Shortly after that, the beams retured this time shooting rapidly several times. It seemed at first to be shooting from the ground to the sky. I was shocked and asked my cousin who was driving to look out my window. He was skeptical at first but was also shocked when he witnessed the lights. Around 3:10am, the &#34;beams&#34; stopped for about a minute. We thought it was over with, when all of a sudden the blue beams were back but this time almost directly in front of us to the southeast. They continued for about 5 minutes, shooting rapidly from the ground and sky. Then they stopped again for another minute and started up again in the southwest this time. This lasted approximately another 5 minutes, and stopped for good. It ended around 3:20am. I know for sure of two witnesses, those being myself and my cousin. As we were driving though, I noticed several of the truckdrivers looking out their windows and slowing down to observe the lights as well. My cousin is orginally from the Bahamas and a nonbeliever of any subject related to UFO&#39;s, aliens, etc. He did comment that the lights we witnessed that night, &#34;were unlike anything he had ever seen and hard to believe&#34;. I never have witnessed anything like that before myself. I too have never been a believer in UFOs or strange phenomenon.<n>

It was a large triangle shaped object that made no noise and was moving at a fairly high rate of speed.  I know it was triangle because it had a bright light at each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved across the sky slow enough for us to really get a good look at it.  It made no noise, at least not that we could here and was in the shape of a triangle.  At first I thought it was a plane or some kind of formation used by military aircraft.  I realized that this was not the case when I noticed that this object was close enough to us that if mthey were tradtional planes, we would have heard them fly by.  It never turned or made any sudden moves, just traveled from the southwest to the north-northwest and eventually out of sight.  We passed it off as something no one would ever believe, and something we could ,never prove we saw, but I recently saw a news report here in Columbia that described others who had seen the same thing my friend and I saw, so for what it&#39;s worth, we saw it to but have no earthly idea what it was.  It was triangle in shape with lights at each corner, it was fairly large and made no noise, the middle of the craft looked open or see through but I may be wrong about that, but it definently was not a solid craft because I could see stars in the sky within the triangle of lights.  This is true, I don&#39;t want to be famous or popular, I just want to know what it was I saw, and I wanted to somehow let those that have seen this object that they are not alone.<n>

I was lying in my bed, which was next to a window on the second story of my house. The window was facing southwest and across the street was another two-story house with trees to either side. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a bright red-orange fire ball in the sky above the house across the street. It was about the size of the full moon in the sky, but appeared to be much closer. It was bright, but it was lighting anything up on the ground, at least from where I was positioned. The fireball was shooting out small bits of fire, which would orbit the ball for a time leaving a trail behind them before plunging back into the main body of the ball. There were clearly flames on the surface of the ball, as well. It looked a lot like what you might imagine an atom with its orbiting electrons to look like. Small specks of fire swinging around the fire ball in all directions. Furthermore, to the right of the object I have just described was an array of white dots, larger than stars, but quite small. In the sky, this would be probably six times the diameter of the fireball in distance. These white dots would line up in two rows (there were probably 8 of them) and then one on the end would scoot through the sky, at first slowly and then with increasing speed, toward the fireball, then stop and turn down and head back to the main group ending up in the lower row, when it originally been in the upper. I watched for probably an hour and a half taking in the beauty of what I was seeing. I contemplated waking up my parents and nearly did so, but I was reluctant to take my eyes off the phenomenon in case I were to miss something. I never woke them up and eventually went back to sleep. The date I have proposed is approximate. I have only recently begun to share this story with people because in the past when I tried I was met only with skepticism, which is, I suppose, the right response. In any case, it seems to have stuck with me a! nd now I would like some answers. The only possibility I can think of, which does not rule one way or the other in terms of extraterrestrial activity or otherwise, is that it had something to do with the nearby Hanscom air force base. This air force base is in a pretty densely populated area, so it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be a good location for top-secret technology testing, although I have heard that some of the research on stealth fighter planes was carried out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I think it was between 2300 and 0100 Pacific Coast Time (GMT –8). It was a large green pulsing fireball that was emitting golden sparks. Relative size to me was most likely slightly over two inches in diameter. I used objects in near field vision within and on the truck, and middle field vision along the freeway as references. Horizontal vector distance was most likely much less than 20 miles from me, based on the distance to hills on the western edge of this relatively North/South valley. The golden sparks were associated (possibly not emitted) with it on the sides and backside of its traverse. None of the golden sparks moved downward toward the earth so were most likely not influenced by earth’s gravitation or else the sparks extinguished quickly enough so as to appear to not be influenced by earth’s gravitational field. I have seen several greenish and other colored meteorite fire trails one of which lit up the sky and exploded over the San Antonio Texas area in 1967 when I was stationed there in the Army. This was definitely not a meteorite. I rolled down my window to listen and observe directly. It was soundless and left no after image of light in the sky or on my retina, nor any light streak, as do most meteor trails. In the ‘tail’ area, somewhat obscured by the golden sparks, were several (I think I remember counting either three or four) smaller objects. Each of these objects was approximately ¼ inch relative diameter with one larger than the others. When I first noticed the small objects they appeared to be slightly not in exact formation with the larger object. I observed them to maneuver independently into an exact single line path following in the path of the larger object. For! the res t of my observation, these objects appeared to follow and maintain an exact distance from each other and the larger object. In color, they appeared to vacillate slightly with the predominate frequency being a yellow-gold different from and paler than the golden sparks. The frequency shift ranged between reddish and bluish around the periphery of the entirety of each object with enough transparency to note the predominant central yellow-gold. Because of the pattern, flight path, and general and specific appearance, at that time I believed them to be manufactured objects (this includes manufactured plasma balls) under some kind of either external or internal control. The direction was roughly slightly east of south, but possibly south by southeast. The track seemed to be parallel to an average altitude above the earth. I observed them as they appeared from over the hills to the north of me until I could no longer see them as they passed out of my field of view as limited by my direction of travel and position in the truck. They could have been visible for as long as 30 seconds. Time is relative and subjective and even more so in situations such as this. I think they were at quite low altitude because during part of the observation they appeared between me and the hills to my west. I was listening to the Art Bell radio talk show at the time and tried several times to call in on my cell phone, but never got through. Others were calling in to the Art Bell program with incident reports. The objects were seen from at least as far north as Portland OR. It was reported that jets were scrambled from a National Guard station at Beaverton OR airport, but never caught up to the objects. Observers reported that somewhere over central CA the fireballs made an orderly sharp-angled turn to the east toward Nevada. I vaguely remember hearing another day that they disappeared or ‘exploded’ somewhere over Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two or three Sunday evenings or nights sometime between then and early March 2000 I observed similar greenish fireballs coming from relatively west southwest of my position as I was southbound on I5 within 100 miles north of Sacramento and 50 miles south of Sacramento. These incidents each occurred between 2100 and 0200. On one occasion I saw three fireballs on the same relative directional track, each within one to five minutes of each other. I saw no golden sparks or other small objects during any of these observations. Each of them appeared to be relative size approximately half or less of the Oct/Nov object, and much further distant. My observation period was very short as they traveled quickly from the western horizon over my head toward NV. I remember hearing later of one report from a woman someplace in Castro Valley CA reporting a similar observation but do not know if it could have been the same as one of my sightings.   I am certified in NLP and Clinical Hypnotherapy and was in practice for a few years. Part of NLP is about learning to be a good observer and make fine distinctions. I am also a snowboard instructor and used to climb a bit, both of which provide good perspective on outdoor distance and orientation.<n>

Then it flashed again (white).   After it flashed about 3 more times, I called my mom and she came out and then my teenage son and his friend.  We started timing it and it flashed every 10 to 13 seconds only.  I could see it in my binoculars only when it flashed.  It was SSE in line with Jupiter.  It would move up and back and sideways but you could only see it when it flashed.  Then there was a streak of light and we all screamed and it was gone.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone outside and was sitting on my back steps before Iwent to bed and was looking at the sky.  A plane was going over pretty high up and I was watching it, when a single flash occured out in front of the plane.  I thought the plane had shot something out of it.  The plane went on and I was still looking where I saw the flash and it flashed again.  So I sat there and watched it.  It was just a bright flash, not as bright as Jupiter though.  But it looked like that.  I yelled for mom and she came out and it continued this slow flash but moving around.  It would be more north then it would flash the next time over to the East and then South but it always stayed in a pretty small area.  I called for my son who is 15 and his friend and we stood out back and watched it.  Planes continued to go over but this just stayed there.  I ran inside got the phone and called my uncle in KY to see if he could see it. I was trying to explain to him where to look but with it only flashing about every 13 seconds it was hard to tell him where.  Then there was a brighter flash headed east with a long trail behind it like a shooting star and then the flasher was gone.  We all screamed when whatever it was flew across the sky because it was so bright.  My mom saw a red streak come out of it headed due east when it was just the two of us out there but I did not see that.  My mom is 58 years old and psychologically stable.  My son is 15 and attends an academic prepatory high school.  His friend is also 15 and goes to a local high school.  He was scared.  I am 41 years old.  I used to work with a local Mufon group here in Nashville but have not been in contact with them for about 5 years.  I have always wanted to see a UFO because I believe they are out there but this tonight was the most unusual thing I have ever seen.  I told my son&#39;s friend it was probably something of ours (from the USA) so he would not be so scared.  Maybe it was a satellite, if they can stop and move in 4 different directions and then take off and lea! ve a whi te trail.  I very much doubt it though.  My uncle reported he had observed the same type thing 2 or 3 nights ago (in Paducah, KY) and watched it for awhile and went to bed.  It was in the south.  He said it was a slow flash like what we saw.  I asked him who I should call and he said no one, just enjoy it and go on to bed.  But I had to tell you all.  I have written one other time to tell about a gold light that I saw one night headed north that disappeared but that could have been too many different things.  This tonight was unlike anything I have ever seen.  Thank you for letting me tell you about it.<n>

I assume it was a shooting star however: It seemed to low and slow. I was looking east, the blue light lasted about 3 seconds. I thought it was a quiet helicopter (no sound) it only appeared to be about 1000 ft up. The night is clear and the stars appear higher. It traveled about 1000 feet and then disappeared. I step outside and could not see anything in the sky. Like I said, I thought at first it was a helicopter and then a shooting star and then it vanished. It was low, slow, blue and didn&#39;t go very far.<n>

THE MOON WAS IN THE SSW OF THE SKY AND JUST TO THE EAST OF THE MOON WAS A VAGUE RED CIRCULAR OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE POSSIBLE A CLOUD BUT IT WAS MOVING SLOWLY TO THE NORTH. I WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT MY WIFE TO TAKE A LOOK SO THAT I WOULD NOT BE THE ONLY WITNESS. SHE RETURNED TO THE BACK YARD WITH ME AND VERIFIED WHAT I HAD SEEN. THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO MOVE TO THE NORTH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. MY WIFE ASKED ME WHERE MY BINOCULARS WERE. I RETRIEVED THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND LOCATED THE OBJECT. THROUGH THE BINOCULARS I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE RED OBJECT WAS INDEED BALL SHAPED TRAILED TO THE BACK AND TO THE EITHER SIDE TWO WHITE BALL SHAPED LIGHTS WHICH FORMED A TRIANGLE. DURING ALL THE TIME I OBSERVED THIS OBJECT IT WAS MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. ONE OF THE WHITE LIGHTS WENT OUT AND ONLY THE RED AND ONE OF THE WHITE BALLS CONTINUED THEIR NORTHERLY MOVEMENT. I LOST VIEW OF THE OBJECT (OBJECTS) IN THE NNE SKY AFTER WATCHING FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE HUGE AND AT AN EXTREME ALTITUDE. ITS DIRECTION NEVER VARIED AS WENT WENT FROM THE SSW TO THE NNE. THE LIGHT WHEN FIRST OBSERVED WAS VERY DIM AND IT WAS BY PURE CHANCE THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE IT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS WHICH LATER DIMINISHED TO TWO. THE LEAD LIGHT WAS RED AND CIRCULAR AND THE TWO TRAILING LIGHTS WERE WHITE AND CIRCULAR. THEY STAYED EQUAL DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER AND WHEN ONE OF THE WHITE LIGHTS FADED OUT THE LEADING RED AND REMAINING WHITE LIGHT REMAINED THE SAME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER. THE OBJECT FINALLY FADED OUT AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES IN THE NORTHERN SKY. THIS SEEMED TO BE A TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT WITH A RED LIGHT LEADING, FOLLOWED BY TWO WHITE LIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE.

At first I thought they were two seagulls, but realized they were much too high.  I thought perhaps they were jets but two jets would not be able to fly in the way that the lights were circling.  Then the lights would disappear briefly and then reappear.  This sighting lasted for about 30 to 45 seconds.  The sky was clear and the sun was shinning brightly.<n>

About five minute later the second light that appeared faded out. Then the first light faded out. Probably five to ten minutes later the light came back in the same location as it was the first time. Then shortly after the second light appeared in the same spot. Then I noticed a third light far to the right which I can not say if it was there for a while or not. Then in sequence probably ten to fifteen minutes later all three faded out in sequence from left to right. With probably a two to three minute delay between them.<n>

At the time I wrote it off as a stealth fighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking out the trash. I heard a strange noise.  It was like that of a fighter jet, but, different. It was irregular, not constant. I looked up. From where I was looking, if I&#39;d held my arms out to &#34;measure it&#34; I estimate it would &#34;14 feet&#34; (this is figurative, not actual size). It was extremely large, It was wedge shaped. A single light on the bottom was lit, it was circular and protuded from the bottom of the craft. I shouted at the object. The craft sopped above me. I yellow &#34;Holy (censored) what the (censored) is that?!&#34; The light in the center blinked once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I heard the roar of jet engines and the craft accelerated so fast it was just a blur, then two fighters (I think F15 tomcats, I&#39;m not sure) engaged in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was. I was told by a friend it was a stealth fighter probably. But I&#39;m very into those aircraft, I&#39;ve seen them flying at night and during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my theory was it was an experimental aircraft, but then why did the fighter jets chase it? I will admit that in theory, I believe in aliens and UFOs. But I&#39;ve looked into other options. I do not jump to conclusions. It could have been an aircraft from another country that was experimental, but I don&#39;t live near anything of strategic importance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is, in my eyes, truly an Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged incident is approximate.

The F-15 is and &#34;Eagle,&#34; not a &#34;Tomcat.&#34;  We do not know how the witness could have been able to identify an F-117 stealth fighter at night.  They seem to fly in only certain, limited areas of the U. S., and unless such a fighter were at a very low altitude, such an aircraft would be visible solely because of its lights.  PD))<n>

The total time I saw this was probably about 10 seconds. The object was moving very fast and lit up the entire sky. It was way to low to the ground to be a shooting star or a meteor.

I was working at a mall in Tulsa, OK.  I had just left work around 10pm to go over to my girlfriend’s house for a few hours.  It was October 12, 1999, and Halloween was fast approaching.  She had decided to go as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at her house, she was outside gluing glitter to a pair of red heels for her costume.  I sat on her front steps with her while she did this.  When she was done, I suggested that we lie in the driveway and look at the stars.  It was relatively warm for that time of year, and the sky was as clear as can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got up and moved to the driveway.  As we lay there, looking at the stars and talking, I noticed something disturbing the night sky.  It was moving VERY slowly, maybe 100MPH or less.  The object was very low to the ground.  My guess is between 500ft and 750ft, but no more than that.  There were no lights, and no sound.  I could make out the silhouette of the object against the distant light pollution and the stars in the background.  It had a long fuselage with bulges to the side, kind of in the shape of lobes, where the cockpit might be, and at the back of the object.  The bulges to the side were smaller in the front than in the rear.  It had a slight glow behind it, though not like a jet.  I asked her if she was seeing what I was seeing.  She saw it as well.  We watched as the object slowly and silently moved through the night sky until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that stood out to me was the complete lack of sound.  As a child I frequented air shows.  I was quite aware of the immense noise produced by a conventional engine, be it propeller or jet.  I had seen an F-14 perform a fly by at 100MPH once.  It was greatly pitched with a tremendous amount of thrust, and was loud enough to wake the dead.  What we saw that night was lower, slower, and not pitched at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t think it was alien spacecraft, but the technology was nothing known to exist to this day.  A few weeks later I saw a show on TV about the “Aurora”, the top secret space plane.  The supposed shape of the Aurora, according to the show, was nearly identical to what we had seen.  My guess is that we may have witnessed a test flight of this plane.  The only thing that keeps me from being sure of that is that there were no lights on it.  I know the US puts lights on all aircraft, even test planes.  We’ve seen this with the F-117.  This Unidentified Flying Object is wholly worthy of the title.  Not a flying saucer.  Not cigar shaped.  Not a light that moves at break-neck speed.  It was just an unidentified, slow flying, silent object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Report at first denied by PPD then acknowledged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited a while to report this just to see if any of the local media would do anything with it.Apparently they are not aware or have chosen to ignore it. It is quite an amazing sighting. I first heard about it in Novemer of 99, from a co-worker who heard a short news segment on it on 910 AM KFYI here in Phoenix, which is Art Bells local affiliate. When my friends son contacted the station they stated they knew nothing about it. When he told them they had done a news segment on it, they said they would research it for him. A representative from KFYI contacted him via e-mail and supplied him with a transcript of the conversation between the crew of the PPD helicopter (Firebird) and the crew of another helicopter .According to my friend, when KFYI contacted Phx P.D. about this they at first denied it, and later when told about the transcript said the conversation took place but that they had no further comment. I am calling this object a fireball only because this is what my friend said he heard it described as on the radio. It is pretty obvious from the conversation that whatever it was, it appeared to be under intelligent control. Hope this is of some interest to you.<n>
10/12/99 21:35|Port Townsend|WA|Triangle|5 minutes|3 satellites forming a perfect isosceles triangle shape, moving in complete unison from the NW to the SE and turning to the South.|10/19/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10217.html|195|ndxe199910| 3 satellites forming a perfect isosceles triangle shape, moving in complete unison from the NW to the SE and turning to the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I like to look for satelites when the sky is clear.  This night was very clear in our area, so we went out a little after 9:00pm to have a look.  We were looking straight up and a bit towards the North.  My son was pointing out the constellations to me as he likes to do.  We had just located Casseopia and the Pleades when right at that moment, from the West, we saw a marvelous shooting star with a long tail.  We both thought it must have made it to the earth intact.  We kept looking for satelites, but found none.  We did see alot of shooting stars however, just like the meteor showers.  As we were looking for moving objects my son finally said &#34;I found one.&#34;  He was pointing it out to me and as I was turning to have a look, he yelled out &#34;No, it&#39;s three of them... together, they&#39;re moving together!!&#34;  I turned and saw what he was looking at.  It was 3 satellites forming a perfect isosceles triangle and traveling in formation at exactly the same speed.  They never broke foramation or changed their speed which was slightly slower than most satellites we watch.  They looked like a small constellation traveling across the night sky.  They traveled from the NW to the SE and seemed to slowly veer more Southerly.  It took about 3-4 minutes for them to travel across the sky and we watched them travel until they faded out of our sight range.  My other son came out to watch them also.  We all remarked about how it could not be one big object because as it passed by other stars we could still see the stars through it... it was not solid.  We have never seen 3 satellites travel in formation before and this was quite a unique experience for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  These probably are U. S. Navy satellites, flying in formation for some reason.))<n>

Before the bend I noticed 2 sets of lights hovering above the trees.  When I was directly to the East of them, I stopped my car and shut it off, trying to listen for rotors.  There was no noise made by these crafts.  They were only about 500 feet to my west and hovering about 225&#39; (Northern most one) and 300&#39;. I observed these for aproximately 60 seconds, then started the car and drove around the bend until I was directly North of them. I could not see an object due to the blackness of the night, however the lights (4 on each side, and one in the center rear) formed a triangular/chevron shape. As I came to a stop directly behind them (Aprox. 150&#39; away) the rear one lifted to the altitude of the other (very slowly) and both, slowly proceeded South. I immediately lost sight of them. I would estimate the size of these to be about 150&#39; width furthest light to furthest light. x 100&#39; tip to Chevron indent.<n>

It looked like an airplane at first, but it was to big, and had an unusual light pattern on the underside.

It was ALMOST totally silent, and not going very fast.<n>

He identified the object as an advertising blimp, and suggested that he saw advertising text on its side.  However, just prior to this sighting, a very interesting event was reported from KS, MO, AR, and KY, which makes us wonder about this one.  It seems to us unusual that some 20 automobiles would stop to look at a blimp, and that no one among that population of witnesses would recognize the object as a blimp.  Also, a former member of the USAF witnessed something nearby in Illinois at about the same time, and he declared it to be one of the most interesting and bizarre objects he has ever witnessed.  He said his impression was that whatever he witnessed, it almost certainly was not from the planet earth.))<n>

There were no beating of blades that you would hear if it had been a hellicopter. There was a faint humming sound. A picture is worth a thousand words and I have 5-10 minutes recorded on film along with the sound it was making. Until now I did not believe in UFO&#39;s.  So if someone can explain what this was, I would be in their debt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Text of follow-up report from same witness appears below.  Object probably was not blimp.

I called ((name deleted)) back and got more precise directions. This time I saw it... A bright light, flashing every 10 seconds with a bright white light, and every 2.5 to 3 seconds with a dim light. I called my wife, ((name deleted)), out to see if she could confirm what I saw and she did. I called((name deleted)) back to reconfirm what we were seeing, and had exact timing on the flashes. For the 15 minutes that I witnessed the object, it only moved about the width of an adult man&#39;s thumb, at arms length, from the reference star. It was heading east across the sky directly south of my house. I called Peter Davenport to make a report. I am 33 yrs. old and have 3 children.

It was a pinpoint of light about twice as bright as venus and had an orange yellow hue. Watching the light from my window I looked for other blinking lights like you normally see on aircraft wings etc. I thoght something was strange when no other lights were visable. Expecting the object to pass over my house I went outside to get a better look, as I had a strange feeling. I spotted the light outside onlt to find it had stopped forward movement but did sway from side to side as if were hovering, much like a helecopter. We ruled out a helecopter because we could not here it nor were ther any other lights around it like you normally see on a helecopter. Also we can&#39;t think of a reason why a helecopter would hover at that alltitude in a rural setting. Watching the pinpoint of light for thirty minutes or so I finally went to bed. I woke up at 00:30 (CST) and looked to find the light was now gone.<n>

At first I thought it was a big bird of some sort the way it was gliding in the sky.  It was reltively low in the sky especially compared to the jet I had been observing.  The object passed silently overhead and it was like the shape of a boomerang.  It was&#39;nt glowing or lit but yet it was oddly illuminated like it was reflecting the light from the valley floor.  (I-5 is nearby and Ashland and Medford are well lit)  I have seen many other craft and strange lights over the past 40 years but this was very unique to my experience with UFO&#39;s.  In my judgement it was around 3,000 ft. in altitude and moving at a pace that allowed it to remain in my vision for nearly a minute as it passed over, veered right sharply and then took off rapidly due east. I can&#39;t get that eerie glow out of my mind.  If I had&#39;nt been looking it would have been nearly invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the 10/11/99 incident, on the morning of 10/ 14/99 at 4:15 AM a gigantic fireball was seen from my home in the southeastern sky.  It was not a shooting star but a gigantic golden fireball steaking across the sky.  We have been seeing many strange things in the sky here lately.

The color of the object was every color you can imagine.  After arriving to destination we called the State Police to see if anyone else seen anything in the sky.  We also noticed that the radio was out in the GMC Jimmy at the time of the sighting.  Then when we turned around the radio came back on.  We were all talking having a normal conversation about music.  And out of the blue we saw this object.<n>

I saw a bright object that I first thought was Venus or Jupiter. It began to move, perpendicular to the aircraft, at about the same speed. It appeared to be a silvery, disk shaped object, 20 to 30 feet across and it was self-illuminated. It passed over the aircraft. It then dissolved into the blue. Jupiter was seen in a different part of the sky later that night. Venus was seen the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Day was cloudy but dry. I saw an extremly bright light drop out of the clouds. The object had no shape, but the light was extremly brite. The object flew from from the southwest to the northeast and moved at a fairly nornal speed. The object flew below the clouds for approx 5 seconds, when two aircraft came out of the clouds and took up a position about 1 mile behind the light. They flew along for about 3 seconds when what appeared to be a missle came off the wing of one of the aircraft and came toward the light. The missle covered about half the distance betwen the light and the aircraft, when the light picked up speed and flew back into the clouds. The missle followed the light into the clouds, the aircraft split up, one went right, one left and both flew back into the clouds and out of sight.<n>

Becouse of the rising sun the jet contrails had a pinkish orangish color to them. I looked lower at the horizon line and I spotted two objects of the same color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I only saw the two jet contrails as they head toward the rising sun. They had a pinkish orangish color to them, My wife was driving behind me in our second car. I rolled down my window and pointed out in that direction. As I did I spotted two round star like objects about 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon. They had the same color about them as the jets. I do not belive that these were stars or planets, as we drive this route every day and just about the same time. As soon as I could I pulled over and took some pictures with my digital camera. If you are interested I can send you a copy. I have been an amateur astronomer sin 1970 and I have been interviewed by Linda Moulton Howe.<n>

High overhead, moving east<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west-bound on I-94 in Wisconsin, near the Minnesota border, at 6:10 in the morning.  Saw what I thought was a blinking white airplane light.  It was suddenly surrounded by a red light - reminded me of a flare or fireworks.  My first thought was I was seeing an engire fire on the plane.  The red glow disappeared from around the white blinking light.  It continued blinking and was again surrounded by the red ball of light.  I saw the red light 4 times before I lost view of it.  I gathered it was going east, as I watched it out of my windshield the entire time.<n>

Not a star. It did not move or change shape and was too high to be a helicopter, plus it had no flashing lights on it at all. It was just a very bright light shinning in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were on our way home from a friends house last night when I noticed this light. At first I thought it was just a star but noticed that it was much brighter and closer than a star. We watched it as we were driving in hopes of seeing it move or show indication of being a known aircraft ( flashing lights, movement etc.) but to no avail. As we continued to watch it we began to realize that it seemed to be to high up to be a helicopter but could possibly be a plane. But then again there was no movement or flashing lights. It looked like a star was sitting inside the earths atmosphere. I am reporting this only to add to the possible reports that must have been reported and to hopefully find out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witness was looking to the east, he probably was looking at Venus.))<n>

I was driving home up the Niagara escarpment that night.  I was fixed on this craft so much so i knew right away it was extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i approached the escarpment I actually lost sight of it in the trees, but the road was heading up and about to make a left turn directly under it.   And thats exactly what happened.   As i made the bend i witnessed the craft make a turn on a dime without tipping the wings.  It was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove slowly until i stopped directly under it.  I opened the door and just watched as this thing slowly went over my head.   I assume it was dead silent because all I could hear was really just the music from mu car stereo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, it happened a long time ago but i will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could draw it easily but i bet some high quality video footage would have made me rich.  It looked man made to me, but i cant see how man has not yet commercialized this technology by now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I am now a 30 year old single mother, in a professional field and working towards a masters degree in computer science.  I&#39;m a very grounded, technical minded person who is skeptical of all things that seem illogical or cannot be tangibly seen, and this is why I&#39;ve waited so long in reporting this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sleeping in the guest room alone due to my being uncomfortable in my pregnancy.  I had just moved to Montgomery, and my 17 year old sister was visiting in order to help me set up the house for the baby.  She was asleep in the den on a sleeper sofa.  Earlier in the night, we&#39;d left the sliding glass doors open to let in fresh cool air because I was always complaining that I was too warm.  I recall that I awoke in the night and instinctively walked into the den, almost as if I were sleep walking, and indeed I believed that I was doing so at the time.  The entire room was bathed in light, coming from the back yard, and it was so bright that I could not see anything in the yard clearly - not the pool ten feet from the sliding glass doors, nor even the patio furniture directly outside.  I could see that there were forty or fifty large moths on the ceiling of the den, and their shadows were long from the light.  At this point I felt a deep dread and blacked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I awoke in the guest bedroom with dirty feet.  I went immediately into the den to wake my sister, and shrunk back when I saw the moths on the ceiling.  They were not there the night before when I&#39;d gone to bed, and seemed to me to be evidence of the event.  My sister&#39;s feet and bedsheets were not mussed or dirty, and it seemed she&#39;d not been disturbed at all.  Never at any other point while I lived at this residence did so many moths enter the house at one time.<n>

It was crystal clear last night, that&#39;s why I really noticed this &#34;haze&#34;.  It was oval shaped with white lights that would get very bright and then get very dim, like a very slow pulsing light.  What really got me was all the other little &#34;lights&#34; flying around it.  I asked my husband to look at it and he couldn&#39;t figure out what it was either.  It was stationery and all these other little lights were buzzing around it.  It reminded both of us of moths flying around a light bulb.  There was no set pattern to their flight and it looked like some of them flew into this thing.  We watched it for about 45 minutes and it didn&#39;t do anything else so we went to sleep as we have to get up early and it was almost 12:45 a.m.  I got up a few hours later and looked to see if it was still there, and it was gone.  No haze, no lights, nothing.  I guess what really made us notice this thing was because of the haze that surrounded it..  There was no other haze around and neither one of us had ever seen anything that looked like that.  Sure would like to know what it was.  If I see it again I will definitely try and get a picture of it with my digital camera.<n>

He immediately ran into the house and yelled at me to hurry outside.  I ran out to the front yard in time to see a craft in the aparent shape of a V lined with orange steady glowing lights.(two on each angle and one in the front) as well as a bright white (search light style) light directly in the center of the V.  It is dificult the estiimate the altitude, but I would guess it to be aprox. 2000 feet traveling at a speed of 1100 mph.  It traveled in a direct line over the mountains and disappeared behind them.  We are in the direct flight path of commercial aircraft traveling to Seattle and Portland or Kennewick, WA.  We have ovserved them many times.  This craft did not follow the normal flightpath of these flights.   This is the second craft of this type that we have observed in a two year period both traveling in the same direction.<n>

The view is breath taking and i observe for several minutes -  like a dream over the horizon and not as high as my top line of vision (eyebrows)a bright pinpoint white light appeared to my middleleft*_&gt;&gt;_______________________________&gt;&gt;_*                                                                                      and dissappeared to my middle right: - what who , no one else around was it a trick of light; I later did some rough calculations 50,000 mph 100,000 mph it was horizontal in trajectory and less than a second, no chance of a photo! am i insane definately not. I am an engineer. so i keep telling myself, i didnt tell any one about this for three years- they didnt believe me, Even my dying father,who has since passed away (2002) and he saw 25 a bomb tests. The only logical explanation is sun light reflecting of off the sattelite array, could this be my salvation? this is my one and only record of this event i don&#39;t wish to be caught up in the air balloon fanatic dopes, .It was over the equator  the bay looks south-wards it stayed silent , i stood there for a few moments and carried on my ride. My only logical conclusion, stay quiet they/ it comes in peace , would you get success shooting a weapon at a pidgeon ,just crap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It is harvest time and the sun set.  You could see most of the stars.  It was a very calm night i felt no breeze and i could hear everything clearly (type of night).   My father come out to relieve from combining corn me so i can eat.  I get in the pickup and he makes 2 rounds.  On his way back from the second round (he is heading north), I get out of the pickup and took a big breath of air.  I like warm calm nights makes me feel alive so to say.  I turn to look north towards our place (1 mile north) cause i wanted to look at the big dipper.  All of the sudden I see a bright light in the sky to the north east,  If you would take a welding arch white type of light that is how white it was just not as intense, though it stood out like a sore thumb (if you held your thumb out in front of you and put it over the light would be about the size of object, If you are into math you can use info later here to estimate size).  I thought nothing of it and looked at where my father was with the combine and he was heading down the hill not quite half way in the field.  I looked back wondering if i could hear any engines thinking it was a helo or a plane.  Heard absolutly nothing except the faint sound of the combine.  It would have been between 5-7 miles away and about 2 miles or 3 miles ubove the ground. I looked back at the light and noticed it was moving erratically.  Now by erratically i mean it moved up and down in the sky really fast but in very short bursts (not far up or down but very fast).  It also did not stop but did move forward fast then slow down in short bursts (not far forward and would slow down).  I had to turn away and blink to actually see what i have been seeing. While watching the movement I was also thinking it either was unmaned or had inertial dampeners.  With how fast it was moving in the short burts no human could stand the movements for a long period of time. All the movement was done on a line so to say (basically draw a straight line and it would move up and down on it and then move forward fast and slow down on it.  When it moved up and down on it it would move the same distance up and down on it). It would move up and down and then move forward on that line and move up and down again. Sometimed it would move forward once slow down and forward again and slow down again, then move up and down 2 times in a row.   It was heading south west.  Needless to say i had seen that object move to the south west and i had watched it for about 3-5 minutes till I could still barely see it and i quickly crawled up the ladder to the combine asked my dad if he could see it in the distance when he got to the end and he couldn&#39;t see it (very bad eye sight).  He thought i was nuts and made it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 2  2 days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were done early with the field we were harvesting and we took the rest of the night off.  I got the little 22 rifle and a spot light and went rabbit hunting.  It was an identical night to the first night calm, no wind 70 degrees out or so.  Anyway I had gone out back and got just to the north end of our trees (100 yards of trees) and seen the exact same thing only 1 mile closer.  Moving the exact same way exactly same movements.  I got chills down the spine.  First thing i did is listened for an engine.  Heard nothing.  Looking for anything i could use to identify it.  Saw nothing.  Then i thought to myself shine the spot light on it (1 million candle light power).  I shined it on it for a second as i was looking NW now (the closest I would be to it).  It stopped moving erratically and started moving in a straight line on that line i was telling you about before at a constant speed.  I then shined it on it again and got scared out of my mind.  A flashing light turned on underneath the object (in my mind to fool me or someont to think it was a plane).  I went running back in the house and told my dad and again he thought i made it up.  I use to go hunting all the time and sit for hours patiently waiting for a skunk or something snooping around.  Never went out again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We have not actually observed a craft but have think that our information may be note worthy. The sighting in Jefferson city has prompted me to write. We live on 10 acres in the country. Three actual seperate events have occured involving four individuals. On the first occasion my husband ((name deleted)) was working on a ladder. We are constructing a new home on our 10 acres. He was inside the house under construction, which at the time was just framed in. It was sometime in October, about 10:00p.m. He was using a spot light to work.  He suddenly felt a very distinct presence around him which appeared crystal/dust like. It was different than anything he had ever observed or felt. He stated that it only lasted a matter of seconds. He told no one about this event as he did not want to frighten any of us. He kept quiet until our 16 year old daughter, ((name deleted)) told us about a simular occurance that happened on her birthday, November 10 1999. She loves to jump on our trampoline at night which is many yards from the work shop we are currently living in on our 10 acres until our home under construction is completed. Around 9:00pm she was jumping. She said,&#34;it was like a light all around me, right in my face but yet it was not a light.  It felt like time had stopped. I am not sure how long it lasted. I was frightened and started to run up to the house when it happened again, it made me stop, I felt like it was all around me.&#34; My husband then told us about the event he had experienced. Our 17 year old daughter ((name deleted)) then told us about a event that happened sometime in October on our property. ((name deleted)) had a girl friend spend the night. They decided to sleep camp out in our house that is under construction. The house was framed in but the shingles were not on as yet. The girls were awake and talking around 1:00am when they saw a bright light filtering down through the rafters in the roof. Their first thought was that it was! an airp lane. The light lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. They were very frightened. We do not have any lights on our property that would shine on the roof. We did not have any electricity to the house under construction except for drop cords. The girls had no electric drop cords or flash lights with them. They were in the dark.  Nor do we have any neighbors close by. We all compared notes on the day that our 16 year old daughter ((name deleted)) told us about her experience. We do live about 7 miles from a local airport and planes do pass over head but that last only seconds. We never have planes at that time of the night. Have you had any reports in our area? We will let you know if anything else occures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted)) is at school as I write this. I have not asked her details about the light such as color or amount of intensity or sound.<n>

We were at least hoping to enjoy a desert sunset and evening and perhaps were hoping to maybe see something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 2100 and 2200 local time we witnessed an amazing display of agility by a light maneouvering over the first ridge between the mailbox and Groom Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about as bright as the planet Venus is in the night sky. It would shoot up above the peaks and then flutter down like a feather. We were impressed when it then starting moving extremely rapidly and stopping from one end of the ridge to the other. It appeared to be covering a few miles in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was striking was the agility of this object. Perhaps moving several hundreds of miles per hour and then reversing direction in literally the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft would disappear behind the ridge often, for several minutes at a time and then reappear. Upon the last disappearance 3 of these objects appeared, doing the same maneouvers but not in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 witnesses to this incident. All of us tourists to the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise associated with this sighting. No turbine, afterburner sounds etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself - I am an officer in the Canadian Forces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Wife - She is a nurse in Calgary Alberta  A small boy age 10 to 12 - from Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His father age 50 (or so) - retired Cop from Florida His Grandfather age 70 (or so) - from Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen fighter aircraft perform in day and night conditions. No fighter can move like that.  The movements were extremely quick. Possibly some kind of model airplane, or unmanned aerial vehicle, if not then who knows...??<n>

Upon exiting our residence  he told me to look toward the sky as hed seen a UFO . I looked up and watched two small lighted objects move slowly across the sky. I estimatew thier altitude to be above 40,000 feet. We then observed three objects in a triangle formation  all of which were different colors and glowing. These three objects moved as if they were being dropped by parachute. The other objects moved about the same area. Then three or four other lighted objects appeared in the same general area. The whole time lasted approxiametly 60- 90 seconds.Fortunately my brother was able to get his digital camera out to film these observations . It may be possible that this was military aircraft, but the observation of the glowing of the objects sent chills through my body.<n>

I saw a round glowing object that I thought was a bright star at that moment but realized that it was only 40 minutes past noon and stars don&#39;t shine that bright in the daytime so I countinued to watch it to see what I could see. It was simply setting there in the sky over top of all the Chem-trails. I showed it to my wife as our kids pulled pack into the driveway as they forgot some things. I looked at them and then immediatly back to the object and the object was GONE.. I am guessing at arms leanth it was about the size of an ink pen point. But was very shiny as though the sun was shinning and reflecting off from it.  I know what I saw and it was not a star, nor was it one of the planes as this object was totaly setting there and not moving other then a small rocking motion.  It appeared to me as if it was simply setting there and watching all the planes spraying these chemicals all around, as the chem-trail are massive here today with approximately 30 to 40 of them at any one time floating down.<n>

The house was getting warm so my father and I went out into the back-yard to sit in the shade. My chair was facing northwest while my father was facing notheast.  As we talked, my father mentioned that he was watching an object in the sky that was apparently not moving. Getting curious, I shifted my chair and after a little searching located the object.  I estimate the object&#39;s position to be northeast and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was clear and bright with the point of light, looking to be a few miles away. I noted the time (10:45)and after a few minutes my father again remarked that the object still hadn&#39;t moved.  I relocated the object, using the peak of a neighbor&#39;s rooftop as a reference point.  Indeed, the object was still there and I went inside to get my 7X50 binoculars.  Using the same reference point, I relocated the object.  Bringing the binoculars into focus, revealed the small object to have an oval shape and glowing a bright orange.  It was now a few minutes after 11:00 and the object had still not noticibly moved.  I watched the object through the binoculars for a few more minutes and saw that featureless orange glow was not varying in brightness.  Asking my father to keep an eye on the object, I went inside to get some stronger optics.  After a few minutes, I came outside with video camera that has a 50X digital zoom. Unfortunately, without a tripod the camera shook too much to be of any use.  The time was by then 11:30 and while continuing to watch the object through my 7X50&#39;s, I noticed that it began moving slowly away. The object&#39;s heading was due east and in only a couple of minutes, it was gone from sight.  At no time during this sighting, did either myself or my father notice any sign of a contrail. I must note that my house is located less than two miles from the U.S.Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar.  I have seen and heard all manner of aircraft over the years and this object really made an impression me.  Because the object was apparently quite far away and high in the sky, I hope that there were other witnesses to this event.<n>

At about 4 to 5 AM. Indiana time; I think that&#39;s Central Time? I was traveling on ATA flight 142 scheduled to depart Vegas at 12:25 AM but due to boarding problems it was about 12:45 before we took off. The captain did not keep us updated on our locations so I&#39;m not sure exactly where we were? I was sitting on the right side of the plane with a view to the south. It was a very large city we were flying over maybe Kansas City but I&#39;m not sure. The object was orange in color and appeared to be just hovering over the city. There were orange lights on each side that blinked several times and then pauses in a repeated sequence. This object and it&#39;s blinking lights were orange and not red like you see on an airplane and that caught my attention. As best as I could tell the object appeared to stay over the city as we flew away. I don&#39;t know what it was or where we were but I thought I would report it in case this may back up some other report. Sorry I can&#39;t provide more info but I was very tired.<n>

It didn&#39;t make any noise and it was like it was flying like a bird or an  airplane but without any noise and it was shining or glowing just like the moon but not so bright. It also had the shape of half the moon. First I thought that is was a bird or an airplane or a cloud, but their where no clouds and there was no wind at all. Because it was so close that I could see the shape and it didn&#39;t make any noise it wasn&#39;t an airplane either. And it was also to big to be a bird too. It was also moving too fast so I just could see it for a few minutes and then it disapreared in the night. Because it was just kind of glowing I couldn&#39;t follow it that long in the dark night. I never saw anything like that before and the first thing that I was feeling was that it didn&#39;t belong here. My husband is a helikopterpilot in the army and he couldn&#39;t explaine it to me and that is why I decided to contact with you. I am a housewife and just started an importcompany.<n>

It was seen for approximately 30 seconds.  It moved from a east northeast position in the sky to a position nearly overhead,  at which time we lost visual contact.  We waited for the object to reappear in the southern sky, after it was blocked from view from the roof of the car, but it never reappeared.  The object was approximately 8-10 feet in diameter, object was approximately a half mile away when first seen and at about 1000 ft. The area in which this object was sited was within controlled airspace (Class C) from Daytona Beach International Airport.  This airspace is radar controlled and an object at that altitude and distance should have produced a radar return.<n>

It stayed in the sky for a very lenghty amount of time( long enough for me to loose interest).

Displayed brief instances(lasting anywhere from 45sec. to approx. 1 minute) of intense brightness, than would suddenly fade very dim, to the point that it would appear to be a distant star. It would stay stationary for lenghts of time, than would move very slowly from side to side and at one point even disappeared briefly just at the edge of the the hills, than suddenly appeared again. At around 2am (2nd sighting) the object displayed all the chararistics as just discribed, but after several minutes of watching it, it suddenly just disappeared. An interesting note; during the second sighting there was an aircraft in the very same vacinity as the ufo during that time, in fact the air craft flew extremely close to the object, but didn&#39;t show any unusal interest in the object. The 2nd sighting I wittnessed alone, where as the 1st sighting was observed by my boyfriend.<n>

Object appeared illuminated diffusely over front edge similar to that of a bright diffuse object. Illumination appeared to be reflected from skyglow of city.  To a casual observer object would have appeared as a boomerang shaped &#34;V&#34; with the notch of the &#34;V&#34; travelling in the direction of travel.  Illuminated area appeared more greyish with faint lighting and progressed to black to the &#34;rear&#34; of the craft.  Front edging had definite thickness but curved for aerodynamic capability.  Travel was absolutely effortless as it glided smoothly across field of view first observed while kneeling on floor near a window on a second story residential apartment structure.  Object on flight of travel first observed at greatest elevation towards zenith.  Observation of travel over half the sky took the referenced period of time.  Size of object estimated like that of a small lake or small mountainous area just north near Griffith Observatory, or for most people like that of one to two football fields/stadiums.  Could only see primarily bottom underbelly. No surface features, patters, markings, or lights of any kind. Sky - clear.  No clouds or vaporous characteristics. Temperature - estimated 78 degrees F. Humid. Haze level - moderate, due to smog characteristic. No trail or atmospheric disturbance of any kind in wake of craft. Personal background:  Extensive astronomical experience and observation over entire lifetime since babyhood.  Estimated conservatively at 30K+ hours. Impression:  Impressive.  Unknown what I saw.  Definitely not a stealth bomber or any &#34;secret&#34; objects that I am aware of from experience. Written initial report to follow within a few days.

It is isolated from all city lights as it is located in the Minnesota lakes country. On Oct. 8th, 1999 at 11:15PM My wife and I were outside in the backyard looking for satelites and shooting stars. The sky was very clear. I first thought I saw a satelite, but noticed there were 3 lights moving in a triangle. I showed it to my wife to make sure she saw the same thing. They were moving at the speed and brightness of a satelite. It was fairly large and moving at a steady speed.The center of the three lights would block out background stars,as it moved from West/Northwest to South/Southeast.It is very quiet in the woods as we have no close neighbors. There was no sound at all, we can hear commercial airliners at very high altitudes when it is that still and quiet. After about 2 to 3 minutes the lights disappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  These satellites may be U. S. Navy satellites, flying in formation.

At approximatly 8:30 one of the students on the sidelines pointed out 2 white lights 4 inches apart at arms length over the school building.  The crowd watching the game had their backs to the object.  There was no sound.  I thought at first it was a security light on top of the roof of the building. The appearance fo the lights was similar to metal halide lights. We observed the lights for several minutes. I at first suspected it was a helicopter and was looking for the navigation lights, but did not see any other than the white lights.  The focus of the lights was on the game.  After several minutes the lights began moving slowly towards us.  Altitude was low probably around 200 ft if that. Distance was about 400 yards.  No sound was noted the wind direction was from the east which should have carried the sound towards us.  The craft moved forward for about 30 seconds ( very slowly) then turned completly on its side and changed direction from NW to SE. The craft flew on its side with wingtip down wingtip up and nose to SE. As it turned I was able to make out the shape of the triangle. The craft was very large.  A couple of cessnas flew at the same altitude that night in the same area, and 5 of them would have fit into the wingspan of this craft. Also we had no problem hearing the other aircraft in the area. The craft flew on its side the legnth of the school building then turned on its back and flew away I have been waiting to see if any further reports would turn up.  A number of people who saw the object said it had to be an aircraft ( reason being is that they didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s)  However, because of the size and the manuevering capability demonstrated I feel that it was definetly something unusual.  The actual object was only visible when it turned on its side.   There was no sound from the aircraft during the entire sighting. The craft was in back of the main crowd, there were only about 11 people in a position to see it.  we were unable to get any photos of it.  It would have been difficult because of the stadium lights. The craft did not appear threatening at any point in time. We didn&#39;t feel afraid but were excited and elated to see it. No unusual smells were noted and no missing time was experienced. ( When I first noted the object I kept an eye on hte stadium clock just in case) There were aircraft in the area, however none were there at the same time as the object. Mostly single engine type craft were out that night. This sighting was reported to Major Filer and MUFON since I&#39;m one of their investigators.  However, If your investigator is interested in this I would be happy to talk with him/her.  I appologize for being so late in getting this report out.  Circumstances in my life have made it difficult to keep up on my UFO stuff. You may release my name but its important to keep my address and telephone confidential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by MUFON investigator.))<n>

(i later found out that shirley mc claines &#34;center&#34; is there and they confirmed the sighting, which makes it less or more credible but i&#39;m unsure of which)as soon as we reenteered the freeway we saw a huge cone shaped foggy light approx 300 ft wide at the base. it was loosley defined in shape and was surrounded by a white foggy mist although it did maintain the shape of a cone/christmas tree throughout the event duration. we pulled off at the next rest stop (maybe 3 minutes farther north) and got out to watch it. one car pulled off, threw away a soda can, and left without looking. a truck driver was parked and out polishing his grill (at night?) with his back to it. at the top was a single point of light that seemed stationary but was then shot off like on a rubberband. we then drove north to trinagulate it&#39;s position, size and shape and exited several times to do so. we were able to determine that it was very large and was centered just slightly north over the munds park exit, slightly north of the freeway onramp on the west side if going north on I 17. at one exit we pulled off to get closer for more details and a truck passed us coming out of a dead end dirt road. we then turned around and crossed the highway to the east side of 17 and drove up to see the object from a higher vantage point. we then got back in the car and rushed to pull off at our exit, kachina village, we went into the small convenience store. the clerk was overwhelemd as the police scanner was processing tons of calls. when we arrived home a few minutes later, i phoned our local npr station at nau and was told other reports were being ca! lled in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at approx 6am the following morning a formation of seven black helicopters flew very low over our home in the direction of the sighting. they came form the north. it was later said to have been a launch at vandenburgh afb BUT both of us are from california and have seen MANY launches. this was not a launch. we later confirmed (to absolutley convince ourselves with proof by comparing what we saw to an actual launch as seen from the excat same location) we further validated this by taking a friend to the launch which the three us witnessed from the munds park rest stop in jan 99. it confirmed that what we saw in oct was definately not a launch from vdb afb, not even close. the person at npr relayed this answer/info to us the next day (10/9/99). my immediate feeling was that most who saw this would be convinced by this explanation hereby redecuing a majority of reports. the clerk at the store said that as the reports continued that evening on her scanner, the sighting was reported from as far south as phx and as far north as the utah border. several times after the event we attempted to get to the exact location but were unable to do so. for years now i have waited to see another report on this date and have decided to share now for clarification and/or coinciding info or events. as much as 40 minutes after the sling shot effect, we could still see the north end of the mist from our home. the oddest part was that the mist hung in the air and stayed in a loosely shaped cone for more than 45 minutes as it slowly disspated. this is the first and last time i&#39;ve seen this type of event. i will file a report about another incident near corvalis or, in 1996, where a triangle formation was surrounded by a bluish mist before it disappeared. lastly, i will file a report for may 10, 2004 which occurred at la cienega lake on the white mountain apache reservation. it was three lights in a triangle formation but as there was no occlusion we determined there were three seperate objects/lights. they may have been the NOSS! sat&#39;s h owever it differed from other possible NOSS sat sightings reported to you. i noticed today that az had alot of sightings in june 2004 and for ours there were 4 sane witnesses. again, we &#34;felt&#34; compelled to be at this particular spot and time to see something and indeed we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We where both concerned at that point, then one the frist a/c that appear moved along the shore line just inland &amp; headed north just east of my location &amp; approached my location moving at 10 to 20 knots. As the a/c closed in on my location I could here a humming sound from the a/c, when it reached my location I could see half of the a/c through the tree line. The a/c was still at approx. 100 ft. agl. and to large to be a &#34;helo&#34; I could see the aft section of this a/c as it moved past my location and noted that the trees were not being moved from any downward thrust at this alt. any manmade a/c would hve to produce 1 to 1 thrust ratio to stay aloft, but yet no sign of this? I did however hear some lite jet fan sound as the a/c were directly over head. The a/c design was unlike anything I HAVE EVER SEEN. After the a/c moved on I noticed other identical a/c moving south to north east &amp; west of my location with the other 2 a/c moving out in the same direction. I worked at phl int&#39;l airport for several years &amp; called the tower there to see if they had any a/c at my location, she replied that there wasn&#39;t any traffic in my section. the whole event took approx 45 mins.<n>

Glanced up at the sky in NNE direction and saw a series of amber lights...manisfesting East to West almost instantly. Two more appeared almost instantly after just below the first line of lights to the lower lefthand end.  They were bright amber color, as bright as a 100watt floodlamp at 100 yards.  I have a measurement because a neighbor has such a light. They were up for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing instantly.  I called my wife as soon as I saw the lights but they were gone by the time she came out.  But one appeared at a lower altitude and further West that she did see. Afterwards, there were aircraft lights flashing green,red and white below and on both sides where the ambers were...but not in exact same spot. It has been almost a year to the day, that I saw two lights of the same description in the same area.  Where one light appeared and a spark ensued and went down to about 8 O&#39;clock level and grew as bright as the first one.  These lasted about 15 seconds before disappearing.  Approximately two months ago, my daughter (13) saw lights in the same area and was reported to your website.<n>

They were blue-white lights - very bright.  I thought it has to be a plane and I watched to see where it would go.  It didn&#39;t move - it stayed in one spot in the sky for about 10 minutes.  The sun was just coming up, but I could make out that it was shaped like a hamburger with a row of circle lights actoss the middle.  There were sirens and lights flashing about this same time, so I thought the police knew about it and were looking at the same thing I was.  I got my daughter out of bed so she could see it too and she called the family next door.  We all watched it ascend straight up!  We never heard it make any noise.  As it went up higher, it appeared to change shape.  It looked like a diamond. The next mornign, I looked up ion the same spot and there it was again, only this time it was much higher up.  It looked like it was coming straight down and wobbling side to side.  I called the police to report it and when the officer arrived it had moved back up higher into the sky.  He said it looked like a star to him.  It is very frustrating to not have people believe you.  I&#39;m just glad I wasn&#39;t the only one who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((age deleted)) year old elementary school teacher.  I have my Master&#39;s ((deleted)).  My daughter is((deleted)).

I was facing south as the object moved in a west to east direction. My best description would be like a red plume shaped nike logo with a bright Star at the top. As i marveled at this the rest of the plume burst into bright stars (aprox. 12 to 15 of them) like the one at the top; they simulteaniously got bright and then dimmed slightly but continued to shine inside the plume. I snapped out of it and thought to get my camera upstairs but when i came back downstairs the object was behind the tree line and not visible. If anyone in the Austin area saw this please let me know.<n>

She said that it was moving kinda rocky as it traveled.  She desribed it as looking like the bottom of a car without wheels and on the side of the craft it had blinking lights alternating off and on, different colors, It was in the shape of a disc. She tells me that at first she thought it was a flying car until she saw the lights go around on it.  She tells me that she thought the pattern was, three lights then a space then three more lights then another space and so on. This was very strange for me to hear because about 20 years ago my sister and I saw, what sounds like the exact same thing. HONEST!

Length (horizon up) 3 units (estimated 90 feet) by 2 units (estimated 60 feet) with upper part shaped like bulge of car key (or awl-head), and lower part shaped like tapered area of key -- the shape of the the craft estimated by border of 8-to-10 red, pulsating lights on perimeter.  Lights were red and pulsed.  Time: 08:35 p.m. Central.  Conditions: Clear.  Sun completely down, (dark), clear, excellent visibility.  Observed UFO headed South-Southwest, bearing about 190 degrees, almost paralleling Texas State Highway 288 (about 45 miles due south of downtown Houston).  Altitude: Estimated 1000 feet.  Speed: Estimated 150-to-200 mph.  Obserbed UFO on west side of highway, then move gently to east side of highway, then gently back to west side of highway -- where it maintained (apparently) a steady 190 degree course.  This course would have brought it just west of the Brazoria County Airport, located at North 29.06.35, West 95.27.47.  Followed (at about 70 mph) the UFO for about 5 minutes -- keeping it in sight until its higher speed out-distanced me.  Typical lighting configuration for aircraft (green light, red light) NOT seen -- only red lights on perimeter.  Important -- this UFO&#39;s description is based on its VERTICAL appearance.  Have never before seen any aircraft with this type of configuration.  In short, it is aerodynamically impossible for this craft to have been flying using conventional flight systems.<n>

Suddenly a light appeared, and got brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as the planet Venus. Then it started to fade away, and then was gone. There was no movement of the object (or event). No sound either (sonic booms, etc.) and it did not look like a meteor, as it was stationary. I watched the sky in that area for several more minutes, but saw nothing further. If it had been something that was burning up in the atmosphere, I would think I would have seen some movement. Could have been a supernova for all I know. Right where I was looking, a light appeared.

I am a retired Air Force Officer and I live to the East of Tucson International Airport and Davis Monthan Air Force Base and see countless aircraft crossing my property, but I have never seen a totally dark object, or have I seen any object pass that quickly.

I was looking west about forty five degrees above the horizon, I was trying to identify some constellations for my astronomy project notebook.  I looked down at my star chart for a minute and then looked back up.  It was then that I saw the objects, I noticed them because they were moving across my field of vision right to left.  At first I thought it was a plane going really fast but there were no aircraft warning lights on them at all. What I saw was three spheres&#39; all aligned vertically.  They were not bright at all, they seemed to be a dull gray with a haze around them. The objects were not bright like a star or meteor.  Once I realized they were not planes or a meteor I felt uneasy, I have never seen anything like them.  The three objects flew perfectly in a striaght line.  I ruled out a meteor because of the dull light and they flew straight.  The objects changed course almost vertical and disappeared, that is what freaked me out, they went straight up.  There is no way that was a meteor, military plane or weather balloon, I have never seen anything do that before.<n>

I live southwest of Bush Intercontinental airport and was watching two commercial jets departing, also in a southwesterly direction. I noticed that the planes had &#34; bracketed &#34; an object between them. The planes appeared to be at a greater altitude than this object and were moving at a greater speed. The object was opaque.....no lights were seen and no glow emanated from it. I could not judge the size but I assumed it to be large. As I reported.....it was chevron shaped and one &#34; leg &#34; seemed to be shorter than the other. It did nothing but just seemed to drift to the southwest.

It was an exceptionally clear evening and we were marveling at all of the stars out that night, when I asked him if he had ever seen one of those hundreds of satellites we have orbiting our planet.  He responded that he hadn&#39;t, and so I told him that I could probably spot one for him within 10 or 15 minutes, and began scanning the skies for one.  We were in a quiet neigborhood, but the neighbors porch-lights were making it difficult to see good, so I walked north between the two houses where the night-sky became more &#34;observable&#34;.  I was looking straight above me, when out the corner of my eye I saw a really fast moving blur to which I began to blurt out to my frind, &#34;Look!, a shooting star&#34;....But I only got out the words &#34;Look! a shoo.......&#34; when My eyes were able to focus on the object.  This was NO shooting star, NO aircraft man has ever built, and NO weather related phenomena!  I could very CLEARLY see a long, thinly shaped triangle with only the edges lit up in a pale whitish outline.  I had only focused on it for maybe a second or two when I noticed a 2nd one behind it a ways and to the right of the first one.  They were flying precisely at the same speed and kept the distance between them so steady that they could have been flying as ONE! (unlike our known aircraft that fly in formation.....they always seem to deviate a little from one another as they fly overhead)  There were no blinking lights at all, only the complete outline of the triangles were dimly lit and the light seemed to gently fade from the outside edges inward, where the center of the craft appeared almost translucent......sky-black with just a hint of reflected &#34;ground-light&#34; of whitish-green.  It is very hard to determine the altitude of anything in the night sky, but to the best of my knowledge, they seemed to be flying rather low, maybe at an altitude of between 1,000 and 3,000 ft.  Agai! n, in a night sky, size is difficult to determine also, and once again, I believe they seemed to be rather small craft, somewhere between 8 to 15 ft. in length, and maybe 5 to 9 ft. at their widest point, which would have been at the aft end of the triangular shapes.  At this relatively low altitude, one would think that you would be able to hear some kind of sound, even if it was the sound of air rushing around them, as they flew at a very high rate of speed,.....but there was NO sound whatsoever!  I would have to guess they were traveling at a rate of maybe 500 to 800 mph, heading north in a straight line.  At this speed and altitude, and given their rather dimly-lit appearance, I only observed them for maybe 5 seconds and they were out of sight.  During this time of observaton, I was calling out to my friend and pointing towards them, asking if he was seeing what I was, and wondering why I wasn&#39;t hearing a response.  Turns out, unfortunately, that one of his kids had called out to him, and he had turned and gone inside the house and didn&#39;t even hear me talking to him, much less SEE anything! I am a 50 yr.old aircraft mechanic of 32 years, living in Minnesota for the pat 20 yrs.  I often fly comercially and recreationally, even though I do not posess a pilots license.  I have always been interested in astronomy and enjoy observing our night skies, and believe me......I will be observing our skies even more now, after witnessing this account, even though I don&#39;t really believe I will ever see anything so compelling as what I saw on that night in early October, 1999.<n>

I play in a rockband who had recently been playing a few gigs in Hollywood. On the Morning of 5th October 1999 we left LAX on the Delta airlines flight to Atlanta at apprx 12.00 midday. We had been in the air about 3 hours and with their being some room by the window, myself and our Drummer went to sit at the window. It was a very good clear day and we could see the ground,( don&#39;t know where abouts we were though ) all of a sudden I saw a disk  moving very fast accross the horizon. I KNOW it was not a plane as it had no tail fin. I proded Marek, the Drummer, who looked out. His response was &#34; what the hell is that&#34;. I know that a few other people must have seen it, however no one really seemed bothered. It really spooked me that it was so close to the aircraft I was in. I didn&#39;t think much about it, until I got home to England. I really want to know what it was. All I know is that it was NOT a plane. ((name and URL deleted))<n>

I could see the whole top of the airplane. I thought it was going to crash. Then I saw the disk behind --very close behind--the jet. I watched in amazement. Good thing there wasn&#39;t any traffic right around me, since I was driving. The disk seemed to have concentric circles on its top, since it looked textured, rather than just solid, shiny silver. Could this have been an optical illusion? I am not sure. I looked away to the road, and looked back. Still there. Looked away again, looked back, and the airplane was straightening out and descending to prepare to land. The disk was gone. Note that the location I was at and saw this is only about 3 miles from McDill Air Force base.<n>

I looked again and saw what appeared to be stars, but then noticing  that can&#39;t be with the sun still up. They were above the sun and one was above the other but offset a little to the south. The bright obects had a orange glow. I assume because of the sky. I saw a commercial airplane leaving Houston Intercontinental and was heading west towards the objects. As i was looking again, the one object on top got bigger and looked kinda like a egg, but had two orange lights on the front. In an instant they were both gone. I searched the sky but did not see them again. I learned tonight a friend of mine saw the same thing a few nights earlier farther north near his home @ about 02:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFROC Note:  Duration of sighting is unknown.))<n>

We were going east on 14-16 when I saw this craft flying from the SSW to the NNEat about 2000 AGL and about 6 miles out. I saw it about 20 degrees to the right and I pointed it out to my wife and son as a UFO. My wife said it was a airplane, but there was no beacon or any lights flashing at all. as it passed about 40 to45 degrees to NNW it started to shine very brightly like the sun glaring of aluminum and starting a shallow bank back to the northwest at which time it disappeared. My wife looked at me and said it disappeared. all I could say was it sure did. I could only discribe this vehicle as one of the fighters on Battle Star Galactica.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness seemed to be an exceptionally competent observer.))<n>

But I am sure others noticed this object as it was quite bright.  I saw it while driving, relatively close to the sun and looking just as a bright comet would (w/ a trail not especially long or unusual for a comet).  I watched the object for a long as I could traveling from the northwest to southeast (approx.), I estimate 10 minutes before I was driving into fog.  As I watched the object traversed the sky in what seemed to be a great distance.  It was obvoiusly quite far away after the 10 mins, and from my perspective very high in the atmosphere.  There seemed to be no erratic movement and changes in shape, light, etc. (except that the light got dimmer as it was farther away)  The light seemed to be white.<n>

Then the driver of the car I was in spotted another one on the other side of the sky brighter than the first.  This one was going from red to blue to yellow, and brightening and dimming, it was so low in the horizon that we lost it behind some trees for awhile, but it was definately moving.

We had become tired as the loop in the neighboorhood was two and one-half miles, and we had circled it several times. We stopped by the neighboorhood poolhouse to get some soft drinks, and take a seat nearby on a picnic table. We were chit chatting, when I had noticed an object in the sky. I called it to their attention, and all of us were in awe. I honestly do not know how large it was, but I speculate it to be quite large, as it was definately higher than the treetops, making it at least 45 feet long in my estimation, more than likely larger. It was a full moon, so the craft had illumination upon it. It was a gunmetal colour, and had two bright lights on either end, and it was shaped like a fat cigar. More like a slug. It is hard to describe, but it was like a cigar that had been overstuffed. In the center of the craft was one light-emitting porthole. The craft moved incredibly fast, and no signs of propulsion were present. No thrust, no propellers, the craft was dead silent except for a rushing of air sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It faces south and looks across to Vashon Is.  My living room is floor to ceiling glass, so the object that moved  horizontally across the sky seemed to be following the coastline.  It was extremely large and green-yellow; the object seemed to be outlined with a glowing yellow.  Yellow, glowing particles were coming out of the tail.  It moved steadily past my windows but  not with such speed that I was not able to observe it.  The object was as large  or larger than a city bus, eliptical with a long tail.  I might add that this is my first experience seeing something  that cannot be explained, so perhaps it falls into the UFO category. I have lived at this location for many years and am well acquainted with th area.  I am a graduate of the Univ. of Wa. and a retired teacher.<n>

It looked like a fireworks flare with the outer edges glowing like the light sparklers give off.  It appeared to be very low but there was no way of knowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the sky is overcast so it had to be below cloud cover to be so brilliant.

Looking south south west.   Observed a very small, light green (almost floresent)in color, with some white spots, circular shaped light, shoot across a small portion of sky, disappearing over the horizon. When first observed, it appeared to be about 15 degrees above the horizon, almost straight south (slightly west) of my location. Size:  Extending my arm straight out in front of me, fingers pointed upward, it appeared to be about half the size of my small fingernail. The light appeared to be an object only in that it appeared to have a clearly defined border (inotherwords, it was not hazy at the edges). It appeared to be moving from northeast to southeast in direction, traveling in a straight line, dissappearing from my sight due to rooftops at about 10 degrees above horizon. It also appeared to be loosing altitude.  But this appearence may be due to its speed and direction of travel, in relation to my stationary location. Extending my arm out in front of me, while holding a ruler, it traveled 4 to 5 inches while dropping about 2 and a half inches. The entire event lasted only about a half of a second.<n>

My wife saw the object moving in a North/NorthEast direction overhead, from the outside porch of our house.  I was driving roughly in the same direction as the object when I spotted it overhead and in front of me. On my returning home minutes later, we were surprised the we&#39;d seen the same weird thing. One more point of interest, on Saturday the 2nd, we had three sonic booms and the sound of more than one aircraft after each boom.<n>

I was looking more or less directly overhead at the constellation Cygnus when motion caught my eye.  Turning to my right, I witnessed 5 (or perhaps 7) faint, diffuse, eliptical white lights in a distictly &#34;V&#34; shaped formation, traveling quite rapidly from north to south approximately 45-50 degrees above the horizon.  I had them (it?) in view for approximately 5 seconds before they dissapeared behind a neighbor&#39;s tree.  They appeared to be relatively close, at a low altitude as I could see a definate change in perspective of the &#34;V&#34; as it first approached and then receded across the sky.  Viewing conditions that night were excellent with no cloud cover at all and no wind.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated with this sighting.  The ambient noise level was very low with no road traffic or other neighborhood noise present.  A cold chill ran down my spine, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I was absolutely stunned.  It took a couple of hours of lying in bed before I finally fell asleep (totally out of character for me).<n>

Upon further notice ( about 15 minutes of staring) I noticed that the lights appeared to not be moving at all.  Which made me look further int them.  I know that this was not a helicopter- the lights were too high and way to bright.  Also there was no tell tale sound of a helicopter engine.  I also know that this was not a plane, because when it did move, it was going in all directions very quickly and then would stop.  This went on for about an hour until I realized that the position of the lights were different than before.  The original, pentagram shape of lights had been changed into a pyramid shape, as if one of the lights had disappeared.  suddenly, it came back but on the other side of the pyramid, as if the object was rotating.  It would do this as it was climbing or moving, but when the object stood still, there was no rotation of the lights.  At that point, I thought that it may have been a satelite, however, the lights were brighter than any of the stars that were visible- including the north star.  Sounds strange huh?<n>

There also has been two to three craft hovering out over the north west part of the ocean as we look from the downtown city area. these craft also behave in the same manner, but usually head east over land and then disappear as they get farther away. It&#39;s driving many of us to think we&#39;re crazy, except now there are too many of us, to consider unusual behavior on our parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no explanation for what these witnesses are seeing.  Sightings of this length would usually cause us to suspect celestial bodies, I.e. stars or planets, but the witness seems to have addressed that possibility, and ruled it out.))<n>

After the object was gone, there was a haze around were the object had been, there was also a bright glow off the mountain that was also very hazy and/or smoke around the glow, the glow slowly fadded out in about  20 min. or so. The object was rounded on the top and nearly flat on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting occurred at approximately the same time at the launch of Minuteman II missile from Vandenberg AFB, but it seems distinctly different in nature.))<n>

Deg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed Bright light to south with streaming contrail of smoke.  Object was apparently entering atmosphere.  Ablation cone of approximately 20 degrees was observed with occasional bursts of sparks.  Object was in a very shallow angle because it was observed in a South to North trajectory from near horizon to approximately 80 degrees (near overhead).  Object ablation cone appeared to flare out near termination of the event at which point it extinguished with a glow that rapidly dissipated.  Total transit time for the object from first observation to termination was a on the order of 20 seconds.  I and my two sons were traveling southbound on Tracy Boulevard approaching the intersection with Schulte Road.  During the object&#39;s transit there were at least 4 times in which sparks burst from the object, lighting up the ablation cone. My son first called attention to the object.  I continued driving and found a place to stop.  As we got out of the truck it extinguished at near overhead.  the trajectory of the object was very nearly South to North.  Estimating the altitude, I would place the path to be directly overhead at Dublin California, approximately 30 Miles to the West.  This is of course the weakest of the estiamtes because I really could not tell how high it was for sure. If I had to guess, I would probbaly attribute this to the decaying orbit of a satelite in a polar orbit.  It was too slow for a falling star and too fast for an airplane.  What most impressed me was how long the object remained in view and the extremely shallow angle of the trajectory.  It would be impossible for me to say that the path was not indeed horizontal<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Observer seemed exceptionally qualified.  We do not know what the object was that he and his sons observed.  The object does not appear to be the Minuteman II missile, that had been launched out of Vandenberg AFB some 12 minutes earlier.))<n>

The Strawberry Mountains(9038 ft.) were in front of us. It was just past sunset and the sky was still blue and we could see what appeared to be a jet with a short vapor trail, about 5 - 10 degrees above and to the southwest of the mountain.  We exclaimed about the jet, but decided it was not a jet as it looked more like a comet with large amounts of vapor coming off in a fan shape from what appeared to be the front of it.  We pulled over and remarked again about WHAT IS THAT!  Then got our binoculars out from behind the seat but before we could get the lens caps off...it disappeared!  The time was 7:08 (was this connected to the missle launch from California?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The time is the same as the launch of a Minuteman II from Vandenberg AFB, but that missile flew to the west.  We received another report from an engineer in Tracy, CA, who reported that he and his son witnessed an object, with a prominent &#34;ablation cone,&#34; flying due north.  We do not know what that object was.  See report for this date.))<n>

It was rather high up, rather large with no sound heard( we were drifting)and no vapor trail- boat engine was off.Two guys fishing over from us noticed it 1st, whistled and pointed up.I am aware there is an Airforce Base in the Falls. Could it be an existing or secret new fighter or does it match any other sightings?.I am 34, an investment banker. The boat owner is 35, an engineer.We fish the Gorge many times every year - the salmon are running now. There were at least 15/20 more boats with 2/3 per boat in the same area we were at the time.

My eye was caught by something visible through the sliding glass door which is east facing.  I quickly turned my head to see what it was.  (The sliding door is located at a 90 degree angle from one&#39;s line of sight while looking at the TV.) What I saw (briefly, but very clearly) was a  luminous green ball, about the size of an aspirin held at arms length, slowly descending in an east, northeast line.  It disappeared while still visible above the tree line.  That is, the light &#34;went out&#34; or &#34;turned off.&#34;  The length of time from the point where I turned and first observed the object in its descent, to the point of its disappearance was approximately three seconds. I might mention that the object was virtually the same beautiful, luminous emerald green as another object I witnessed in a much longer and more dramatic context almost forty years ago in Albuquerque, NM.  These are the only two occasions when I have seen such an object, but the striking color of the first sighting has always remained vivid in memory.  The recently (but briefly) seen object had the same coloration.<n>

When I arrived at her door I rang and I looked up to the second floor window. That is the window of her apartment, she mostly opens the window to throw the keys. When looking up I noticed 9 bright lights. There course was WNW. They made no sound. They seemed to be flying very fast and very high, though the lights were very bright. I couldn&#39;t distinct if anything was between the 9 lights. There were no blinking lights. It was as if you see 9 sattelites flying over in perfect inverse V formation. During the V formation the speeds of the lights was constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly I knew it weren&#39;t just planes or helicopters in formation, cuase the shape just changed to a double inverse V formation!!! The changing of the formation was only a split second, and the movement of the different lights were smooth without one of them crossing onother one. The movement of the different lights wasn&#39;t symmetric, the left side of the V moved differently then the left side of the V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .   .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .     .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .       .<n> <n><n> <n><n> (if this works out this drawing... they moved from the shape above to the shape beneath) .   .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .   .   .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern in the movement (!which went very smooth!) was like random. Normally in aviation they have a fixed manner of changing to another formation. Also it happened in only a second time. The way they slowed down and catched speed up again was surprisingly smooth. It wasn&#39;t in a way that If they were fixed (in some way connected) so that turning over or changing angle caused it for me to see it as another formation. (I really hope I express myself good here, I&#39;m Dutch :) )<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The diagrams of the object&#39;s two shapes, rendered with ASCII characters, did not survive the transfer from the e-mailed report to the database program.  Moreoever, we have no idea what will happen when the report is transferred to the website.  In the original version, the object was a V-shaped object, with approximatey 30-40 degrees of angle between the two sides.  After the object had changed shape, the three lights, which comprised the &#34;nose&#34; or tip of the wedge, had moved back, so the formation then looked like the letter, &#34;M.&#34;  PD))<n>

Husband putting car in garage. Stopped to look at stars.  Movement caught my attention.  Moving from SW to NE, I I noticed (I am assuming), a single object, the shape of which was a chevron and formed by golden lights.  The lights were bright at the leading edge and decreased in intensity as they went toward the rear, with the midsection being totally dark. The sky was perfectly clear. I could not tell if I was looking at a solid stucture or the sky through the lights.  I thought I heard a very faint hum, like an electrical transformer, but I cant be sure. ............... ................... ...                   ... ....                     .... Sort of looked like this, but several hundred lights, and the midsection dark. There is no way to tell how high it was, but I got the impression it was lower than a conventional aircraft would be over a populated area. It measure approximately 3 or so inches at arms length. I see there is another report from Independence.  Id like to talk to whoever made it.  I will e-mail Mr. Davenport and give permission to pass on my e-mail address.<n>

The lights were at app. 40 degrees elevation and due west of my position. The lights were a red and a green light, even spaced from the ground, almost looking like aircraft lights. The red was on the right and the green on the left.I observed the lights while driving on an E to W road, and at first, thought they were from an aircraft. When I reached the topsign at the end of the road, i lost sight of it through the trees. After a right and a quick left, I searched for the object again, but it had vanished. The object appeared to be motionless, and was fairly close to my position during the sighting.<n>

I still look for them for fun. I was facing south and I looked directly overhead and immediately saw a bright star-like object (about as bright as Venus or a high flying jet if it is coming at you from a distance) which was moving at a normal pace (for a jet) in a direct southward trajectory until it slowed and then stopped. It did not stop abruptly, but slowed first. The light then just slowly faded out, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible (this took about 3 to 4 seconds). While the behavior of the object and the fading light most likely has an orthodox explanation of which I am ignorant, the event seemed somewhat signifigant.  NOTE: I am requesting contact from an investigator with this report due to events in my past and NOT for this individual sighting, as well as an general exchange of information.<n>

Weather- clear, unlimited visibility, near 70 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were having dinner on the patio, when something bright in the sky caught my eye.  The object was bright (possibly from sun reflection) and produced one brilliant (sun?) flash as it approached 90 degrees overhead.  The object appeared a little wider than my thumb at arms lemgth.  I thought it resembled two 737 fuselages my wife describes it as two silver frankfurters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live 15 miles S. and 14 miles E. of the closest commercial airport(OKC), and 15 miles S. and 5 miles east of Tinker AFB.  We see many aircraft on approach to these two airports as well as light aircraft at low altitudes and are familiar with these. This object was about the size of a commercial airliner on approach to OKC.  However it had no wings or tail fins, and it didn&#39;t taper towards the tail like an airliner does.  It was shaped like a short cigar.  There was no vapor trail and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a quiet place and there was absolutely no sound.  My wife saw me look up and she saw it without me having to call her attention to it.  We both sat dumbfounded as it sped along overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, we agreed that it was the most unusual thing we had ever seen! I cannot estimate well the speed or distance, but were I to guess, I would say if the object were the size of a 737 fuselage, it would have been 2 miles high and half a mile East of us. It was moving about twice the speed of an airliner on approach to OKC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The course was directly from the South to the North (airliners on approach are usually East to West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was about to go out of sight into the trees, I ran and fetched a pair of 10X50 binoculars.  I caught sight of it again through the branches, and it appeared to be two metallic cylinders with a space between them about half as wide as they were thick.<n>

I was ascending the escalator at Penn Station, when I reached street level, towards my left about 20 feet away, in what seemed like a male figure, standing tall about 6 feet 7 inches near the mouth of the entraceway to the station.  Crowds of commuters flowed around him, as though he wasn&#39;t there, he stared at the variety of passersby as though he were trying to choose one of them. I caught a glimpes of his face, maybe is eye too, I don&#39;t remeber if he looked at me or not...for no more than two seconds and looked away immediately, kept walking down the sidewalk, without turning back, feeling that if I did turn around for another look, however far away I was getting, it would be the end of me.  The fear instilled in me was so tremendous to this day I can&#39;t explain it. His face was not human, his eyes looked right through you...It was something I wanted to forget as soon as possible but couldn&#39;t...it&#39;s as though he had some kind of will that said, keep walking, don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t look, this does not concern you. His face was a light grey almost white, thick brow, menacing eyes and the thing that stays in my mind most was his stature or the way he was standing, his back arched, broad shoulders, his elbows poining towards his back, his head tilted down just a bit looking at the tops of peoples heads, scoping them out.....it was a normal day, people going about their business and there was this thing standing right in broad daylight? I know it was not human. but that&#39;s crazy, because if this was a sighting then we are all in deep ((deleted)).<n>

When it stopped you could see that the object was a blueish-gray in color.  It blended in with the sky...but the stars were so bright here tonight.  So, when it passed over us...you could not see the stars.  That&#39;s how we saw the color of the object.  The size of the object was the size of a football field.
