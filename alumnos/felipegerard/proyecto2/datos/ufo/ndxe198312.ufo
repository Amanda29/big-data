There to the left of the rail on the bridge was a certifiable flying saucer.  It was close to the edge of dark, but the object was very clearly there and was just hovering there.  The  top was concave and around the bottom were &#34;windows&#34; and there seemed to be a light on inside as light was coming from each one. I took off as soon as I got a good look since it was so obvious what it was.  It was gone when I came back later that night.  (The date is appox. since I can&#39;t remember the exact year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex wouldn&#39;t let me tell anyone about this for fear of drawing attention to himself as he hadn&#39;t filed his income taxes in a lot of years and was afraid of being &#34;fingered&#34;!)   The saucer was silver and about the size of a city bus.  A friend of mine had seen something that followed her home ab! out the same time frame and there was a write up in the paper about it.  I wanted to contact her for details, but wasn&#39;t allowed to do so.  I should do it now, even after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am telling this now in the hopes that someone can shed some info on my sighting of the 80&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary time for the sighting.  PD))<n>

USA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report of sighting of a UFO December 20th, 1983.  Time: 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM EST.  Route 95 North, traveling towards Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up a hitch hiker trying to get back to Maine, and about a half hour after picking him up, we saw crossing the Highway a large blimp shaped craft the size of a football field wide, and it was glowing a bright amber light, as if it was lit up from the friction causing heat to make it glow like a coal in a fire place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in front of us, as I stopped the car on the Highway about 100 to 200 yards ahead of us, and about 200 yards up over the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a blimp, nor a plane, not a fireball, nor a helicopter or jet.  It had a powerful low pitched sound like humming and we watched it slowly move across the Highway and was only traveling about 20 to 30 mph since we were able to look at it as it moved across and kept traveling east over the Atlantic Ocean and then curved upwards and disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was real, I know it was not from this Earth.  I was honored to see it, I was not scared, just awestruck to open my eyes to see it as clear as I could.  The hitch hiker and I had fun the whole ride to his house in Maine.  It was reported on the radio from Kansas to Maine that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch.  I was sitting sideways to the road, the smoke from my cigarette seemed to be hovering in the air, I was in my own world and didnt notice for a couple of minutes.  When I turned to look up, it was not the smoke from my cigarette.  Right above tree top level, hovering directly across the street was a triangle shaped UFO .  I live in front of a subdivision and the triangle was at the entrance to the subdivision.  It did have smoke around it some and it started make a very loud noise like it was in trouble.  It hovered there quite some time.  I walked out into the yard and stood by my fence.  I could see directly underneath it then.  It had 4 lights that seemed to be in each corner of the triangle.  I know that sounds strange but standing underneath it, the triangle seemed to have four corners.  Like it was triangular on top and square underneath.  I know it doesnt seem to make sense but that is what I saw and Im not lying about it.  It just hovered even after I stood staring at it for what seemed a long time.  It was still making an awful racket.  I finally came to my senses and went and got my sister from in the house.  She came out and we both went and stood by the fence, the craft then oh so slowly began moving up the street, towards Old Stage Rd, going up the hill.  My sister and I walked with it down the side of our fenced yard.  It was still making a loud noise.  Later at a x-mas family get together, my aunt who lives down Old Stage Rd was talking about how a loud noise had woken her up at night a few days ago, she said it was making a terrible noise and she said it was around 1:30am.  So it must have kept traveling down that road.  Also my neighbor across the street came outside, stood underneath it looking up at it.  When the UFO started to move, he jumped in his car and followed it up the road.  My sister nor I ever spoke to him about this since we werent on speaking terms with him.  I always wi! shed I c ould have though.  I have tried to write this in the best way that I know how,  I will never forget it!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, but a Saturday occurred on December 17 in 1983, we believe.   We will try to check this.   PD<n>

Looked just like a shooting start except that it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A freind and I were looking at the big dipper before our paper routes at about 5:00 - 6:00 A.M. I think this was in December but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not sure of the year.  The year would have to have been between 1980 and 1983.  As we were looking at the Big Dipper, an object streaked across the Big Dipper going toward the horizon.  I believe the direction was North East.  The object looked just like a shooting star in every respect except for the fact that it came to a complete stop for a fraction of a second, then continued once again going just as fast as a shooting star, then it seemed to burn out the same as you would expect from a shooting star.  The object was white in color and went in a straight line.  There didn&#39;t seem to be any noticable acceleration after it stopped and started again.  It just appeared out of nowhere just like a shooting star allready moving very fast, But then it came to a complete stop for a fraction of a second and then continued seemingly without any acceration at the same rate of speed it was traveling before it stopped.<n>

One night seceral of us Airmen had dragged a keg of beer out in the middle of the desert to party and blow off a little steam.  As you can imagine not much else to do there.  About 2AM i was getting tired and wanted to go back to the dorm and go to sleep.  The Friend that had given me a ride wanted to stay.  Since the base was only about 3 or 4 miles away i decided to walk.  It was December so it was cold.  I was wearing a military parka so I didn&#39;t see that as a big deal.  About a mile and a half from where we had been partying i started to get very cold and was shaking.  I kneeled down to gather some body heat. The next thing I know is that I am waking up with a man on top of me with a gun stuck between my eyes.  He was the owner of a home I had gotten into.  He did not know me and all the windows and doors to his home were locked, there were no signs of a forced entry.  He also had a German Sheperd in his yard that was completely fenced, that would have chewed me up had I tried to enter.  He held me at gun point while his wife called the Police.  When the Police arrived they simply drove me to the base and left me with my Base Commander.  The home owner had found me sleeping on his couch in his living room.  I had a pillow under my head and a blanket over me.  I nor the home owner knew each other and niether one of us had any idea how I got in his home.  The house that I woke up in would not have been the first home that I would have come to, far from it.  I noticed that I had a slight cut on my stomach that was very deep but there was no sign of blood and it healed within days.  My Base Commander was lost for words, and since I was his administrative asst. he knew me very well.  This was not something that I would do.  In later talking to some of my buddy&#39;s that had stayed at the site where we were partying they indicated that about an hour after I had left to walk back to the base they did notice some strange lights coming from the other side of the hill in the spot where I remembered just kneeling down to gather body heat. I had been drinking beer that night but was now drunk.  I have never found out what exactly happened to me that night and nobody in the small town of Indian Springs, Nevada ever came forward with any kind of explanation.  I remember having another incident when I was a child but thats for another time.<n>

Crossed boulevard and disappeared over warehouse. drove under it thinking it a police helicopter dowing surveilance.  Very disturbing and panicked when eyes met driver of on coming traffic who witnessed same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, so it bothers you&#39;re web site doesn&#39;t make any mention of this because it was in the local paper the following day as having been witnessed by a cop patroling Milwaukee Street.  Anyway as for my experience I was coming home from the Univ of Wisc Madison&#39;s library and it was late and very cold out.  I pull up to the light going northbound on Johnson Street (just past Tenney park near the police repair shop and old paint warehouses) and about 15 feet above the roof of this house down Johnson Street on my right is this thing.  It was black, but appeared illuminated - kinda dim like - underneath.  I didn&#39;t think much about it. Thought it was probably a police helicopter searching the neighborhood for some East High School punks.  But it kept my attention cause it wasn&#39;t really a spot light eminanting shining down into backyards.  Also it didn&#39;t have any blinking helicopter like lights on top.  What ever it was doing it was moving slow, steady and smooth and kept following over the row of roofs.  From what I could see it look like a rounded off van with a fat base.  My light changed and I started on my way about the same time the &#34;helicopter&#34; finished with the roofs and was headed across the street.  Alot of observations started coming real fast as I approached to go under it.  It was about 15 feet off the ground.  It was uniform in its black color but had definite seams. No windows. The one distinct feature I remember the most was a cross like seam (real pronounced like) on its belly.  This is about when all the contradictions started pooring in.  First off, there was loose snow - if it was a helicopter how come it wasn&#39;t kicking up snow?  And the bushes in the boulevard - they didn&#39;t twitch like they were caught in any chopper wash either.  I remember shutting the heater off and coasting without the gas peddle down so I could hear the helicopter.  Helicopters are noisy but none of the houses had woken up, and I wasn&#39;t hearing anything and I was right underneath it. And I felt kinda funny passing underne! ath it.  The car reacted like it was mildly buffeted by helicopter wash and I can recall kinda of a slow down.  And something was wrong about the illumination it was casting down. The light was dim but clear and the shrub branches kind of reflected like hotdogs under a heat lamp at the gas station.  So I realize now somethings fundamentally wrong.  I take my foot of the gas and this thing rises slowly to pass over the warehouse just beyond the oncoming lane&#39;s traffic.  I&#39;m borderline freaking out and so this guy in this big vanilla colored older model chevy (the kind that seats about twenty) is coming at me in the oncoming traffic lane and he&#39;s got his face like smashed up against the windshield over his steering wheel looking real hard at what ever the thing was.  And he gives me this blank big eyed look.  After that I this wasn&#39;t right and went  right into an adreniline pump that kept me pacing when I got home for at least a half an hour.  The next day it was the newspaper being reported as mussing around on the far east side.  I really try not to talk about this.  And if I&#39;m not sure I think I entered this same experience into this web site before - it feels good to say something.<n>
