1/30/68 01:00|Dayton|OH|Disk|10 minutes|Very large white saucer, chased by B-52 near Wright Patterson Air force base.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98374.html|2|ndxe196801| Very large white saucer, chased by B-52 near Wright Patterson Air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO REPORTING DOCUMENT  First, I was informed of your website by an older broadcast of Coast to Coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this event happens many years ago, but I believe it is still note worthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this was my first encounter but not my last. I had two more sightings about 10 and then 12 years later. But that is another story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now a brief background on location and time frame.  Now the sighting.  It took place in late January or early February of 1968-or 1969.  I had just received a telescope for my birthday (01/18).  I don’t remember if it was my 12th or 13th birthday.  But at that time I had know knowledge of UFOS, and this memory has been burned into my brain for over 45 years.  You already know that I live in Dayton, Ohio.  At that time my house was as the crow flies about 5 miles from Wright Patterson Air force base.  Now this was the time when Wright Pat was still a SAC base.  We had B-52s Fly over the house every day.  It was there approach pattern for landing.  Sometimes so close off the deck you could see the rivets on the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place between 11 pm and 1:00 am.  My friend and I were out in the backyard with my new Telescope.   Directly due east there was a very large, almost pure white saucer-shape craft.  It was hovering on the horizon at just above tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That would place just east south East of Wright Pat.  It was moving very slowly, heading South East.  Now it was big, hard to judge size, but at least as long as a football field maybe bigger. It was as bright as the brightest full moon you have every seen.  Except three very light gray porthole looking discoloration marks on the bottom.  These were evenly spaced.  Now here is the kicker. Just as we saw this object, a B-52 comes flying over the house with its landing gears down.  It is on final approach, most likely not more than 1000 feet or so off the deck.  It just clears the house, landing gears go up and it powers up.  Let me tell you know it when a B-52 starts to accelerate.  Now there approach pattern was at a North East heading.  This B-52 banked hard and tried to get up behind the craft.  I don’t know how close it got maybe a mile or two.  The B-52 is behind the craft just as it disappears behind some trees.  We run down to the corner of the block, it appears the B-52 is closing! than ZIP the craft went almost straight up and out of sight in about 2 seconds. B-52 fly’s around for 15-20 Minutes.  Then it is gone from sight.  The next day in the Journal Herald news paper there was a small paragraph saying about 200 people reported an unidentified object in the sky.  I have never been able to find this report going over micro film.  But it is hard if you can’t nail down at least a pacific week or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was picking up my cousin and her son to attend a drive-in movie and as I drove out Casitas Pass Rd., I observed a huge orange (more the color of fire than sodium lights) moving thru Casitas Pass into Carpinteria valley.  It was traveling low as I could see the outline of the hills behind it. I honked &amp; yelled for them (including her husband) to come out and see it.  Her husband got a quick glimpse before the view was blocked by the avacado orchard across the street. We quickly drove to the frontage road that runs along beside Hwy 101 (going South) where we would have an unobstructed view. This rd is very close to the ocean as well as the S. end of the valley. There were 3 of these &#39;glowing&#39; craft...at arm&#39;s length, the size of a dinner plate. We were with 1/2 - 3/4 mile from these objects as they flew below and to the N. of Rincon mts. As we stepped from the car to watch we noticed several cars in the S. bound lanes of Hwy 101 pull over &amp; people getting out to look at these things! They slowly moved out over the ocean...hovering not far from shore for several minutes &amp; then, one by one, went &#39;out&#39;.. like a switched light. Nothing was in the newspaper (Santa Barbara Newspress) or on the news. The next evening a neighbor (technican/aero-space co.) also observed them but at a much later hour. My cousin has a B.A. from U.of CA and was 28 yrs old @ time of sighting. I also have a B.A. and am in charge of operations for a Nevada mining operation. Our son&#39;s were only 4 yrs old @ the time. I am reporting this because of the recent sightings (similar color, ect.) being reported from the East &amp; in the hopes someone else that witnessed these UFO&#39;s might speak up. I have seen something similar here in Nevada a few yrs ago..just S.E. of infamous Area 51.<n>
1/20/68 19:00|Gloucester|NJ|Disk|5min.  &  5min.|Myself and a girlfriend were laying in the backseat of a car parked on a lonely street next to a power house, old factories, and a wate|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26251.html|4|ndxe196801| Myself and a girlfriend were laying in the backseat of a car parked on a lonely street next to a power house, old factories, and a water tower.  The girl said look at that so I looked up and out the window in the back and I saw this saucer and the bottom was swirling and making a swirling sound it was spinning up near the water tower and it had a small part ontop of the saucer and there were three windows and the light was blinking from one window to the next it was grayish.  I thought I have to get to the drivers seat and get out of here and all the time I was thinking if I move something might happen but I got into the drivers seat when I started the engine the saucer went up in the sky within a fraction of a second and I could see it way up in the sky.  I saw this one airplane come across the sky towards it and the saucer went down and then another plane came from the other way and the saucer went up in between both planes, one plane above it and the other plane below it.  Then I started to go and the saucer seemed to move along with the car.  We went to get someone to bring them back to show them because no one would believe us.  We went to her house but no one was home and then we went to a store were I hung out with friends and no one was there and then to my house and no one was there.  My house was about a quarter mile from it so all I had to do was drive straight down my street which was next to the Delaware River across from Philadelphia the south part of Philadelphia.  A couple miles to the north was the main part of Philadelphia and south was the Phil. National Airport.  Across the river was industrial and docks and the Eagles football stadium.  As I drove down my street I would pass the town park and then onto another street there were about 10 oil tanks and then the industrial park were I saw the saucer.  I kept going down the street (ALL THIS WAS DURING NIGHT TIME) and I got half way past the oil tanks, which were along the river to my right, and just before the water tower I got scared and said to my friend that I can not go back there and I turned left onto this street and all of a sudden three of the brightist lights I ever saw came shinning in the back window.  It seemed as if the or what ever it was came from behind the oil tanks and from the river and it seemed as if it was in the air and shinning the lights down from up in the sky.  I put the gas peddle to the floor and took off as fast as the car would go.  I was about to come up to a cross street which was a major road and this intersection was one of the worst in town for accidents but I did not care I went through the stop sign and went right across the street and when I got to houses were people lived I felt safer and slamed on my brakes and got out to look and that fast there was no more lights.  I asked my girlfriend what happen and she said when I put the brakes on it went off to the right of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I have never seen another saucer but a lot of times I can hear that swirling sound out side in the sky when I am in the house and it is quite.  I asked the girl I was with at that time if she had ever seen one before and she said yes.  Its been over thirty years but I have never seen her again but I hope I run into her to ask her if she had seen anymore. jAlso my science teacher said it was probably a weather baloon and the lights we saw was from an airplane but an airplane could not fly that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone said were seeing things and never believed us but I believe there was something to back my story up to be true.  Like I said this happened in 1968 and around the early 1980&#39;s the government attack force of the USA, and they never told anyone the Mayor or Police Chief or anyone that the were going to do this, attacked the industrial building behind the water tower and next to the oil tanks.  I read it in the city news paper and when they attacked the building it woke up residents that lived down the street and a couple blocks away.  The governments answer was that they were just practicing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The building they attacked was a place called GAF which is strang because I read a group that deals with UFO&#39;s and the organization name is GAF. Also I read somewere that tin or alluminum was used for spacecrafts, which I do not know is true or not, but this building made alluminum siding and they said that there was contamination in the building which closed in the mid 1970&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, thats all I have to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was early evening around 7 or 8 in the evening in mid Winter.  A lot of fresh snow had fallen and it&#39;s surface had a crisp crust to it under a bright winter moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on a long country road about 30 minutes from Moncton and it&#39;s airport.  This road is due North and lines up with the airport where in the distance it&#39;s beacon can be seen at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother had asked if I would go to the store a few houses away and get something needed for the home.  I called my friend and cousin from across the street to go with me.  We could see across the valley for miles.  No clouds in the sky, the moon was out and the stars were crisp.  As we neared the store, my cousin and I remarked how in the North in the direction of the airport, a bright red light could be seen and it must be a plane or something.  Both our fathers worked at the airport and we both had a facination with aircrafts and flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We entered the store and within a few minutes we were outside on our way home but we soon noticed that now above the house with the store and behind us was a large red half-ball and it was folowing us.  It was about 30 feet high, silent, about the size of a small car and it was flashing similarly to a police light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you took a red glass ball, painted the top black, and then painted a wide black band dividing the base into two red wedges, and then placed a rotating light within it.  Mind you, we could clearly see the two base of the half-orb but I did not see anything above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment of fear came over us and we wanted to go back into the store but it meant going towards this and since it was not making any noise and slowly moving towards us, we turned and walked South towards our two homes.  I remember vividly walking home all the while being accompanied by this flashing light.  We were scared as we walked but it kept the same distance from us on our way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this point to us getting in front of our houses, I have a feeling of dis-jointed time.  As if something happened or that of missing time.  I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, my cousin and I are standing on the road directly between our two houses.  We were scared and didn&#39;t want to seperate but wanted to get inside quickly.  We decided to split and run at the same time and both of us ran into our respective homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got in, my mother and several of my siblings (big family with 12 kids) could see that something had scared me.  Several of my sisters saw it through the back windows as the object just passed over our house and went towards the river about a mile away and then turn North again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been etched in my mind for over 35 years and I still can&#39;t figure what it was or what happenned to us between the store and us getting home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then another saucer followed and stopped about 10 feet above the first one.  Both craft were identical (30 ft in diam and 10 ft high) being silver clad with large (3-4 sq-ft lights) around and encircleing the perimeter of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were impressive as they were very bright red, blue, and yellow lights.  This was a very beautiful sight to behold.  After a few minutes, the craft moved up big clear and over the mountain at the head of the hollow while our bird dogs (english setters) barked at them.<n>

On or about the date posted a buddy and I climbed a ear by hill to read letters from home ( as we always did). 5 to 10 minutes after reaching the top of the hill my buddy pointed to a solid dull looking cigar shaped object which seem to be carved out of a very clear blue sky. We looked at it for a few seconds before we could comment and we decided itw as not a clound since the edges were crisp and there was some obvious 3 dimentionality to it. The object was just huge since we actually had to move our heads from left to right to see it end to end. Within 15 20 seconds the object seem to be shrinking horizontally in size till it just vanished. To our estimation the whole incident lasted not more than 30 seconds. We ran down to the school to report what we saw and a group of the other children were very exited when they say us we figured that they had also seen the object. To our surprise their exciment was due to the fact that my b! ody and I had been gone for over 2 hours and we had been missed at lunch head count. Fortunelly for us a Franciscan monk in charge of the school was very sympathetic and offered to call a local USA air base (Torrejon) to ask about the phenomenon. The base reported that there had been no scheduled test flights that day but were very interested in a personal report. We declined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all this time I still wonder what happened in those 30+ seconds that misteriously turned in over 2 hours of missing time<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was about 1000 feet in the air. We estimated it&#39;s size to be about the size of a football field,it was close enough that we could see the edge of it and could tell it was a solid object. There wer trees on both sides of the road so we couldn&#39;t see it for very long but I would say it was moving about twice as fast as a fighter jet. It didn&#39;t make any sound. There was alot of reports about cattle mutilations around that time.We were only sixth graders at the time we saw it,it scared us so bad that we ran about a mile home without stopping. I have wondered about this all my life, so I decided to report it.<n>

We turned off a main road onto a little zig-zag short-cut road. The road was fully lighted. Yet when we turned off to me it was like we &#39;drove off the edge of the world.&#34; It was thick black dark. I couldn&#39;t see her or any part of me. Then suddenly we were on the road in front of grandmothers--three blocks from where we turned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went in and my sister went to set the clock for the morning, but the time was wrong. The clock said 2am. I went in the living room to find the correct time. Every clock in the house said 2am. I went back and told her that. She said, &#34;huh?&#34; and set the clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought of this incident again until she brought it up 30 years later.

Yet, I never thought of it again, until she brought it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost 3 hours?? And seemed to not think that strange at the time.

The light was changing colors and was unlike any light we had ever seen.  It moved slowly and quietly until it was almost over us.  It hovered for about 5 to 10 minutes.  At the last, it took off, straight up, at a great velocity and was gone in a second or two.  We spent most nights on guard duty and were used to all of the lights of the night sky in Viet Nam, and this moved in a fashion that no known terrestrial vehicle could move.<n>

I was maybe 15 at the time, living with my parents. I was sleeping, in my own room at the rear of the house, when I was awakened by a noise.  It was the sound that a jet would make, however it was of a slightly different pitch, I knelt on my bed looking out of my window and was frozen in place by the sight of a UFO hoovering approx. 100&#39; above our neighbors and our house.  This UFO was the stereotypical UFO for the time and I am not sure that I could even describe it accurately now.  This craft hoovered maybe 15 seconds in this spot ( which seemed like 15 minutes ) and then it departed in a vertical direction until it was pretty high, before moving horizontally.  The next thing that happened was pretty cool.  It was a clear night with a lot of stars visible and I was watching this craft depart out of frozen, excited, curiosity.  It was traveling horizontally when it came to a spot in the sky that was pure black, no stars, and darker in! color than the night sky, as it got to this spot it turned into it an vanished instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was disappointed that it was gone because I wanted to continue to watch and follow this craft, but I was excited because I felt I knew a little something that others didn’t, and that was an explanation of how they are able to travel such great distances.  I have told very few people of this sighting because they tend to not believe you, and I have never really known who I could give this information to. If this information helps in any way than my job is done.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
