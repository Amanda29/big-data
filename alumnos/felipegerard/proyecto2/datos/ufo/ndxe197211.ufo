11/8/72 20:00|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|10-15 min|Dark triangular object emitting "dread", searching for something, then challenges USAF base security.|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40999.html|2|ndxe197211| Dark triangular object emitting &#34;dread&#34;, searching for something, then challenges USAF base security.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object came from the SE about 75 feet from our position, and about 35 feet above the ground, it had a triangle shape, no visible markings,, the object seemed to be extremely dark- flat black some what shimmery at the edges and at points on the surface of the object. There was a very deep drone hum, not really heard but felt, we didn&#39;t move as it seemed that if we made ourselves seen somethime may happen to us. As the craft passed in front to the NE and about30 yards from us a beam of brilliant whte light shot down to the ground from the (?) front of the craft, and began to sweep left to right down then up as if it were searching for something, When this light first hit the ground the was a disturbance of dust rising, and as it sweeped around you could see dust roiling up. We experienced an ill, nauseous, dread feeling. We continued to watch the object fade out of sight. The direction in which it was traveling would lead it towards a USAF TAC/MAC base. Soon afterward we felt eased of the &#34;dread&#34; and we about to leave when we noticed that the airbase had came alive, ie: search lights, sirens and military police vechiles ranging along the security fencewe saw this due to our being on a slight rise. We left in our car, and decided to check if the base was shut down, the main gate was closed and MPs were not allowing anyone to enter. The next day the word was that a coyote had set off the perimeter alarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

This occurred on the Military air base formally known as Uplands Airforce Base, and while walking to an early morning hockey pratice I decided to look for stars to take my mind off being alone in the dark. I suddenly saw a very low, very bright,silent object with 3 blacked out rhombus shaped (windows??) approaching me a very high rate of speed. The object suddenly came to a complete stop right in front of me over a large tree approximately 200 AGL. It appeared to just stop and take notice of me in my hockey gear and hovered silently for about 20 sec and then at an incredible speed left at about a 45 degree angle towards some clouds and just disappeared. It was initially flying to the best of my knowledge, down the military flight line from the International side of the airport.<n>

The craft was red and glowing.  It went behind a mountain but did not come back out on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a child when this occurred, but I feel that I need to now report it.<n>
11/1/72 19:30|Crescent City|CA||30 seconds|High pitch tones were probably an encounter with a UFO in Crescent City California during the early 1970s|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42789.html|5|ndxe197211| High pitch tones were probably an encounter with a UFO in Crescent City California during the early 1970s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a teenager at the time and overheard two very high pitch tones.  The tones were witnessed by another person of similar age in the same room.  Both of us dismissed the tones as a dog whistle at the time.  The tone started in one pitch and many moments later appeared to change pitch to a second tone.  We were actually in a bedroom when we heard the tones.  It is difficult for me to remember the exact date, time, and month because this was something that happened a very long time ago.  I do recall that it was raining at the time this was going on and for that reason I listed November as the most probable month of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A number of years later I attended a support session for abductees that was held in Seattle on Aurora.  Although I have never been abducted, I learned from the group that high pitch tones are one of the signs associated with contact with a UFO.  For that reason I have decided to file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think I can provide you the witness name.  It has been too long ago.  I can&#39;t give consent to a collect return call, but if someone e-mails me or calls me, I am happy to call them back at my expense.

11/1/72 08:00|Trinidad|CA|Light|10 minutes|Satelite sighting, changing directions to quick for normal.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33953.html|6|ndxe197211| Satelite sighting, changing directions to quick for normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Young kids walking to school. This occurred when we were in grade school. I don&#39;t recall the exact year or month. Sometime, I think during the early 1970&#39;s, when the government decided to save fuel by having us go to school in the dark. We would walk to the school and it felt like the middle of the night. All of the stars were out and even a satelite once in a while would go across the sky, in a straight line. That is when we were surprised to be watching a satelite going straight but it turned and went different with no noticable change of pace. South to north, steady, and then make an absoulte right angle and go east. South to North and then an immeadiate right hand turn to the East. We just looked at each other and did not know any words to describe what we witnessed. We got to school and other kids were talking about the same thing. A satelite going as normal and then turning 90 degrees. Without changing speed or anything. Just going and turning and then gone when out of our range of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound. No colored lights. Just like a star in the sky, like our satelites. Moving like a satelite. But turning to a right angle just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never knew what it was. We were just kids walking to school in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  The energy crunch occurred in the fall of 1973, so the event may have occurred during that year.  PD))<n>
11/1/72 01:00|Winding Stair Camp Ground|OK|Light|1 hour|We could see the  very bright white light outside our camper but no shadows only objects in the light and carbled lanquage|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25456.html|7|ndxe197211| We could see the  very bright white light outside our camper but no shadows only objects in the light and carbled lanquage<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother inlaw and I were deer hunting on winding stair mountain in southeastern oklahoma and decided to stay at winding stair campgound which is located out on a pointon winding stair mountain.  I was driving a pickup with a commerical camper with sleeping bags. we arrived at the campground and parked at the campground and parked in the parking lot over looking a canyon.  We went to bed about 10:00 p.m. and at 1:00 a.m. something woke me up and it was a bright light in the parking lot next to ourpickup.  I have never seen a light so bright.  I started to climb out the camper with my gun when something told me to stay put inside the camper.  I woke my brother inlaw and he said that was the brightest lights he had ever seen.  The odd thing was that no shaddows were being cast on the other side of the truck away from the light.  I asked my brother inlaw if he wanted go see what it was and at that moment an internal voice told me to stay in the camper and everything would be alright.  It was hard to look into the ,light it was so bright as if it was a white light not a vehicle light.  As we set in the camper we could see something walking in the light and could hear voices, a weird audiable voices such as muffled radio language type voices.  The objects walking in the light cast no shadows on the camper.  After watching for a while a peace came over us and we both laid down in our sleeping bags and in about 2-3 minutes the light went out.  One thing no sounds were ever heard except for the carbeled lanquage.  I have never told anybody this story and neither has ny brother inlaw.  I brougt it up to him 10 or so years later and he said he didn&#39;t want to talk about it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

She told some people what she saw. but they didnt think it had anything to do with it. about week later around midnight the dogs started barking again trying to jump the fence again, towards the mountian. This time she stayed inside and looked for the light again.She saw the light again dropping behind the mountian. she stayed at the widow to see if she could see the come up again. about 20 mins later the light came up ,and took off towards the west. the next day my dad came home from work..he hauled stuff for a living. she told him what he saw and about the men missing.And how she thought it was a ufo.He laughed at her.But a few days later they went into town and read in the paper the men was found at their camp,with some kind of gliter stuff on their colths.and didnt know where they have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
