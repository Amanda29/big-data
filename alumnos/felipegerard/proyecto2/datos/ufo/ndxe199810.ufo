On our left was a forest and a flea market and on the right was some house so we were caring on a conversation when i looked over in the feild when i seen a looked like a circle thing it was  well looked about as big as the moon from far away and it had white blue and red blury lights all around the sides the  bottom of it looked like 4 little  odd shaped triangles like a drawling on the bottom that they formed a circle but they were made from triangle things and it looked like a little very little amount of fog from it I was like oh my god and i said jessi look and we were just standint there and we didnt even talk it stood like  not even 1 block away from us  and it was over a bare tree befor the forest and flea market just in the middle of the feild so we just stood there and were like what is it so I stared at it and jessi looked to the right where the houses were and so I looked at the houses but 5 seconds later we looked right were it was and it was gone within 5 seconds whatever it was, it was gone like no tace of what way it went no light no sounds it was just like  it vanished so then we ran home and we got in trouble for staying out that long but we told my mom what we saw and she says a few months prier my sister and my mom seen a similar object outfront in a feild about a mile away so we never really talk about it but we know it was definatly not a airplain or a kite or anything and so thats my story and thats what happend on halloween 98 so now Jessi and i both beleive in aliens now. and when that happend me and ((name deleted)) were both 12 but we both know what we saw<n>

Being that i hadnt slept in 3 day and was extremely tired,i was sorta day dreaming out of my window&lt;I was in the front passenger seat&gt;,when i saw ,what can be easily described as what a spot light looks like when shined on a cloud only much brighter,at first even though im a ufo enthousiast i just sorta brushed it off.After watching this disappear several times and reappear for about 15 minutes i mentioned it to my mother who was driving the car&lt;She hand never seen a ufo before&gt;,and she didnt believe me, so i continued to watch out my window hoping to see it again,with no luck..Then i looked out my mother&#39;s window and there it was again,appearing and disappearing and doing strange menuvers.I pointed it out to her and she was very excited it being her first sighting.Together we watched the object for at least 30 minutes, her in totall awe it being her first sighting and me in awe although ive had hundreds of sightings this was the best so far.near the last few minutes the object came out from behind the clouds for a few seconds,It could be best described as a line of lights,4-5 lights in a straight line,i assume is was saucer shaped with lights lining it and because of my angle i only saw a line of lights..Then we pulled into a rest stop and because of all the lights it was to hard to even see the clouds.We were at the rest stop for about 30mins and when we did get back on the road we never saw it again…<n>

The sky was in full view with no clouds. As I was singing I looked up and saw a very bright sphere like object moving very fast across the sky from West to East. Before the object disapeared, it shot out a bright orange/red flame from the back of its flight line. The flame did not extend that far from the object. The object was in view for around 5 seconds, then just disapeared. My guitar player also saw this event. When I told our manager, he said it most likely was the rocket boosters from the space shuttle reentering the earths atmosphere. The only problem with this is that the shuttle lifted off 10 hours earlier.<n>

The airborne object(s) remained in one position for about 5 minutes then apparently rotated on center axis about 30-degrees clockwise, and remained there for about 10 minutes.  There were about 12 to 14 lights in all, and they appeared to be associated with one single object.  One set of lights, 2 to 3 in number, located on the left-side view-point rotated separately from the rest of the lights.  At approximately 19:00 the lights went out.

I was driving about 65 mph. It was big and it was close. It was traveling from the northwest to the southeast. Most astounding was the bright apple-green color, the closeness, and the long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 47-year-old married woman with one teenage son. I publish a national, monthly trade magazine by profession and was on my way to a quarterly operations meeting in Auburn, CA, with my business partners. About one hour into my drive, directly in front of me at about a 45 degree angle, a large, very bright ball of fire streaked across the sky moving from northwest to southeast. I was driving about 65mph on CA Interstate 680 North on the southern outskirts of the City of Dublin. I was shocked at how close the fireball was. It&#39;s very difficult for me to judge but I would guess it was just two football fields away from me at a 45 degree angle. The center of the ball was the brightest white I&#39;ve ever seen but the most remarkable aspect was the bright flourescent apple-green color around the ball and surrounding the long tail. After about five (5) long seconds it simply disappeared. I was stunned and looked at the car to my right in the lane next to me. A woman was looking at the very spot where the fireball had disappeared. For a brief second we just stared at each other. I shook my head and she made a gesture to indicate she saw it also. Though I didn&#39;t need confirmation as to what I had just seen, I was glad to be able to tell others that there was another witness. (I have seen one other object that was unusual but that was in June of 1971 in Estees Park in the Colorado Rocky Moutains. That ball of light moved at rapid speed, changing angles quickly, once shooting straight up into the air. I will reserve my following comments only to the object I saw most recently.)<n>

Please see the report for 11/2 also.  He said it was like a comet, but too bright and too low to the ground. There was no sound.<n>

I often look out at the stars. This particular night there was a glowing greenish light that caught my eye. It was bright an unusual and unfamiliar. I live close to an airport, but the airport&#39;s last flight in/out is not past midnight. There is a cargo plane that takes off every night around 2 am, but I can hear it; it is a familiar sound to me.I also see the planes come in and out and I can not remember a plane or helicopter ever hover or circle around the airport. The light was not familiar to me, so I stared at it for awhile and went closer to the window to study it...it just sort of loomed over the hillside. Then it moved slowly and two other lights appeared. I heard nothing. It is very isolated and quiet where I live. I can hear the planes that take off very well, but I could hear nothing; no rumble of a motor or screem of engines. I thought it was a helicopter, but thought it strange that it hovered in this particular area at this particular time at night. The lights were the size of a melon at my distance and moved in unison now. All together the lights moved like they were attached to something. First they moved &#39;forward&#39; or my direction (west), then they went up and over further(south) and then back and down and back(east). And, then, suddenly they seemed to just disappear. There was no cloud obstruction and it didn&#39;t seem that the object/lights went behind the mountain or that a craft had landed. The lights were too far away from the airport to be able to land. It was very strange. Almost as if they went out all of a sudden. I would not be even reporting this if I had not been listening to Art Bell tonite. All of a sudden I felt this strange familiarity with the reports that were coming in on his show (11/16/98-Monday). I had no idea that other people were seeing this kind of thing. I just wrote it off as &#39;being tired&#39;; seeing a strange star(s); or, a cargo plan or helicopter I just couldn&#39;t hear. Ironically, I&#39;ve been ! looking for the lights every time I get up late at night...just to satisfy my sanity more than anything...did I really see something or didn&#39;t I? Until tonite, I wasn&#39;t altogether too sure. Now, I know, that others, during this very same time period really saw something like what I saw. It is both reassuring and eerie at the same time. I only wish I had written down the experience right away or called the air control tower or something. I was afraid to call or report the sighting because I didn&#39;t want to be &#39;wrong&#39; about what I&#39;d seen. The reports on Art Bell&#39;s show make me even more sure of the siting, but I still feel strange about what I saw. I&#39;m a teacher and this is a small town and I wouldn&#39;t want people to think I&#39;ve gone nutty or something! But, I am reporting the information because so many others out there seem to verify what I too saw! Hope this helps<n>

I never saw a shooting star like that and never thought of it anything more then that.  I&#39;m am writing to you because I heard on the Art Bell show of people seeing a similar thing in different parts of the country.  And it was being decribed as a UFO siting.

After realizing that it hadn&#39;t moved in the 5 minutes I examined it through binoculars and quickly called my roommate (who described the same thing).  See description below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calling my roommate upstairs I stuck a pair of binoculars in his hands and, before telling him what I saw, I asked him to describe what it looked like to him.  Through the binoculars he saw five or six lights arranged in a compressed oval pattern.  Through the binculars each of these lights seemed rather faint, but with the naked eye it was very bright and impossible to miss the colors flashing between red, blue and white (the colors changed rapidly, more than a strobe light even).  To my surprise, he was seeing EXACTLY what I was seeing.  We watched it for about twenty minutes and, before we decided to give it a rest, what was originally five or six lights had become one -- perhaps whatever it was was moving farther away, although it seemed to hold the same position for the time we watched.  (I continued to watch it from my bed -- I&#39;m in a loft and have a terrific view of the sky.) If I had to pinpoint an exact location of the light, I would place it at at least two miles away in the SW sky over Lake Michigan.  I&#39;m on the North Side, so I guess that would put it parallel with the Lincoln Park/Gold Coast area.  It could easily have been overlooked by people on the ground, but once they saw it I guarantee it would have raised an eyebrow. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I definitely know what it wasn&#39;t.  Any of your ideas or insight would be much appreciated.<n>

It did not cast light on the surrounding objects.  It was about 100-120 feet away, hovering above a house.  It was barely moveing to my right, and behind a tree.  I saw the entire craft for only a minute, the rest of the time I saw the light inbetween the branches of the tree.  I looked at my clock.  It was 11:10.  I looked at it with binoculars, but could not make out any detail.  I thought about waking my mom, but she had taken some back medication, and was in too deep a sleep.  I was about to get my camera, and run out to the craft, but I then remebered watching a show on UFO.  The people that got too close to UFO would have there electronic equiptment shut down.  And, people that got too close would recieve radiation poisoning, or if they were really unfortunate, get abducted.  I watched it for 20 more minutes, then, the light was gone.

The weather was clear. The stars were bright. The object I saw was like a round globe, dull white, in color. The strangest thing about this object was, it did not have a tail . That and the color. It was almost transparant. You could clearly see the shape. But the middle was a dull white. I have never seen a comet, meteor, or anything else, that did not have a tail behind it. I would be intrested to know if any one else reported this. The object was traveling West To East.<n>

I looked in that direction (E-NE) and heard a second noise exactly the same and saw an ignited type flash - bright green - streak down from the sky coinciding exactly with the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my arcadia doorway smoking a cigarette when  we heard an extremely loud noise, my husband describes it as a rocket engine noise, that seemed extremely close.  I stepped out of the doorway to look in that direction and heard a second noise exactly the  same.  At that time I was looking at the horizon (tree top level) and saw a bright green flash ( I did not see the &#34;ignition&#34; it was a flash that had occurred and retained the shape of the flash).  It was like a jagged edged star with many irregular points, like a cartoon explosion.  It was bright green, rimmed with white, and retained that complete shape as it streaked down from the sky.  The streaking downward coincided directly with the loud noise (the noise followed the downward path) until it was below my point of vision.  It did not burn out on it&#39;s way down but retained the shape the entire time.  I did not hear a crash or any ending, the noise just quit. From my location at Scottsdale Rd. and McDowell Rd. it would have been approximately over 4 Peaks or maybe a little south of there.  There were very few stars in that direction, and it occured between two stars that are about 2 fingers apart vertically at arms length, and about 6-7 inches above the horizon at arms length.  It started just below the top star and a little to the north, and streamed down at about a 60 degree angle in a northwesterly direction.  The entire episode lasted about 10 seconds.  My husband heard the sound but wasn&#39;t out the door quick enough to see it.  I am 39, white female, college educated, and have never seen anything like this before.  I was completely awake, sober and the sky was clear and cool.<n>

I thought nothing of it and , about 14 miles down the road I notice the same orange light, so I woke my wife up and told here that I keep on seeing a flashing orange light. So she started to watch the sky and moments later she notice the same light. Then as we got closer to the mountains, about a 100 ft up in the sky we notice 6 triangler shape ships with bright orange l lights just sitting paused in the sky. I didn&#39;t know what to do so I pulled the car over as well as other cars pulled over to the side of the road to observer the space crafts. My wife asked me to just take off because she was scarred. With in minutes we notice 18 or so air force jets coming in from all directions. It looked like they were trying to circle in the space crafts. Then two of space crafts took off fast over the mountains as four air force jet tryed to chase them, but the looked way too fast. The resrt of the space crafts looked like they took off in different directions with air force jets trying to chase them as well. The rest of the night, looked like the air force owend the sky&#39;s. I think that NORAD must of saw something on radar. Why else would air force jets come at top speeds trying to circle the space ships in. Their is alot of people in the LA Veta, San Luis vally that see things like this all the time but don&#39;t report it.<n>

We were about 25 miles just south of Tumwater traveling about 60-65 MPH.  We both noticed a large blue fireball appeared flying overhead     (Note: the object came into view through our windshield passing our vechicle in the sky heading in a northern direction.)  The fireball was in sight for both of us to witness before disappearing.  At approx 18:45 we also observed 4 flashes of blue light as if a storm was of in the distance. The flashes of light were about 2-3 minutes apart.  No clouds were in the sky and no storm conditions present    These blue flashes were in the northern sky.  At this point we were were still driving on I-5 inroute to Seattle.<n>

I thought that I had lost it.  I looked over to the left side of the road, and hoovering back over the filed was this weird yelowsih flashing object. It was 3 lights. I pulled off onto the left side of the road, and it headed west. I follwed it until I reached a stop sign.  It was overhead of me, floating above a MAIN Highway. It turned around and headed the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the store and on my way back I noticed an unusual bright object heading east on the left side of the road.  Behind it was a smaller light, following it. I noticed it because it was flying so low over top some trees and then like that it accelerated its speed.  I followed it on the main road, route 33 east.  I lost sight of it for a second, but on insticnt I turned down Angling road heading north east.  I got to a clearing on a top of a hill.  I looked over to the left side where I thought I could see the object moving, and instead I saw 3 bright yellwosih lights blinking in a very unusal non- pattern formation hoovering over a field.  I cant say how far away it was, but pretty far back.  I turned onto the left side of the road and watched it.  The it started moving west, slowly at first, then faster. I went back onto Rt 33 and follwed it.  I thought I could maybe beat it to the next road on the left, where it appeared it would fly over.  Instead, the object made a 90 degree turn, crossed over Rt 33 and headed south.Luckily it turned where I could take a road to follow it, Colby road.As I follwed it, it appeeared to be further and further.  I kept following it anyways.  Finally I saw it move to the south east.  I turned down Sharrick road and followed it some more.  When I reached the next road, the object was on the left side of me, approaching an intersection.  When I got to the intersection of Rt 20, the object turned around right over the intersection! It was triangular.  A light was at each vertex.  Each time the craft changed directions, a red and green light went on.  Of course I did an illegle u-turn and speed to keep up with the object, now heading north west.  Finally I lost it and I gave up.  I know I have seen tis particular object before.  When it was over the field, there were two lights on top, and one in between the two on the bottom.  It made no noise and for some reason, it didn&#39;t really try to get away from me.  It could&#39;ve becasue I was going about 110 miles per hour trying t! o follow it.  It knew I was folowing it. And for some other strange reason, it followed the roads, why didn&#39;t it go where I couldn&#39;t follow?  The are I saw it in was a pretty populated area.<n>

It seemed to have either exploded or &#34;flashed out&#34; of existance at tree level on the west side of the freeway just north of (maybe a quarter of a mile, above a residential neighborhood?) where the Helen Keller Elemntary School is located. The object appeared to be rather large in size, possibly 4-8 feet in circumference. Its&#39;s redish tail, blue in the center, red on the outter edges, and about the same the width of the fireball seemed to be nearly a half mile long. After the flash of sparks, there was no trace of the object in either ligering light or debreis.<n>

I was there  for about a second then vanished with a vertical flash<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had let my kit of Birmingham Rollers out to fly at around 4:30 pm, a predator had begun to chase them and they headed for higher skies(a normal thing when chased) They went up high, approx. 1500 feet, I couldn&#39;t see the color of the birds too well, so I brought out my bino&#39;s to view them better. They turned clock wise to the north and I spotted a metalic shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look at the object and it was semi circle(kind of oval) it looked like a dule chrome and not a constant color, a hazziness to it.  It looked like a circle with a portion of it flat on one side.  It was there for about 1 full second+, not very long at all, then I see this weird flash of that was silverish in color but going vertical on the side of the objects flat side, followed with a small mirror type flash.  When the flash appeared the object was instantaniously gone, I pulled up the bino&#39;s and there was nothing at all up there but blue sky. The object appeared to be up as high as you see airliners cruising by, not sure though.  If it was up that high it would&#39;ve been approximatley 3/4 the size of the airlines wing span. I was by myself but came into the house right after seeing it and told my wife about it, she said sacastically in a jokingly voice &#34;Did they abduct you too?&#34; I have never seen what I would call a UFO before and have been flying Birmingham Rollers most of my life and I&#39;m 30 years old now. I went to work the next day and told an acquaintance there about it, he thought I was kidding for a second, then knew I was sure that I&#39;d seen something.  He said his sister had called him a day earlier and said she&#39;d seen a UFO, but didn&#39;t know any details of it. I&#39;ll send a diagram of what I saw in the mail<n>

I wanted to watch them as they were rolling around but I couldn&#39;t see the colors very were, up about 1500 feet I&#39;d guess.  I put down the bino&#39;s as it was hard to follow them, sore neck. They turned and went northern flying in a counter clockwise turn.  I saw a shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look and it was a semi oval object just sitting there, not moving.  It was like a dule chrome color, but kind of hazy like when you see a jet airline flying by. It might have looked hazy from the reflectivness of the object but not sure? It was only there for a little over a full second then a bright silverish vertical flash appeared(reminded me of something like on star trek, when they transport), followed by a flash similar to a &#34;mirror&#34; flash and it was just gone. I pulled up my bino&#39;s to see if I could see anything in the vicinity and there was absolutely nothing. the object like I said was kind a oval, but more like a circle with one flattened side to it, the flash appeared from this flattened side while it vanished. a guy I work with said his sister had seen a &#34;UFO&#34; the day before i did, this was after I had mentioned to him that I had seen one that he said his sister had mentioned to him a day earlier that she&#39;d seen one.  I haven&#39;t learned the details of her sighting yet. That&#39;s it.<n>

It traveled much faster than an airplane or jet and traveled across the sky from South to North and out of sight in a matter of about 7 seconds.  Just before it disappeared, it changed to a yellow-orange color.<n>

The light dissapated and then through partially cosed vertical blinds, a light entered my room and circled the room. Through the verticle blinds a shadow appeared in the light in the room. The shadow had an elongated head (not long as in high, but as in a sort of football shape) a long thin neck and a thick body. I shadow didn&#39;t move with the light, but through it.  So in otherwords the light behind it was not moving, the shadow was. I thought of more rational possibilities than an extra terrestrial or alien or other life form, whatever your preference in title, but because of the angle of the blinds, I couldn&#39;t justify the way the light moved around the room instead of on one wall. Perhaps this is something to report, or perhaps I need a lesson in light movement?  I&#39;m not ruling either possibility out. when I got the nerve up to look outside, the light had vanished and car alarms were going off. I got back into bed and heard a low level ???hum or ??? - an easier sound to make then to describe - type sound.<n>

Saw blueish green fireball traveling west to east.  Had redish colored tail.  Lasted only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend Emile and myself were going home after work and while driving north through Spencer, IA on US Highway 71, we suddenly saw a bright blueish green colored fireball with a long redish colored tail moving from the west to a northeast direction.  Having grown up in the wideopen spaces of western Nebraska, I have seen many falling stars, but never have I seen anything as large and differently colored as this.  Both my friend and myself were startled and commented to each other that we had never seen anything like that before.  We both thought it was just a meteor but both marveled at the size and color of it. I guess I never gave it a second thought until one night your director was on the Art Bell radio show the other night talking about recent sightings.  He told about the fireballs being reported and the color descriptions matched what I saw so I thought I would look up your sight and let you know what we saw.  I would appreciate it if someone would get back to me and let me know what I might have seen that night.  I have never seen any flying saucers or any other strange things except for this.  I am curious to learn what it was.<n>

It took about eight to ten seconds to cross the sky.  I was at the barn working on my truck.  It is a clear night , no clouds, rain or fog, stars and planes going by.  Then I saw it go by, it went across the sky and over the trees.  I thought it was going to hit but I didn&#39;t hear a crash.  I thought I saw something earlier about 6:15 or so but I thought nothing of it.  I went up to the house and called 911.  1 hour later they called me back and I called you [Peter Davenport].<n>

I was giving her a hard time about always watching when I looked up and there was our &#34;light&#34; friend again. It went back and forth a small distance and sometimes hovered then just disappeared. A couple neightbor kids came over and saw it also, their parents don&#39;t appreciate this. I developed the film from our last sighting and in addition to the lights there are also &#34;steaking&#34; objects that we didn&#39;t origianlly witness with our eyes. IF you live in the Denver area take five or ten minutes every day to look at the sky... you might be surprised....we&#39;ve come to expepct to see them every now and then.<n>

It was so high up in the sky that at first I thought it looked like a star,but it moved in an eradic north easterly direction.  The elevation of the object that I saw was to high for an aircraft. I watched the object for app. 10 min. until my husband came home and looked at it to.  He saw the object when came home and told me he had seen an object similar to it about 6 years ago. We watched the object for a few minutes longer and went inside because it was too cold to stay out and watch the object.<n>

This unidentified airborn object had no tail of debris such as that of a meteor.  It was a bluish white like the light of a xenon strobe. It did not flash, rather it pulsed off like a strobe pulses on.  It looked like a &#34;plasma sphere&#34;.  I have no way to perceive it&#39;s distance nor it&#39;s size.  It was in excess of 2,000 feet away, as it passed behind trees which were at least that far away.  Interestingly, I mentioned this to two other people an hour or so later, and one of them had seen what he described as the same type thing seen at the same time I saw it, yet he was 25 miles East of my location.  For all I know we could have been the same object at some distance, since he and I both saw it in the NNE.<n>

I was on the job at the time and WAS NOT CONSUMING ANYTYPE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS.<n>

The objects didn&#39;t appear to be balloons and were definitely not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed to move independent of each other but at times did move together. They appeared to hover (or hang) in the sky, which led the observers to believe that the objects weren&#39;t aircraft. Balloons were ruled out because no one in our area has a hot air balloon and we&#39;ve never heard of 7 weather balloons being launched at the same time. The objects eventually moved due east, heading out over the ocean. One of the observers managed to videotape the sighting and when he asked his neighbors for their thoughts (they witnessed it as well), they had no idea as to its origin either. Although the observers watched the object by eye and with binoculars for close to 30 minutes, it was nearly impossible to detect any specific features on the objects. For what it&#39;s worth, we typically do not have a lot of helicopter activity in our area. But strangely enough, three days later, one twin-rotor (apparently military-green) and one black high-tech-looking Huey-shaped helicopter circled the same area most of the afternoon until dark.<n>

We were on the property for about an hour checking out the landscape and taking pictures the area.  As you will see by the photo I send, the area is quite peaceful and quiet. As my friend and I were talking he interupted and asked me if I heard something. We heard a faint blowing sound but couldn&#39;t tell what direction it was coming from.  At first we passed it off as a strange wind.  However, a few minutes later the sound suddenly became much louder from behind us. We turned to see this strange object in the sky slowly moving toward the ground.  The closer it came to the ground the more dust it kick up, yet we didn&#39;t see any type of engines or blowers on the object.  The object never did land.  I was able to take two pictures. The first did not show the object. I only assume I was so stunned that I clicked way to fast. The second is the one I will send to you.  After I took the second picture the object became much quieter and in a flash shot straight up in to the sky and dissapeared. The object was perfectly round with several smaller circles on the bottom of it. These smaller circles were somewhat reflective.  My best guess is the object was no more then 25 feet from one side to the other and about 5 to 8 feet high.  The main part was gloss black and the smaller circles were a peach color. My friend and I both grew up in Colorado and have spent a great portion of our adult lives in the mountains of Colorado.  My friend is a top broker at a leading firm and I own a computer related business.  I have never seen anything like this or have given it much thought.  We both have a lot to lose if this was to get out that we &#34;believed&#34; in such things.  The only reason I&#39;m reporting this is because my wife said it might help me close this issue in my mind.  However, I do not want to let anyone who I am other then my name.  If you want to contact me you may do so by my email address only.<n>

Before I start my stories, I have to let you know that I haven’t any even a bit of interest in astronomy when I was still a pupil, but before I recognized what I have seen, I began to pay attention to the dark sky for nearly 10 years. During these years, the curiousness to the universe was energy supporting my work. Well, you may have been out of patient. And I’ll start my own stories about UFO . And there are graphs to illustrate what I say, if you are interested in them, please send Email to me and I&#39;ll send them to you. ((e-address deleted)))  1.When I was a child, about 8 years old (around 1988). It happened in an summer evening when my parents and me were outdoor for cool wind. I noticed that there was a &#34;argent balloon&#34; standing still in the high sky just above our boarding house. It was in the round shape and its side which toward the sun was argent. My parents and some neighbors noticed too. Then, we asked the man living in the top floor to have a look at what to the earth it was, but the man said that it was too high to see clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was dark, the &#34;balloon&#34; still standing here but changed into a very bright star-the brightest star in the sky that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.A unclouded morning in the winter when I was a pupil (around 1990). I got up as usual and when to the bath room to wash my face, then I detected through the windows there was a bright star in the sky. Contrasted against a tree outside the window and between the star and me, it was about waist of the tree. Because, in my memory, I haven’t seen such bright star before, so I kept my eyes on it. About 15 minutes later (The sun shine was just available that moment), it has been moved up to the top of the tree. And in the next minute, all for a sudden, the bright light disappeared and there was a ball (at least I think it like a ball, because of the distance) floating in the sky (a little big than I saw in story 1, maybe it because of the different distance). And in the second minutes, there were something like glinting lights looked like the lights beneath airplane began glinting on the bottom of the ball. At first, one white light, than, one blue light, and two white lights, two blue lights. More and more lights glinted alternate, meanwhile, the ball began to movie faster and faster toward the East-directed to the Sun. Until it was out of my sight, there were approximate 3 seconds, then the ball reached a astonishing speed that was much more faster than any plane I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.Years later(I’m a student in junior high school ), one morning I got up at 6:00 and sat down on my desk to prepare for my final examination. A familiar scene-the brightest star standing around the moon. For it I haven been prepared a pair of telescope, but I can’t see anything else but a bright ball. But I took notice of the distance of the star and the moon: fortunately, there was a smaller star beside the moon, and through the telescope the moon and the smaller star just like a background picture of the bright star-caused by distance. Obviously, the bright one was in the atmosphere. I kept observing it for about 5 minutes, during the time, it was quiescent. But 2 minutes later when I return to the window, it has been disappeared. I realized something and look toward the East-the Sun just rose up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.Maybe the UFO will visit me in every certain years. I met it again when I was a senior high school student. Morning, after I got my school, I found every one in the school was looking in the sky. Then I discovered there was a huge &#34;earthen plate&#34; floating in the sky! I can’t believe what I saw! It looked like a plate and there was a small circle on the central of the plate. Slowly, I move toward the shining Sun in the East, and in the end was covered by the Sun light. It was reported in the newspaper and some astronomer explain that it was formed by the ash from collision of two minor planets in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m 21 and is an academician now. These usual experiences gave me spiritual energy to study science. And now, I want to share my stories with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) 2003.12.30  (wee hours)  2:20<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were just aproaching a small town called Hollymount with about 5 miles more until we would arrive home. I was having a conversation with my mother when I saw her staring at the sky. Suddenly something also caught my attention. It was like the headlights of an oncoming car,but it wasn&#39;t a car. It was an object to the right of the moon,slightly larger than the north star and brighter. It was round and looked like a small sphere. First we thought it was the north star but it began to move.  It was very shakey and unstable looking. Then I saw another object approaching it ,a plane. The sphere had being hovering in one place but as the plane got nearer the sphere began to move again. It moved from side to side quickly. It began to rise to the left. At this stage the plane was very near. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards to the right until we lost sight of it. The plane continued to follow the object but in a straight line until we also lost sight of that. We have being in great shock since witnessing the object and would love to know what we saw.<n>

She observed three silvery blue objects,each with two orange C-Shaped formations extending from the sides. The three objects were in a trinangular configuration. The report from Mosinee,10/1/98, describes the same type object seen by my wife. She had the objects in view for approx. 7 minutes. The three discs remained motionless for the duration of sighting. She exited the highway still observing the three discs. Her view of the objects was momentarily blocked by trees upon turning onto the road to our home. When her view was unobstructed she looked back for the objects but they had vanished. My five year old daughter also saw the the objects. She asked if they were ghosts in the sky. This sighting visibly scared my wife, who up until this sighting, has never reported seeing any such phenomena.<n>

One object shot off at extreme speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am filing this report in behalf of my family as follows; Four white completely silent objects were seen northeast of 64th. St and Peak View Rd. Cave Creek, Az. at 6:40 P.M.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 20 minutes and was witnessed by 4 people ages 20,  (daughter)48(wife), 71(mother in law), and 72(father in law). The objects appeared approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and were initially spaced approximately 1 foot apart at arms length as they   moved about randomly in the same general area. The objects were at different altitudes initially then one object began to descend slowly. During descent the object became very bright (appeared to become larger).  The objects seemed to take turns descending and rising. While observing one object, another instantly appeared appeared next to it (seemed to come from knowhere). There were no other lights associated with each object (only one light source). One observer stated that when the objects lowered the light changed it shape to become somewhat pointed on the top and bottom and thicker in the middle. The same observer indicated that the size of the objects were about the same size as a standard household lightbulb at about 150 ft. distance. Another characteristic of the objects is that they would become dimmer when moving but becomming noticeably brighter when hovering or descending. Two of the observers reported that one of the objects shot off at an extreme speed almost too fast to follow at an approximate 30 degree angle upward and disappeared. No aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. All observers are of sound mind and have stated that they have never seen anything as bizzare as this.  We all frequently see aircraft landing lights for all types of aircraft since we are north of Scottsdale airport, Deer Valley Airport, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airport but these objects were distinctly different not only in appearance but movement. This writer is a company Vice President, Aerospace Engineer, and licensed pilot and very experienced with many different types of military and commercial aircraft and aviation technology in general. I interviewed each observer to obtain as accurate an account as possible.  I personally missed the sighting by approximately 10 minutes when returning from work.<n>

My friend saw it simultaneously and jokingly asked if it was a UFO.  It moved very slowly yet was not stationary.  I commented that if it was...&#34;Beam me up, Scotty.  There&#39;s no signs of intelligent life here.&#34;  We laughed about it and didn&#39;t give it a second thought.  However in retrospect it defies logical explanation in terms of a conventional aircraft.  We both work at a retirement community as a nurse (myself) and a nurses&#39; aide.   The above description  is as accurate as I can be  except for the &#34;fins&#34; on the side...they were more like jug handle in shape but not separate from the actual body but tight against it and also covered with lights...barely destinct from the body of the object but noticable due to the shape not being a continuous oval/circle becase of them.<n>

It had a dull &#34;glow&#34; about it, and stars in the background DIDNOT disappear (but dimmed)  when it passed between me and those stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Riding my motorcycle home from work, I noticed the haze of a nebula (?) below the belt of the constelation Orion.  When I got home I took out my small telesope and sat on my back porch and focused on that nebula, then started just looking around the sky without the scope.  I was looking practically straight up when I saw this object come into view from the over the top of a tall tree that is in the yard.  When I focused my eyes on the object, I couldn&#39;t understand what it was.  It didn&#39;t look solid, but rather like a thin cloud.  I watched it travel south, for about a 5 seconds then turn east just for a couple of seconds.  It then turned back south and continued in a straight line.  I jumped off my porch to get to the side of the house where I could  still observe the object and watch until I lost it in the tree line from neighbor&#39;s trees.  When I first noticed the object (straight up) it looked like a cloud that you could see through.  After I observed it turn east then south, I specifically watched for it to pass between me and a star.  When it did,  the star light did not blink off, but dimmed instead.  There was no sound of any wind, but the object was very high in the sky.  What made me think it was not a cloud was that when it turned 90 degrees (twice), it maintained the same quarter moon shape.<n>

After star-gazing for 10-15 minutes my eyes were pretty well adjusted. I had seen only one high altitude jet and no shooting stars or satellites.  I was laying on a cot flat on my back inside a built up commercial/residential area with high background light level.  Very faint cumulus clouds, widely dispersed were present, but not in the section directly overhead where the objects were observed.  Sky was otherwise clear and stars particularly bright this evening.  I observed 12-15 objects travelling at a constant velocity and direction, very nearly due south. Their luminosity was equal among them and remained constant until obscured by tall trees nearby. Color was dim orange/gold. Objects were no more than points of light.  I would estimate the arc they traversed in approximately 6 seconds was no more than 35-40 degrees.  Objects were in a roughly U-shaped formation with the closed end leading. There were no sounds as there had been with the jet earlier.  Size of formation would comparable to 2 finger widths at arms length.<n>

I thought they were helecopters until I was right on them. I pulled over for a minute to watch. They did&#39;nt make a sound. They appeared to be black but it was dark. This is not the only time I saw the crafts eithier. I saw them two other times near the same place. The Huntsville area in North Alabama is home to Redstone Arsenal, which is the home of the US Army Missle Command and Marshall Space Flight Center NASA.

The craft rotated constantly. It was nothing like I have ever seen before. Two airplanes flew over the mysterious object. My parents stared in awe, they called my brother. (Which he stared at it in amazement.) The thing also had a grayish aura around it. Its lights were orange, it&#39;s color was silver metallic. After that, it continued it&#39;s course east.<n>

This craft was large, sort of grayish black colored and appeared to have grid lines like graph paper on it along with port holes along the middle. It dropped down from the dark cloud bank and I could see the turbulance it was causing in the cloud. The thing seemed to change shape and was moveing fast but not faster then a  jet air liner. I couldent understand why it was so soundless. After it crossed in front of me I floored my car  so I could see it go away. Well the thing was now moveing directly away from me and it looked very thin as all I could see was a vertical line now. Man I was so excited to get home because it looked like it went right over my house but when I got there no one was home. Well my pulled in about a min later and I was pissed that she dident see it and my son started laughing at me. I thought there would be some thing on the news but nothing was said.

I was told that it could be mapping satelites or reflections of some kind from distant cities or cars off the atmosphere or ionosphere. I am no astronomer so bare with me.

The direction I was facing is southwest.  A very bright phosphorous green light attracted my attention as it appeared in the sky southwest of Vancouver, WA and came down to earth quickly in what I think was a northwest direction.  The light had a slight northern slant (almost vertical) to it and was visible for three to five seconds.I am not sure whether it just abruptly left my area of vision or whether the treetops obscured my view. The light was a very bright phosphorous green. I don&#39;t believe that it was a meteor because of its slow speed. My immediate thought was fireworks but it was too large and didn&#39;t go UP in my field of vision because I would have seen that, too.`<n>

The sun was just rising to my left. As I took A drink of my coffee I noticed a large shape to my right, approx 100 yds away.   I pulled my car over and rolled my windows down to see if I could hear anything.  I couldn&#39;t. I turned my car off to hear better, still no noise. This &#34;craft&#34; was about the size of 2 maybe 3 city buses put together from my estimation.  I noticed that the object was in the shape of a saucer. Its top and bottom sections remained still while the center section moved. The whole thing was very dark but also very distinctive.  I could still not hear anything at this point.  The craft was just above the tree line as there was a small forested area right underneath it. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  The hair on the back of my neck actually rose. At this point I had seen enough so I started my car.  At this point my eyes remain fixed on this object.  As I start my car this object starts to move silently but very slow at first.   As we all know headlght come on automatically on new cars.  I put my car in gear and slowly started to move.  At this point the center section of the craft started to spin faster(still no noise) and as I was watching what was appening the craft was gone in the blink of an eye.  It took off so fast it was almost like it left a streak behind it.  This really flipped me put by this point..  I have never told anyone because I thought nobody would belive me ..I will swear on the BIBLE that I have seen this ans I&#39;m a catholic...

It had a matte charcoal surface  And their were rows of circular lights on the bottom. I could see a radio tower and it was over and higher than the tower.  I could see the tower and the red lights but there was nothing but air below the object in the sky.  And as for it being Venus, planets are not that large<n>

I quickly realised that this was not the case as this flame colored, perfectly round object was growing larger, rather than getting smaller. This object continued to grow larger and brighter, maintaining its perfectly round shape. I was alone at the beach but there were approximately six to eight people nearby, and I looked to see if the others were seeing this object, they were watching it as I was. This object grew to the approximate size that a silver dollar would appear when held at arms length. (Its size increasing probably 500 percent during the event lasting maybe two minutes.) Then this object vanished completely in a fraction of a second, it did not fade out, it was big and bright in the daylight sky one second, and totally gone the next second. Within one minute of this object vanishing, those of us on the beach were buzzed by a low flying military helicopter. I do not know whether this was a coincidence, or some sort of message to those of us who had observed this, but this helicopter flew directly over us at no more than 150 feet in the air. I did not speak to any of the other witnesses on the beach with me, because for some reason nearly everyone there immediately started packing up their belongings to leave right after the helicopter flew over, and for reasons that I cannot explain I too left, although my normal course of action, as it seems to me now would have been to stay and watch a little longer to see if this object reappeared, but I left with an uneasy feeling that I cannot explain.<n>

I think it was about the size of a BB held at arms length.I got a good look at it. It moved so fast I could hardly follow it with my eyes.

I&#39;m guessing that it was within a 1000 feet because of the doppler effect that I&#39;m used to from other craft fly by while approaching the airport.  I saw a car chasing it down the street like a bat out of hell.  The sound was traveling from east to west and the craft appeared to hover in a stationary manner over the lake for the better part of a minute and was was giving off an intense gold light that was dispersed by the fog above the water.  The engine sound was very smooth and almost sounded musical with just a hint of a regular pulse.  The tone could be likened to a number of square waves all tuned to different spectrums that would modulate independently of one another by just +/- 5 or 12 Hz.  The regular pulse was occuring at the rate of about 120 beats per second was was very faint.  This thing didn&#39;t have the slightest hint of a jet engine, prop or blade.  I live near an airport so I know the airplanes in the area.  This was not one of them.<n>

It at first went down and to the right from Orion, then began moving down towards the horizon, but in a side to side swaying motion.  Possibly it was moving in a helix pattern downward (or away?).  My friend was excited and ran back in the house to get two others, but by the time they came back out it was gone.  3 of us saw it, 2 missed it.  It seemed to be quite far away, and was no brighter than an average star.  Synchronistically, it did happen after i&#39;d been telling them all about ufo&#39;s and other strange phenomena.

It was NOT the shape of the Stelth bomber. It was a 90 degree V with no middle area. It was siluated against the evening sky. My estimate of its size may seem funny but, if you  could see a passenger jet low enough in the sky to have a look of being about 3 inches across its wing tip to wing tip, would be close. It made no sound and had no lights and moved very slow from southeast to northwest. It seamed to have heat wave around it like something being hot. We also saw a figure like that about 2 weeks later moving from south to north but much higher in the sky and had a goldish glow to it and probably moved over the house in about 3 seconds. Very fast and very high.I have watched and looked at photos and writings and have not ever found a picture, drawing or writing like this thing we saw.

The brightest is in the  western sky and looks like a very bright star. What distinguishes it from a star is that it bobs and moves periodically; it exhibits an purposely changeing radiance (decidedly more ray-like than eminance) and there is a blinking white light apart from the main star body. Positioned at about 11 o&#39;clock is a single blue green ray; fixed in position and length. The rest of the rays once again, seem to shift and change. To the casual observer it would appear as a bright star. The other 4 objects are also star like though not as bright (possibly due to being further away) and display an artificial  &#34;wagon wheel&#34;- like radiance. This experience is available to anyone in the bay area all night, every night. They are clearly wanting to appear as fixed stars even while waivering some. The one bluegreen ray and the periodiodically blinking light just off to the upper right and the waivering just won&#39;t allow for real star status. I am quite frankly surprised that there haven&#39;t been a rash of reports on this. It is once again quite astounding in that the entire Bay area has regular nightly access to a genuine sighting every night. One need only venture out and take a close look at the brightest &#34;star&#34; in the lower western sky to find that it is in fact an altogether wondrous non-star.<n>

The shape was fluctuating until after it crossed the road Then it appeared to have the shape of a &#34;Bird Of Prey&#34; (the Klingon warships fromStar Trek) is the only way I could describe it. then I realized it was being flanked by a regular jet airplane, military in nature, following to the right and just behind the object. They both disappered over the mountainous horizon. Both were traveling VEry fast, there was no sound at all and there were other cars on the road, I couldn&#39;t have been the only one who saw it, It was HUGE! So huge it dwarfed the little fight jet that was accompying it.<n>

I am a pragmatist, based in our known realities of scientifically proven facts, but what I saw was most tangibly real...even my dog stopped and looked up at this item.  I decided to report this today after reading about the police in southern Illinois who gave descriptions very similar to my own. At age 47, on or about the 15th of October, 1998, (may have been 10/10-10/27), I took our Cairn Terrier outside for her last &#34;potty break&#34; between 10:31 and 10:37 pm.  My spouse had gone to bed just minutes earlier.  It was a very mild, clear, star-filled evening.  As I stood looking at the beauty of the stars, facing a slight northwesterly direction, an enormous flying craft appeared--almost as if it had been &#39;Star Wars-like uncloaked&#39;. I was immediately struck by it&#39;s seeming closeness to the earth, it&#39;s relative silence, and it&#39;s almost COMICAL display of two huge single-row banks of lights on either side of it&#39;s triangularish front---it looked almost exactly like the row of lights on police cars in these colors: red, clear and blue.  My next thought was: &#34;well, if this is a secret USA project, they sure want to be seen!&#34;.  It was close enough for me to wonder if those inside would wave at me. As this object approached, I choose to stay and watch what would probably be a once-in-a-lifetime experience instead of getting a witness.  As this seemingly slow and quiet craft approached our property, I tried to gauge it based upon a 40-50 ft. tall pine tree in the next yard.   My mind was trying to move fast to get a size estimate.  With it&#39;s unusual shape, it was difficult.  Nor do I possess the advanced physics/mathematical skills to measure items based upon horizon/angle, etc.  To me: this item was rather symmetrical, i.e., width from widest point-to-widest-point appeared to be 150-200 feet; front-to-rear, perhaps 200-250 ft, based upon it&#39;s distance from the pine tree&#39;s top and width of view it took up in my line of vision.  Our city block is approximately 250 feet long, and each lot facing our street is 150 feet deep.  I believe this object, if on the ground, would have just about filled the property space of one-half of our entire block--perhaps more.  I remember won! dering why anything so huge would risk flying this low so near to 4 electric company smoke stacks located on the waterfront of our city. Description: first impression: a triangle.  When I was directly underneath it, my next impression was: pentagon with a flair; my last impression: pentagon with enough of a flair to be considered an arrowhead.  Rear of craft as it was flying SE, away from me over Lake Michigan: flat rear/slight sides to main body, just like the back end of an arrowhead. Other descriptive items:  as it passed over me, I thought I detected some type of circles on the bottom of the craft; the bottom of the craft was the darkest part of my visual experience.  As the craft first came toward me, I was fascinated by the banks of lights--what appeared to be rather halogenic red/clear/blue....but then I noticed that there was a beacon light on the top of the portruding &#34;cabin&#34;.  This craft DEFINITELY had a curved cabin with either windows or perhaps black reflective surfaces.  However, this cabin was NOT sharp-angled like the stealth bomber type.  This cabin seemed proportionate to the rest of the object, i.e., it was not a small bump in the middle of a disk.  This craft was not a &#34;thick&#34; craft...at least it did not appear so to me from the front/bottom/rear views I had of it as it almost silently cruised toward/over/away from me. Behavior of Craft:  seemingly &#34;slow cruising&#34;; it did a flat bank from it&#39;s more southerly direction of travel to a southeasterly direction and it did this RIGHT over my head, i.e.,our street runs perpendicular to lake michigan on a slight NE/SW angle, so when I was watching this craft go directly away from me after it passed overhead, it had to be traveling in a slight southeasterly direction over Lake Michigan (I believe a straight-line shot across Lake Michigan would have placed it in Indiana/Ohio eventually?--it did the bank directly over my head; at no time did this object exude any type of exhaust/exhaust noise--only a low humming.  We experience many helicopters flying overhead here.  If one takes a typical Flight-For-Life type helicopter on a scale of 1 to 10 for noise, with the helicopter&#39;s noise being a &#34;10&#34;, then this craft, many times the helicopter&#39;s size, was barely a &#34;1 to 2&#34; in noise level.  At one point, it felt as though I could almost reach out and touch, it! seemed so close to me. Other Characteristics:  Nothing struck me as it being &#34;out of this world wierd&#34; except it&#39;s enormous size and quiet functioning, and two bizarre banks of &#34;cop car gumball&#34; lights.  This object seemed to have a dull body surface in a darker color, i.e., it was not silver/white/red/blue/green/purple/orange, etc.  It was, perhaps gray/brown/black.<n>
10/15/98 22:30|Dublin (south of)|IN|Diamond|1 minute|One diamond shaped aircraft in the sky west of Richmond,Indiana flying from the SE to the NW in October, 1998.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34014.html|118|ndxe199810| One diamond shaped aircraft in the sky west of Richmond,Indiana flying from the SE to the NW in October, 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October, 1998,I was at a cookout with 7 friends,at a rural home generally south of Dublin, Indiana. Dublin sits on US 40 west of Richmond,Indiana. At about 22:30 hours we observed a diamond shaped aircraft approach our location from the SW, flying generally NE. No outside lights other than farm security lights were in the area and none were very bright. There was a full moon. For about one hour prior to this observation we had been watching a red light in the sky SE of our location go up and down in an acrobatic fashion, diving and climbing rapidly and performing turning motions. That light was in the general direction of Connersville, Indiana. The diamond shaped craft approached from the SW. Our conclusion as to the shape was based on lights on four &#34;corners&#34; of the craft. There were several lights and they appeared to be on the ends of the &#34;wings&#34; but they were not bright enough to illuminate the craft or  the &#34;wings&#34; Most were white but none were flashing strobe lights. The craft flew almost directly over our location at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. What struck us was the lack of any engine noise. It was absolutely silent.We did not hear its approach and it made no noise as it passed over us. It flew to the NE generally in the direction of Richmond, Indiana or slightly to the west of that city. It was visible for about one minute. Our conclusion was that it was a military aircraft because of our relative proximity to Dayton, Ohio and Wright Patterson Air Force base.Our host told us that he had seen similar objects in the night sky many times before. His home is no closer than 1/2 mile to any other residence and the sky is very dark. There is very little light pollution from Indianapolis 50 miles to the west or from Richmond 20 miles or so to the east.I am retired military and familiar with aircraft identification procedures.The other guests were all adults about 45-55 years old. We were all sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After about ten minutes, the &#34;light&#34; suddenly dove into the ground (so it seemed), it disappeared from our view at the same high rate of speed, going straight down.  Within a very short time we saw and heard two jet aircraft in that same area.  Being ex-military, I recognized the engine sounds as being probably F-15&#39;s  (they constantly flew training missions over our house, we got used to their engine sounds).  The two jets were travelling fast and low over the same area the light had been.  As they passed, the light came up from under them and followed them out of sight to the East, just below and behind them. Witnesses:  ((personal data deleted))<n>

A light appeared at 10 o&#39;clock which caught my attention because it looked to be an aircraft coming in for a landing. The problem with that was that Cleveland Hopkins Airport was 10 miles west of my position. I was traveling at 60 mph and the light maintained its 10 0&#39;clock position throughout the sighting. It was a clear night and having lived within 5 miles of Hopkins Airport for the last 33 years I know what a plane looks like at night. As the craft passed overhead I heard no sound and could only make out six perfectly round, bright lights arranged in a circle. I did not see it land, but in 33 years of watching airplanes I never say a light configuration like this.<n>

It was dark that night, but we had a clear sky. I could tell i had very large fields on both sides and up ahead i could see a tree line about a mile ahead. All of a sudden i saw bright lights moving through the trees and thought it was a car, but when the lights went upward i knew it wasn&#39;t. As the lights came above the trees, i saw a faint out line and for a moment thought it was a huge airplane, but when i got close i saw it was a huge triangular ship hovering slowly above the trees about 100 feet. The ship was black and as big as a football stadium. My Heart leaped in my throat when i saw it and i edged over to the side of the highway to watch it. There were no other vehicles around so i turned off my truck to see if i could hear anything and it was deathly quiet. Absolutely no noise. Then one of it&#39;s bright lights, which were in each corner of the ship, rotated downward and was spotlighting the field as it passed over the trees and then above the field. It traveled very slow in a southward direction and finally slowly disappeared over the horizon. I started my truck back up and proceeded to head on towards Enterprise. On my way i met a few other truckers and asked them over the CB if they had seen any strange lights, but to my surprise not one person had seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I noticed the object as it was heading directly towards the horizon at a perpindicular angle.  The object was at about 40 degrees above the horizon when I noticed it.  The fireball was about 4 times the size of Jupiter currently in the Southern sky and brighter than a full winter moon.  The inner core of the object was a very bright white and the larger corona was a very intense blue-green color.  The tail was seperated from the object and was also blue-green with shades of yellow and red.  I-495 is the mega-highway that encircles the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and is extremely well lit.  Usually, no object in the night sky can be ascertained from the beltway due to the overhead lights.  I was very surprised to see a fireball in such a highly populated area.  But, I assume that I would not have seen it had it not been so bright and large.<n>

I had come home from a long day at school and discovered I had to run into town to pick up something to prepare for dinner. I got about a half a mile down the road and glanced up into the sky at my right and saw a bright shiney silver object suspended in the sky. Close enough I could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane or even shaped like one for that matter. It was shaped like a disk with a well rounded egg in the middle. I went home after going to the store and reported the event to my husband, and I was laughed at. So I summed it up to being delusional due to lack of sleep. It wasn&#39;t until a saw a special on tv last week on UFO&#39;S that I decided to tell someone. At that time they showed the exact same object as I saw, which in away convinced me I&#39;m not crazy. And ever since I witnessed the object hovering, strange things have been happening around my house electrical apliances coming on for no reason etc... E mail me if youre intrested in hearing more. I wouldn&#39;t swear this event happened in Oct. My life moves in semesters and all I know for sure is it was last semester.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The West bound object started to get obscurred by the bright sunshine and was never seen again that we could see after about 3 minutes it headed toward the West. Visability was cear and unlimited and not a breeze of wind to be felt. I did take a look at the objects with magnified eye pieces and thought i would clearly see a high alltitude weather balloon but thiis was not the case.  There appeared to be sorta like shock waves given off by the objects and every second they would go from a oval circle shape to a football shape of form. No aircraft of any kind was seen during this 1 hour period viewing these objects. Louisville Internatioal airport is about 15 miles due south of were we observed these objects and was very busy taking incoming and out going flights till the objects seem to be in the air space of this airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End Of Sighting...…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I observed this intermittantly as we slowly moved with the traffic down cumberland. It was a hazy or overcast day is the only reason we noticed it because it appeared to be a gray matallic color and stood out against the background of the sky. I estimate its size at approx. 3 feet thick and about 12 feet in length. I am writing this 4 years later and i cannot remember exact date. Size and distance are my best guess only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked to see what appeared to be a small, white fireball streaking a bit in the sky. It burned out within 3 or 4 seconds. I looked closely to determine any residual smoke, I saw none. I scanned the area at hand, a suburban street, for nearby power lines and found none. The fireball was an isolated incident in the sky, accompanied by no other perceptable phenomenea. The duration of the event and the nature of the fireball made it difficult to perceive an altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky in my area is vary dark because only a few houses were built at this time.Just as i was focusing on the orb it accelerated perpendicularly from the ground faster than anything i have seen in the sky .i am an ex KC-10 and KC-135 mechanic from MARCH AFB.

There is very good fishing in these corries and thats what attracted us there.  We fished this particular one alot that summer and fall.  We were sitting on the bank not saying much.  Infact i remember just looking around me because its kind of an erie place.  theres alot of wild animals so i would always keep a watch out. my buddy was smoking a cigarette staring out over the lake.  I looked up and just above the lake there was triangle shape figure hovering motionless above the lake.  The object was only approximatly 3-400 yards away from us and maybe 100-120 yards above the water. The object was the most odd looking blueish color ive ever seen.  It was like a neon blue but it wasnt very bright.  I was so in aww of the object i remember looking at my buddy, he had this wierd look on his face like he couldnt believe what he was looking at.  I quickly looked back to the object.  I couldnt say a word.  The object hovered there for about 10 seconds, we didnt say a work.  Then very slowly it began to move.  It was heading toward the south side of the lake.  All of the sudden it began to increase speed very quickly and within a second or 2 it completely dissapeared.  We both looked at each other and said what in the hell was that?  We were both very frightend.  We imediatly decied to pack up out stuff and leave.  We were very skeptical to speak of the incident at work, because we knew people would laugh and think we were crazy, so we just told family and friends.  Another note, as the object darted away it moved so fast it left a trail of light that lasted maybe a second, but it looked weird. the object also made no noise at all it was completly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I was standing looking at the stars when I saw what I thought were twin shooting starts far in the eastern sky.  But the &#34;stars&#34; stopped their decent and then came heading toward us in a slow manner.  As they continued heading west...I was amazed.  I told my husband that he had to come and see this. They seem to float through the sky...oval in shape or like two flat bowls glued together...they were a glowing orange, almost seemed translucent.  No sound was heard and they continue into the west.  I moved to the front of the porch so I could watch them further.  They headed into the the western sky and mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were enjoying the evening at a local bed and breakfast on the corner of 1st street and 5th avenue in Tucson, I was standing watching the stars.  I observed what I though were two shooting stars in the eastern sky.  I thought that was quite strange to have two shooting stars, following the same decent.  Before they reached the horizon they came toward the west. As they came closer...I told my husband the come here...he needed to see this.  We watched as they continued on toward the west.  There were two oval (like two flat bowls glued together) and flying side by side with slight movement from side to side.  They seemd to be glowing orange from the inside. There were no lights to be seen on them. Since we observed lots of airplanes from the Tucson Airport and the Air Force base and helicopters during our stay...we can say objectively they were not commercial aircraft.  It is hard to judge the distance and heighth they were, but they didn&#39;t seem to be extremely distant.  They continued into the the western sky and into the mountains. My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Tucson and we reside in Malaysia.  We are American citizens.  My husband is ex-navy and I am an artist.  I am 49 and my husband is 52.  I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenom, but have never observed one.  And my husband is a skeptic.  His comment was &#34; I don&#39;t know what they were, but I have never seen anything like it before.&#34;  The next day I was relating the story to our daughter.  Her comment was &#34; Mom, we see them all the time in the night skies here.  We don&#39;t pay any attention anymore because it is so common!&#34; I didn&#39;t know there was a national reporting center until I did some research on the net.<n>

I witnessed what appeared to be a &#34;falling star&#34; directly North of me that suddenly separated into three objects that looked as if the meteor broke up on entry.  the three objects then came back into one and the object stopped and just did nothing, then faded out.  About two minutes later I saw a dim object N. by N.W. of my location travelling back and forth horizontally.  Suddenly five &#34;fireballs&#34; were ejected downward and disappeared suddenly.  The object stopped for about a second, then travelled in a N.W. direction at about a 90 degree angle and emitted another 6 &#34;fireballs&#34; in rapid succession that also appeared to fall downward.  the object then disappeared from my view.  I then got on I-15 Southbound and at about 8:15 PM saw a bright light off to my right at mile marker 85; it was stationary and increased in brightness for maybe 2 seconds and then dissipated.  At approximately 8:25 PM. I saw four Fighter planes from Nellis AFB pursuing a rapid course in the direction in which the objects were spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other information that comes to mind is that when I initially thought I was Witnessing a meteor coming into our atmosphere, the object had a very yellow hue to it, as opposed to a more white hue associated with such objects.  The other witnesses were: a person who pulled off the road to witness the event, as well as, three truckers who were pulled over on I-15 looking up in the vicinity of the incident.<n>

My friend thought that it might have droped behind the horizon but we both agreed that the horizon (Curve of the earth), was well above the point of entry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much like above, except the thing seemed to have a &#34;V&#34; like shape almost like a delta wing, but white green.  It was to dark at the point of impact to see if there was much spray coming off the ocean, but it must have done something.  There was a strong wind that followed shortly afterward and we both felt it.  Then nothing, now we are used to ocean breezes but this was much more and only lasted a second or two. I have never seened anything like this before.<n>

Very hard to focus on it because of &#34;shimmering surface&#34; and low light conditions. (looking west down shoreline) I stared at it non stop for about 10 minutes while casting into lake and of course, I hooked a fish. After landing fish I looked up to find it GONE. No sound no nothing. I returned multiple times to same area, time, light conditions, never to see anything like it again.  It reminded me of a surfacing submarine at first thought,but water much too shallow. I estimate its size to be approximately 10 feet high with a conical shaped top, about 8 feet in diameter with its bottom un seen or flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

During its flight, it made numerous odd flight changes, including bouncing up and down like a ball. It also changed shapes, including separating into 3 individual lights. At one point it seemed to change into a mist like form, but was still illuminated and visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on a fishing trip at Heron lake in Northern New Mexico, I witnessed a strange light rise very quickly above what appeared to be the Taos area, in the East from where we were. The light was constantly changing colors from green to red to white to blue. I thought it was a military helicopter because they are always up in that part of the wood, but then it shot straight towards us, real fast like. We&#39;re talking 100 miles of ground between Taos and Heron, and that thing zipped it in thousands of a second. It stopped like almost over the lake, but must have been up around 8,000 feet or so. It continued to hover in place and change color for approx. 10 minutes or so. At this point I woke my daughter to see the UFO, cause it was almost 3am by this time and my fishing party was all bedded down for the night. We sat and watched and even tried to wake the others, but they dismissed me as being drunk or tired or something, which I was not. I continued to fish and to watch this THING, and we began to talk about it, when it started to change. It slowly seemed to vaporize. It turned into a cloud, but was still illuminated and was quite visible. It stayed in this form for about 5 minutes or so and then became one solid light again. At this point my daughter got scared and went back inside the camper, she&#39;s only 8yrs old, and this was something that really struck her as odd. I reeled in my fishing line and just sat there letting the fire die and watching alone when the thing started bouncing up and down at a very fast rate. It resembled a rubber ball, just bouncing up and down for at least 4 or 5 minutes and then stopped. Then it started to go from side to side, back and forth, at what seemed the same distance of travel each time for about the same duration of time as before. Now I was becoming scared, and was putting my gear away, when it stopped and then split into three separate lights, and formed a triangle and remained motionless for what seemed 15 minutes. I smothered the fire and sat in the door way of the camper and watched as it re-shaped into one solid light again. Now it was close to 3:30 am or so and when I got up to go inside, it shot off towards the West towards Dulce New Mexico, about another 40 miles or so. That was the last I saw of it, when it positioned over Taos before I went to bed. This is the 3rd strange object I personally have seen in this area, and is the longest viewing and strangest of all my encounters while in this wilderness area.<n>

We were traveling down Leicester Hwy and saw a red ball of light.  It was in the western sky.  We pulled over to the Ingles parking lot and called my wife on the cell phone to look outside from our house and see if she could see it.  By this time approx. 18 cars pulled in around me to look at the object.  None of us could figure it out.  The light would move up and down left and right slowly.  My wife grabed our dogs and got in the car headed for us.  She said the dogs started wailing like they were hurting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she got to us the dogs would not come out of the car and huddled in the floor board.  When we tryed to pick them up they were stiff, as if they were scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More people including 2 Asheville Police cars pulled into the Ingles parking lot to view the object.

This object made absolutely no sound even though it would seem by the size of this object and the speed it was going that it would make some kind of sound.  We at first thought that it was a meteor, but the ones that we had seen it the past had never been so bright green. The object passed over our heads and disappeared behind the mountains (near the Acadia National Park area).  We were very surprised and had never seen anything like this before.  This object seemed very close although we could not precisely judge the distance.  This object was so bright that when it disappeared behind the mountains, it left a huge silouette of the mountains behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright green.  No sounds, lights or sparks were seen coming from the object.  It passed from ahead of us literally over our heads then disappeared behind the mountains in back of us.  The object left no trail behind it which seemed odd to us considering the speed. The object was spherical in shape.  My friend Steve is a student in Bangor, Maine presently studying broadcasting.  I am a nationally registered EMT and working on a unit part-time while continuing my education at Southern Maine Technical College.<n>

Lights appeared to be flashing at one point.  It is not any known air craft, helicoptor, or tower of any sort.  It is too high, remembering that it is below the clouds.

Colors were green over yellow over red.  Disappeard, then reappeared west of original location.  Flashing at some points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sighting was at 20:30 central time.  Object was located in north eastern sky line.  Description of object:  Possible shpere shaped; top section first appeared green, center is yellow, lower section glowed red.  After watching the object with binoculars, it had &#34;drifted&#34; to the east.  Then it seemed to have disappeared.  Reappeared (possibly even another craft, unlikely) west of the original position.  Approximately 30 minutes later the object rotated clockwise.  The red glowing section pointed northwest, while the green section seemed to have vanished.  The majority of the object seemed to be yellow at this point.  The yellow pointed south east towards the ground.  Eventually it rotated back.  It then seemd to have &#34;drifted&#34; back to its original sighting position.  Rotated a 90 degree angle clockwise, then went straight up higher into the atmosphere.  It went back to the original colors green on yellow on red (rotated back).  Watching it longer, I noticed something was &#34;dropped&#34; suddenly from it.  I saw it fall for not even a second and then it disappeared.  The object has sat in that one position for several hours now.  It is currently 03:31 on 10/12/98.<n>

I noticed what looked exactly like sunlight reflecting off a shiny airplane, except that it was moving way too fast.  If it were an airplane, it was at a VERY high altitude, judging from the relative size.  It appeared to split in two, attempted to rejoin, and grew fainter as it neared the horizon and vanished.  It was moving almost perfectly due East.  All this occured in ten seconds or less. It was a clear sunny day, with no major fronts moving through.<n>

I stared at it trying to identify it, but could not. It was moving slowly westbound, at (my estimate)about 25,000 feet. I went in to get my binoculars, but when I came out, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned in my summary, this object was not something that I could identify. It seem to have some metallic components because it did reflect the sunlight. It also had a strange movement, like drifting and yawing at the same time. What amazes me the most is that it was not there when I came back, about a minute after. At the pace it was moving, it should have been there still. I immediately called the San Juan Flight Services Station, to find out if they had seen something in the vicinity with their primary radar. They offered me your number instead. I place a call and left a message in the answering machine, but I erroneously reported the time of the event as 1605Z, instead of 1805 which is correct. I later called the San Juan Center (CERAP) to check if they had any information that could confirm or explain my sighteen, but they said it was difficult to check their recordings and data bases and to get something usefull from there. One more thing, the object was in the vicinity of the Dorado Beacon (DDP) which is an NDB used as reference for IFR flights inbound to Puerto Rico. I am a private pilot and I can tell you, what I saw was not an airplane or a rotorcraft.<n>

I was 1/2 way home when I saw 3 very bright lights in a triangle formation high in the WSW sky and I thought it was a new type of landing light system (flying school nearby).  As they got closer they seemed to be slowley heading towards me and they seemd to merge and became one very intense oval shape - I glanced at my watch (police background - it&#39;s a habit) and noticed that it was approx 22:30 - also that the luminous hands and numbers of my watch were glowing EXTREMELY brightly.  I looked back at the light which then seemd quite close (big as an American football) - the whole road seemed lit up when it suddenly went out - gone - just like that.  I continued home, I thought at first there had been a crash, but no wreckage or smoke . .  nothing.  It&#39;s a 10 to 15 minute walk from my friend&#39;s farm to my home.  When I got in I went to see my wife who was in bed (a cold), she was watching the 00:30 NTV news - live.  I cannot account for two hours.  I didn&#39;t report this because I had no wittnesses and didn&#39;t see the point of reporting it.  But that missing 2 hours intrigue me.  My wife can verify when I got home and friend can verify when I left &#39;party.&#39;  Also; I&#39;m very reluctant to confess that I am getting &#39;odd&#39; dreams since then involving what I call &#39;flash card seuqences&#39; and other stuff.  Look, I&#39;m not interested in &#34;proving&#34; anything, which is why I kept it to myself.  If I&#39;m not believed, OK.  But has this happened to anyone else?<n>

No jet or helecopter sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving S. on I-90 about 30 miles SW of Spokane WA, when off in the distance I spotted a bright light.  I assumed that it was a satalite.  It got brighter and brighter, so I began to watch it closely.  We seemed to be coming up on the object, and I then thought that it was a jet plane with its light on.  It did not seem to be approaching us however, as we saw the light for at least ten minutes. As we approached the object, it was evident that it was NOT moving, but hovering directly over the freeway.  Its light was lighting up the freeway and the surrounding fields, as a plane light would, but it was not moving!  It was light like a search light it guess?  About that bright.   My assumption was that of a Harrier Jumpjet, but as we drove under the object, the was absolutely NO jet sound, and we did not notice a tail. The object was boomerag shaped, with green and red lights on the end of the &#34;wings&#34; I did not stop, as we were in a line of cars traveling together home to Portland OR, and as that my wife was petrified of the object, but everyone we were traveling with saw it, and could not explain it. I was not going to report it, as I thought that it was military considering the red and green lights on the ends, but there is no military base that I know of out there, and after hearing the womans report from Portland OR, on the Art Bell show of a triangular object in the sky with no sound, it sounded awfully familiar, and I though it was my duty to give the info I had, valid or not.<n>

From where i am they appeared to be over nyc. I thought i was just imagining it, but then my friend tommy who was on the other side of the park went running ihto the middle of the park screaming &#34;did you guys see that sh$t!&#34; Other then the green lights falling from the sky, my other friends have never seen anything ufo like. Im about 50 miles from nyc give or take, so either this was one big ass ufo, or 3 normal sized ufo&#39;s flying together. Id have to guess the latter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It formed a triangular and upside down t shape that when followed by naked eyes , it was too fast to see it from point A to point B. also we notice tourist copters flying to that direction and suddenly turned away like it could not legally fly into Area51 zone. Alot of people saw it as well standing by us and Im curios to know if anybody else report same sighting. Also I took some pictures with my camera and developed it,but all you see is the dots where in area we saw them. One other thing I forgot to mention is the object apeared to be 3-5miles out and at about 45 degrees up in the sky.<n>

It looked to be at least 2 miles away, at approximately 55 degrees altitude from our posiion. My first thought was that it must be an elongated weather balloon, but it changed shape in weird fashion. It went from being clearly defined, to very blurry, as if it were vibrating violently. It also lengthened and shortened slightly. It appeared only to move slightly left (north) then right (south) a few times before moving off south and east, moving out of our view behind the building. What amazed me was that all the people I was with looked up at it after I spotted it, then looked away as if they had seen nothing at all. But here was this clearly unexplainble thing floating in the sky!! It reminded me of that footage from Florida of the floating metallic cylinder over the water...<n>

Then the object began to shift to the East at a very slow rate at the same time it&#39;s glow was changing from bright white to some what of a fireball color. it changed directions several times. I took a picture of it with my digital camera while a second jet airliner was crossing the same vicinity. I&#39;m not sure what it was but I could almost make out a Spherical object just hovering. Please get back to me on this Image that I took of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before the object appeared to Spherical in shape while glowing brightly, I noticed the sun&#39;s reflection of the jet was sort of bright but it wasn&#39;t nearly as bright as the object I was observing, and the object appeared to be much more further away than the jet. That&#39;s why I was at a loss for an explanation. It was so bright and there were no clouds in the sky, It was Sunny out. The way it changed directions was very awkward. It was very subtle but quick. When I took the picture I thought that was enough of that. To my surprise when I get home all I see is A bright Blue sky. Then I started changing the Contrast of the JPG and Zooming in and to my surprise, and out of all that blue sky appears this glowing object again, round in shape with a very strong bright energy glowing from the center. I&#39;m not an expert. You be the judge. Please get back too me.<n>

I saw three bright white lights in a perfect triangle moving slowly to the south east, following Sunset Blvd.  At first I thought it was a low airliner but there was no sound and no landing lights.  I called to the security guard to have another witness.  We both saw the lights, then they split up with two moving slowly to the east and the other to the west.  Then they appeared to stop and very slowly fade from sight (about 4 minutes)  I kept my eyes on them (the two that turned east) as long as I could and they just faded to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle of bright white lights that I saw appeared to be very low in comparison to an airliner flying over head.  The triangle appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  The brightness of each light was about that of the planet Venus. The size was of each was about 3 times the size of Venus.  When I first saw it,  the triangle appeared to be just to the right over another highrise that is across the street.  That highrise has about 20 floors and the triangle was easily as big as the top of the building from my perspective.  I was standing next to the highrise I work in and felt a tingling on my neck and a thought popped into my head to look up.  So I looked straight up the side of the building with my head all the way back and just at that moment the lights came into view.  I thought &#34;that plane looks low&#34; then I realized that a plane would have flashing lights and a more elongated triangle with the front point farther away than the back two.  But this thing had all the lights equally spaced like a formation.  I slowly moved from left to right and passed the top of the building across the street in about 20 seconds. I then called to the security guard who came out in time to see the triangle and then a few seconds later the lights on the triangle separated with two lights going left and one going right.  The lights that went left stayed the same distance apart and rotated slightly.  The security guard said &#34;Thats wierd&#34; and went back inside as I watched the lights that went left slowly fade to nothing.<n>

We noticed this light come up from the ground in a northerly direction.  The light was quite faint and obviously about 7-10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The reason it caught our eye was because there had been a lot of police helicopters in the area, the weeks prior to it due to a rising crime rate.  Knowing that if it was a police helicopter and it came overhead they would probably call the ground troops to get us out of the locked park) The light went from side to side and up and down and we still thought it was a helicopter.  Then suddenly two more lights rose from the ground and the first one shot up at a tremendous speed.  The other two start moving eratically too, so we carried on observing for at least an hour, some of the lights disappeared, but as soon as they did another few came from the ground.  By now we had ruled out a helicopter and maybe thought it could have been a Harrier jump jet. Some of the brighter lights had smaller lights shooting out of them at very fast speeds, then flying upwards and disappearing.  There was also on only two occasions a blue searchlight type light beamed down to the ground in a cone shape.  However this light was ommited from absoltely nothing and quite some distance from the moving white lihts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly one of the white lights got really bright as if it were pointing towards us. So we paid attention to that one, it started moving slowly to the right and then stopped after it had got considerably closer to us.  It stayed hovering for about 2-3 minutes then jumped upwards, darted downwards and from side to side.  That then made us realise that this was no conventional aircraft of any known kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then got even brighter and started moving in our direction, as it got closer we could see that it had two round shaped bright headlight type lights at the front and flashing red and green lights on the bottom.  The carft did move as if it was finding it difficult, tilting from side to side.  It was about 100ft above the ground as it passed over our head so we got a real good look, it was a shiney dark yellowy coloured matchbox type shape, with a pyramid or roof shape on its underside, the flashing green and red lights were on the peaks of the roof shape.  There was no sound apart from a strange wering sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BUT To top it off as it past over our heads it morphed into a green tailed and green passenger window lit 747 at the same height off the ground(around 100-200 ft), a plane at that height makes a massive amount of noise but there was still none. Once the UFO had changed shape it gained altitude and almost completly disappeared within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We bothed looked at each other and were speachless, also as we walked home there were thousands upon thousands of white star lights in the sky moving around almost like the underside of the spaceship in Independence Day the Movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have submitted this report to a British site some years ago and forgotten the address, the reason for saying this is because I drew a picture and attached it, but can&#39;t attach it to this one.<n>

It was partly cloudy and a cool night, there was some smoke from a barbeque coming over the stadium.  We were sitting mid-field when a silent object moving approx. 40-50 mph went overhead.  I sighted the object at the 30 yard line and followed it about have a mile past the stadium.  The strange thing is it appeared to be triangular yet not. It seemed to rotate and change shape and appeared to be approx 60 feet wide and 200 feet off the ground.  Its as though you could see right through it, but it still had a discernable shape. My son who was 11 at the time, looked over at me and said &#34;dad did you see that?&#34;.  I told him I did. I then asked my brother-in-law if he had seen anything. He hadn&#39;t.  Its like we were the only 2 people in the stadium to witness this event.<n>

It was a red light (not flashing, brighter than Mars) about ten degrees above the horizon, in the East heading towards the South with a slight and steady decline in a altitude.  At this time I cought it in the scope of my telescope for a second or two (It still appeared to be a red object as I earlier described it) but then I lost sight of the object behind a tree.  I ran up the street but could not see it.  I then saw a star over lapped (for the lack of a better word) with a redder star in the ESE. At this time I was so fritened about it that I just decided to forget about until know.<n>

Leading edges faint orange. No lights or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in my driveway lying on my back in order to view the evening meteor shower.  Suddenly, I noticed an odd looking triangular shaped craft moving at the speed of a commercial airliner flying directly overhead.  It was very faint, barely discernable, had I not been attentively focused on the stars I probably would not have noticed it at all.  The object obliterated any starlight behind it as it silently glided from north to south.  The leading edges of the object had an eerie faint orange glow.  No lights were visible on this craft.  I often watch the night sky and must say that I have never seen anything quite like this.  It was exciting to see.  The object moved behind a tree and I jumped up to see if I could reestablish a visual contact.  As I expected, once the visual contact was interrupted, I was not able to focus on it again. I did notice the red light of an aircraft in the vicinity but probably at a much lower altitude than the object.  This aircraft certainly was not in pursuit of the object and was moving almost perpendicular to the object trajectory. I called the sighting in shortly therafter to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I was quite surprised but at the same time elated to find myself speaking directly to Peter Davenport, Center Director.  Having heard him speak in the past as a special guest on the Art Bell Show, I recognized his voice immediately.  After phoning in the sighting, I returned to my post, hoping to see more, but there was nothing but stars once again.  I thought about what I had witnessed, and wondered if I would ever see something like this again in my lifetime.<n>

This was no meteor.  It looked like a giant seagull, or two chevrons joined ( ^^ ) [that’s the closest my computer will match its shape, but more elongated side to side]  It was moving slowly and deliberately NE-to-SW and had a dozen or so lights on the underside.  Had it been standing still, it would have blended perfectly into the night sky, they looked just like stars, only they moved together.  I detected no colored lights.  The shape could have been one unit, two chevrons tip to tip, or multiple in formation, but appeared to move together.  The lights did not blink at all, and I heard no sound.  The impression I had was of a single unit, probably low altitude compared to planes in the area, which were easily differentiated by their lights.  At first I thought perhaps it was just a flock of geese, but I followed it for maybe a 30-second period or longer until it was too far away and too dim to see.  Geese in our area are common, but do not remain visible for long, nor do they fly that uniformly, and they invariably honk.  They (geese) do not look like lights.  It was not an airplane.  I never did see any meteors that night.<n>

It changed color very slowly,kind of gelling from white, to a pinkish red,then back to white.Then it stopped moving and the light went out.I got out and stood by my car door. Because it was overcast and nightime,the street lights and such created a dome effect under the clouds.I could see the silhouette of the object below the clouds.It looked like a diamond on its side with the back 1/4 cut off.It was very silent. I did listen for engine noise,I made sure of that.At this time I was  about 1/2 mile from the highway,there was no traffic noise to confuse it with. The light was off for about 6 or 7 seconds.It then came back on white,which took up the whole shape of the silhouette.It then started moving again, away from me in the same slow,swaying fashion.I watched it travel toward Haddon Heights until I lost it in the trees.<n>

It was a clear night. A handful of lights moving across the sky caught the corner of my vision. Over toward the house behind a street light (in view) I seen 5 lights that were the size of stars along with the same brightness. I nudged my friend and just pointed. We started walking back towards the house when the lights were becoming a lot more identifiable. The 5 lights were in a half circle and sitting on the belly side of a huge triangle shaped ufo.  Both of us experienced a tone or ringing in our ears, other than that there was absolutely no sound.  When the vessel came into full view it couldn&#39;t have been no more than 300 to 400 feet off the ground and this thing was creeping. It couldn&#39;t have been going faster than 5 or 10 miles per hour. I knew it was strange because this thing was as long as my neighbor&#39;s yard and our&#39;s put together.  Anything human would have fell out the sky or been loud.  As it was passing we both noticed that the ship had blue wave like sparks coming out the back.  The sparks drifted for about 10 feet or so from the craft and just disappeared. When our view was starting to be compromised by trees we climbed the roof of the house and watched as it went over the 4 lane highway and skimmed across the trees until it was gone.  After this incident, although not my first I&#39;ve experienced the same ringing in my ears, my sinus&#39;s which hardly ever bothered me are bothering me all the time, and even hives.  I&#39;ve noticed throughout my life that I have seen more ufo&#39;s up close than I can shake a stick at. Some more experiences that I&#39;ve had....  an orange glowing ball that blinks in and out of existence which I&#39;ve seen on 3 occasions, and an egg shaped one that appeared once when I was a child that was hovering directly above me 1000&#39;s of feet and actually split the clouds as it left. Dreams, visions or remembering things... some recent and most when I was little.....  well that&#39;s all for now... too much to write! .... thx for the patience..and time<n>

10/6/98 20:45|Cream Ridge|NJ|Triangle|12 - 16 seconds|Three small white lights in triangle formation flew over head at night then disappeared suddenly.|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17019.html|178|ndxe199810| Three small white lights in triangle formation flew over head at night then disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were observing the night sky when I spotted 3 white lights flying overhead in a formation of a triangle. No other lights were noticed in between the other white lights. These lights were very high up, probably much higher than any air plains that fly over and the three white lights were the same size as many other stars, as well as being as bright as many other stars. The reason it caught our eye was the formation the three white lights were flying in and they remained in that position flying at a steady pace overhead towards south Jersey. There was also no sound, it was very quite. The sky was very clear. While quietely watching the triangle of three lights fly over head in a straight line a sudden scurry of birds flew out of the trees behind us very quickly. I always thought it was unusual for many birds to want to fly in the dark especially in an area without much light around. After about 12 - 16 seconds of watching the flight pattern, we watched as the one front light went out (disappeared) quickly, which then the second white light then went out about a second after the first one and then the third light went out, dissappeared, after the second one, until there were no more lights to be witnessed. It was&#39;nt that the object had flown way out of our sight and slowly faded out, rather it had not flown that far off before the lights started to go out one by one. I did not have my camera equipment with me on this night. Now a days my camera equipment goes every where with me. We had never seen an air craft with lights like this do this sort of thing. It had also seemed that this craft had to of been very high up because of the size of the lights and could not get an idea of speed. After we calmed down and discussed what was unsual with this object compared to an air craft/ air plane we finally headed home. When I came back home my cable was out and was unable to watch t.v., not that this could have anything to do with this event, but it did&#39;nt help me to relax that night. I am a nature photographer of 4 years, my friend was in the Navy in the past. We had become interested in unusual sightings and have witnessed a few before and after this particular event and had become very good at knowing what does not move, or act like any air craft and if something does not have the normal lighting to an air craft. I would only be interested in being contacted for information by email or snail mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness was watching a group of three satellites, which were orbiting in formation.  We believe that they are launched periodically by the U. S. Navy, and we believe that they are referred to as the N.O.S.S. satellites.  PD))<n>

I attempted to follow its path with my eyes on the other side of the trees, only a brief distance, especially at the rate at which the object seemed to be traveling, but did not see any trace.  The light seemed to be quite far away, perhaps 2-5 miles directly south of my view, at about 45 degrees above the horizon from my vantage point.  Its size appeared to be larger than the brightest star, but not much bigger.  The narrow tail appeared briefly as it was visible before the trees, but disappeared almost instantly.  I thought about what it may have been, as I was incredulous, never having had a sighting in the Denver area. I thought about it being possibly a reflection of tail lights in my windshield, but I was traveling on a one-way street on one side of a river (the other direction is on the other side of the South Platte River, and is not visible much of the time from my side of the road) after having passed through an intersection where a traffic light halted any perpendicular traffic.  Additionally, the light had just turned green and I was one of the first cars to pass through the inter- section.  Finally, I have traveled this route many, many times before, and had never seen anything of this sort.  One more thing, there may have been light clouds that evening, but I do not specifically recall (sorry).  The sun was well-down by this time--not dusk at all. As mentioned above, I had never seen a sighting in the Denver area, but have had 2 separate sightings in the Caribbean in February of this year. I am a 33-year-old female computer programmer and UFO enthusiast, having grown up in northeastern Colorado, watching programs about such things, but have never, until recently, seen anything I would consider a UFO.<n>

When you stop at the intersection you have a good view of the sky above a gas station and some trees.Something caught my eye above the station at 45 degrees . It was a green irradesent ball about the size of a street light,it came straight down, I was facing west at the intersection.It lasted 2-3 sec. and then it just went out. The way it went out was the strange thing , it seemed like it was sucked back is the best way I can discribe it , not like a light being shut off. I told my wife about it and a friend in work a few weeks later he related a similar experience. Then I heard about it on Art Bell and other peoples experiences and learned about this web site<n>

The object moved at constant speed and looked like a round glowing sphere, green in color with no distinguishing marks. The color was light green and looked similar to the bio-luminescent green light sticks the kids use on Halloween.  The diameter appeared abount ten times Jupiter and brigter than the Moon. The Moon was full, due South, close to Zenith with Jupiter just to the West, sky was very clear. Just before disappearing (.5 sec) a second smaller sphere appeared just in front of the larger sphere. It traveled at the same speed, with the same glowing green light at about one fifth the size.  The objects moved much faster than any jet or prop plane, but slower than meteors. There was a slight hint of a tail but I&#39;m not sure if that was just my eye&#39;s retina persistance. I have worked as an engineer in the aerospace industry for 25 years. I have extensive knowledge and experiance in Astronomy, Optics, Electronics and Astro-Physics having designed Earth, Moon, and Sun sensors, star trackers and Star Magnitude Photon Detectors for use on communication and spy satellites.  I regularly observe and am familiar with the local flight patterns around Burbank airport to the SE and Van Nuys to the S.  There were at least 3 planes to the S and W. I have 20/10 vision and no color blindness. I have seen a few large meteors (comparable to the above object) that appeared to have some visable diameter but they usually have a tail with visable fragments that persist for up to several seconds.  I have never seen a green one.  Maybe burning copper?  I was the only witness and was observing from my house at N34 23.400&#39;  W118 29.350&#39;  1200 ft AMSL<n>

Brillient Bright Green in color with sparkling long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just heard you on the &#34;radio show&#34;, and would like to offer you &#34;My Experience&#34; with a most elegant sighting. I actually live in Central Washington State, but I was in California at the time visiting my Mother.  The date was specifically October 5th, 1998 and it was in the evening, about 8:00 PM California time, and it was dark. I was in the parking lot at my girlfriend saying good night when her little boy of 10 years old said &#34;Look at that!&#34; I turned and viewed one of the most elegant things I&#39;ve ever seen! With my wide span view between the trees I saw very long streak in the sky moving on a horizenal plane. It was moving similar to a shooting star, with an extremely long tail, and it was the most brilliant &#34;Green&#34; color I&#39;ve ever seen. The front was much larger and brighter than the trailing edge, and I noticed that it was moving slower that a shooting star, but still a a great speed. Surprisingly, it appeared very low in the sky. (About 20 to 30 degrees above the horizen.) It had a &#34;flat&#34; trajectory (no movement up or down) and the sight lasted at least more than 10 seconds in clear view. Along the trailing end, which I repeat was very long, there were tiny (but fine) speckles of white &#34;glitter&#34; like from the a ferry&#39;s wand. The actual tail of this thing appeared to be over 20 miles long. It was identical to the one the lady described when you played her voice recording on the radio show. I had a 90 degree clear view horizonally of this thing and it was simply remarkable. As my back was facing the ocean, I viewed this as it was moving from my left to my right side. This means I was facing a easterly direction. (with a little North added) I was actually in &#34;Dana Point&#34; California one block from the ocean, facing towards the approximate direction of San Antinio Peak which is located about 20 miles NE of Ontairo. (I&#39;ve done a lot of flying in this area.)  So this thing was coming from... a Northly direction, and going to a Southerly direction. Almost the opposite direction of the Lady&#39;s sighting. Now this lady I dicribed above just had her sighting tonight 12/18/98, while my &#34;identical&#34; sighting in California was on 10/5/98 . Over 2,000 miles of seperation! I am a former Deputy Sheriff and former Police Officer. I also have a Commercial Pilot license, and I know what I see, when I see it. I hope this sighting helps. Thank you for being there!<n>

It started like a sharp pencle lead drawing a line across the sky, and the streak became a little widerer as it crossed the sky.  The streak was a dull orange in color, and there was no flash of light like a meteor would produce.  It traveled from a south by south-east toward the north by north-west in two seconds.  It seemed to disappear into the north sky, but a few seconds later I realized the tail was the only thing that disappeared.  The object had come to a complete stop, and the object was dropping toward me position.  It dropped until it was four time size of Mars, or about the size of a 22-cal bullet.  It looked like a distant white star when it stopped in the sky, but it looked like a bright white-orange ball when it stopped dropping toward my direction. It was about 1/2 mile north of my position, and its elevation was at about 10,000 ft. when it slowly (400 or 500 mph) moved due west of my position. My view was obscured by some trees, and I lost site of the object.  I moved to a different location, but the object was out of my view.  The object made no sound, nor did I see another tail or exhaust. The whole thing lasted a very short time, but the westerly movement was the most time consuming. This is the second time I have witnessed a strange object moving due west.<n>

We spent all day working on a dock I am building on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It was time to take my family across the river so they could get in their car and drive home. It was around 9:15pm on Sunday, October 4th, 1998. I know that because my sister had to be at her home by 9:00pm and we were running late.  We were in a boat. We left from my dock on Goat Island, SC and went across the river to a dock on Isle of Palms, SC. We were unloading my family and their things off the boat. I was facing south down the Intracoastal Waterway. Over my left shoulder I saw a double blue flash out the corner of my eye.  I thought it was lightning and turned around very quickly to my left to see. I saw a ball about the size of a soccer ball. The sphere  was glowing yellow and faded  red glow around the ball.  It had an extremely long tail about 10 times the size of the ball.  The tail faded from red to blue. I could see all the colors of the spectrum .  the red was directly behind the ball and went to orange, yellow, green then blue. the tail also tapered out to a point at the end. The ball &amp; tail was above Isle of Palms when I first saw it. It moved horizontal (parallel to Earth) for about 4 full seconds. Once it was above the waterway it reduced in intensity and began to fade out. Then it shot off again at about a 30 degree angle toward Earth...still headed away form the ocean...west. that took about 3 seconds. then faded out completely. I was with my boyfriend, in his boat. That was the second time we witnessed the same type of event.  The other was June 28th, 1998.  This time the rest of my immediate family was there and saw it too.

The tower didn&#39;t see it; but the commercial pilot described a very impressive, bright streak that looked like a large meteor. If needed, Charleston Int&#39;l Tower has the tapes; doubt if they would release it, since there was no mishap involved.<n>

At the rear of the second ellipse was a tail, like a comet, but it was shimmering bright fluorescent green.  Both ellipses were the same color.  It was traveling through the sky about 30-35 degrees above the horizon from south to north and it was arcing to about 20 degrees and then disappeared.  It lasted about six seconds and made no apparent sound.  I was the first to notice it and I yelled at my husband and he also observed it. I am a teacher, elementary as well as high school, regular and exceptional education.  My husband is a machinist.<n>

Very , very suddenly the sky lit up extremely bright. I looked up thinking someone had launched a fireworks rocket and saw a streaking object that appeared to be a &#34;giant&#34; meteor racing across the sky from the ocean (east) towards the land (west to northwest).  It appeared to have a large head with an extremely long tail that was glowing a blue-green color. although the sky was already well lit from the full moon, the brilliance was magnificent. It was over in a few seconds. Many witnesses walking on the beach that night yelled at me and we all were in a state of awe.<n>

A large object appeared from my left which I first saw in my peripheral vision. At first I thought it was a shooting star which is commonly seen drivng this route. However, as I focused, I saw it to be a large reddish orange fireball with a very bright and long tail. It appeared only briefly, shooting from left to right, just long enough for me to tell my 11 year old daughter to look at it. We rationalized it must have been a flare or fireworks, but the next day&#39;s paper confirmed our sighting. My background is that I have been a nurse for 22 years, with a degree in Nursing and a degree in Business. I am enrolled in graduate courses at the Citadel. As a child I witnessed a UFO following my brother and I though we told no one. I believe we are not alone in this Universe and we are foolish to even think we are.<n>

The sky was partially cloudy - you could see stars here and there throughout 1/2 of the sky. My car was heading slightly uphill - the sighting took place in the top 1/2 of my windshield. At the 11:00 position, I first saw the clouds flash blue/green, then flash again just a second later a little lower and to the right. Then the ball appeared as it passed through the clouds, and disappeared at about the 4:00 position, I think behind some trees. The flashes were clearly the ball falling through the clouds. I think they were rather low in the sky. Absolutely no way this was a falling star. It was close.<n>

At the time of the sighting, I did not know whom I could report it to, and figured that if it was truely something, the news would have reported it.  I am going to write word for word from my journal entry of that day: 4:37am, Stateline Road.  That&#39;s the time and place I was when I seen it.  I was heading north, so it was in the western sky that  I spotted &#34;it&#34;.  I don&#39;t know exactly what &#34;it&#34; was, but I can describe the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading from Milton-Freewater to Walla Walla, going to work.  Usually, when I drive, I like to glance around, especially early mornings, because of all the different hues of color in the sky from the moon.  Well, anyway, shen I was about to cross the Oregon-Washington Stateline Road, I glanced to the left of me.  I seen a bright, green flash, followed by an object that appeared to be on fire, decending at an approximently 35 degree angle, parallel to the course I was traveling.  The whole scene occured in a short timespan of maybe a few seconds.  After watching too much television, I remembered to document the time by my car&#39;s clock-radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I couldn&#39;t tell you exactly what the object was, or if it was even an object or maybe a fireworks display. But, given the angle of decent, my best guess it that it was a solid object.  I could anything from a meterorite to space garbage or even something extravagant like a UFO.  I just hope that I&#39;m not the only one who has seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Even though the witness submitted his report more than three years after it had occurred, his facts are correct.  Please see other reports for this time and date.  The event was very strange, and it was seen over a large area of Oregon and Washington.  One witness in the Seattle area reported that the object slowed, and then sped up again.  PD))<n>

All of a sudden, as if a light switch was turned on, the sky lit up as bright as day, then an intenser, brighter flash happened, followed be an even bright flash than the previous one, followed by again, as if someone turned a light switch to off and it was over.  There was no sound to it and there was no other detectable activity or noise in the area.<n>
10/4/98 02:45|Albuquerque|NM||1 minute +|VERY bright white light,  appeared to be about half the diameter of the moon.|11/1/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04505.html|200|ndxe199810| I was on what is known as the West Mesa in Albuquerque, NM, one block south of Sage and about 1.5 blocks west of Coors, (new Coors) facing east.  The light seemed to appear suddenly over the airport, or maybe just north of it, sort of rising up.  It was a VERY bright white light, and appeared to be about half the diameter of the moon.  It then proceeded at a rapid rate, faster than conventional aircraft, taking only about 2-3 seconds to complete its northward journey. Then, it stopped and simultaneously turned red.  Then, it proceeded much more slowly back toward the airport at a slightly lower elevation.  It proceeded past the airport and that is when I stopped looking for it, as it was being lost behind trees.  Total sighting was a minute or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and two brothers who live nearby were on what is known as the West Mesa of Albuquerque, NM, about one to one and a half blocks west of New Coors and a little less than one block south of Sage.  The time was between (my guess) 02:30 and 03:30, Sunday morning 10/04/98.  I was facing east, the brothers west.  I saw it first, a very bright white light, similar in appearance to aircraft landing lights, but, it was a single light and much too bright to be aircraft landing lights.  It reminded me of an extremely powerful quart-halogen light.  It appeared over the airport or maybe just a little north of the airport, and then moved north, seeming, from our vantage point, to be just above the nearby Sandia Mountains.  Albuquerque is at about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the tallest peaks of the Sandias are about 10,000 feet.  Its travel time from north to south was only about 2-3 seconds.  I have watched aircraft circle and land at the airport here countless times.  The light&#39;s speed was at least 10 times that of the aircraft when they are approaching from the north before landing. From our vantage point, the light seemed to stop at about the same place as a couple of red marker lights on the nearby Sandias.  I was now facing slightly north, perhaps about 30 degrees north of east.  As soon as it stopped, the light became red.  The red was not as bright, but, it was far brighter than the aforementioned red marker lights.  Then, it reversed course and headed back toward the airport, but, now it was moving much more slowly.  It actually went past the airport when I stopped watching for it.  On its reverse course, it was at a slightly lower altitude and was disappearing and reappearing behind trees. Total sighting was a minute plus. There is a nearby trailer court that the light passed over (or seemed to pass over). The street lights in the trailer court went out when it passed over, both on its northward journey and its southward journey.<n>
10/3/98 14:30|Carbondale|IL|Changing|20 min|a Black object not moving.  It was about 1500-2000 feet in altitude, and about the size of a gumball held at arms length.|11/1/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04601.html|201|ndxe199810| On the specified date, myself and a few of my friends witnessed this flying object, that was not an airplane, helocopter, or balloon. I am a pilot and I have been around flying craft all my life, I did not recognize this object.  It stayed about 1500 feet in the air for about 20 min moving north and south about 10 degrees.  We were facing east over the city of Carbondale when we saw it.  It then disappered into the blue sky.  About an hour later an F-16 fighter flew down from Springfield Il. and buzzed the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  I have been here for 3 years and have never seen a military fighter jet fly over Carbondale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:30pm CST myself and a friend were sitting on a couch outside of our fraternity house in Carbondale Illinois.  I looked at the sky to see some birds flying around and then behind the birds was a black object not moving.  It was about 1500-2000 feet in altitude, and about the size of a gumball held at arms length.  We both stood up to get a better look and could not figure out what it was.  We were faceing east and it was about 3-6 miles away from us.  The object began to move from north to south and back, in the sky.  The object was also changing shape.  When I say changing shape I mean it looked like a large rubber bag full of water suspended in the air and the bag was changing shape.  I have been around flying aircraft all my life, I am a pilot, and I have never seen anything like this ever.  To prove to my friend and I that we were not crazy, I went inside to get some othrer people to witness this object.  I brought out 5 people.  They all saw it, some skeptical, but they did admit they saw something not normal.  Then another friend of mine drove up, and stated he saw the object from one of the dorms on campus which is about 2.5 miles from where I saw the object.  The object then disappered into the blue sky after about 20 min.  It was a slow disapperence, it was not a quick bolt out of the atmosphere.  After all this took place, about 1-2 hours later an F-16 fighter jet from Springfield Illiionis flew over the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  There were several rumors of why the jet was flying around down here, but nothing official ever came out.  The odd part of the jet is that for the 4 years I have been in Carbondale, I have never seen a fighter jet fly around this area.  It just so happens that the military jet shows up shortly after this craft was witnessed.<n>

They both ran into the house an called me to help them!  I grab a weapon and headed for the back yard where I found nothing but a semi cloudy night with a hazy moon and some bright stars showing through them.. They were both shaking with fear and it took several hours of my telling them it was just a reflection of the light from a police car going by. But I know police spot lights don&#39;t come from the sky and are not a heavy florescent blue that casts no shadows. This was just a strange experience that I can not really explain so I thought it might be worth reporting to you.<n>

I had just gotten in the bed in the sleeper compartment of the truck when my husband asked me to come up front and look at this weird light coming at us. By the time I got up and put my glasses on it was getting very close to us. It was a triangle shaped craft and was very dark in color. I would say black or very dark green. It was silent and only about 1,000 feet above our truck, that we had pulled over to the side of the road. We were on hwy. 278. and just after the sighting, I got the name of the small town and wrote it down, along with the time and date. We have had several sightings and I would be so excited or should I say scared that I wouldn&#39;t even think to write any information down. I did have a camera and camcoder with me but I was so excited that I didn&#39;t even think about picking one on them up. I said that I would if we ever had another sighting. This is not an easy thing to do when your scared. The craft started off being off to our left and then came toward our truck and then passing right over the top of us. There was no sound from it what so ever. It floated over us and just disappeared.<n>

The crafts were the size of pin-heads and of a silvery color.  My attention because of the slow flying and the straight line of their formation, Military aircraft fly in a Vee formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were waiting for a bus at the Grayhound bus terminal in the city of El Monte.  To the north of our location is a small, city, airport.  I was watching small, priviate, planes taking off from the airport.  As I was watching the planes taking off I noticed four small, slivery aircrafts flying towards the West.  I kept watching them as they were flying in an unuasual manner.  I told my mother who could not see them, at first.  I waited until another plane was taking off. Just as the plane was to the left of where the crafts were I told her to look to the right of them.  She then saw them for herself.  I observed them for several minutes as they flew overhead at a very high altitude.  I hope these next dote show up as I would like them to .      This is the formation in which I first saw them. As I .      watched the crafts flying towards the West they seem to .   arc to the start of a circle arcing towards the left as .            follows below. . . . . The crafts disappeared overhead behind palm trees. The sky was clear and the sun was in the East.  There was nothing to give me any reason to think that they were normal crafts seen in an unusual condition.  That&#39;s about all that I can give you.  I only hope that it helps in someway to figure out what is really going on around here.    Good luck.    ((Name deleted.))<n>

It looked like a comet, only it was stationary for a long time.  I watched for about 5 minutes and took a couple of pictures.  Then it started moving, accelerated and moved from the upper right to the lower left and disappeared behind the &#34;saddle&#34; of the buttes.  A couple of minutes later I saw a jet.  It had a much longer tail. I am a supervisor with a state agency, have a college degree , and  consider myself to be a stable person.<n>
10/1/98 23:10|Mosinee|WI|Other|5 minutes|I was driving south on U.S. Hwy 51 and I saw a craft that didn't move for 5 or more minutes.  The craft also made no noise.|11/19/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04747.html|208|ndxe199810| I was driving south on U.S. Hwy 51 and I saw a craft that didn&#39;t move for 5 or more minutes.  The craft also made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated above I was driving south on U.S. 51, travelling from Wausau, WI to Stevens Point, 30 miles away.  Mosinee is approximately 10 miles south of Wausau and the regional airport resides there.  As I passed the airport and got away from the lights of Mosinee I noticed what appeared to be a set of automotive high-beams floating above the treeline about 3 miles ahead.  I assumed it was an airplane, but as I drew nearer I realized that I was the only one in motion.  When I was finally only a mile or so away I saw 2 blue lights on either side blinking in unison, and one light blue flash on top that comes only after the side lights flash.  I slowed from 65mph to approximately 30mph and noticed that it had a saucer-like base but it had 2 C shaped pieces sticking out of either side and almost meeting in the center.  It hadn&#39;t moved since I first saw it and when I was closest I measured it&#39;s altitude with my thumb, and it sat one thumbnail or about 25 feet above the treeline.  It was also right next to a road that overpasses the highway and winds into the countryside.  There are no homes or farms in the immediate vicinity of the sighting.  The second witness was not with me in the vehicle, but rather a truck driver who came up behind me.  I was in the right slow lane,(51 is a 2 lane freeway), he was in the passing lane.  He slowed his rig down to about my speed of 30 mph and I noticed that his attention was fixed on the object to the left of both him and I.  There was other traffic on the other side heading north, so this object was very blatant, it didn&#39;t appear to be hidden.<n>
10/1/98 22:30|Moundsville|WV|Triangle|continous|5 large objects observed, 4 of them flying in a rectangular motion. Perfect 90 degree banks at incredible speed!!!|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18410.html|209|ndxe199810| 5 large objects observed, 4 of them flying in a rectangular motion. Perfect 90 degree banks at incredible speed!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my days at college, my roomates and i decided to visit, the ((deleted)) temple in moundsville, wv. following an old dirt road through the woods leading us there, i noticed a strange hum coming from outside the car. I pulled over to a place where the dirt road ran beside a small crick. The sky was perfectly clear, and EVERY star was visible. We were at a particular opening in the woods, were you could see a good bit of the sky. At about 10:30 pm I noticed the humming was coming from the sky, and looking up, I saw 5 distinguishable crafts approx. 1,000 ft in the air, i&#39;m not the best judger of distance when it comes to te sky. 1 hovering motionless in the center of the sky, and the other four were flying around it at astonishing speeds. The intriging part about them was, the fact that they were circling the center craft and banking immaculate 90 degree turns without slowing down. I noticed a slight visual disruption directly behind the 4 crafts, as if staring through gasoline fumes where your vision is distorted by waves of exhaust. The crafts appeared to be triangular shaped, distinguished by 3 blue lights at each point, and one larger and brighter white light in the center. They appeared to be holding their position the entire time were there, as if they were spying, or maybe waiting for something. We decided to leave because we all had class early next morning and it was an hour and a half drive back to the school. As we were leaving, headed down this old dirt road barely large enough for a single car, which also I might add, is lucky to be traveled twice a day; we were forced off the road and into the grass by 3 large oncoming vehicles. The first, an undercover state police explorer - as it appeared to be, and the other two were a camoflauged military hummer, and a large transport van also in camo. The van had 2 large sattelite dishes on it and more antennaes than i could count. Go figure/?? If theres anyone else out there, that may have seen the same spectacle in the sky near moundsville around that time, please let me know your out there. I&#39;ve made an interesting hypothesis about the humming coming from the sky. Have you ever hit a tuning fork or a cymbal from a drum set and placed it extremely close to your ear, and heard the low level hum that the sound waves radiate? It&#39;s almost unearthlike, and that is the EXACT sound I heard! I believe that this particular craft uses sound wave generation to either induce motion as in forward or reverse, OR, just as a means of hovering. Sound is measured in decibles, which is basically described sound pressure level. PRESSURE is the key, i believe they can force themselfs in any direction by controlled bursts of sound waves or magnetic waves. The government cannot keep a lid on this any longer, as long as everybody knows whats goin on. Then we&#39;ll all know who was directly involved in it for quite some time now; and you probably hear their excuse being: &#34;We didn&#39;t want to create a widespread panic...&#34; Sure what would happen if everybody suddenly realized there IS other life in the galaxy?? People would revolt against society, taxes wouldn&#39;t be paid, people wouldn&#39;t go to work, THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN&#39;T MAKE ANY MONEY ON YOU!!!! And more importantly; They would no longer be top dogs; let alone even be able to try to cover anything else up. Think about it for a while, sooner or later you&#39;ll start to realize what there up to.. Hopefully its not all too late for us when it does become apparent... Thanks for your time, and continue to live free and intelligently! ((pseudonym deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A discernable craft flew directly overhead and proceeded to disappear over the horizon at low altitude. There was no sound and viewing conditions were optimal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were moving harvesting equipment from a remote field back to the farm. While driving  I had observed 2 orange fireballs in the southern and 2 in the western quarter of the sky. A cold front had passed through earlier and viewing conditions were optimal.  The fireballs were distinctly orange, had a definate round shape, did not move, were all of the same appearent size, and faded quickly after about four seconds.  There was no pattern to their appearence; 2 were seen at the same time to the west. I could see only a small area of the sky while driving but saw these while driving for only 15 minutes. The fireballs were approximately the size of the full moon, about half a degree of arc.  After arriving at the farm on the prairie at 9:15 PM I asked the other drivers if they had seen the fireballs but no-one had.  We scanned the sky and noticed a very bright light to the SW low to the horizon. It was a point source but did not appear to be moving.  I determined that it was not a planet because it was south of the plane of the ecliptic.  We observed it for a while until  we realized it was gaining altitude.  It soon resembled car headlights about 2 miles away and was at about 15° elevation.  At this point it became evident that it was an aobject moving directly at us and maintaining altitude.  I remembered I had my Pentax with a 205mm lens in my truck a started taking pictures.  The object flew almost directly over our heads.  It had 3 bright white lights that were visible from all angles. There was a white light on each side with the center light  slightly ahead of the other two. There was also a cluster of green lights in the center of the object with one or two red ones intermixed.  These lights were very faint and did not blink.  There was no sound whatsover. As it continued to the NE the white lights were still dominate but there was also faint reddish lights visible from behind.  We eventually became bored with the event an left the property about 9:30PM with the object still visible above the horizon.  We were treated to 2 more orange fireballs in the west as we left.  My cousin says he returned to the field at 10PM and saw the object again.  I recall an incident in April of this year just a few miles to the north of this sighting that I saw the same lights (the rear aspect) at about 10PM along the same flightpath as abseved on 10/1.  I had lost sight of them as they moved behind a neighborhood house. I am a 40 yr old geophysicist and my cousin is a 43 yr old farmer.  his 12 yr old son and my 16 yr old nephew were the other witnesses. My nephew reported that someone at school claimed to have seen an object in a field near Vermont, IL that night.  That would have been about 5 miles to the SW of us and consistent with our sighting. and saw the object again. The film was ASA 200 and did not turn out.<n>

I noticed a large orange fireball just north of town and I thought here we go again, the fireball just sat stationary at about 30 degrees above the horizon. I then turned around and proceeded to drive south on route 99 where the lights of the town was not a factor and my view would not be obscured. Approx. 1.5 mi. south of town I seen 3 orange fireballs to the east of me approx. 1/4 mile. from my location at about 1000 ft. in altitude. These fireballs were in a triangular formation and motionless. The location of these lights were less than 1/4 of a mile east of the Western Illinois Correctional Facility. After approx. 5 minutes they seemed to implode into themselves. I proceeded to a small black top road called the Wild Cat Road, to head back to town. I then noticed what appeared to be an air craft with 2 white landing lights approaching from the south west. The craft was slow moving like an old j-3 Cub and made no noise. I got out of my car and watched the craft pass over me. It was small like a fighter jet but was totally quiet and moved so slow. As the craft passed I noticed a string of 5 white lights along the trailing edge all in a line. The were no aircraft marker lights or strobes on the object. This is a small community with a population of 1900 in rual America. What the Hell is going on??????<n>

The &#34;stars&#34; suddenly descended upon them, and as it turned out, they were not stars, but instead UFOs. The objects hovered overhead for no less than fifteen minutes. The craft were so massive, and close enough for the men to make out a dark, metallic hull with a ring on lights that encompassed &#34;every color of the rainbow&#34;.The men stood there mesmerized, and watched as the UFOs suddenly &#34;went right back where they came from&#34;. Two nights later, the UFOs re-appeared, and this time instead of hovering, they decided to put on a display of &#34;out of this world&#34; aerial manuevers. This event lasted about fifteen minutes as well. 	A friend of theirs was in the town of Wadley, 14 miles away, and he too observed the aerial display of the second encounter. The event seemed to have a profound effect on the witness and I believe his story is absolutley true. We also contacted Dr.Steven Greer (CSETI), a personal friend of the chief witness. He was very interested in this particular sighting. Although we filed this sighting with CSETI, I thought it extremely important that NUFORC be informed as well. Although I did not personally witness this event, the information was relayed to me because I am credible UFO researcher who has documented many, many cases. If you are interested, I would gladly share any of these cases with your excellent organization.. Thank You.<n>

It shot across the sky from left to right at an incredible speed. It was most definitely on fire. The shape was quite round and there was a thick, very grey smoke with deep orange flames all around it almost like a volcano eruption. As it sped across the sky it broke up into about 8 pieces with one larger piece continuing it&#39;s journey where it disapeared as we could no longer see it. We all saw it very clearly, none of us had ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It came out of nowhere and was almost like it wanted to be seen.   It made absolutely no sound, although it was a very large craft.  I remember it just sort of paralyzing my friend and I.  We suddenly stopped talking as it seemed to just float by us.  I remember the bottom of the aircraft reminding me of the ship on &#34;Star Trek&#34; it was dark grey with rivets etc.  There was a light on each point of the triangle.  I know they blinked different colors of yellow, red, and green. My sighting was at the age of 11, which was 12 years ago.. it’s just one of those things I will never forget.  It was probably only going 20 miles per hour over our heads and when it was probably 30 yards ahead of us it shot up into the sky extremely fast.  All I saw then was what looked like a star until it disappeared.<n>

After a few seconds, the object seemed to break apart slightly finally become consumed by the bluish glow until it simply fizzled away.<n>

10/1/98 10:00|San Francisco|CA|Sphere|6-7 Minutes|Soccer Balls over SF|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86966.html|219|ndxe199810| Soccer Balls over SF<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall the date or even exact time of the year but likely it was Autumn of 1997 or 1998 in San Francisco, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10 AM I was standing in the redevelopment zone now known as Mission Bay, adjacent to the old Bethlehem Steel Yard just 60 yds north of the restaurant/lounge called Mission Rock Resort.  I was drinking coffee and watching the view across the Bay to the east when I saw two white &#34;balls&#34; just feet off of the deck of SF Bay coming towards me from the direction of the Oakland Airport.  I took these to be two Sikorsky S61 helicopters of the USCG and thought that I was about to witness a test exercise.  However as they came closer into view I realized that these objects had no wings or rotors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were soon in good view and the day being near perfectly clear, warm and quiet in my location I could see that they would pass me at near ground level.  As they approached at an estimated 30 mph I could plainly see that they were two separate objects of equal size in the shape of soccer balls, that is they were generally round but had a series of flat sides precisely like that of a soccer ball.  As they neared the edge of the shore they, in perfect close formation, began to climb slightly to an altitude that I estimate as 250-300 ft and passed me only about the same distance laterally.  I was simply awestruck.  I witnessed two fisherman on a nearby dock who apparently saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two objects passed my location (They made no sound, had no aura, lights or haze around them) they increased their altitude dramatically and climbed to an estimated 1000-1500 feet above the skyline of San Francisco.  It was a weekend day, I believe Sunday and when I followed their progress to the north of me I noticed LARGE numbers of similar objects!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with the San Francisco skyline and habits of its citizens and could not identify all of these objects.  A few could have been Mylar party balloons that had gotten away from people and some others were definitely real hot-air balloons in the distance up in Sonoma.  I always kept one eye on these two items while making these other observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reaching their maximum altitude the two &#34;craft&#34; then did a maneuver about each other that I can only describe as a dance, similar to a deux-se-deux of a square dancer.  This was only momentary and then they began, still in formation, to return along the same flight path that they had just traversed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my first sighting of these two vessels perhaps only three minutes had passed.  I knew that they would return my way yet I found it impossible to yell out to the only two others nearby, the fishermen, as I was so transfixed.  I did notice a police squad car approaching at slow speed and briefly thought to hail them down but my astonishment was such that I could not speak a word!  As expected these two objects returned at the same speed, passed me again at the same distance and again dropped down to the deck as they headed back towards the East Bay.  I had no reference to judge their size and can only surmise that they were each about the size of two small autos.  They were Flat (Mat) Hospital White in color and their surface, clearly solid, could have been metal or even fine wood.  There were no windows, lights or protuberances of any kind.  There were no flames, emissions, contrails or noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the great many other objects that I saw over the City skyline that day, some of which I identified as hot air balloons farther away in the distance and others possible Mylar balloons, there were perhaps 100 more objects, most of them shiny metallic.  Most were stationary or nearly so, some actually moved in the opposite direction of the prevailing wind (Which was negligible that day).  I could clearly see that these shiny metallic ones were rotating on their axis in a clockwise direction.  Most made little lateral movement or altitude adjustments.  As I was focused on the two &#34;soccer balls&#34; I dismissed these others, though I found them quite dramatic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent the rest of the weekend awed by this experience and upon returning to work at the SF Public Library on Monday I immediately discovered a flier in the lobby alerting people to the &#34;continuing&#34; UFO sightings on, around and about the Oakland Bay Bridge in the vicinity of it&#39;s Eastern terminus, an area now called South Beach. The flier stated that a CHP unit had observed it one night ( I think I have since read that somewhere else.) and that crowds were continuing to gather. The flier was an open invitation to join the crowd, however I did not. The flier further stated that the local media were aware of the ongoing phenomena but would not cover the story. As I have become so deadened to the UFO issue I did not think to report this to anyone. I promised Peter D. that I would write up this report regardless of it&#39;s age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in San Francisco for over twenty years and spent a great deal of time outside. Indeed I drove a taxi full time for about ten years, 50-60 hours per week.  I am quite aware of the comings and goings of aircraft, flying debris, the relative wind, human activity and so forth in the City.  Nothing that I can imagine can explain away the vast number of odd-acting objects that I observed that day other than the two or three that I noted above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of two seemingly credible reports from the same source.  Other sighting occurred near Ocotillo Wells, California, on, or about May 01st, 1994.  PD))<n>

We were about twenty miles south and watched it hang approximatly 2000 yards up, off the ground. It had a large white beam of light coming down out of it and spoted on the ground. It appeared to create its own &#34;storm&#34; of wild weather with lightning blasting off the top and in a very hard wind from west to east the lightning spilled away from the object off the east.The sky was very cloudy but had low clear cieling and the object was just above thecloud layer.  The intensity of the light seemed to throb bigger and smaller. This all happened the morning of October 1st,1998.I later made notes and a sketch. I am a commercial artist from dallas texas. I have only now come across this web site or I would have reported sooner. I saw this from a camp site I was in located in Northern, New Mexico. After seeing this thing later that morning I looked at the map to see where it could have been. I called the police station in Bayfield colorado as it seemed that was where it occured. I spoke with an officer an after a brief discription and query as to &#34;has anyone else called in &#34; he stopped me and described the same thing only he said he was in his patrol car underneath it, He was just outside the town of bayfield. I later called the airprot control tower in Durang as I thought certain ly they had it on radar. It was huge. They said nothing. Istayed in touch with the officer but not much ahs come of it. My question to you is did anyone else see this or do you have any other reports from that day and location??<n>

I went outside in my backyard about 4:30 a.m. to get another look as it was so facinating, when I noticed an object moving through the sky very quickly and it was white in the front and had an orange/bluish contrail.  I found this interesting as it wasn&#39;t falling from the sky, it was moving perpendicular to the Earth.  Then, I saw dark objects following it.  And how I saw this was due to the fact they crossed in front of stars.  One of my roomates came out and saw the objects following the colorful object. I don&#39;t know what we saw, but after having something else in 1993, I believe it was not of Earth.<n>

It looked like it was maybe 10 miles away, and from where I was, looked about the size of a small car (think yugo). It took me about a second to register what I was seeing. I watched it for about 5 seconds. It went from a green ball of fire to your run of the mill orange, and then started to dim a bit. Then it was out of sight. It was falling at a slight arch. I&#39;ve seen meteors falling before, and this was nothing like it. Also, there was a cop that had a car pulled over on the main road about 30 seconds before the fireball. After the event, I looked over toward the main road, saw his lights were no longer flashing, and then he was on the sideroad moving at a rather high rate of speed, Heading in the direction of where the ball &#34;fell&#34;. Im almost certain he saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats pretty much all the detail I have. Im 17 and a college student.<n>

The three of us were off to the side, having a private conversation.  I looked up at the partly cloudy sky, and in a clearing almost directly above us, I saw five bright triangles moving quickly to the south.  I pointed them out to my two friends, who also saw them before they dissapeared from sight.  They appeared to me to be about the size of air superiority fighters (F-15&#39;s) at a very high altitude.  They flew in a formation close to a single file line, with a slight curve.  The back object would speed up to take the lead position.  As soon as it did, the new rear object would do the same, and so forth.  They appeared to have the maneuverability of small birds, such as sparrows.<n>
