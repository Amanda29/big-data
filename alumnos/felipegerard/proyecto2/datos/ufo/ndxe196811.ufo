I was 14 or 15 years old at the time, and although I do not remember the exact date I do remember the details as though it were yesterday.  I was laying in my bed trying to go to sleep, looking out my bedroom window.  My room was dark so I could see outside very well.  I saw a white light traveling just above the horizon at a speed I would consider to be in the range of an airplane.  It was traveling from the north toward the south.  I watched it for a few seconds and it came to a complete stop.  I thought huh,  this must be a helicopter.  It set perfectly still for a few minutes when I saw a smaller light come from behind the moutain I was looking toward and it went toward the larger light.  It went straight to it and when it got there it seemed to go inside the larger light.  I could only see one light anyway.  The larger light proceeded south at the speed I first saw it traveling, then accelerated very fast and went out of sight.  I have searched through your reports around this time and have saw no story that related to this sightning of mine.  It has been around 36 years since I saw this and I&#39;m sure not to forget it.  If any one has any similar story or has sightings occuring in Alabama on or about this time I wish you would send them in.  I have an interest in the UFO phenomena because of this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was barely getting light enough to focus in on it. At its closest point to us, the light went off as it went into the low cloud cover. I was able to determine that from its nose the geometry was delta, or triangular, as I couldn&#39;t distinguish the shape of the rear half of the object.  It was soundless, and there was no wind noises after it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and 2 close friends were in our cornstalk blind duck hunting one fall morning.  Our decoys were out, and it was still dark.  Daybreak was upon us, and as it got lighter, my vision of the distance increased. In those days, because of my extremely accute long distance vision, I was the spotter, and my 2 buddies manned the duck calls. The cloud ceiling was very low, as we looked to the East where the faint light of daybreak was commencing. Then about a quarter mile towards the Northeast, I saw a round light skimming in and out of view in the low clouds heading South at about 50(?) mph.  Because of the subdued lighting, identification was impossible.  However, when the craft passed directly in front of us at its closest distance (1/8th mile), my focus zeroed in.  Its light then went out as it went into the clouds.  I was able to determine that its light was recessed somewhat into the nose of the craft, and about a foot in diameter.  I saw only the first 10 feet or so of the craft.  Moving back from the recessed headlight, the shape was &#34;delta/triangular&#34;.  My 2 buddies and I looked at each other in disbelief as the craft made no propulsion noises, or any wind-cutting noise in its wake.<n>

It was long ago, so I am not sure which ship I was on, but I believe it was The Alaskan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On lookout it was my job to scan the horizon, but I spent a lot of time scanning the sky.  When I saw the three lights I thought they were spotlights from shore on clouds, but then I realized there were no clouds in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called up to the bridge, and the mate on duty said he and the helmsman saw them also.  The lights were a slightly greenish color and moved around quickly, then sped off, north.  We awakened the radio operator,  but he waited until the morning to report it.  He said there were sightings from Florida to Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I couild tell you why I waited so long to report this --I guess I felt I had, having told the radio operator.  It isn&#39;t easy to tell people that you&#39;ve seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching a show on the subject last night, and decided I should tell sombody.  I have been, since then, a high school math teacher and editor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother was in the right seat while I rode in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying in a Cessna 182 Skylane from Stillwater, Oklahoma to Enid, Oklahoma at approximately 2200 hours, I observed from the rear seat that the under side of the right wing suddenly lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at an altitude of 800 ft AGL.  There was no weather or adverse wind conditions.  The farm lights were easily visible below as were the stars above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved to the right in order to observe what was making the light, the cockpit lit up, then the left wing.  This was as if a search light had passed from the right wing to the left wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, this was in the country.  No towns with search lights were along our flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, any search light beam would have been observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third, the 182 cruises at around 120mph and the light traveled perpendicular to our flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no unusual sound or turbulence encountered.  There were no fluctuations of the aircraft instruments, navigational or primary flight instruments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was unusually quite after this incident and refused to talk about it later.<n>
