1/22/80 02:00|Murphy/Arnold|CA|Sphere|45 Minutes|Tracked by a UFO|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84925.html|2|ndxe198001| Tracked by a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1980 in early winter, I was driving home from Angels Camp, California, on Highway 4 eastbound.  It was around 2:00 in the morning and snowing.  I was just outside of Murphy&#39;s, when I pulled over on to a large snow covered dirt shoulder to tighten my tire chains that were hitting against the wheel well of my car.  As I kneeled down to tighten the rear passenger side tire chains, a bright white light flashed on me, lighting up everything around me.  At first I thought it was the headlights of a vehicle coming, but noticed there wasn&#39;t one.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, but a few seconds later it happened again. This time the light stayed on, and I immediately stopped what I was doing and looked to see where it was coming from.  I noticed it was coming from directly above me shining through the snow covered clouds.  There was no noise and I couldn&#39;t see anything other then the beam of light shining directly on me like a spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure what was happening.  Suddenly I felt a sense of panic.  I jumped back in my car and tried to get out of there as fast as I could.  I was about 15 miles from home, but because it was snowing, and the roads weren&#39;t plowed, I couldn&#39;t drive any faster then 25 miles an hour.  During the trip back I didn&#39;t see a single vehicle in either direction.  I felt scared and alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finally got off the highway and into the subdivision where I lived, I felt a sense of relief.  But when I turned the corner to go up the driveway to my house, I saw a bright light at the end of the street shining through the clouds.  It looked like a really large star.  But I knew this wasn&#39;t possible, because of the low cloud cover from the snow storm.  I was really frightened by the sight of this.  I felt like what ever it was that shinned it&#39;s light on me earlier, followed me home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and immediately woke my parents to tell them what I saw.  They didn&#39;t think much of it, and just wanted to go back to sleep, reassuring me that everything was okay.  That night when I went up to my room I was really excited and nervous.  I was so wired I couldn&#39;t sleep, and stayed up all night into the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note. I lived in Arnold, California for 7 years.  It&#39;s about 4000 feet above sea level on the western Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Living there I experienced many snow storms. When it snows there, a thick cloud cover blankets the sky.  The clouds are very low to the ground, and you can&#39;t see through them.  Whatever I saw that night somehow penetrated this blanket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/21/80 14:30|Los Angeles|CA|Diamond|2 minutes|Spinning metallic diamonds over Super Bowl|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19781.html|3|ndxe198001| Spinning metallic diamonds over Super Bowl<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects that I am referring to where actually broadcast live during the 1980 (?)NFL Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  During the game, a cameraman focus and zoomed-in on a couple of spinning diamond shaped objects that were over the Los Angeles Coliseum.  The network broadcasters noticed it and started talking about &#34;how curious&#34; the objects where.  The objects appeared to be metallic in structure and were hovering a few hundred feet above the staduim.  As they turned, you could make out the obvious flash of metal when the sunlight hit the sides of it.  It appeared to spin on its corner points (as if a compass - north and south) and in a left to right spin.  The cameras stayed on this for about 2 minutes and then the cameras cut back to the game.  It has been almost 22 years since I&#39;ve seen this, but I clearly remember the things I saw.  They were not the Goodyear blimp, or any type of news helicopter covering the game.  My older brothers and some cousins and I were watching the game.  I was 13 at the time.  I remember that there was a news blurb about it later, but never remember seeing or hearing anything about it after that.  Unfortunatly I don&#39;t have a copy of the came, you may want to find a copy of the broadcast of this game to view.  I don&#39;t remember what quarter or time of the game this happened, but I do know I saw it all on live T.V.<n>

It was late at night, about 10pm or so. I was on I-79 (I think that is the name of the Interstate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I saw two glowing disks floating over the mediam strip. I couldn&#39;t tell exactly how big they were, but they were huge and hovering just a few feet above some pine trees: approximzte altitude-40 to 50 feet.  I did not see any details, just their glow;they never moved. I was driving south at about 60mph and the sky was overcast.  In about 15 minutes I was past them and nothing else happened.  I checked my watch and did not notice any missing time.  It was a bitter cold night in January or February; I do not remember exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/80 22:00|Albany|IL|Disk|5 min|saucer over corn field on a cold winter night.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34214.html|5|ndxe198001| saucer over corn field on a cold winter night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot remember the exact date or time but I just discovered your site and want to tell you what happen about 1980.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, (infant)child and I just returned home to our rural farm house from an out of town trip. It was dark, cold out and very clear. As we rushed the sleeping child in the house from the car she took him upstairs and I went to kitchen sink to get a drink of water.To my right we have a pantry about ten feet deep and a window at the end facing the east and a flat corn field that rises about two hundred yards out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a star outside the window, it seemed very bright but it was clear out so I assumed it was still a star.Then it occurd to me it could be a planet so I grabbed the binoculars we kept on the pantry shelf and walked up to the window to look at it. Just as I raise the binoculars up my wife stepped in the dark pantry and asked what I was doing. I asked her to look at the bright star it could be a planet. She did as I looked throught the glasses. She commented on how bright it was just as I got focused. I could actually see two lights that appeared as one with the naked eye. between the lights you could make out a silver looking saucer shaped body. I was sceptical of what I saw and asked my wife to look through the glasses and tell me what she saw. As she focused she discribed exactly what I saw.We stood there for a couple minutes and exchanged the binoculars a couple times when all of a sudden as I was viewing  it took off away from us at a rate of speed you could not immagine. I know it was going away from us because it didn&#39;t leave in a straight line, it swept off in an arc. She thought it disappeared with the naked eye but I could actually see it leaving. I estimate it was over the corn field about 200 yard from the house maybe a little further. It appeared to be maybe 25-30 feet long and about 5-6 feet thick at the center and the lights where white as bright as a car light. It appeared to be stationary at 150 to 200 feet high until it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/80 21:45|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Disk|8 Minutes|Super-colossal circle of rotating lights perpendicular to the ground "sailing" over major city.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59093.html|6|ndxe198001| Super-colossal circle of rotating lights perpendicular to the ground &#34;sailing&#34; over major city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Whom It May Concern,  First of all, let it be known that I am not a UFO &#34;believer&#34; per say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this occurred approximately 27 years ago, I thought it&#39;s time to report to various UFO investigation organizations. I hope this is worthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the winter of 1980, January perhaps, I just got off work at 9:30 P.M. from the auto dealership. I was a car salesman at the time. I started driving towards the city of Toronto, Canada, on the QEW (Queen Elizabeth Way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the Esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). I didn&#39;t have anything to drink and didn&#39;t smoke any pot on that day/evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, I noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of Toronto, at about the ten o&#39;clock position from my point of view. This caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. The lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. Imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. As this &#34;pie plate&#34; would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. It was at night so all I could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a &#34;fixed&#34; platform as the lights were revolving in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I&#39;ve heard of UFO&#39;s and was curious, at that time in my life, I didn&#39;t really give that much thought about them. I&#39;ve always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. I&#39;ve seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. I drove taxi&#39;s off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. On two occasions I&#39;ve even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . I&#39;ve read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as UFO&#39;s. I chuckled to myself thinking how easily &#34;UFO believers&#34; can be fooled by natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while I was driving about 115 kilometres per hour on the highway eastbound. These lights were getting closer and closer as &#34;we&#34; approached each other. I recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. As I kept driving, I was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. I kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. The closer it got, the more I looked at it. Now at my nine o&#39;clock position, the string of rotating lights started to bank left like an airplane would &#34;turning right&#34; At this point, I realised that these lights were not letters at all. They were different shaped, yellowish white lights. The reason these lights were different in shape was because they were &#34;ingrained&#34; into some body. When the lights were seen head on, they were circular. But as they rotated out of &#34;direct&#34; view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. That&#39;s why they appeared to be all different shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, during the time when this object started to bank left, from my point of view, I was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane or a balloon. It was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. Also, it didn&#39;t appear to be flying or floating. The best way I can describe it&#39;s motion is that it looked like it was &#34;sailing&#34; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. That&#39;s why I was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. Every time I resigned myself to what I must be witnessing, I jumped to another conclusion. This jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. I was imagining all kinds of things. For example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. This didn&#39;t make any sense at all. I&#39;ve seen advertising planes before. This was nothing like this. Not even close. Than I was trying to imagine a &#34;Goodyear blimp&#34; with these letters going across it&#39;s side. This was nothing like it either. So here I was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. As I was driving, I started to slow down because I kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. In retrospect, I don&#39;t even know how I kept my car on the road because I was so awed by this display in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the killer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object kept banking and banking more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! The first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. At this point I slowed down to about 50 KPH (30 miles an hour in a 60 MPH highway for my American friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would smash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 KPH highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the shocker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was mesmerised by this UFO, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn&#39;t realize how BIG this thing was. At first I thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. IT WAS GIGANTIC! At least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! I don&#39;t know what gave away it&#39;s size. Maybe the reflections of light on the ground. The best way I can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. You know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can&#39;t see until you stare at it for a while? After a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? That&#39;s kind of the transformation I experienced. At first I thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly I REALLY saw it. IT WAS HUGE!!! I yelled out loud to my self, &#34;HOLEY F**K, IT&#39;S HUGE!!!&#34;. I DON&#39;T F***ING BELIEVE IT, IT&#39;S F***ING HUGE!!!. I thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. Speaking about this surge of adrenaline. Have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? When your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? That&#39;s what I felt when I realised how GARGANTUAN this object was! I could literally feel my heart pounding like crazy. To be frank, It literally scared the hell out of me, when I realized how big it was. At this point, I rolled down my window and pointed to this giant &#34;ferris wheel&#34; in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. I remember how cold it was when I rolled down my window. It was something like minus 30 Celsius below zero.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, I don&#39;t know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and &#34;sail&#34; back to the direction it originally came from. I rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. Still it seemed other motorists didn&#39;t notice this object. It still irks me to this day. As I was approaching the city limits, this object was in it&#39;s flat position again climbing over the city. Then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red &#34;aircraft like&#34; blinking light (which I never noticed before). After a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. It was like in the movie &#34;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&#34;. The lights just blasted on. Than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. Strange behaviour. Now I was exiting off of the highway on to Spadina Rd. I lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. When I was on the street where I was going, I saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. I stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. He was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. I asked him, &#34;how long have you been here?&#34; I forgot what he said, but I asked, &#34;did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? He said &#34;no&#34;. After parking my car, I met my friends at the bar, &#34;Baily&#39;s&#34;, and told them what happened but they didn&#39;t take me seriously as they&#39;ve already had a few and were more interested in the ladies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After &#34;sitting at the bar by myself&#34; for a couple of hours I went home. I was living at my parent&#39;s house at the time, temporarily, so when I got home around 1 A.M., I called the police. I didn&#39;t know who else to phone at the time. They didn&#39;t take me seriously of course so after that, I phoned the Toronto International Airport and managed to get through to Air Traffic Control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a UFO report. Nothing. So I called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as I wanted to make a report. They told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. As it was late and my parents were asleep, I told them I&#39;d rather come to the station the next day to report. Next morning, when I contemplated going in I decided not to, fearing they would think I&#39;m some kind of wacko.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a &#34;UFO sighting&#34; to no avail, I started doubting myself. I was trying to convince myself that perhaps I was somehow mistaken. Maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. Maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. Maybe like thousands of others, I witnessed something that I misinterpreted for something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And now the conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the Toronto Star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! A short article. &#34;Dozens of Mississauga residents reported a UFO as big as a football field!!!&#34; I don&#39;t recall the whole article. I&#39;ll never doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule I&#39;ll be subjected to. After about 27 years, I just had to let this out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

1/11/80 23:00|Wichita|KS|Cigar|3 to 6 minutes|Cigar-shaped, city-block long, silent, super-slow forward moving and descending, three red lights, blotted out the stars w/black.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42453.html|9|ndxe198001| Cigar-shaped, city-block long, silent, super-slow forward moving and descending, three red lights, blotted out the stars w/black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A profound event happened to me on Friday, January 11, 1980.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11 p.m., CST, I returned to my then home at ---- N. Emporia, Wichita, KS, parked my car so it was facing east beside my house, turned off my headlights, and in the dark was left with a vision of an object in front of me in the sky like none I had ever seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge, cigar-shaped object located about 300 feet in the air above me, about 30 feet east in front of me so that I was not looking straight up, but rather at about an 75 degree angle. It was about a block long and blocked my view of the stars on an otherwise clear night.  It had three flashing lights in a forward-direction-pointing pattern located at its right trailing edge.  It emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever that I could hear, and I have exceptionally good hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How could something that big hover and descend in a fixed direction on a windless, clear night without making any sound? This huge object was moving ever so slowly forward north and descending ever so slowly (just a few feet per minute) towards the massive complex of over 100 Cargill grain elevators on 13th street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in my car for what seemed like at least three minutes scanning my memory for any identifiable object to match what I was seeing and I could find none.  I then got out of my car and moved closer on the ground to watch it.  I stood there for a time as well, but I seemed to lose track of time, maybe another three minutes. However long it was, I still could not come up with any sort of answer as to what I was looking at.  There was nothing in my associative memory to compare it to.  I felt profoundly awed by what I saw and I felt nauseatingly dumbfounded that I could not figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, when I could handle my unknowing no longer, I knew I had to take action.  The only traction in terms of evidence and logic my brain had to go on at the time was that there was a very large object moving downwards and in the a northerly direction toward on a path that would soon put it on a direct collision course with one of the world’s largest wheat grain elevator complexes run by Cargill, just one block away on 13th street.  I was concerned that it this huge object hit one or more of those 100 plus grain elevators, there could be a massive grain dust explosion causing extensive death and destruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once this horrific thought crossed my mind, I knew I had to call the police and warn them of this imminent danger.  I managed to pull myself out of my awestruck paralysis and go inside to make the call.  The Wichita Police were grateful for my call.  They said they had been getting reports of such an object from all over town and asked me if they could send an officer out to interview me, to which I of course agreed.  The police said they even had one of their helicopters aloft trying to locate and identify this mystery object. They also said the local McConnell Air Force Base people claimed it was not one of their activities and they may even have sent out some planes to locate and identify it, though nothing I know of was ever reported by them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got off the phone with the police, I raced back outside to see what progress this object had made.  To my complete surprise, the object was altogether gone.  I got in my car and drove around the area to the north and east and back the other way in hopes of seeing some sign of it.  I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police came out and took my detailed report, which the Wichita police records clerk says was filed January 12, 1980 under the heading, &#34;Three Flashing Lights&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter a reporter from the Wichita Eagle Beacon came out and interviewed me.  I was still in shock and awe from what I had seen, and afraid I would be considered some kind of a nut case.  Therefore, I tried to conceal my fear and defend myself from scorn by trying to appear calm and rational, even to the point of trying to normalize or even minimalize and dismiss what I had seen. I told the reporter words to the effect that it was either a very large blimp, a weather balloon, or a very elaborate little hoax.  I was pretty sure it was none of those things, but I had nothing else to reference it to and to speculate any further was quite frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before he left, the reporter gave me the name of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle and the phone number should I want to make a formal report.  I am sorry to say that I did not call that night as I was too shaken up and afraid to do so.  Big things were happening to me, it seemed, and I was already way over my head.  Therefore, lest I go crazy, it seemed best to lie low and see if the rest of the world, or some part of it, had seen what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is only now, 25 years later, that I am able to file this report, thanks mainly to the Peter Jennings ABC program aired here Thursday, 2/24/05, and viewed by me tonight, Friday, 2/25/05, via digital video recorder.  It was a great program and confirmed many of the details of what I saw and the psychological reactions people had to this experience.  Thanks to all who brought this information forward and presented it so well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very excited and have much more to say, but I know I don’t have the space to do that here.  Suffice it to say that two days later, on 1/13/1980, the Wichita Eagle/Beacon Newspaper printed the story of what I and apparently two dozen other Wichitans saw on Friday, 1/11/1980.  The article is titled &#34;It’s a Balloon, It’s a UFO, It’s a Mystery,&#34; and it appears on page 2E of the Sunday, January 13, 1980 edition of the Wichita Eagle/Beacon newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it does not seem possible to attach a scanned PDF copy of the actual newspaper article to this description, and since I realize you may not have the time or desire to look up the article from the paper’s microfiche, I will copy it, (deleting names and contact information to preserve anonymity even though all interviewees openly gave their names and addresses for publication), for you here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN TEXT OF ARTICLE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Headline:  &#34;It’s a Balloon, It’s a UFO, It’s a Mystery.&#34;  Reporter:  Susan Edgerley, Staff Writer Body<n> <n><n> <n><n> Copy:  &#34;Midnight Friday, Pharmacist (fist and last name #1) and a friend have been square dancing.

1/1/80 23:30|Chicopee|MA|Diamond|5 minutes|I heard a noise like thunder, went to the kitchen window and saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11911.html|12|ndxe198001| I heard a noise like thunder, went to the kitchen window and saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up hearing a noise like thunder.  Out of my bedroom window I saw an orange fireball flying by, so I went into the kitchen to look out the window and told my sister to come and see the meteor coming down.  When I opened the curtains my sister and I saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.  It was about ten feet wide and had large green lights on the points of the diamond.  A very low rumbling sound shook the house, the window glass was rattling and the sound seemed to be going through my chest.  We watched it for a few minutes, then the thing slid off the porch roof horizontally, then lifted up and flew away.  It was blacker than the sky, and it seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  Then 4 jets from the Westover Air Force Base chased it but were far too slow to catch up with it. My sister and I started to walk out of the kitchen, but I don&#39;t remember going to bed.  I woke up a few hours later, my parents were home and they were yelling at my sister because she was sitting in front of the TV with her eyes bugged out, shaking.  Then I noticed that I was tucked into bed with my slippers on, which I had not been wearing when I got up to look at the object.  My hair was spread out on the pillow and my arms were crossed mummy-style when I woke up.  My door was locked, so my parents had not tucked me in-- and I was too old for that anyway, since I was 14 at the time. The strangest thing is that I never spoke to my sister about this, and I had a false memory of having told my best friend about it.  It was five years before I fully remembered what had happened.<n>
1/1/80 19:00|Yorkeys Knob (North of Cairns) (QLD, Australia))||Other|2 - 10 minutes|1 slow moving UFO rising from East (ocean) to West, on straight path, rectangular/cylindrical shape.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44259.html|13|ndxe198001| 1 slow moving UFO rising from East (ocean) to West, on straight path, rectangular/cylindrical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I resided at a house on Deauville Close, Yorkeys Knob, (near Cairns), Queensland, Australia.  I remember I was in primary school, but I can&#39;t remember the exact date of the event, I&#39;m pretty sure it happened in 1980, but I&#39;m not sure of the day/month.  It was in the evening, my family was having dinner, I was late &amp; they were calling me for dinner.  I was looking out my bedroom window, I liked to look at the stars at night, the blocks next door were vacant bushland and I had a good view of the stars.  We lived on the beachfront, there were some dunes covered in scrub between our house and the beach.  I remember this event so clearly, it haunts me, at the time I was mesmerised by it.  I called out to my family - &#34;mum, dad, come look, there&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  They didn&#39;t come, they were eating, and laughed at me from the other room.  To this day my family still sometimes recall my &#34;story&#34; and still make fun of me.  If only they had seen what I saw that night.  The UFO did not look like any picture of a UFO that I&#39;ve seen - it was a different shape altogether.  It rose from over the low bushland near the sea, I first saw it when it was about 10 or 20 metres above the ground, I watched it come in from the East/sea, and it moved along a straight path westward, slowly rising.  It seemed to fly so amazingly low, near my house it seemed to fly above the block next door (that I was looking toward from my bedroom window), my bedroom was on ground floor, and the UFO seemed only about twice the height of the black wattle tree next door - probably only 20 to 40 metres up in the air - I couldn&#39;t beleive how close it was.  Somehow it then continued it&#39;s path westward, gliding more towards the south west gently, getting higher and higher, it rose over the tall trees of the swamp at the southern end of the cul-de-sac, and I could no longer see it over the horizon of trees/swamp.  It glided along a smooth straight path the whole time, and it moved so slowly.  I don&#39;t know exactly how fast it moved, it seemed like the pace of someone pedalling along on a bike, maybe 2 minutes?  It seemed forever, but I think that was because of the mind bending experience.  As for the UFO&#39;s appearance - it was NOT a saucer.  There were no little green men.  I did not seen any aliens at all.  But it had a soft glow around it.  The outer seemed greyish, but my eyes were focused in it&#39;s front face - you could see into the front of it, but all I could see was a light pale soft yellow colour, there was no detail.  It was cylindrical in shape - the same sort of shape as a rectangle, but with rounded edges, and not very deep.  It was smooth all over, rounded at the corners, and I could only see into the front, I don&#39;t remember seeing into the back (it was a long time ago).  The shape was sort of like this (it was rectangular, like a long/thin/wide cylinder, kind of a cigar shape from the side, but rectangular if looked at from the top or bottom): Side view: --------- <n>         <n> ---------  Front view: ----- (     ) -----  Underside or top view: --------- <n>         <n> <n>         <n> ---------  That&#39;s the best sort of scale I can get using typed characters!  Remember it was smooth in shape and edges were round, not sharp.  But the front view did have notably rounded sides, like the &#39;()&#39; characters.  To this day I know I saw it, but I doubt myself all the time and it has messed with my self confidence as a result, I was double check things that I do now as a result.  But I know what I saw was a UFO.  It also made NO sound, which was spooky as it was so close to the ground and my house, it made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I&#39;m not sure how old I was but my next memory is my third birthday.I remember a gift that I got and I also remember having this first memory at that time.I can recall even at that age a want to hold on to it and I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am lying on my back in the grass.It is night and there is cool a lite breeze.I remember this because I could feel it blowing my hair around.It tickled my forhead.I felt very at ease and calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was so beautiful.It was filled with dozens of geometric shapes.There were many different colors and they had a soft internal glow that bordered on translucence.They were very soothing and I felt that they were my friends.I know that they were soothing me,like a mother would a child.I cant explain in words what I felt inside but it was like communicating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration is probably about 2-5 minutes.Throughout my childhood,it was always my strongest memory and inspired me in everything I did.I&#39;ve always thought that it is what sparked my curiosity about sciece at an early age(got my first shock at 5 by poking around in a telephone outlet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow,when I was 13,I went to live with my grandparents as a result of my mothers death.I stayed in my dads old room.At about the age of 15,I started having weird dreams.There were so many that I cannot remember the chronology,but I will state some.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the first was one in which I was having a dream about eating cereal.I thought I started to fall back in the chair and got that rushing,falling into oblivion feeling,that woke me up.I was lying flat on my back in bed and someone approached me from the left.I couldn&#39;t move.From here it gets a little foggy,from terror I think,but &#34;he&#34; lifted my shirt up to my armpit then used something to cut me just under my left nipple.It didnt hurt but I was very scared.I then felt a horrible,numb,type of pain.A pulling sensation coming from the area where I was cut.I couldnt turn my head to see,but out of the corner of my eye,I could see him pulling out a piece of tissue.The pain was incredible.That all I remember until the next morning.My chest was a little sore and I had light scratch in the exact area where he cut me.I also have no muscle in the lower portion of my left breast.I&#39;m 25 years old today,I work out,and I still have no muscle in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another dream is one where I wake up in the middle of the night.There is a pink hazy light coming from my window.I get up and look out.It looks like daytime on an overcast day except in pink.I look to see what time it is and my clock is not on.No power in the whole house,so I dont know what time it is.I had a very strange feeling at this point and decided to go outside.The sky was overcast and pink.Where I live was only a mile north of Rosenblatt Stadium and you could see it from the backyard.We also weren&#39;t to far from S.A.C,so on some days you could wee jets flying in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went around to the back and was shocked to se the sky filled with U.F.O.&#39;s.Discs,cylinders,pyramids,spheres,Etc.I also felt that they saw me,or better yet,were waiting for me.I dont remember anything after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many more but I am no good at typing and am tiring already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day I got up the guts to bring them up to my dad, &#34;jokingly&#34;,and he later confided in me similar experieces he had as a young man in that house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of 18,I moved to AZ and the dreams stopped.I moved back to a rural part of NE 1 yr later.I have been here for almost 7 yrs now.The dreams have started again and now they involve my young son.This also coincides with a recent sighting of a U.F.O.(it was on the news,on tape).I really wish they would stop.I call them dreams but honestly,there is nothing more real at the time.I&#39;ve never told anyone else about them before,and feel kind of silly,but I need to get it off of my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this isn&#39;t a specific &#34;sighting&#34;,but I had to get it out.Sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

1/1/80 01:00|Indianapolis|IN|Light|7 minutes|Very bright green light without sound moved over me and my car from a wooded area about a 1000 ft. up.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56902.html|15|ndxe198001| Very bright green light without sound moved over me and my car from a wooded area about a 1000 ft. up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left my brothers house on new years eve late that night.  The new year had been in only about an hour.  As I got about a mile away from my brothers home, I noticed this &#34;very bright light&#34; in the distance, coming out of the sky and going down to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t pay it any attention until I got closer to the source about two more miles towards home.  As I came up on this main street, this bright light came out of the sky again, and I thought it was a police hellicopter on some kind of patrol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then, &#34;I notice, there was NO noise coming from the light at all&#34; and the light was &#34;GREEN&#34;, and it was glowing on me, my whole car, and around the area I and my car was in, about a 20 feet area.  I looked at my car, and it was green inside and out, and freen all over me.  It was so strange because no one else one on the mostly busy road but me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The quite bright green light withdrew back up in the air to the source, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the strange things of it was there was a great &#34;silent&#34; during the whole thing, no noise of any motor, just silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in that week, I noticed others on the t.v. news across the nation noticed the very same thing as I did, the bright light with a green glow that was too bright to look at.  I didn&#39;t tell my wife about it til about a month later.<n>
