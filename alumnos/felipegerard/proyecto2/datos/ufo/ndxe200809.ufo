It was shortly after sundown with some lingering clouds that were illuminated brightly because of the bright moon.  Looking distantly towards the north/northwest I saw an object with a reddish glow move from the east to the west.  The light did not blink, so my first thought was that the object was the space station flying overhead.  It had been a few years since I&#39;ve seen the space station overhead, so I was excited to see it again.  But then I realized that the trajectory was not they typical pattern the space station orbits over the earth.  As I began to realize that this object was possibly not the space station, another object with a flashing light akin to an aircraft or fighter jet began to follow the first object.  It sped up as if it were trying to catch up to it and then when it got to a certain distance from the first object, it locked in the same speed and maintained its course and distance with the first object.  I watched for a few more seconds before I lost view of both objects behind the clouds.  This could have occurred either over Fort Bragg or Pope AFB or just to the north of these military installations.  I am located about 2 miles south of the Reilly gate of Fort Bragg. No noises were heard and no definitive shapes could be identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

While on the playground during recess, a student spotted a white object hovering approximately 1000-1500 feet in the air.  The object appeared to be white with two large spheres on one side and what appeared to be an elongated cylinder on the other side.  It was almost triangular, but it was two spheres and a flat, cylindrical shape.  We thought it was possibly a weather balloon at first, but it was rotating at a constant speed and height as it moved slowly across the sky.  It seemed to be almost scanning the ground.  I also thought it could be some type of flying camera taking pictures of the area after Hurricane Ike or for some type of internet &#34;earth map&#34; because it maintained the same speed and altitude. The object was near the descent pattern for Houston Intercontinental Airport, but it was too slow and was obviously not an airplane, helicopter, or blimp.  The object made no sound as it moved across the sky.  I wanted to go inside and get my camera, but I didn&#39;t want to alarm any of the other students.  I also thought the object would be out of view by the time I returned from my classroom.  Only a small crowd gathered to watch the object as the other students played on the playground.  I am skeptical of stories I have read about UFOs, but I did witness an object that is unidentifiable.  Please let me know if there is a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/08 08:00|Norcross|GA|Other|10 minutes|((HOAX??))  Huge black blimpe object hovering/flying over  Norcross Georgia!!|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66882.html|4|ndxe200809| Huge black blimpe object hovering/flying over  Norcross Georgia!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Norcross, Georgia.  This sighting was on Sept. 31 2008, I was walking down Holcomb bridge road coming from Peachtree Corners/Holcomb bridge rd. area  heading toward the intersection of Holcomb bridge rd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was approaching the plaza/parking lot where Blockbuster and Papa John’s Pizza is located, I notice a huge black object in the sky directly in front of me.  It was hovering over the area where Peachtree Ind. Blvd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd. intersect.  The object was shaped like a “Blimp” but much bigger! The outline of this object was easy to see, but the actual body appeared like a “ink smudge” no real texture (wasn’t solid)(The object was a little higher than tree level) As I was looking at it, I notice a young man coming toward me,and I stopped him and pointed to the sky and asked him did he see that and if he knew what it was.  I wanted to make sure I was not seeing things!  The young man turned and looked up (it was behind him) and he could not explain it either.  He was the one that pointed out something that was hanging down toward the back of it. We talked for a few second and he continued on his way.  Once I focused on the rear end of the object, it was then that I was able to see some sort of ‘wavy like aurora’ somewhat smoky looking around the back area.  I continue to watch it as I was walking (not very fast), when I got close to the CITGO gas station I notice a small airplane coming south down Peachtree Ind. Toward the object.  I stopped and waited to see if the airplane was going to change directions or something to avoid running into this object also I wanted to compare the size of the airplane to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airplane was coming from my left as I faced the object toward its front end.  I could clearly hear and see the airplane but when the airplane approached the object, (the objected did not move) it passed thru the top portion of the object!!  As it flew thru the object I lost sight of the airplane, but I could hear it and I stayed focused until it emerged from the other side.  The airplane continued south on Peachtree Ind., as if that big black object was not even there!!  By now, I am getting very confused about what this thing is and I wondered if the people driving could see it!  I start walking again still looking at it.  I was walking to the Chic-fila on Peachtree Parkway and I usually walk thru all the parking lots on Holcomb Bridge.  When I reached Holcomb bridge rd. heading toward Panera’s, I start loosing sight of it because of the trees.  When I came to the first parking lot where RBC bank is at, I looked to my right and there it was!  I almost felt as though it was following me because I do not walk fast and I figured it would be gone by the time I get from the area with all the trees.  The object was now flying north on Peachtree Ind. Blvd., heading toward Duluth!  I watched it pass the Holiday Inn Hotel; at Holcomb Bridge and PIB it then started to pick up speed but continue flying along PIB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object until it looked like a black spot in the sky.  After it got up in the Duluth area, it appeared to stop at the bottom right of the sun!  The sky was blue and free of clouds this morning and this object was completely black.  I know people traveling up and down PIB had to see it.  Anyone in Chic-fila’s drive thru, anyone coming in -out of Paneras had to notice it. It was large to miss!  If anyone seen this Object that morning please report it, I would like to know what it was.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It was Strange &amp; Scary!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is a hoax.  Witness indicates a date of September 31, which does not exist.

9/30/08 01:25|Las Vegas|NM|Diamond|2 minutes|4 Lights moving in unison then diappeared after a sudden bright flash of light over Mora county, NM|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66407.html|6|ndxe200809| 4 Lights moving in unison then diappeared after a sudden bright flash of light over Mora county, NM<n> <n><n> <n><n> On early Tuesday morning September 30, 2008, a very dark, clear, and cool night I was driving west on NM state road 120.  Near mile marker 31 I stopped and parked facing west next to a white gate on the south side of the road.  Immediately after putting the vehicle in park I looked out my front passenger side window facing north and watched 4 lights in a diamond shape configuration moving south in unison then change direction traveling east.  I noticed the time was 1:25am.  They were solid white amber lights facing down toward the ground. The lights did not blink or flash or change color. I stepped outside of my vehicle and watched the lights with a pair of binoculars and did not notice anything different as for changing colors or flashing lights.  I kept watching with and without binoculars as it traveled in an easterly direction.  Then as I looked again for it with my binoculars I noticed a bright flash of white light thru the binoculars.  I did not see the source of the flash or where it emanated from but it did appear to come from the direction the lights were traveling in.  I was unable to keep track of these lights because they flew behind the horizon of a hill about a ½ mile just to the north of where I stood.   My friend on the passenger seat observed the lights in motion and the sudden bright flash of white light.   I have been a outdoorsman my whole life and know this region very well.  I am very familiar with aircraft because aircraft is a hobby and so is the night sky.   There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky that night.  And I don’t know what the heck caused that bright flash of light to occur.  It was just like a flash of lighting at night going off in the distance is what the flash of light resembled.   Even with binoculars I never got the impression or suggestion that “ahh…its an airplane or a jet…”.   It was different and certainly something I had never witnessed before.   This great little experience lasted no more than 2 minutes.  After this occurred I got back insi! de the v ehicle and turned around to travel east to look for these lights about a ½ mile to a mile from where I was parked to get away from the hill that blocked our view and was unable to find these lights again.  Below is a simple sketch of the light configuration I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Felton Delaware<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to go pick up my friend and this thing that looked like an airplane flew over my car in the driveway really, really, low.  It had about 8 huge headlights that were white and really bright and a blinking red light in the center of it.  I actually stopped to look at it because it was so strange.  When I went and got my friend I told her about it and she said I was stupid.  On our way back to my house I pointed it out to her and it was hovering over some woods on my road, it was very big.  My friend started freaking out and I tried to follow it.  When I stopped in the neighborhood next to mine to sit and watch for it, I was outside my other friend’s house and told him to come outside.  He came outside and we stood and waited for it to appear, at this point all of it’s white head lights were off, and we could only see the blinking read light.  All of the sudden the thing turned around and all of the lights were back on.  It was headed straight towards us and was still very low so I got back in my car and went home to tell my parents.  I recorded it on my cell phone but it is a very shaky picture because I was nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the father of the above witness, I can confirm the video phone evidence is very impressive.<n>

He described a black triangular craft with a huge yellow beam projecting from the front, and some other lights around the edges.  It was moving extremely slowly, just above our house, went between the house and guest house, then over the trees beyond. It made a &#34;weooo-weooo-weooo&#34; sound.  To my knowledge, stealth planes don&#39;t move that slowly, so we are curious and wanted to report this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I reported it to the San Jose FAA Operation Unit, and they said they had received similar reports from that night, but that they believed it must be a helicopter.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be sincere.

In the middle of the conversation my mom looks out our window and yells, &#34;Oh my God! There&#39;s a plane on fire!” We both then ran to our back deck and saw what looked like two bright, orange and yellow hazy triangular objects heading southbound. We thought it was two planes, possibly heading to Scott Airforce Base, on fire until the two bright somewhat triangular objects intertwined and switched sides. This definitely decreased the possibility of the objects being airplanes on fire. My mom contacted 911 and as she was on the phone the objects disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for our backgrounds, my mom is 45 and a RN and I am 14 year old girl.

It was a little later than usual, somewhere between 8-8:30 p.m., but I wanted to go for the walk regardless.  I had just made it up the hill from my house when I thought I heard a sudden mass of car horns blasting at the same time in the distance.  I looked around and then got a throbbing sensation in my head.  In a natural motion I just looked up and saw a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not seem to produce light since it seemed very bright but I did not have to squint to look right at it.  It appeared quite large but still a good distance over my head.  It then abruptly seemed to retract itself, as if being spotted, straight back and then made one or two zigzag motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light quickly got further and further away it seemed to give off something like a vapor trail, but more the consistency of smoke, as it picked up speed.  I watched it until it was the size of a pin-point and then completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in probably no more than 30 seconds.  I did not feel threatened at all but continued with a slight throbbing in my head and behind my right eye for the duration of my walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned home safely and have had no adverse reactions.  My son and dog appear to have not noticed anything and show no symptoms either.  All in all, back to normal.<n>

I did see hints of other colors, but very dim in comparison.  The movements made it impossible to be a helicopter, plane, or anything known to the public that I&#39;m familiar with.  No sound either.  We have been watching the sky a lot since hurricane Ike. Unbelievable bright, the brightest thing I&#39;ve seen except, for when we saw the same exact thing from the same vantage point, in January I think, and then we saw the news that thousands all over texas had seen them, and people in houston saw the same thing we did, that&#39;s why I&#39;m reporting it this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped to lay down and look at the stars. Upon looking up a triangular shape caught my eye. It had just become dark and for a split second I thought it was a weird bird. Then I looked at how it flew, from east to west, then back again, then in a circle. I asked my daughter if she saw it and she said, &#34;Yes I do. What is it? Is it a ghost or a demon or a spaceship?&#34; It moved very gracefully, then turned south and began to fly over us. It never increased or decreased in speed. It appeared as a triangle with a hollow center, sort of like a boomerang with stripes. There were no lights but some sort of very small illumination like a glow which gave it the ghostly appearance. It was gray, a light gray and made no sound at all. The thing continued to fly, very smoothly and gracefully, to the south until we could no longer see it. About a minute later what looked like a star, just a simple star, began to zigzag across the sky. It disappeared twice and then flew to the southeast. We went inside and told my boyfriend, who laughed at us. Then one of my other children suggested we draw what we saw (the triangular thing) in opposite rooms. We did and the pictures are identical. This concerns me as I&#39;ve had weird things happen to me all my life - playing with strange objects in my room as a small child (that no one else ever knew about as they visited me at 3 a.m. or so), a triangle cut into my back in the middle of the night (as with a laser) that I never felt happen, a metal rod instered into my heel that I never remember the trauma of receiving (showed up on an x ray).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One moved to the west away from us, the other to the east right above us. It was higher than a plane would normally be but still appeared big with no noise. It moved overhead and appeared to slow down almost coming to a stop, moved in a strtaight line very very slightly to the right and moved on picking up speed but never moving overly fast....then poooph, it was gone. During this we also thought it strange that we saw 3 shooting stars and 3 satalites........anyone else see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was very low in the sky and kind of looked like the ball out of a roman candle. However, it moved from north to south across the eastern sky fairly low and there were no other ones before or after it appeared. There was no sound associated with it and it quickly disappeared with no visible smoke or anything left behind leading me to think it was not any type of firework. It was also too low in the sky to be  shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed the lights moving slightly, appearing to be hovering in the distance, like stars. Then, they moved dramatically, and appeared to get much closer, as the lights got brighter and bigger. They changed positions rapidly, several times, moving across the sky. Then one went north, and the other went east and disappeared or faded from view very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was much brighter than all other stars, etc. At first, I had the unusual sensation that all the stars were moving while this object remained still. It was as bright as a car headlight in the sky, but not clear light, simply white. I always look for flashing lights, and this had none. Also,no noise. Dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved fairly slowly to the north for about a minute or so, seemingly getting farther away (as if gaining altitude). All of a sudden it dimmed to the point that I could only locate it with my peripheral vision. It stayed on it&#39;s path, but was barely visible. After another few seconds, I lost it in the very clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought is that before I noticed it, it must have been lower and directly over my house. Scary. This is the second possible sighting of my life, with about 18 years in between. The older was was a way different scenario, and an apprently different type of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very open-minded, but not stupidly so. There may some explanation for what I saw, but it could have been otherwordly as well. Just kinda weird.<n>

My parents were vacationing in St. Pete, Florida on Sept. 28th, 2008, and were driving on US-19 at around 9 P.M. when they noticed the clear outline of a large, dark, diamond-shaped object that seemed to be hovering three-fourths of a mile to the side of the roadway. The diamond-shaped outline could be observed as it blotted out the stars and all other light from behind it, and even more noticeable: a row of brightly-lit windows stretched down the length of the object. They described the object as large as a house, but probably even larger, due to its distance from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents had slowed down considerably to observe the object, and they described the object as “hovering”, because not only did it appear to be totally motionless in relation to their speed, but it also appeared totally motionless in relation to other low-altitude planes and aircraft, which were moving normally even while the object receded behind them as they drove on. They also described the object as being well above the horizon and high in the sky, not apart of or constituting any kind of ground structure, such as a building or power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents actually turned around at the next available opportunity, some five or ten minutes later, and drove past the area where they had seen the object, but could not find any trace of it; instead, they did observe three helicopters flying in unison and passing in the direction they had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic was somewhat heavy at this time, and my parents were wondering if anyone else had observed this object and had reported in.  You can contact me via email, or via phone for further questions or to speak with my parents directly.  Thanks a lot.<n>

We were taking a walk around our neighborhood in Flagstaff when I looked up at the northeast night sky and saw the constellation Cassiopeia. I immediately noticed something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cassiopeia looks like a W or a crown in the night sky but it looked much different tonight. I immediately noticed what looked like two bright stars (about as bright as Jupiter was tonight) in the bottom left hand of the W. They looked like two bright white satellites only they weren&#39;t moving. We watched them for probably 10 to 15 seconds and they didn&#39;t appear to move at all which I knew was strange. Then they slowly moved in formation off to the northeast and got dimmer as they moved that direction. I kept track of them for a while but then lost them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be high up there like they were in space, and there were no blinking lights so they couldn&#39;t have been planes. If they were planes, they sure didn&#39;t move like them, sitting still and then moving. My wife and I both saw these objects and couldn&#39;t explain what they were. The whole thing lasted for about a minute from when we first saw them to when they started moving and disappeared.<n>

Within a minute we were all watching a triangle shaped object fly along into the distance and out of sight. I know it was something. It has no lights on it. The only reason we could see it was from the reflecting lights off the city. It looked like a fog..a triangle shaped fog. Silent. I mean we were in a park at night time. The city park has no lights.

One friend said what is that. She described it as a long skinny star that blinked.  None of us could see it.  We kept telling her it was a cluster of stars or a sattlelight. But she said when it lit up, it was faded and if it were a cluster stars, why would they all blink? So I moved to her side of the hot tub and had her point out where it was in coordinance to the little dipper, and she said 12:00. Then the other girl and I saw it.  As soon as we all were saying that is weird, a big flash happend under it and went black. Kind of like someone throwing a blanket over it or like big wings<n>

Then a second orb came from the same direction and followed the same path in the sky and then, as the first, just seemed to disappear.  About 4 minutes later a fourth one travelled the same path, except this time, before the third one disappeared, a fourth appeared and we now had two in the sky at the same time.  The last two disappeared just as the two before.  There was no sound.  They appeared to be glowing and moving rather slowly across the sky.

I looked and then realized that shouldn&#39;t be in that spot of the night sky (facing N/NW at a very low altitude). I went inside and grabbed my husband, and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  At first he thought it was a planet until it started flashing. It never moved, but kept getting brighter and putting off red and blue flashes, though it seemed like it was just one light or object that the flashes were coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and grabbed the binoculars and realized it was actually a cluster of 3 lights, white, red, and blue. My husband and I took turns on and off with the binoculars, while the other watched with the naked eye.  You couldn’t see it with the naked eye, but in the binoculars you could see that at first the lights were horizontally aligned, then would instantly change, though you couldn’t see the transition (even in the binoculars), to a pyramid shape, then to one on top of the other, with the third next to it. The lights pulsed one at a time, going around the formation. They were very rhythmic in their movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 or 20 minutes later, it still hadn&#39;t moved, when a plane came close to it. The plane had to suddenly adjust its course and go up and over it very quickly. As it did this, the lights jerked sideways, like they were moving out of the way. All in all, the lights stayed for almost 45 minutes in the same spot, and were relatively low, lower than normal air traffic. The plane was a small plane, headed right towards centennial airport.  There wasn&#39;t a sound associated with the lights, though you could hear the small plane as it flew past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then moved down and our vantage point was blocked by a tree across the parking lot from our apartment building, then reappeared at the top of the tree line.   The light then faded, almost like it was receding and heading N, NW, but staying at the same elevation, and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, the “event” lasted close to an hour.  We were facing the N/NW, in castle rock, the northern area, facing Sedalia, with RT 85/Santa Fe directly west of our apartment.  The “object” was no more than a mile or so away I’d say, and not very high in the air, maybe 200-500 ft?<n>

I called out &#39;what is that&#39; ran in and grabbed my camera hoping it would still be visible when i went back out. its a Canon PowerShot A590 and the first clearer picture was taken on normal. The rest are on 16x zoom. Interesting the rest are all dark and you can just about make out the object.  Fading daylight but skies still blue at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner heard me shout out and came rushing down the stairs asking what was up, I told him and he took a while to locate the object and then ran in and got my binoculars that are in the kitchen drawer, he had trouble locating it through the binoculars but when he did he said that it was coloured green and red. He suspects they were heliem balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought i&#39;d report it anyway as you never know. I think id go with helium balloons too as an alternative to a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an aside the aircraft in the vicinity was a plane on the landing path of Gatwick Airport.<n>

I have witnessed this object before in 1996 in Fremont California,  and two times in Santa Clara California. I have totall witnessed this sphere lingering in the sky a total of 4 times in my life. The Vegas I finally had witnesess. This was no weather ballon, satallite, It flew below the flight paths of approximately 9 jets that flew above at about 20k - 30k feet in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and aircraft mechanic and a broker and appraiser on the side. I believe these objects &#34; spheres &#34; are real. I could not determine a very definate shape because of its distances. I noticed that they always maintain their distance. I wanted to report it this time. The sky was clear with 10 to 15 not winds on the ground. The color appeared white. There was only one. We took no video or pictures, but the same sphere videos are all over youtube. So many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object seemed to maintain its position due East and was flashing.  This rate of flash seemed to follow an erratic pattern in terms of time.  I observed this object for about 10 minutes and it seemed to vanish behind the lowest layer of clouds and reappeared during this 10 min. duration and then again vanished with no return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remarkable aspects of this object were that it seemed to maintain its position and the major characteristic was that it was mostly made up of light which was visible in the afternoon sunlight.  In other words, this object hovered too long for it to be an airplane and too high to be a helicopter and noticed its light emissions in the bright sunlight.  When I turned away 180 degrees for a brief moment (for about 45 seconds after 5 minutes into my observation) and then turned back 180 degrees and looked back at the approximate direction of this object, it was visible in the exact spot of my last view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure of the altitude of this object because I do not know the size. My opinion is that this object was quite large and that it was much higher in altitude than say an airplane flying at about 15,000 skipping in and out of the view against the lower layer of clouds.  I am unsure of the color and shape of this object but I can describe it by stating that it resembled a drop of mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other bathers present; however, I am unaware if these bathers noticed this anomaly.  There was a seagull flying in the distance and I did not remember seeing any planes in the air.  I also noticed a ship heading South about 5 to 10 miles due East of my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They remained together but there was some movement or flashing?? I could not make it out clearly but thought it could have been 2 balloons and perhaps they were turning, with one side being reflective to cause the flash I was seeing. The speed  was minimal, they seemed to be floating along but so high up and no clouds to tell if they were going with a breeze or not. They came from the northeast and drifted southwest. I had time to run in the house, get my camera and take one photo before the trees obscured my view. I was surprised the photo shows 2 lights of different colors,one round and one more oval, and something darker between them that is difficult to make out due to the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also witnessed the 3 red lights in Tinley Park a few years ago and reported it. There were a few sightings of 3 red lights forming a triangle. My friend and I watched this one night. Then a few months later many people saw the same thing occuring on Halloween night. So many people were outside and saw it, Perhaps its this time of year we should be looking at the skies again in Tinley Park!<n>

I was around exit 14 when suddenly a seemingly stationary silver, metallic, oval-shaped object caught my eye out of the left side of my peripheral view. I focused on it for what could have been no longer than about 10 to 15 seconds before it suddenly vanished before my very eyes. Before the object in the sky vanished, I started to ask my fiancé if she had seen it as well. Before I could finish, she immediately confirmed that she did also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first sighting of this object, my fiancé and I continued to search the sky in that general area. When about  no more that 20 seconds later, the object seemed to appear in the same direction as before, but it appeared smaller or further away. (I have no way of knowing the distance between the two sightings) This second occurrence seemed to last around 10 to 15 seconds and was again stationary, when it suddenly vanished while I was viewing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I the fiancé, of the first reportee was sitting in the passenger seat when out of the left side I witnessed a silver, metallic, oval-shaped object for approximately 10-15 seconds. I saw the object move slightly towards the left and then more so towards the right very briefly, then I saw it vanish. After a few seconds of conversation with my fiancé (without eye contact because I was searching for the object in the sky…) I continued to look in that general area in the sky and witnessed the object for a second time after about 20 seconds or so. This time I saw the object of what seemed to be  a further distance, however this time I saw no movement before it vanished and only lasted about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Confirming… I too, saw these objects in the sky on September 27, 2008 at approximately 11:30 a.m. in Florida (near the Tampa area) heading westbound on I-4 driving towards the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.<n>

After a while of shooting, my friend told me to come to where he was and pointed out what looked like a star that was changing colors from a pinkish color to green to white, blue and yellow.  We both thought the color changing was strange, but he told me to keep watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later, the color changing light moved very erratically up and to the right.  The movement was similar to what a sheet of paper would do if you dropped it, only moving upwards instead of down.  We both watched it for a while, trying to figure out what it was.  We thought it might be an airplane or helicopter, but the movement was not like any type of aircraft that I know of.  The colors were also not that of aircraft that I know of.  Sometimes the movement was kind of slow, others it moved a great distance very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a while, and after a while we both had to get some sleep, and went to bed.  We both thought about reporting it, but figured nobody would believe us, and think that since we are photographers that we were trying to pull off some sort of hoax.  We were both very confused just trying to figure out what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I talked to my brother about it that I decided to report it.  He told me it sounded similar to the lights sighted over Stephenville, Texas, recently.  I looked for photos of this event online, and found something that was very similar to what I had shot, and decided that I should report the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo is shot with a 300mm lens fully zoomed in for 5 seconds (on a tripod).  The second photo is just a cropped image to enlarge detail.  No editing was done to either photo, except for cropping of the second image.<n>

All lights were out and we were scanning the sky for satellites and falling stars when an object appeared over our heads moving north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be very high and very large.  It was either one craft in a triangle form with three dim lights up each side and one at the point (seven total), or it was seven separate craft flying in a &#34;V&#34; formation. The latter may be more plausible because I am pretty sure that I could see &#34;through&#34; the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with this craft and no sonic boom even though it appeared to be moving very fast. The craft was dim and disappeared quickly.<n>

As I do if i&#39;m out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just below the constelattion was a small star, same size as the others and same colour as the rest of the stars but it was moving very very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may well have been a satellite or the space station but after witnessing both of these on many occasions I found it a little odd that it was so distant and so slow.  I find satellites tend to leave a trail as a shooting star should and are fast and the space station when we see it is very bright.  first time we saw the space station i thought it was some kind of spy plane.<n>

I saw what I initially thought was a bright star. As we stood, it became apparent that the light was moving extremely slowly towards the right. The light appeared stationary to look at, but over time it moved quite a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a white/silvery light, and appeared to have a shape behind the light. It seemed to not be at a great distance from us - very much nearer than the stars which were visible nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through binoculars, it appeared to be a white globe, with a tail shape at the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the shape for approx 45 minutes - we had to keep moving to keep it in our sight as it&#39;s journey was taking it behind trees, blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw one airplane flying in the general direction of the light and believe the people on board must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then lost sight of it for around 10-15 minutes as we came in the house to make telephone calls to the local airport and UFO society.

As it flew overhead it took a very quick and bizzare little jog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see that it was triangular in shape as the sky was not completely dark yet.

I was heading East toward the Las Vegas Blvd. the road that I was on is probably 200 yards in length, it is a residential road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove down the road, I was able to see The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, this is a very tall building. nothing out of the ordinary at first as i turned onto this road that headed East. Maybe halfway down, I noticed a large sphere, golden and radiant, it looked like the light from a lighthouse shining directly at someone, but with a perfect bright sphere shape. This sphere was hovering in place perhaps 2/3s of the height of the Stratosphere building. slightly to left of the building from my perspective, which would make the sphere be on the North side of the building, 2/3s of the way up. I wasnt sure what it was and immediately it peaked my curiosity as soon as I saw it, it didnt really change in brightness from what i could tell, I was in a moving car. As soon as i got to the end of the street, i turned right (South) and the stratosphere was now being blocked by a commercial building across the street that i turned right onto. When i saw the stratosphere again, maybe 20 ft after made the turn, the sphere was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a black helicopter heading toward the stratosphere from the North, and it looked like it was flying around the same height of where the sphere was. There should be a point made that there is no way that the helicopter could have been the sphere i saw, because the helicopter was MILES North of the Stratosphere, headed TOWARD the Hotel.  I did not see the bright sphere again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this was around 6pm, and in las vegas it is still very bright at 6pm, so it would make no sense for a massive light to just be hovering around buildings, especially that close to one.<n>

I sat there for about fifteen minutes, I was already sick and I felt ...as crazy as this sounds... an external &#39;annoyed/go inside/getting sick&#39; that wasn&#39;t my mind or emotions. As if something was annoyed at me for being so reckless, sitting in the cold while sick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly got urgent. &#39;Go home&#39; I literally heard. As if I was in danger sitting there, beyond getting the flu of a lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I know this sounds like a prank and I feel crazy for admitting I heard/felt that, but you wanted to know everything...) I walked home and as I stood on the driveway, I had lost my key and I sat down outside. I sat there for about five minutes, waiting for housemate to finish putting baby to bed so she could let me in, and I saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about fifty metres away, the size of half a penlid, and coming diagonally towards me.  It was heading straight for the park.  It was a saucer shape, had some lights... that blurred in my eyes so I cannot say how many but some were larger than others... and I suddenly felt like it was lookingfor me, expecting me at the park, and that I HAD to get indoors. It made no noise, even though it was low down, we have planes that cross over much higher that we can hear (They don&#39;t follow the path it took and they are much much higher, always the same route for them.)... it was close, low, and it was upwind, but I still heard no sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got inside as soon as I could and even though I felt scared, I for some reason went to my room. I lay down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up about 23:00, feeling like I had woken from being under general anesthetic (I had surgery in 07 so I remember the feeling well), all groggy and strange.  Soon I went back to sleep and slept it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see many planes going over us but none follow the route this UFO took, they are all heard easily, and they never come down as low as it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen one UFO before this, but I can&#39;t remember what date it was as I was a child, and a strange event happened to me when I was about three or four years old. A huge flash of light during a thunderstorm and more... sound, something outside... but not a lightning bolt (see below), I was scared suddenly beyond anything I&#39;d ever felt(even though I had been watching the storm for about an hour and was used to the lightning), I thought lightning had struck the window... it was that bright, that incredible. I assumed it was a lightning strike outside the window because of the sound/something there...<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I went to parent&#39;s room, they hadn&#39;t heard or seen a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that day on, I was scared of one type of alien only. ALl others I liked to watch in movies... not that we really watched any at that age...but from that age right to now, I cannot watch sci-fi movies with one particular type of alien. It wasn&#39;t that I&#39;d been exposed to alien movies as a child, I was only a toddler... it just always was, I always knew about them, I literally grew up knowing, like I know that there are lions in Africa type of know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s only recently, since I moved out of that house and bedroom, that I allowed myself to think it was more than a lightning strike. There&#39;s a similar flash on youtube of a possible abduction with a big flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;ve always had things happen, always seen things, always known.<n>

I looked in the sky to see four circular lights flying in a square :: formation.  At first I figured it was an airplane until it registered how fast they were going and that there was no noise whatesoever.  I then saw them change formation into what appeared was going to be a V shape formation, but then changed into a diagonal line (from my perspective at least) like so .... but diagonally from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the lights were white/yellowish with a hint of light blue, but were behind a thin layer of clouding so I can&#39;t be sure the exact color.  I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a commercial aircraft because of how fast it was moving and the fact that the lights moved from their original formation.  I can&#39;t rule out that they could have been military craft, however the following is what leads me to believe they are not.  (or at least what military craft are available knowledge to the public.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. They made no noise whatsoever.  Not even after they were gone.  There was no trailing engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The speed and seemingly effortless way they manuevered into another formation.  They changed direction faster and more fluently then military aircraft would be able to handle.  As I said earlier, they went from :: to V to a diaganol line .... in a matter of about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. The fact that they were just lights... just a circular light.  No flashing, no additional lights, just a solid circle of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Under a minute later some helicoptors could be heard in the vacinity..  Tho as to whether or not they were there for the spectacle is beside me.  If they were, there would be no way they could have matched the UFOs speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that is my sighting.  I personally am convinced they were not commecial or military aircraft.  If the goverment has some black project for new craft and propulsion systems, that is another story.<n>

I was putting my cat in the garage, but before I did that, I walked out to my gate and was looking at the western sky. It was a dry warm night, there were stars out and a few airplanes in the sky. There is nothing but a field, where I walked down to my garage (at around 10:00 pm). I was gazing at the sky; I live in the country. As I was looking out into the field, I saw an object in the sky, a little above tree-height - flashing colors. It was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. Or it looked like it was turning or spinning. The lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue green; pastel colors. The object was completely silent, I couldn&#39;t really make out the shape of the UFO. I went to get my film camera and my video camera. When I came back it was gone, I was disappointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my cat into the garage, and when I came out of the garage I walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, I looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. All of a sudden I looked up and there it was! Staring right at me, at tree-top height, directly across from me, in front of a house - across the road. The field I was looking at, before, is right alongside this house across the road. The UFO appeared totally different now. It was circular, and of a star-like color, only a little warmer (color). It was white. It hovered for a minute or so while I picked up my cameras and took pictures. When I aimed my film camera, I couldn&#39;t see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. I got my video camera up and shot that too.  After I took my photos the object, which was completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. It was descending to the ground, I thought. I walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground and where it would land, but when I got around the gate, it was gone. It must have gone behind the house as I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning I viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn&#39;t even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO&#39;s. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don&#39;t know. The UFO&#39;s were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn&#39;t see all of them at once. It could have been only one UFO changing form, though… Who knows?<n>

9/25/08 21:00|Granby|MO|Circle|Six nights in a row|Unidentified Very Bright Flying Object with Red, White, and Blue Flashing Lights  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star.  PD))|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66006.html|75|ndxe200809| Unidentified Very Bright Flying Object with Red, White, and Blue Flashing Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Thursday night, September 25, 2008, at around 9:oopm,  I noticed a very bright light sitting stationary in the northeastern sky well below the stars.  It perked my curiosity because it was much brighter than any star and was not moving like an airplane would move.  As I continued watching the object, I could pick out three distinct flashing  colors, which were red, white, and blue.  I also noticed movement in the object, such as zig zagging, a dipping back and forth motion, twitching movements, and a downward swirling movement. It has also darted away to the left, only to fly back in from the right and stop in the same location.  It has showed up for the last five nights in a row, Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night, Monday night, and Tuesday night, between the times of 9:00pm and 11:00pm.  Generally, we locate it in the northeastern part of the sky.  However, last Monday night, it was more towards the northwest and in a couple of hours had moved to its usual location in the northeast.  My husband, my two children, and I have viewed it through my son’s telescope on two nights, last Sunday night and last night, which was Tuesday night.  Through the telescope three very bright red, white, and blue lights appear to be flashing and chasing each other in a circle on this object.  It is definitely not a star, planet, airplane, or a helicopter.  It is something very technological in nature.  As each night progressed and the time became later and later, this object appears to climb higher and higher into the night sky, almost out of view.  Any busy or fatigued person just glancing at it would probably just shrug it off as star when it is sitting still or an airplane when it is moving straight through the sky. It really has to be studied to pick up on the three brightly colored flashing lights and the unusual movement of the object at times.  It is amazing and very fun to watch.  It has made an interesting addition to our home school.  My children can’t wait until dark to find out if ! it is ba ck in the sky.  They love to view it through the telescope, as do I.  This lighted unidentified  object would be perfect for anyone wanting to research or investigate  further, because it has appeared without fail now for the last six nights, and I anticipate it will also appear tonight.  We would love to share it with the world, but we do not own a video camera and a simple still photo from our distance would not do it justice.  We have told family and friends to look out for it at night; however, they are all already in bed when we bring out the telescope and I would feel kind of silly reporting it to law enforcement. It really has to be seen with your own eyes, and then you still won&#39;t  believe what you are seeing, and you will not want to stop watching!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star.

This appeared &#34;normal&#34; -- except I saw a lot of detail... a bright white light at the head with a green tail, headed East  Moments later, from the same general area where the first object faded, I saw what I thought was a slightly less bright red-tinted shooting star, heading towards the northwest.  This is when things got odd.  This second object slowed down almost to a crawl (still moving smoothly like a shooting star).  Never coming to a complete stop, it turned hard right, accelerated, and made a circle, spiraling inside the circle towards its center before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do &#39;shooting stars&#39; do loops??  Seconds afterwards, as I was attempting to begin to describe what I saw to my wife, two USAF fighter jets flew in a path that took them directly over my neighborhood, and  at a much lower flight level than I&#39;ve ever seen out here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI I am on the far northern end of the valley.  To my East is Nellis AFB.  To my NW is the bombing range.  However these planes sure must have been in a hurry to have been flying so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, there was one more green colored &#34;normal&#34; shooting star which my wife did see, and a strange plane which was also flying fairly low but without sound.  It headed over the mountain to my North and then down the spine and over the mountains.  I have seen objects that look like stars initially seem to &#34;land&#34; behind this mountain on several occasions, but I have never seen a shooting star do a loopty-loop.<n>

I didnt pay much attention to her the other night, because I believe in ufos but still am a little skepticle when hearing from a teenager.Not anymore!!!!<n>

It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn&#39;t even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO&#39;s. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don&#39;t know. The UFO&#39;s were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn&#39;t see all of them at once. It could have been only one UFO changing form, though… Who knows?<n>

At first it seemed to move at an airplanes pace for about 6-7 seconds.  But it seemed to be to large and to bright for an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 7 seconds it seemed to morph into a green light that was super intense. The green light lasted only a second. At that time its airplane like pace changed to a warp speed.  Much faster than anything I can imagine anything on this earth capable of doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess in much greater excess of 1000 mph.  And yet no sound was ever heard. An aircraft would at least break the sound barrier.  It even left a green streak behind it for a split millisecond as if the light itself could not even keep up with the actual object.(possible light distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Left me in disbelief for the rest of the day.<n>

I went outside to smoke a cigarette, while I was outside, I noticed a bright light in the NorthWest sky travelling East. I watched it for about 10 seconds, until I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a dark shape moving South at a slow speed. It appeared to be shaped like a vee, but no lights and no sound. It traveled South for about 2 or 3 seconds from when I sighted it to when a tree blocked my sight. This object seemed to be about the same height that a  small propeller driven airplane would be, and travelled about twice as fast. Then about 3 weeks later, I was out at about 5:30 or so in the morning. I saw an object travelling South. This object was the same shape as the vee, only it had lights. One light was in the center, while the other four were equaldistantly spaced outward on the vee. These lights appeared to be on the rear side of the object, as it was moving away from me and the dark shape of the vee was in front of the lights. I should mention that the lights were not bright, in fact they blended in with the starlight all around quite well. The object, when I saw it, was at about a 45 degree angle for about 2 seconds. Then it leveled off and went south for about 2 seconds until that same tree obscured my view again. Once again, there was no sound. This is very strange to me, since two sightings happened so close together at the same location, and pretty much the same time of day.

All three of us were swinging and listening to our own portable music.  At approximately 1 a.m., I saw an object in the sky that I was and am unable to identify.  What I could see of the object consisted of 5 disks of light which were the color and brightness of the stars in the sky, but much larger than stars, and these lights were arranged in a distinct &#34;V&#34; shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The quality of the light is much different from any light I know of on an airplane.  Whereas airplane lights consist of small, bright lights, the lights I saw were large, dim, and disk-shaped.  The angle of the disks demonstrated that the lights were on the bottom of &#34;something&#34; and that they were not very far away (horizontally).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at a very low speed, as though it were cruising casually through the sky above the city, heading in a south/south-easterly direction.  However, the object was already almost out of site behind other objects when it caught my attention, leaving me only a very few matter of seconds to view its travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I noticed the object, I turned off my music (a matter of a split second) and I heard absolutely no sound attributable to an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may be of interest to the record that the city of Warrensburg is extremely near an Air Force base, and thus I have seen plenty of their aircraft, both day and night, including the Stealth Bomber.  In fact, I saw a low-flying Stealth Bomber just the night before, and so I was easily able to distinguish the object I saw from the aircraft typically seen in the area.<n>

With binoculars I could see that it appeared to be more oblong shaped with a dark band separating 2 lit areas of the object. Unfortunately it was not brightly lit enough to capture with a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife and I noticed it had made several erratic movements up and down and side to side, we knew it was not a celestial object of any kind. We monitored it for close to 30 mins from our backyard as it made several sudden but subtle movements back and forth and up and down. It was approx 15-25 degrees above the horizon, looking west from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The erratic movements it was making were unlike any I&#39;ve seen a helicopter or airplane make, especially at the distance it appeared to be. We are somewhat near March AFB, and French Valley airport, and we do get a lot of helicopter and airplane traffic overhead, but this made no noise and did not seem to move in a way I&#39;ve ever seen a helicopter make. It certainly could not have been an airplane as it was too stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My neighborhood is by the river, and is known for it&#39;s big, mature trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My lot faces the northeast, so when I went out back Wednesday night, 9/24/08, around 10:30 PM, I was looking up into the southwestern sky.  The view is surrounded by tree tops.  It was a clear night, and I could see stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came into my view as fast as it left.  I was able to watch until it disappeared behind some trees, approximately 7 seconds.  It looked like the pictures you see of meteors going across the sky, except this was at tree level, about the size of an average house in prospective to the trees, and was silent.  It was bright bluish-greenish in the front and red in the back, traveling from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited there in astonishment, waiting to hear a crash.  I was unraveled and ran inside to call our local TV station to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, as I was explaining it to my neighbor, his teenage son saw it too!  He works around the corner from our home, and saw it from the window at his work place. He thought it was going down on the gas station across the street from him.  He didn&#39;t hear it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are just wandering if anything was reported or if anyone else seen it too.<n>

I figured it may have been a satellite but then we saw another moving in the same direction. and another.  Then the forth one faded in from a different direction and then changed course.  When it changed course i knew right then and there it was not a satellite or the space station or space junk.  The fifth object seen we thought it was simply two of the lights moving together at the same speed and then we realized it was one HUGE object!  How we came to that conclusion is when both the lights came to pass a star the star vanished for about a second. then it came back.  this object was moving slowly as well. It simply looks like 2 stars moving from the west to the east.  Then all of the sudden it abruptly changed course to go north.  This is the most active night i have ever seen besides the lights over Phoenix Arizona incident a few years back that the government said was flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something that large should have made a lot of noise for how close it appeared.  But then i guessed it must be so far away.  The rest of our time we viewed a few more single star like objects move across the sky and some of them changed course.  One of them was red in color.  The last object observed was very large and at first i thought it might be a huge b-1 bomber or something flying low. the only problem with that is the speed it was moving (Fast) and no noise as well as strange lights.  one white light left one white light right and one red light in the center with an occasional bright red burst emitted from the back red light. (Blinking (Bursts) but not like a plane in succession). The object seemed to show a double image of itself on top like a mirror. WEIRD! For me to see what we saw tonight makes me so angry that the government would cover up something so huge! It is so obvious if people would simply get out from in front of there t.v&#39;s and watch the sky for them selves. I just can&#39;t understand why i couldn&#39;t see any additional detail. They all simply looked like points of light. (Stars).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect satellites and stars.  PD))<n>

When I looked up I saw it was the sun reflecting off of an object.  I wasn&#39;t sure what it was so I watched it to see if it was a plane or something else.  The light only reflected of it for a few more seconds then I could see it long, and cylindrical.  It was kind of grayish in color and appeared to be moving kind of slow for a plane.  It was moving from the southwest to the northeast.   Just to the northwest of the object I could see a jet flying higher and faster in the opposite direction.  I could hear no sound from either one and could see no exhaust trail from the object but I could see one from the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved closer and more in front of me I could see there were no visible wings.  It was low enough that if there were any wings they should have been at least somewhat visible.  At this time I went in the house to get my wife to look at it and when I came back outside I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  I took my groceries in and came back out and it was back but appeared to be farther away but I could still see it pretty good and then my wife got a look at it too and agreed that it didn&#39;t look like any plane that she had seen before.  We continued to watch it until it disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got farther away it looked like it was descending but that could&#39;ve been because of the angle it was moving away at.  As it disappeared there was another jet was coming from north of where I last saw the object.  Both jets were also military type jets, in this area were rarely see any commercial jets as the nearest major airport is 100 miles away in Memphis, TN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a ufo before but have always been interested in them and believe they exist, but I&#39;m very objective when I look at things and if I had the slightest feeling that this was a plane I would never report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 43 and this is the first time I can honestly say that I saw something in the sky that I couldn&#39;t explain. I&#39;m not saying that it was aliens because it probably wasn&#39;t but I know it wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, blimp or anything like that.<n>

As I talked on the phone I thought it was changing color from white to red so I assumed it was a plane.  I realized that in 15 minutes it moved approx 1/2 inch towards the treeline ahead of me. I thought this was strange because several planes went past this object and hit the treeline with 2-3 seconds.  I was mesmerized because I knew it was moving ever so slightly and changing colors from white to red. I watched it for 30 minutes (I was stationary sitting on my patio chair) then it just dissapeared instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The rear seemed to undulate or flow energy like a jellyfish or chinese kite flapping in the back, almost like it was a wispy celestial body and semi-transparent but still with very defined edges overall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I want to say it looked spirit like or partially organic.  It was very wide from the back view as it cruised off into the distance and from the rear seemed like a long white or pearly line gliding along off into the sky heading southward towards delray beach.  It moved very straight &amp; level and much faster than any tiny distant blinking planes did that were far off in the west sky shortly after that we used for comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our neighbor also came outside halfway through our sighting and clearly saw the craft/object as it went off into the distance and could&#39;nt believe his eyes and agreed it was not anything he had ever seen before.  I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, bird, or a cloud and we were completely sober and I have 20/20 vision, trust me when I tell you this was something very strange.  It was very clear in the sky about half way up and lasted about 30 seconds total and we still can&#39;t believe what we saw really but I felt the need to report it in case others witnessed it as well in south florida over the caloosa park area on 9/23/08.  Please report it if you did.<n>

I was travelling NW and saw a bright light (airplane like, but not blinking and extremely bright) in the sky.  Then it was joined by 2 more of the same look.  The 3 lights moved around each other.  I thought that if they were planes that they would crash.  Then they vanished. I drove on.  A few miles down the road I saw it again, except that the 3 lights were playing a &#34;leapfrog&#34; for 5-10 seconds and then vanished.  I waited for about ten minutes.  Then I just saw one of the lights for appx. 2-3 seconds and it vanished.  I called home to report what I saw and my significant other was freiked out!!! A co-worker described seeing the same thing about 2 nights ago appx. 40 miles away.  Again, not sure what it was...  came home punched in UFO sightings on the net and found your site.

Just to the west of the water tower, what looked like a few miles, and would place the object somewhere in the vicinity over highway 54, a small, spherical, metallic object appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approx. five thousand feet.  You could see the sun reflecting off the bottom and the top was darker where the sun wasn&#39;t reflecting from it.  I kept checking every couple of seconds out my window at it to see if it was moving or to figure out what it was but it was just stationary.  Anyone from this area knows the only aircraft we get around by us is crop dusting planes and small single engine props. and no other planes were in the sky that i could see at the time and this object was not moving at all eliminating the possibility of it being a plane, and the metallic appearance means it was not a star or the ISS. I went to look on! e more time it looked like the object just shot off due west and in a pretty vertical trajectory gaining altitude in a split second and was gone.  I wasn&#39;t going to think anything of this except for the fact that I saw the exact same thing in the exact same spot while driving in the exact same spot about a year or two earlier which is weird.  I also was reading reports on here about other sightings and noticed someone saw something similar in the Stevens Point/Plover area and thought maybe there is something to this sighting after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was approximately 2:20am on Tuesday morning, Sep 23, 2008.  I woke up to go to the bathroom.  After I got back into bed, I closed my eyes and I saw these distorted images reflected in my eyes (my eyes were closed).  These images were red, blue, yellow, green and in the shape of random lines vibrating.  All of a sudden I hear a very distorted sound, like someone playing a strange instrument with only 5 notes playing one at a time.  This continued for about 2 minutes until I heard a very loud , deep rumbling noise, like an engine, above my house. I got up to look out the balcony window but could not see anything in the sky.  All I could sense was absolute silence, no other sounds could be heard, no wind, no cars, no birds, not even an airplane which I thought could be the reason for the noise.  But there was absolutely nothing.  It was as if time had stopped.  This rumbling noise was very low, like nothing I’d ever heard, but I couldn’t see anything. There were no lights.  This lasted maybe 1 minute and then I heard those notes again.  I looked around the backyard and then all of a sudden, to the left of me, I see this greenish shaped image projected on the wall of the apartment complex to the left of my house. It was the shape of a circle with a point at the top and a flat bottom with a line running through it. It was on the wall for a few seconds then it vanished.  It must have been at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet long on the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to the front of the house thinking maybe the noises were coming from there but did not see or hear anything. I went back to my bedroom, sat there for a few seconds and then heard those notes again! I looked out the balcony door I saw it again. The image projected onto the apartment complex.  It lasted about 1 minute and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You must think this all sounds very crazy and unreal, but I saw it and heard those noises.  This is the first time I’ve had an experience like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this lasted about 5 minutes.  I couldn’t go back to sleep for at least an hour after that.  It was the strangest thing i&#39;ve ever experienced.<n>

The night was a clear night with a good view of the stars. The person I was with was standing near the corner of McAllister and Baker streets and observed what we at first thought was a plane.  She pointed it out to me - I was standing about 15 feet south of her - and I looked up and saw 3 dim points of light (about the brightness of a dim star) that formed an equilateral triangle, moving quickly in smooth, straight line north/northeast.  At first we thought this might be a plane but considering that the craft appeared to be silent, and that the lights were a decent distance from one another it does not match the description of any plane that either of us has ever seen.  the craft moved smoothly out of sight and we ran uphill to try and continue observing it but were unable to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it is worth, I grew up in a town that was home to a Navy Air Station and was within the flight path for a major international airport and did not recognize the lights we saw as being consistent with any plane or helicopter that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

We were looking in the sky for the moon and couldn&#39;t find it.  We were watching a low flying, large airplane that was flying overhead which is unusual for this area.  My daughter looked down to talk to me and at that time I saw 2 triangles sort of adjoining or maybe it moved so fast it just looked like two.  It just suddenly appeared (maybe it was behind a cloud?) and before I could tell my daughter to look into the sky, it sped off at a right, upward angle into the night.  As far as the size, it is hard to describe because of how high it was, but compared to the airplane it was about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the low flying ,large airplane that had already passed us.  It did not look like it was following it - but who knows it disappeared rather quickly.  I could see a trail of light as I watched it, but it didn&#39;t leave a trail in the sky.  I am truly amazed and blown away because I have always wanted to see something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after he went outside he called me and another family member to come out and watch something. We went outside and there was a big orange light hovering to the NE. As soon as all of us 3 were watching it, the orange light began to move and went directly over our yard and over our heads flying under the clouds. As soon as it had passed our yard it slowly began to disappear. The light traveled from the NE to the EW and was of a triangular shape. Approximate 20 minutes after the first light, a second big orange light appeared traveling from the NE to the W. This one had a orange circle around the main light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between those sightings we were able to see smaller and bigger flying stars.

Perfect formation &amp; very fast &amp; high in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As tonight was a clear night, I went outside to look at the constellation of Cassiopeia. I have studied this for years and know it very well. However, I noticed what I thought was a constellation within it. It was the inverse of Cassiopeia in that it was an upside down triangle but with another object in parallel with it. It then moved very fast across the sky, northwards crossing Cassiopeia and remaining in formation perfectly. This object was moving very fast, and I could hear NO noise. Please note this appeared very high in the sky, and I can only compare it’s brightness to the stars. The size appeared huge, as it replicated in size to the 2 pointer stars of Cassiopeia and in relation to the constellation moved across it in seconds. This was no aircraft as far as I’m concerned due to relative size and distance travelled compared to geo-stationary satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a professional in IT, have a qualification in astronomy and always look for a rational explanation in ambiguous issues, but I cannot explain this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sky perfectly clear and moonless with Jupiter bright in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was carrying groceries from my car to my apartment and was not watching the sky when suddenly, a flash of white light from above caused me to look skyward. I saw a white hot, incandescent object with blue and red tinges of color at its center and a short tail of sparks directly overhead. The object and the glow surrounding it were about the size of a saucer held at arm’s length against the sky. Its speed was a bit faster than meteors I’ve observed in the past. The object passed to the west behind the roof of my apartment building where I could no longer see it. When I rounded the corner of the building, it had disappeared altogether. I assumed it burned out while beyond my field of vision. The sighting lasted about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately concluded I had seen a meteor, but the altitude of the object was surprising. It appeared to be much closer to the earth&#39;s surface than meteors I’ve observed in the past, including the spectacular meteor shower I saw in August, 1993, that resulted from some vaporization of the Swift-Tuttle comet core. This object seemed so close that I initially thought it might be some type of firework launched from the nearby neighborhood. I was concerned the object was going to touch down somewhere nearby. (I realize that altitude is difficult to judge when there is no other backdrop than the stars at great distances in a black sky.) There was absolutely no sound that preceded my sighting the object and no sound when it flashed and then passed overhead.

I noticed one was brighter than normal with much more flashing lights than any plane I have ever seen. I also noticed it was moving much faster than the other planes. As it moved from North to West it stopped in the sky. I did get binoculars out to look at it but all I could see was the bright lights constantly flickering and flashing, mainly red, green, yellow and orange. I did look at the rest of the sky and noticed another object to the North East with the same description. At times they would get very bright and almost look as if they were on fire (with that kind of flickering light). I continued to watch them for 2 hours and there was not change except the object to the West did start to fade out, but the object to the North East was still just as bright. I found it very odd that they did not move from the locations they were at. I’m sure there could be some explanation for this, but I do not see what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to scan the night sky and saw an object coming from the western sky that did not appear to be an airplane.   It was coming directly from the west and I was hoping it would be a satellite reflecting the light from the sun that had set an hour earlier.  I did not see flashing lights, or colored lights; just a steady glow.  As the object drew closer, it appeared it was about as high as some of the jet airliners that often pass overhead to other cities.   I was just outside of my house, so I ran back in to get binoculars (7x35) to see the object better.  It appeared to be traveling as fast as military jets at high altitude, but it did not look like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using the binoculars, I was then able to tell that the quality of light was much brighter than reflected sunlight and that the object appeared to be creating the light.  It was a round shape; glowing a very bright white with a slight hint of blue at the edges.  Again, I could not see any standard aircraft lighting.  Based on the altitude of normal aircraft, the diameter of the object appeared to be as big as the length of an airliner.   It was now about overhead, and I was thinking it could still be a satellite, when it then began changing its eastern course and then began heading in a northeastern direction.  I could not see jet thrusters or wings on the craft. I continued to watch it as it disappeared.    If it was satellite, it should have lost intensity as it went further from the horizon, and it would not have changed directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran out of the room to get the binoculars (gone less than 1 min.)and it was gone when I returned with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vantage point: The object was observed from 1 mile east of the shore and 1/2 mile north of Port Ludlow facing due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: On the water north of Foul Weather Bluff which is the northern-most tip of the Kitsap Peninsula in Puget Sound. It was approximately 100 feet north of this Bluff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape: The shape of a bowl facing downwards on a small plate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size: Approximately the size of 1/2 of the moon when seen very high in the sky. Another reference point is that it was approximately 1/2 to 2/3 the height of the bluff (Foul Weather Bluff) just south of it from sea level. Its width was approximately 3 times greater than its height. The fact that it was lit up was taken into consideration in estimating its size.  It appeared to be huge because of being lit up and with it&#39;s reflection on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighting: Lit up with diffuse light, not dissimilar from the moonlight. Another way of describing its lit-up appearance is that it was similar to the light coming from an off-white or light-beige light fixture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both observers are professionals with advanced degrees (M.A and PhD), both have taught at the universities and have never seen anything like it.  My husband has remarkablely keen eyesight (20-15 range).<n>

I said 50 degrees, it should be 150 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slightly after midnight, Sept, 22. I saw a whitish shape emerge from the skyglow to the north, simular to the artist rendering in graphic-1. It was the size of a silver dollar at arms length. My first thought was, &#34;that&#39;s a very big bird!&#34;. In a matter of seconds it was overhead and I realized it wasn&#39;t flapping or moving as a bird would, just a steady movement to the south. Graphic-2 depicts what it looked liked overhead. When it was overhead it was much dimmer and had no lights or sound whatsoever. There was some kind of disturbance or disturbed air in a short wake to the rear. It took 10 seconds to go from the skyglow to the north and disappearing in the skyglow to the south, about 50 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that if this was a bird at low level it would have passed to the east at just above roof top level, assuming 500 to 1000 foot altitude. This would be 30 to 60 mph, and with no flapping movement - not a bird. If it was a plane high enough so as not to be heard then it was flying without lights and would have been MASSIVE in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simply, I&#39;m stumped!<n>

But this time, the white light moved like a bumblebee or a similar crazed insect, instead of in a cross formation, and lasted until we couldn&#39;t follow it due to distance, apparently headed toward Mexico.

I had been doing this for a couple of minutes when i was startled to see a very bright object moving overhead.  It seemed to be moving quite quickly towards the spot in the sky where I had pulsed the laser a few seconds earlier.  Thinking that it was a plane, I was worried that I might have distracted the pilot, as I am always careful to avoid pointing my laser at aircraft.  As I continued to observe the light as it moved from overhead towards the northeast, I became puzzled because the light did not look like a regular plane or helicopter.  It was much brighter than any star in the sky.  It was slightly yellow, about the same color as the sun at midday.  It made no sound.  Its motion reminded me of that of a satellite, with no obvious changes in direction or speed relative to the stars.  I watched it for about a minute until it was about 30 degrees above the northeast horizon, at which point the light disappeared.  The light appeared to go from full brightness to dark in under 2 seconds, and had the appearance of &#34;flattening out&#34; from top to bottom just before I could no longer see it.  I interpreted this as the kind of behavior one would expect from a satellite moving into the earth&#39;s shadow.  This was *much* brighter than any artificial satellite I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very slowly it started to move in our direction. The object was moving too slow for an airplane. The object appeared to be splitting into two separate objects and then appeared to re-form. It also had almost looked like it was radiating heat as there was a slight ripple like effect surrounding it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object slowly moved acorss the sky we saw two jets, one in front of the other fly close to this object as if in some kind of formation to observe whatever this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later the object was still moving slowly and we noticed a pink balloon object drift past the “UFO” in the opposite direction. So the balloon type object was following the wind direction and the “UFO was traveling in the opposite direction, thus confirming for me that the “UFO” was not a balloon and too slow to be an airplane and much to high to be either a helicopter or a blimp (which it bore no resemblance to anyways) the pink balloon type object almost looked like it was shriveling the “UFO” as were the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this time the object appeared to be dividing and re-forming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (my husband, sister in-law and myself) all observed this object for at least 40minutes in which this time it had made a slightly curved course across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested if there have been any similar sightings to this one from yesterday and would be very interested in hearing you r opinion. I also called your hotline and left my telephone number, I would be more than happy to talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We would like to meet with you and discuss this amazing encounter in person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:30 AM my brother ((name deleted)) heard something walking on his roof.  He went outside and discovered a craft hovering about 20 feet off the ground.  He then ran to get his phone and started taking pictures.  Beings were on the ground and at one point one being quickly approached him but stopped when he snapped a photo.  Some kind of mist was falling from his ceiling which made him start to feel paralyzed so he moved away from the area.  At one point an alien which had small eyes and a shriveled face peeked through the window. ((name deleted)) then went close snapped a photo and the being acted as if it angered him.He did not get this photo and the phone turned off twice during this experience. There are several photos of craft and beings.The photos are dark but the beings can be seen and one photo of a craft is impressive.We would like to meet in person.I know this sounds to good to be true please believe me when I say this is NOT a hoax or a joke.He would like to sell the phone and we would be willing to talk about this encounter and more on a program.I have a lot of interesting information to talk about also. Hope to hear from you soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) 1-509-((number deleted))<n>

I stepped onto the porch and spotted a saucer shaped object roughly fifteen feet across. After getting my cell phone, I ran outside to the front lawn to get a photo of this object, which was about 40 feet away. The object started to move towards me slowly so I ran back inside the house. My porch was flooded with light. A few minutes later I saw what looked like vapor falling from the ceiling. I started losing feeling from my arms and legs so I hurried out of the house onto the porch. The paralyses faded after leaving the house. I saw an alien figure about 5 foot tall .It had a large head and large dark eyes. I pointed the phone at it as it charged me and took a photo. It then stopped and backed away. I noticed a large object moving over my roof towards me. Again, vapor like substance started to fall making me lose feeling in my legs and arms. I went into the house and locked the door. I saw an ugly looking face peeking into my kitchen window. I walked over while making eye contact and took a photo. It shook its head violently as if irritated. The bottom of my blinds on the living room window went away from the wall ten inches. I again saw a vapor falling from the ceiling so I ran back onto the porch. I called my father to hurry over to the house. I also called 911. An officer came and the craft left instantly as the car approached. I told him what happened but he didn’t believe what I had to say. After he left the craft came back quickly. My father showed up minutes later and they left for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother went onto the roof that day and found that some shingles were broke. Also four groups of large staples were found. The ground was wet and there were a few circular impressions in the grass .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking it was a plane, at first I was skeptical.  I saw a bright light, about the size of a large star and seemingly far away that blinked constantly in bright white, red and occasionally blue.  We watched it constantly for several minutes to discern if it was moving…and it definitely was not.  After a few minutes, we noticed another of the same light objects to the left of the first, doing exactly the same thing.  It too was stationary, white, red and blue blinking lights…first one color then, the next…mostly white and red, but blue at times, too.  They were in the N/NE sky above the tree line, but we did not have to look up to see them.  We also saw various planes with blinking lights, moving…and stars…unmoving…these two objects were different.  I did not want to make a big deal of it, because my son is only 11, and after watching the lights for about ten minutes, I left the window and told him to go to sleep.  We will look again tonight, but I have never seen anything like it.  My son is 11, in sixth grade and of normal/above average intelligence.  I am a 43 year old female, with a Bachelor’s degree and post-grad education in the medical field, also of average to above average intelligence.  I was highly skeptical until I witnessed this with my own eyes…over at least a constant ten minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was primarily looking at deep sky objects. I was focused on the Andromeda galaxy and wanted to look for the double cluster galaxy since know its location. I was looking towards the North-Eastern sky when suddenly I noticed two objects that I was never familiar with.  There were two objects which were orange-ish in color. They appeared to be shaped as spheres. Both of the objects appeared within the eyepiece I was looking in. They appeared to be somewhat of a faint orange color. I can almost say that they were faint because they were in space around the Earth’s orbit and not in our atmosphere because I stopped looking in the telescope and tried to see them with my naked eye but could not. As I looked again in the eyepiece they were going in a south-eastern direction and suddenly made a quick turn going towards an easterly direction. One was below the other towards the lower right. The one below was sort of bouncing around or more like dancing around in no particular pattern. This stuck me as odd behavior.  They kept their same formation and distance as they moved down the sky. I followed them for about 30 seconds and quickly called my 14 year old son outside. I asked him to take a look through the telescope and he saw the same objects I did. I tried to view the objects again, but they were probably below my fence and out of sight. I have seen helicopters, falling stars, satellites, &amp; airplanes through my telescope and there were not any of those. I’m not saying they were UFO’s, but I certainly don’t know what they were. This was definitely a strange first moment for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The night had patchy low clouds, but both objects were below the cloud cover or just hitting it. We could see commercial jets going by on the way to SNA (Orange County Airport) that would go through clear areas, then be totally obscured by clouds. The pilots should have had a clear view of both objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects appeared to be identical. We used a spotting scope to observe the second slower object. It appeared to be a tall shape and had multiple (from 3 to 8) lights that were rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=92624&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=14<n>

It changed shape from rectangular to a twisted looking shape then back. Kind of like a rubrics cube twisting. The object was changing colors but was over all very bright whiteish blue. Kind of like looking at a huge high def TV around 5000 feet. It was above the clouds. Didnt look like anything any of us had ever seen.  Someone inland fired up a spotlight and pointed it at the clouds below the object. The rectangular twisting light source continued a sort of accent untill it was a dot against the sky like a star. VERY STRANGE. Cant find any news and im getting frustrated because im sure lots of people saw it + someone pointed a searchlight at it. Hope to find others who witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had bright red lights around the perimeter that were blinking on and off in succession  The disc-shaped object was so bright, it appeared to glow.  Far off in another direction, we saw a  helicopter, and by comparison, the size of this unknown craft was at least 10 times bigger.  We followed it by car, as it moved just over the tree tops in our view.  It flew on an even plane, at a speed that seemed faster than a blimp, but slower than an airplane.  We watched it for about 10 minutes before it flew out of our sight.  It was a very clear night and we saw this object very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then realized it was moving towards me at a very high altitude. I first thought it was a flock of birds flying in a V formation. The triangle then disappeared into the clouds for 2 to 3 seconds, thats when I ruled out the bird idea because of how tight the formation was, how high the formation was, and how fast the formation was. This formation traveled all the way across the sky in a matter of 10 to 25 seconds. The formation did not stop and go, it just kept flying almost stright south. As a pilot in training, I am fairly familliar with the way certain aircraft act. This or these objects did not have any strobes or red/green lights on wing tips. The objects also did not make any noise at all what so ever. I am a huge aviation fanatic, and my friends tell me I&#39;m obsessed with military aircraft. I have never seen or heard of anything like this before in my entire life. Looking up into the sky, if you hold your hand up, it appeared to be about two to four inches in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like this .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .   .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .     .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . . . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No directional lights (green and red lights) or any blinking lights, which all plans have. There would be no reason for a plane to have landing lights on that high. Then halfway through the sighting we witnessed another smaller craft, less brighter, also no blinking lights traveling in near proximity of the first craft, then traveling faster and began to accend higher than the first craft. First we thought an air force fighter and an arieal refueling tanker, but fighters usually travel in pairs and after refueling, the fighter would decend, not accend higher than the tanker. Also one of those friends saw the same thing, the next day, around same time, this time traveling north to south, also with three other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My guess was that they were going about 60-70 miles per hour and they seemed to be flying below the two radar dishes. They were white in color and I couldn&#39;t make out a definitive shape. They appeared to be flying in formation, very close to each other. I watched them go into the clouds but didn&#39;t see them come out. A few minutes later, as we neared Layton and Kaysville, I saw them again, but very quickly. They were in the same area, only going the opposite direction. They were going north this time, below the radar dishes. I lost track of them as we continued heading south and I could no longer see the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Through binoculars it appeared high in the sky as we could see birds which appeared to be at the same height much clearer.  It was an indeterminate color and either possessed it own source of light or was reflecting light from the sun, i.e. it appeared to glow brighter and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although moving slowly, and at times changing course it was hard to keep a bead on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my best visual of this object it appeared to be separate round balls of light.

Passing directly in front of the moon, was a small object (to the naked eye) moving very slowly to the north-northwest.  I grabbed my binoculars out of the car, and examined the object through the binoculars.  While the object was still quite tiny even with the binoculars, I noted a bright orange/red &#34;sheen&#34;, with a small white globe near the top of the object. Could not determine if the object was metal or cloth.  It continued moving very slowly to the NW, then vanished from sight.  I immediately contacted the National Weather Service office in Kansas City (Pleasant Hill, MO) and spoke with the on-duty meteorologist.  I inquired if they had recently launched a weather balloon.  He stated weather balloons for this area are launched from Topeka, Kansas which is 60 miles west of my location.  He also stated weather balloons are only launched at 0600 and 1800 hours from Topeka.  I attempted to take a photo of this object, but even with 20x optical zoom, the object did not even show up on the screen of the digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On 9/20/08 at approximately 10:30pm I was sitting on a back porch by myself. It was  a very clear night with good visibility. I was watching plans that were off in the distance, the airport is about 30 miles from the house.. Most of the planes  were coming from the North then heading East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from behind a large tree to the North I saw what looked like 3 balloons tied together forming a triangle shape. They were not lit up , more like illuminating from the lights below and the moon. The object looked silver and moved very slow with no sound. Then it moved very fast covering a large distance, then slowed down again and then went backwards a ways. At this point I called for my dad and aunt to come see. I realized it was not balloons. This was far to big to be. The object kind of hovered in the same spot for a few seconds, looking  like a ball would look floating on water. Then it made a fast movement to the South West, then turned West and what looked like straight up, then it was gone. About 2 minuets later two military jets flew by. They both went to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally my family came out and watched the sky with me for a while. All we saw after that were  commercial airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had several sightings all in Arizona. This was unlike the other two objects I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Marion county. This was not a conventional aircraft or meteorite. it was a really machanical engine sound. and was moving very fast possibly in excess of 2000 miles an hr. or more easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/19/08 23:40|San Luis Obispo|CA|Changing|6 minutes|a star that turned 10 times its size, got dim again, and then black, over and over , moving by perfumo canyon|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65794.html|171|ndxe200809| a star that turned 10 times its size, got dim again, and then black, over and over , moving by perfumo canyon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening my friends and I were haning out by the mobile homes recreational pool, outdoors, with our feet in the jacuzzi. I always look around slo&#39;s sky because I know and believe because I have seen with my own eyes, unidentified flying objects in this area, and the sky was so clear i could see the stars all the way down to the horizon by the perfumo canyon hills. I was watching the skies and I pointed out the planet jupiter,i might be wrong though,  to my two friends, and they were enjoying the pretty night sky. A star &#34;star?&#34; suddenly appeared to become very very very bright and then move to the right, and then dim down, and turn black. It dissapeared for approximately a few seconds and then reappeared more to the right, which makes me think, maybe there was a string of lights attatched at somewhere, but who knows. This object didn&#39;t have the appearance of anything but a star at times, but then would become 10 times its own size and yellowy bright, and then shrink down to the size of the stars around it, and turn black again. Whenever I have a sighting I make sure whoever is around is watching it with me, I still have a problem believing my own eyes, even after witnessing these things(but not the same shapes and colors)on various accounts..and my friends usually come to me for answers but I don&#39;t have an answer for this one. One of my friends mentioned, maybe its government top secret stuff, but why would they throw a huge light on it unless they were trying to make it disinformation...? WHO KNOWS!!!It kept moving every time it turned black, somehow, reappearing and moving north, from the south west.I believe we stood around for maybe a little under ten minutes, but my knees started shaking and my eyes were watering, and I can freak out pretty fast if I&#39;m not expecting a creepy night, so we decided to get some rum and sit inside like normal old folks in this mobile community.-I&#39;d also like to mention, there were many many aircraft(helicopters) in our small airspace, and after a whi! le the s ky became completely covered in dark high up fog!?what for?<n>

I was looking a set of three stars when two of them started moving in a uniform direction probably northwest from my position. My mother came outside and I pointed the two &#34;stars&#34; out to her and she noticed them too which reassured me that I wasn&#39;t trippin. We both deduced that it was too high to be a plane, i suggested that it might&#39;ve been satellites but reasoned that they wouldn&#39;t probably be so bright that high up and two of them probably wouldn&#39;t be so close together moving in the same direction. As a matter of fact a real plane passed by and we both compared it to the plane and knew that definitely wasn&#39;t that because it didn&#39;t have any colored lights are anything blinking. They looked just like a stars: bright and circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But whereas satellites make a slow track through the sky, this shot across it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s occurred to me that it could be a shooting star, except there was no downward trajectory to it whatsoever. It was moving laterally.<n>

I picked up the ipod and put the volume all the way up only to have it reduce itself. The song began to sound distorted. While I messing with my track wheel, I continue driving and noticed a yellow light in front of me. I turned off my ipod, continue driving and saw the yellow light take the shape of a flat circle. It now looked like the sun. I continue driving in its direction and suddenly felt that my air conditioner was throwing hot air. I continued driving and felt a bolt of heat in the center of my body. The light suddenly disappeared  and I  suddenly realized that I was doing a you turn in the middle of the road. I drove back in the direction I was coming from at about 55 miles per hour. When I finally had cell reception, I realized that it was 9:54pm. I cannot account for those 10 to 14 minutes after I felt the heat in my center.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I look up to the dark blue sky and i see this big about blimp sized oval, there was a few stars around including an airplane, of course it couldn&#39;t have been a blimp because as i was so nervous my mind sort of sparked and was working faster then normal, i tried to identify the item because at first i really thought it was a blimp. It gave out a swooshing sound, that sounded like an airplane but not quite. When i stared at it for a few more second i notice there is no top that a blimp would have, which is the balloon that holds it up, It had about 5 different colors of light that the oval gave out, Orange, red, Blue, Green, and purple, some colors where flickering. As i just stare at it my heart begins to pound about 2x as fast, i thought to myself i have got to calm down, so i took a quick breathe, I could not identify the object at all as a known human built machine. It was Moving about half the time a plane would take to get from one place to another while watching it from the sky about 80 feet or so. I know defined it as a U.F.O. As i walk into the corner store i begin to look for a clock, it was 21:04, when i came out my heart still racing, i come home and try to explain it to my mother, but as usual i dont really think she believes me, she did however say &#34;things happen to people and its unexplainable but don&#39;t expect seeing it again&#34; as i told her that i was going out with the camera. i went out anyway and saw nothing, it really makes you regret not acting fast or having a camera even though its weird to do that i will always remember now that witness and proof is very important. I just really wish i had proof because frankly no one believes me. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it but this event surely changed my life 							- thank you for reading<n>

Once we got on the bridge, my passenger and I had a clear view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a few thousand feet in the air, located in the bay between Bayonne and Elizabeth, NJ.  The triangular pattern of its three blinking red lights made me suspicious that it may be a jet liner heading for Newark Airport, but it looked nothing like the many other planes in the sky and was not on the normal approach pattern to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, when first viewed, appeared to be saucer shaped, with a raised flat top.  As we moved further along the bridge, the craft appeared to elongate into a cylindrical shape, however it seemed that the orientation of the craft to my car changed so I assume I was just getting a different view of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft, in addition to the lights, had a strange whitish blue hue to it that illuminated its body and made it stand out against the night sky.  It appeared to be moving slowly eastbound, but it is hard to say if it was really moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of the craft soon after we exited the bridge.<n>

I could clearly see the bottom of the craft through my moon roof. The object took several seconds to move from the right side of my vehicle to the left and I could see it was black, triangular in shape and had many red lights on the bottom center of the craft. As it moved across the highway I got a clear view of the back. It had a tall, rectangular piece running perpendicular in the middle of the rear of the craft. Along this tall, rectangular object were red and white lights running up and down. The back of the craft was shaped like a long rectangle and had huge circular light on each end. Many lights were coming off the top creating an aura of bright white light. It proceeded to move across the sky very slowly and then turned west to head back towards Lebanon/Fairview Heights area. It was so large, as it moved west and I moved east I could still see its lights in the sky when I reached St. Rose road, approximately 25 miles from where the craft was flying. It was definitely not an airplane, a blimp, or anything I have every seen in our skies before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I turned off Main Street, I noticed a bright flash in the sky to the north.  I turned my head to the left and saw the sun glint off of something in the sky.  It had to have been highly polished and metallic.  I live in an area where I see all kinds of crafts: jetliners, blimps, private planes, I even saw fighter jets over my house after “9/11”.  This looked different, very different.  I didn’t turn my head back and proceed on my way.  I actually pulled over to the curb and stared.  What I saw were two objects.  They were close enough that I was to be able to discern certain features but far enough away not to be able to be precise about the features.  They were moving in tandem at about 200 mph (the same speed of an airline on approach that I typically see at Laguardia Airport and were under the low hanging clouds, which I estimate were at 2,000 feet or so.  One was larger and appeared to caplet-shaped.  The other was smaller and followed the first.  It was spherical but not perfectly round.  What was dramatic about this was that they were incredibly close to one another, as closer as fighter jets from a squadron that fly in formation.  At first, I thought the larger was towing the smaller but then I dismissed that thought.  Then I observed that there is no way that air traffic in the NYC metropolitan area would be allowed to fly so close to another craft. They flew in a perfectly straight line but never did the distance or perspective between the two change.  I observed this for a good 30 seconds as they moved off and away.  As I biked off I had to analyze what I saw and decide whether, in fact, they were UFOs or not.  What convinced me that I believe they were is the fact that no noise emanated from them and I don’t recall seeing any wings on these crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Cruise control was set at 75 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had my sunglasses on and noticed some large dark spots on both sides of the highway in the desert.  I thought perhaps there had been some brushfires overnite but did not smell any smoke.  I removed my sunglasses and and could tell it was not spots of brushfire, but rather large shade spots.  All levels of terrain were covered in shade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a minimal number of bands of cumulus clouds in the sky, but not enough to create the huge areas of shade spots in the desert.  There were at least 4 shade areas to the north and two areas to the south.  I called my husband on the cellphone to tell him about the shade spots.  As I was running parallel to one of the large spots, I started counting to try and measure distance.  I counted to fifteen seconds before my view was obstructed by cliffs.  ( I calculate 15 seconds at 75 mph is approximately 1290 feet.)  I exited at the Golden Shores exit. (First exit in western AZ)<n>

I watched it for two or three minutes to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was and then went to get binoculars.  When I put the binoculars on it, it continued to move left to right, up and down and then around in a small circle.  It appeared to be a round sphere with several small white lights all over it.

It was a still and quiet night and the triangle moved silently, not very quickly but faster than a passing satellite would. The sighting lasted perhaps 5 seconds before I lost sight of it.

Observed it slowly descending. I was walking my dog out of my garage for his last time out for the night. Stood transfixed in my driveway. Called out for my daughter in disbelief, but by the time she joined me it was out of sight. This object was extremely bright, couldn&#39;t miss  it.  I called my local police to ask if anyone else had seen this, was advised no one else saw it.  They suggested I call State Police, which I did, and the dispatcher advised me of same.  I find it hard to believe I was the only one who saw this.  I am certain there must be a very logical explanation for  this; I would actuallly welcome one. It was absolutely brilliant against the dark night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be in close proximity to my home, much much lower than planes fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not drink, save for an occasional glass of  wine when I am out to dinner.  I take no drugs, not for health or recreational purposes.  I am mentally healthy. I am a 56 year old female, active, intelligent and reasonable.  I just want to know what I saw.

Initially it was white but as it got farther away it changed to 2 very small, close together red lights.  Shortly after changing, it was gone; it didn’t fade out of sight, it just disappeared.

Plane pass just below a cirle of four very bright lights.  Cirle of lights did not move as plane passed and in comparasion, cirle of lights was extremely large.  This cirle of lights moved off to the left and stayed in same spot.  Could not see actual outline of &#34;craft&#34; as lights were big and bright and what stays with me is how large it was and that it was just sitting there.  Saw other planes in the sky and could easily make out their shape.  Did anyone else see this?<n>

The wife and I noticed in the sky directly above us and streaming accross the sky due west were an incredible amount of white trails from &#34;jet-wash&#34; (i believe is what it&#39;s called).. I don&#39;t mean ten or twenty; we actually stopped counting at fifty. They strangely did not criss-cross each other at all either. The sun was just about set so the trails were extremely visable in a clear, calm, cloudless, bright blue sky. Air traffic is common w/Midway airport to the north and Gary Airport to the southeast. We found it strange since these trails were all quite fresh, as if these aircraft had &#34;all&#34; flown over at the same time.. and very recently too. No aircraft were visible in the immediate sky at the time. We&#39;re used to seing jet trails all over the sky on clear days but this was even beyond unusal. I really doubt commercial jet traffic would be &#34;that&#34; heavy for the given time and day. Military traffic might make sense but why and to where? No word was mentioned on local A.M. radio or local Internet news. Really very curious if anyone else in the area found this odd?  We both noticed it immediatly; surely someone else did too?<n>

I had just looked at my watch and noticed that it was 6:45 p.m. and then my eyes were drawn to the sky where there was what looked like a short contrail from a jet.  But what was unusual and really got my attention was an object that seemed to be following the same general direction of the contrail, but it&#39;s speed varied.  It was so far away I couldn&#39;t tell if it was another jet or something else, but there was no contrail or anything around it.  I took a picture with my digital camera and I can&#39;t tell if it is one or two objects behind the contrail.  (See photo attached.)<n>

It was totally brown with red eyes, and one by one four more popped up from the near by plants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 3:00 I noticed five triangular discs in the sky that were moving very slowly, zig zagging. At times they were stationary and at times they would move slowly. At about 3:50 AM they just disappeared/ vanished. It was like a light switch turning off. I was only able to make out one craft and it was triangular. The formation of the five craft were as followed:  x     x          x x x<n>

There were four or five small rectangular dimmed lights that were on a curve on the center right front.  The object did not make any noise as it was flying.  There were no red lights or blinking white lights on the object as required in the US.  The speed was approximately 25 mph.  The object was moving in the sky similar to a blimp.

We were going past our general store and all of a sudden  we look to our right and there where 5 bright orange lights in parallel to each other. There was one light under the other 5 lights. We have a 2000 toyota rav 4 with a moon roof. I opened the moon roof to see If I could hear anything and there was no sound. I thought at first they were flares but flares will fly in a arc when the drop. The object must have been about 600- 700 feet above tree level so I thought that It could not have been a fighter jet testing because there not allowed to fly that low.  After about 30 seconds it just disappeared it was flying next to our car. The lights did not burn out slowly that were just out in the snap of a finger. It is really interesting to me. Me and my uncle always watch ufo files and this kinda resembled the pheonix sighting. It kind of scared me. You have no clue what it is it is just so mysterious. I really hope you guys can give me some answers because im really interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One in the NW sky, one in the NE sky, one in the SE, one in the SW.  The moon is almost full.  There are a lot of planes as well in the sky tonight, but these lights are stationary, and they don&#39;t blink like an airplane. I saw the first one at about 20:30.

9/17/08 19:56|Whitby (Canada)|ON|Circle|4-5 mintues|Same UFO spotted in same place 5 days apart from each other.|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75807.html|218|ndxe200809| Same UFO spotted in same place 5 days apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am letting it known right now that even though this event happened on the night of September 17th 2008, exactly 5 days prior my girlfriend and I saw this same object in the sky.  As I took out my phone to  capture the Unidentified Flying Object (had a blackberry pearl at the time) and while I went to the camera mode to take a quick picture of it all of a sudden the camera was not working and the screen had gone completely white during this first event, and all of a sudden as soon as this object in the sky disappeared I look down at my phone and the camera function starts to work.  I knew it was time to purchase a new phone so I got a new iphone a couple of days later.  On the night of September 17th 2008. My girlfriend and I were walking down the street from my house and we saw the same object in the sky in the same place.  The object was just sitting idle for what seemed to be a couple of minutes .It was circular in shape and had a neon green glow coming from! it.  I knew the location it was hovering over.  It was hovering over the water I would say about 15-20,000ft in the air at the Port Whitby Boat Marina in Ontario, Canada.  Right around that area.  As the green glowing object started moving I knew it was time to test the camera out on my phone. As I take out my phone and get the camera ready to start taking a couple of pictures.  My girlfriend and I are stunned by what we are observing.  The object is idle in one spot, then in a split second must have travelled a couple of miles in the sky to the left.  Then stops for a split second again and then goes back in another split second to the right then once again stops for a split second then again another split second later back to the left when it stops in less then a second again then in speed that I have never seen before not even from fighter jets shoots off to the right into the sky and disappears.  I had managed to be able to take 2 pictures on my phone during this event of the ! object moving back and forth. I know for certainty there is NO aircraf t in the world that can perform such maneuvers and can have speed like that and be able to stop on a dime and again accelerate to incredible speed in what seemed like just a couple of miles.  This was no human constructed aircraft. It was from what I can tell an Unidentified Flying Object .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was currently in high school at the time and I had already graduated about 1 year before hand.  Not exactly sure what type of things you would like for the backround information but if any information needed please contact me through email or cell.<n>

After about 10 minutes I went to get my brother and my telescope.  Through the telescope the object was a very bright white circle being circled rapidly by a much smaller object that appeared to have a constant beam of light hitting the larger object.  This went on long enough for all three of us to watch it through the telescope.  When I again looked through the telescope, there appeared to be an explosion on the larger object and I could see what looked like a fireworks star-burst.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller object then rapidly left the view through my telescope.  Once that happened, you could no longer see the larger object with the naked eye.  It all ended approx. 19:45 central time.  The larger object was brighter than the planet Jupiter which was also visible but in the southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 3:45 to 4am but before I walked inside I lit up a cigarette and started to smoke it on my porch.  I don’t like to smoke inside my house.   I looked up and about 3 miles away I saw this orange ball of light in the sky and at first I thought it was a plane with orange headlights because my house faces the London airport about 8 miles east of my place.  When I looked at it waiting for it to fly over my house or away It didn’t, it just stood there.  Then I ran inside to get my camera and to take a picture.    I hurried because I didn’t want it to go away.  Of course my digital camera was low on batteries so I could only manage to take one shot before it shut down on me.  I was frustrated and cursing then it looked back up and it was gone.  No sound no nothing.  This is the photo.   I can’t make sense of it.  I don’t know what it is all I do know that those are stars in the background and also I don’t know what the object is on the lower right.  Let me know what you think.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a very bright star to the left of where I was standing. Didn&#39;t think too much of it and just kept looking around. Then I noticed another star that was quite bright but had a tail coming from it. I adjusted my eyes, because it could just be my eyes, but no it had a tail. I looked around at other stars to really make sure it wasn&#39;t my eyes. As I looked around I say a star that was positioned in the triangle that shows up in the sky that normally is not there. It also had a tail. The tails would get long and then short. I watched these for a while to see if they would move or disappear but they were just hovering. I could be wrong but I really felt like they did not belong there and that they were observing something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter seen it first and asked &#34;what is that?&#34; I seen four of the six lights she had seen, the sight went away.  We stayed out following the flashing light, moving slowly for about 10 minutes then the bright lights appeared again.  Could not tell if what shape of object they were on, it would appear to be round because of the way they flowed.  The following description is what was seen two (2) times, was there about 10 second duration done and happened again in about 10 minutes.  The tiny blinking light (1) never left until 2nd appearance was done.  The main lights were quite bright white/gold with red appearance around the outside.  The first light would have been to the right side and it would fade out as the one ahead of it (to left side) would become bright and so on for four lights I seen, each time, the first time my daughter seen six of them and asked me to look and I only seen from the fourth one on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were bright, circle, one fade in and then fade out as the other fade in and so on.  Almost as going around.  Not quite sure what it was, I know it was not a airplane because we seen them behind us in the sky and they are noticeable.  But we are both very glad we seen it.  Hope we have an answer some day.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My first thought was that it was a plane because the light was bright.  It seems stationary and I at first was convinced it was conventional aircraft.

The atmospheric condition was partly cloudy. We had already started our descent and were probably about 3-4 miles up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 18:30, about 30 minutes before we landed at LAX, I spotted a spherical metallic-looking object moving at approximately 150-400 mph either west-east or sw-ne about 1-2 miles above the ground, moving the exact opposite direction of the plane about a half mile to the south. It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 yards.  ((sic--100 feet.)   I first spotted it at about 11:00 (direction, not time), and I was only able to view it for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared from view. I didn’t notice any lights on the object, but it was reflecting the sun which was low in the wsw which caused it to appear bright copper. I didn’t notice any other physical features such as wings or a tail, and it didn’t leave an exhaust stream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m 52 years old, and have been an amateur astronomer since I was a young child.  In my life, I’ve seen just about anything you can think of in the sky, but never before last night have I ever seen an object that I could not identify.  I’ve probably made over 40 cross-country flights, and am used to seeing planes and helicopters, but the object I saw last night didn’t resemble anything I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it has a non-UFO explanation, but I decided to post the incident anyhow in hopes that someone else may have seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a correction to my previous report submitted 09/17/08 at 14:17:09.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I described the size of the object, it should have read:  It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (In my original submittal, I stated 100 yards.)<n>

The lights then moved in line from west to east with no sound.  I am just south of Tulsa Airport and at first thought it was a jet that was taking off because I did hear a rumbling sound when I had first seen the lights.  But when the lights split into multiple lights I humorously thought a jet might have been sent to investigate the lights.  I do not know who to contact to see if there was a series of jets that took off that morning.  Surely they would not allow 6 or 7 jets to take flight at 1:30am with surrounding residential areas so close to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a fire in the sky that moved very slowly and suddenly disappeared.  Many people were outside viewing it and some were videotaping it, other residents from close by areas saw it too.  It was comming from the North/East over the oceanfront maybe?  It must have hung around for at least twenty minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But thats not where the story ends.  Later that night me and my Girlfriend, ((female&#39;s name deleted)) were shopping for groceries in the local Farm Fresh located on General Booth blvd.  I noticed a strange looking man walking past.  He was tall, caucasion, dressed in casual cloths and he was by himself but there was something strange about his eyes.  They looked a little out there. Heres a photo of what the eyes kind of looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://daysofourlife.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/charles-manson.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked passed and didn&#39;t really think too much of it except &#34;that guy looked weird&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another man caucasion, short, casual cloths-also alone, and he had the same eyes!  I became interested and followed him for a bit.  He walked over to the magazine section and was reading some magazine(didn&#39;t look to see which one), and I told ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) about what I had seen and she told me to go up to him and ask him for directions, so I did.  His movement was very erratic and he had his head lowered at an angle(which I also found strange). I told him that I was lost and needed to know the best way to get to the oceanfront.  He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn&#39;t turn away from his magazine and wouldn&#39;t look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.  I will tell you this, as a person who is experianced in meditation and telepathy, the man gave off a very strange, unearthly energy that I cannot describe.  I felt hypnotized by his words.  I couldn&#39;t read anything from him except th! at I felt as if I was pulled in by his strange energy.  He told me that he wasn&#39;t from here and couldn&#39;t help me.  I felt tongue tied and couldn&#39;t bring myself to say anything else.  I walked away feeling hazy, as if the experiance had happened in a dream or something.  My hand were cold and I was shaking.  I told ((woman&#39;s name deleted)) about it and she insisted that she speak with him herself as her psychic powers are natural and mine are more developed.  By the time we had returned, he had disappeared.  I just wanted to leave, so we did.  Nothing else came out of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Each bright light was located at every end of the triangle. Interested in what I was looking at I decided to drive closer to the object to get a better look. I was able to get right under the craft and get a pretty good view of it. I was about 300 FT from the ground, and was moving at a very slow and steady speed. I got out of my car to get a better view and noticed that it was making no sounds. It was heading west onto I 95. I would have loved to have some evidence but the only thing on me at the time was a cell phone, and all that appeared on camera was a bright red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun at that time and location was at Altitude -17.7° and Azimuth 281.8° E of N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slightly north of the moon&#39;s expected rising point, at about 80° to 75°Azimuth, I saw what at first I thought were Venus and Mercury in a formation I saw two years ago in Bogotá, Colombia, when Mercury was seen above and to the left of Venus in the city&#39;s southern night sky.  Yesterday&#39;s &#34;Venus,&#34; however, was unusually large, round and bright, and &#34;Mercury&#34; moved quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion, right before I aimed my Sony DSC-F828 camera towards my &#34;planets&#34; and took several pictures, e-mailing separately:  DSC00066: At 7:39 pm &#34;Venus&#34; is bright and clear above a cloud formation that has two horn-like extensions on top.  &#34;Mercury&#34; is no longer white, it is now a yellow moving element as it moves away quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion from its previous position above &#34;Venus.&#34;  Neither &#34;Venus&#34; nor &#34;Mercury&#34; have strobe red and bluish-white lights which would identify them as commercial aircraft, approaching FLL&#39;s international airport.  At the lower-left, another yellow light is seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DSC00067: Still at 7:39 pm, &#34;Venus&#34; is at its same position above the cloud and the yellow light from DSC00066&#39;s lower-left area begins to move rapidly in an upward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DSC00068: Still at 7:39 pm, I zoom in into &#34;Venus&#34; and my camera&#39;s automatic focus, without clear referencing points, blurs the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DSC00069: Now at 7:40 pm, I still cannot get my camera to focus correctly, &#34;Venus&#34; has not moved from its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DSC00070: Still at 7:40 pm, I zoom out as &#34;Venus&#34; shoots up and to the left, caught here emitting white light from its bottom and yellow light from its top.

Many people were stopped to look at the quarry.  We came over the tracks and noticed that everyone was looking upward.  We looked upward and there wwere 2 fireball objects passing overhead with another one in the west.  Steady speed, no sound at all, no navigation lights.  This is exactly the same object that we saw less than 1 month ago on a night with a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witnessed a brightly illuminated(blue) object in the sky.  It was just right there motionless(or so it seemed to the naked eye) not too much higher then out tallest building of around 12 floors.  It was unlike anything i have ever seen.  my husband pulled up next to me and i told him to hurry and look.  We sped home to witness this with out children and grab our binoculars for a closer look.  The object seemed to slowly move closer then stop.  At first the shape was round and bright blue in color. We took pictures.  It changed color to a solid orange/red, then began changing shapes. Pear shape, round, oblong, oval, as well as changing to being outlined in orange/red.  I made sure I was propped against car to steady my arms as we were looking through our binoculars and discussing everything we were seeing.  The object made irratic darting movements, causing me to constantly have to re-find and re-focus it. After about 5-10 min. it slowly slowly began drifting up at about a 70 degree angle. as it got higher it again changed color back to the brilliant blue only outlined this time.  By the time it was almost out of sight, passed the stars, it was barely even light outside.  It was awesome.  The weather was clear and this object looked and felt so out of place in our sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But they had a form.  They were definitely not balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also could tell they were quite large, because if a buzzard, the bigget bird around here was that high it would have been about a sixth to an eighth of the size of these things, and it would have been soaring and flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were stationary and were in a line side by side but separate individual objects, not moving any parts, just floating with the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at them for a short while but could not figure out what they were.  They didn’t look like anything I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my house to get a pair of binoculars, but when I got back outside, they weren’t there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and have not seen them since.<n>

September 2008 - 3 Witnesses - Triangular Formation in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im telling this exactly as it happened because I think alot of people don&#39;t come forward like they should so I&#39;m telling what I saw.  Unfortunatley, I never thought of reporting it til now, but this is how it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happned around mid september 2008 in San antonio Tx, on the Southeast side.  Me and my friends ((male name #1 deleted)) and ((male name #2 deleted)) were walking we were about a little past ((female name deleted)) coming down Schley going the west when Nathan told us to look in the sky,I didnt see it at first until my friend nathan pointed it out, but when I did I was like &#34;What the hell is that!!!&#34;   The thing seemed to be about a mile away and it didnt seem to do much but move real slow.  But let me tell you, I watch the History channel and seen about stealth but damn this was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  The thing would kinda glow on and off to where when it would glow, there were about 20, what I guess could be called bulbs, floating in a triangular formation that would turn white, but then it turned transparent. It continued to do this at about a rate of 1 pulse every 2 seconds, fading white then gone, white then gone, non stop. The thing moved real slow and kinda, came towards our way as we were walking. The whole time I was freaking out to seeing something like that. At one point I tried to take a picture but my camera phone wasnt able to zoom that far or even make it out at all. So we continued looking at it until it went behind some trees and we couldnt see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just for the refrence,  This thing was not a plane, It was not birds, or a meteroite or any natural occurance for that matter. It was something beyond my undertanding. I&#39;ve never seen a plane fly that slow either, it just cant be done... I&#39;ve seen planes all my childhood when my dad worked on them. This was not a plane! And I&#39;ve never seen a bird change colors before. We know what we saw and I will put it on everything to stand by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what could this possibly mean?  Are they here to observe us?  Or is it the government?<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

A very large craft. It happened during a lightning storm. That was nearly 3 years ago. Since then I have not made any reports or seen any other objects. Although I have had a experience on 9/15/2008 at exactly 0533 hours. I set my alarm and woke at 0445 hours. I showered then packed my bags for a long work trip to Oregon. I noticed the time after I got out of the shower and it was 2 minutes after 0500. I loaded the vehicle and finished making my morning diet drink and went to the car to leave. What happened next was very weird. It was 0633 in the morning. I got very angry that I was late and made several calls on my cell phone immediately to make sure it was really 0633 the time on the cars clock. It really was 0633. It took me several 11 days to figure this all out. I got home from my work trip and went to my alarm clock to see the time on it (battery Operated) It was on time exactly and the alarm was set to 0445. I don&#39;t remember walking to the vehicle that morning to leave only that I was looking at the clock and feeling angry that my alarm clock had let me down. It never has in the past. I am missing one hour of time. I was alone.<n>

They were all at relative distance to each other not in formation, but rather part of what seemed to be a very large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky this night was very clear with lots of visible  stars, a typical fall night up here in the North Country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Son and I went outside to get a better look, once outside we observed no sound coming from the object which was roughly a few miles away traveling very slowly much to slow for any kind of aircraft also judging from the amount of stars that it obscured from view, its height and distance from us it was extremely large roughly perhaps twice the size of a modern day aircraft Carrier,  We observed the object for a few minutes when it increased it&#39;s speed rapidly and was gone from view in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many lights and objects in the sky, but never thought that any of them could not be explained, however the object my Son and I observed this night was far to large, made no sound and moved far to slowly to be of any aircraft design I know of.<n>

Looking in the camera screen I noticed a small white light dancing back and forth beneath the moon. It moved side to side, one moment on the left side of the moon, the next moment it moved across the sky to the other side of the moon. It was moving below the moon forming a U shape around the bottom of the moon. It&#39;s movements were rapid and jerky, kind of like how a fly moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t see this with our naked eyes but 3 of us did see it with the camera lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night and many stationary stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of this object was circular, it looked like a star that was moving very fast across the sky. I can&#39;t believe it was an aircraft as I&#39;ve never seen anything of this earth move like that. It was very erratic in it&#39;s movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white color, that of a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background: A lifelong belief and interest in ufos as my family and neighbors witnessed ufos over Westchester, Calif when I was very young..but old enough to remember the excitement. At that time, my father reported this sighting to ufo folks and they had an official meeting at our house that included people from Hughs Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A long time listener of Art Bell and others, I have long been aware and interested in ufos in a serious and open minded way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;ve ever witnessed anything like this or reported any such sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did email a ufo guy in Orange Co. here via his webby mufonoc -Mutual ufo Network OC<n>

It seamed ragged in appearance, and was flying fairly close to the ground.  It made no noise, and its shape did not fluctuate.  It appeared initially to be two birds flying together, but there was no flapping of wings.  When it was first sighted, the object was parallel to the horizon, but shifted to perpendicular after about two minutes.  The object was observed through 7x binoculars but was, at that point, two far away to be identified.  The object was not moving in a decaying trajectory, thus ruling out a falling item.  It made no sudden accelerations, and exhibited no lights.  After about three minutes of observation the object disappeared behind the trees.  The object seemed to be about 12 feet long ad three feet wide.  No further observations were made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My front porch also faces north.  I was talking for about 3 minutes and I noticed an object in the sky going from east to west. I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane, jet or hellicoptor. Their was also no sound coming from it. I live in the country and it is very quiet where I live. I told my friend what I was looking at and said it may be a UFO. My friend asked where I was looking and told me they were outside also. They told me they could see it also and could not figure what it was. They also noted that it was silent. I was about to run in my house and get my camera and it suddenly disappeared, I couldn&#39;t see it. I asked my friend if they saw it and they also said it is gone, it was just there and it just disappeared. I then siad I bet it was a UFO. about 30 seconds after that I started to hear the sound of a jet. I said to my friend I can hear a jet sound maybe it was a jet. Then seconds after that a jet flew from the south towards where the Unidentified object was. This was the first time I saw a jet like this flying. It was one of those with the dish type radar on top of it. I think they call them AWAX or AWAC. This jet kept flying north. Shortly it was out of sight and you could not hear it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am familiar with the flight patterns of planes and this was not a common pattern and planes have wings. The object was round an very dark yet it seemed shiny enough to occasionally reflect the sun. I pointed out the object to my girlfriend who happened to be the driver. We observed it while stopped at a light. It then did something I never saw any plane or manmade flying apparatus do. It stopped dead. And began to move very quickly in the opposite north western direction. We pulled into a home depot parking lot just to watch it. It began to ascend into the clouds that were to the north. Eventually it disappeared into the cloud bank. Shortly after a fast moving helicopter did pass through the exact area we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I  ran to see what he was talking about and sure enough there was some unknown craft above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was up pretty high up and dark outside so we couldn&#39;t tell what shape it was but, it was glowing orange as if it was on fire. The glow was almost as if it was pulsing but not going completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, it was hovering in one location and appeared to not be moving at all. About 30 seconds after I first saw it it started to accelerate fairly quickly to the east. It traveled not to far and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to my neighbors house as they saw it much longer. They said it was coming from the north and was glowing a bluish color and as it got closer they saw what looked like sparks coming off of it. My neighbor said she was sure a plane was gone drop out of the sky. As it got closer the glow changed from blueish to a fiery orange. And then the craft stopped above them. That&#39;s when I got the call and rushed outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was but the orange glow could not have been a normal aircraft. Possibly a military jet with afterburners on flying straight up could explain why it was stationary at first and appeared to accelerate so fast. I dunno but it was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

It was headed in a southwesterly direction toward the Black Hills in Tumwater. As it headed across the sky, it did not appear to be going in a straight trajectory but rather sort of a &#34;squiggly&#34; path. It climbed higher and higher as it went. I don&#39;t know how to judge in feet, but it was flying relatively low, when I initially spotted it and seemed to quickly be gaining altitude. It was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Airplane fly over through out the day because I live in a flight pattern, and I always look up to see.  This morning I heard a plane but it was a passenger plane or that size, flying up high and as I looked at the plane, lo and behold if there were not 3 discs shaped “craft” flying behind this jet.  I could see they were probably higher in altitude; they seemed to just follow along.  The were not flying in a “row” they were just 3, close in proximity and one of them seemed to be going back and forth, as if “playing around.”  I watched one of the “craft” fly up even higher and disappear as the other 2 continued following. Now this happened in a 15-20 second span.  They were reflecting light so they were solid.  Not birds, not balloons, no wings but clearly following above and behind the plane.  I wanted to run and get my camera but I knew that by the time I got it they would be out of view from my vantage point.  I am not crazy and actually feel crazy even writing this but it’s not the first time I have seen “ufo” activity here in this area and it is never reported on the news. I am curious as to why when I have seen objects/ufo&#39;s, that there is nothing, nothing! even in the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft did not appear to be moving. I initially thought it could have been a banner of some sort, but after stopping the car and observing for a few minutes, it was obvious this was not the case. First, the craft was much too large to be pulled by a plane and had no text or picture of any kind. It was a flat dark gray color. From it&#39;s position relative to mine and the apparent size in the sky, it appeared to be much larger than an airliner. I drove down Lawyers Road toward NC 27 to get a closer look at the object as it appeared to drift westward. I did not seem to be getting any closer to the craft as it was still a considerable distance away when I got to NC 27. I turned around and returned to Mint Hill and was unable to see the craft once I had stopped again. About 15-20 minutes later, I was outdoors again and looked to the north to see if the craft was visible. The craft was emerging from behind a cloud on the horizon, which gave good indication of it&#39;s distance. There were very few clouds in the sky. The craft appeared much smaller, probably further away. It was drifting westward once again and disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The three lights were vertical, then went horizontal and darted across the freeway.  We couldn&#39;t really tell what the shape of the aircraft was but it almost looked triangular and or boomerang. When it was tilting to the side i swear it was black but we really couldn&#39;t see the body of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the about the size of a freeway lane and seemed about 3 feet high, but it was kinda hard to determine the size.  It was not that far away, which was weird because the lights were not blinding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights turned of when across the freeway and seemed to fly almost like a kite, very smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned off the radio and could not hear any kind of aircraft. It went into a field and vanished to latter pop up and seemed to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were 10 miles south of the 165 on the I5. I tried to drive over to check out what it was but both my girlfriend and niece were freaking out and didn&#39;t want me driving towards it. Anyone have a similar experience on 09/14/08??  Very curious.<n>

I looked at it for a bit, then stepped out to see how bright the other stars were and to see if I could identify a constellation for reference.  The stars were not bright at all so I wondered if I would hear about this in the news later.  Then as I was watching it started to slowly move, as it moved closer the bright light appeared to be 3 or 4 lights in the center.  At first I thought it might just be a Harrier as it appeared to be over the vacinity of Mt. Weather, VA along the Shenandoah River.  Then I realized the lights were clustered with blinking red lights around that and a few white lights on the outer perimeter.  It came almost directly over me and I know airplanes, I worked at an FBO and there were no outer wings lights, tail or nose lights.  I could determine no shape whatsoever.  I heard it, it was a muffled plane sound.  It was not a chopper.  It went over the house and I went in.  I just kept thinking about it and I am sending this to you and do wish I had grabed my camera or my phone for photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window to see what the weather was doing. I saw a light in the sky. Thinking it was a plane with it&#39;s head lights on, but I didn&#39;t see any blue or reds on the tips. Also at this point I relized it wasn&#39;t going foward or away.It wasn&#39;t a helicoptor. It was dead silence outside. Now I was curious, so I kept staring for roughly five minutes. I watched it go from one side to the other in the sky. Then it went up and down. When this bright orb would go from one side to another it would disapear for a sec then reapear to a different part of the sky. Don&#39;t know why I waited so long to say something to some one. Also the following week I saw military chopers in the sky. One cargo looking one and a tiny one. That following week I saw something in the day time - a black sphere speeding through sky. I have never see anything move that fast befoere. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen things here in Vermont. I guess cause of the view I hav. It&#39;s over 100 miles and crystal clear skies. That helps for stuff like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The object appeared to be circular with blue, white and green lights with an intermittent red center.  I woke up my brother and his family who also observed the object for about 20 minutes.  At one point there appeared to be two objects.  The second only being observed for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister-in-law took several pictures.

My wife was leaving our apartment to run an errand for her mother. We live in a second floor apartment. I ventured outside onto the porch area(which faces east) to bid her farewell. Thats when I noticed a helicopter flying low in the sky. Then I noticed that helicopter was following something moving directly east. This something was a translucent diamond shaped object and its color matched the haze of the sky. It had no lights and wasn&#39;t outpacing the helicopter by much. If it was silent I wouldn&#39;t have noticed because of the helicopter&#39;s sound. It was in my field of view for about 15 seconds. I exclaimed, &#34;What the heck is that.&#34; Simultaneously, my wife couldn&#39;t get our car started and asked me to look into it. I waited a while because I was still in awe of what I had seen and was describing it to her and my daughter. Then ten minutes later I started the car with no problem. She stated that she saw the same object at the same time I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Only thing is they are in the sky. Resembled the flashing of a cops light bar on top of their vehicles. Blue and red. Then I come to notice their is tons of these. Scattered all over the sky in this region. In formations they we just hovering, but once here and there one would switch positions. The objects were in my guess, maybe 65 feet in the sky. Very low, right over a few buildings and animal fields. Now as of now I haven&#39;t heard of any animals missing or anything in this neighborhoods, but this is mainly because I&#39;d rather not get labeled a nut-job by my neighbors. But they didn&#39;t seem to notice me, or if thats the case, care I was watching. I was stopped for around 20 minutes. The entire time they stayed in a triangular formation, with several formations in the sky, heavy cloud cover from incoming hurricane weather, and they made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just something I&#39;ve taken note of, once I did get home I was extremely tired, and thats why I took off from watching this is a felt like I would fall asleep in my truck, sitting in the middle of a road. Also in our local paper The Herald Times in Bloomington, yesterday it was reported that we have had crop circles found in a nearby town of Bedford. I would be happy to send and photos of the area of sighting or of what the object looked like if needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I went to the bathroom and when I came back about 10-20 people were looking to the sky.  There were 3 orange bright glowing balls, which was first sighted in a triangle shape.  Then one of the back corner UFO&#39;s raced forward passing the lead circle.  Instead of continuing across the sky from South to North they moved up and got smaller and smaller until you could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was glowing reddish orange and stopped approx 150 ft from the ground, it had misty trails and an aura/grey haze around it. The craft stopped completely and then changed course moving in a &#34;Z&#34; motion with extreme speed, again it stopped abruptly and shuddered/vibrated, at this time the craft was at a 45 degree angle to the ground, then the craft changed angle leveling out. The craft made almost no sound but a low humming vibration and was approx 50-60ft long. The craft never changed color or shape and seemed like it was spinning very,very fast.The craft disappeared in an instant leaving a ring of light the shape of the object. Seeing aircraft in the sky around our house is not uncommon as we live directly in back of an old military airfield (Mather airfield), now used for commercial and small passenger aircraft, this craft and encounter was not anything like a plane,jet or helicopter, or aircraft in use in todays technology I took 3 photos, two show the glowing object at the different angles and the third shows a the &#34;Z&#34; movement, misty trails and a metallic object in the right lower corner. The experience lasted approx 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we got outside, we had seen 4 Dim white LIGHTS hovering in the sky circling our house. They had said it had been following them from down the block. It was the weirdest moment of my life. It wasnt doing slow, they were going in really fast circle motions. I couldnt record it because the lights were too dim. Every once in a while they would flash a white light. It was cloudy so they were above the clouds too. We didn&#39;t know who to call or anything... I think they are still there now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All together in one shape. It was like a see- through giant mixing bowl, used in the kitchen. This UFO was as low as a fully grown oak tree. The bottom of it was bigger than the oak trees circumference, and the top was about the width of a football pitch. The UFO was round in shape. The lights were window shape, like rectangles, but no definate edge to them. They were whitey cloud colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could only see the UFO if there was a cloud behind it. As soon as the UFO went above or below the cloud which was behind it, you lost sight of that part of the UFO.I called out for the UFO to come closer to us for a better look, and it did. We watched this UFO circling a field for about 40  minutes. We slowly started heading home, and the UFO followed us for three miles. Stopping when we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When a small air craft was spotted in the sky, this UFO shrunk into a small ball and hind unseen, as soon as the plane passed, the UFO could be seen in its full glory again. I did take about 4 or 5 photos on my mobile phone. When I was in my car I had a quick look at one of them, but it was just black sky. When I got home I thought that I could down load them onto my computer and enlarge the image. The problem was, when I looked on my phone memory for them, they were not there,as if erased from the memory. This was an unforgetable experience and I would love to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I tell my sibling to look and says &#34;What is that?&#34; then the lights start to move to the right side of the car and then my parents and sibling gasp when they see these white(color changed) lights moving in a circular motion. We couldn&#39;t believe our eyes. We had just seen a UFO. I had never thought that I&#39;d see one in my life. Besides the government couldn&#39;t possibly lie this time (make an excuse) because there are no army jets flying arouns in the bay area and the only airport near Dublin is very small and has likewise small planes (not for traveling)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

M. in North Las Vegas, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 9-12-08 at around 8 P.M. I was returning home from work and dinner. I was alone and had entered my complex when I saw a large saucer shaped spacecraft. My first thought was that what I was seeing could not be for real. It was so big and unmistakably an alien craft, or a projection of one, that I could not believe what I was seeing. It appeared to be spinning and changed colors. The only colors I remember vividly were pink and green. Because of the size of the craft, I started to get nervous thinking that this could be an invasion. Instead of stopping I slowly turned down my street and eventually lost sight of the craft. I pulled into the driveway and went into the house for my binoculars. I was not able to find it again. When I returned to my house I put on the Sunday night Football game to get the score and I had some old fashioned radio like static for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not believe no one else saw this.<n>

I would say it was perhaps 500-1000 feet off the ground, but its hard to say, because, well I know this sounds weird, but its shape was hard to make out the closer it got. It looked spherical, and was scintillating, and curiously, the air around it seemed to shimmer - it was hard to see its edge, that&#39;s the only way I can describe it. It moved silently from my left, and I was thinking to myself that if it stopped it would have be a UFO. And then, as if it heard my thought, it stopped directly in front of me! I just stared at it, and I had the most curious feeling of being watched, hard to describe, just felt as if it realized I was looking - so I waved at it.  It then started to slowly go up into the sky. As it was going up, its color seemed to change to a whitish metallic, almost like sodium. And then, it began to flash. A bright, neon green, then pink, and yellow. It also - sounds weird again - seemed to phase in and out of the air. It would seem to disappear, then I would see one of the flashes, and it would appear again at some distance and disappear. This continued until it was a tiny speck in the sky and then I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you can help me identify what I saw, or let me know if other people have seen similar craft, I would be very appreciative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

The lights seemed to circle the object. I&#39;m not sure if it was my eyes playing tricks on me but it also seemed like small rays of light were coming off of, what i was almost making out to be, the corners of the object like it was surveying or scanning. i was only able to watch it for a short while before i became unnerved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were approaching the state road 276.  My wife noted a very bright yellow light to the southeast high in the sky at about a 45% angle from the horizon.  It appeared very high in the sky.  It appeared as one light even though we were seeing it thru trees beside the road.  It was very very bright.  It seemed to go on and off at first like warning beacon.  It was maybe on for 2 seconds but then off more than 10 seconds.  I told her that was too long off for a safety beacon.  We were looking for a break in the trees so we could see better.  We were traveling about 45 mph.  Then a whole large cloud became the same bright yellow like the object had gone behind.  This was brighter than how a lighting bolt would light up a cloud.  We then came to a clearing just before the junction of  County Road 276.  We pulled off the road and looked toward the bright yellow object that was at the moment behind a cloud.  It then seemed to quickly move from behind the cloud and appear as several large bright yellow lights moving in a curved line toward the ground.  This lasted only 2-3 seconds and then the lights turned off but we could still see a much smaller orange-red light moving very rapidly across the sky.  We are accustomed to seeing military helicopters near our home town about 45 miles to the north.  This was moving much more rapidly than they move and seemed higher.  It also changed direction more rapidly.  It seemed to move like a fast jet but could do a 180 degree direction change instantly.  We watched this for maybe 5 min then it disappeared.  We watch for maybe another 10 min and it came back for maybe a min as the small orange-red light and then disappeared again to the southeast.  Tyndall air force base is in that direction east of Panama City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote this about 11:30 once we reach Panama City and unloaded our car.  After I wrote this my wife proofed it and only added that it seemed much higher than a helicopter.  Otherwise she saw it as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was looking out the window and saw what appeared to be a craft with two very bright white lights (top &amp; bottom) with a red strobe in the middle blinking about 4 times faster that the red light on the wing of our plane. It passed very slowly off the left side of the plane (approx 10 seconds from as far right as I could see to as far left). Then two more side by side (or could have been one above the other as perspective is difficult, passed below the wing. They seemed to be moving at the same speed and had same light configurations as the first. We were flying level at the time so i guess the first one would have been at about a 90• angle and the second two at about 65*. This too lasted about 10 seconds. I was trying to gauge the size of the lights as they did appear to be quite large. the white lights I gauged to be slightly less than a quarter of the moon that nigh and the red strobes were a bit smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our altitude at the time was approx 37,400 feet and air speed was approx 550 mph<n>

This object appeared to be metallic in nature because of the quality of the surface reflections. It reflected shades of salmon/pink and yellow on its surface. This was particularly noticeable, because the prevailing weather conditions this morning at 7 am was thick gray clouds in all directions. The object looked to be in the distant sky approximately 9.8 miles (the distance from Luna @ 635 to 635 @ 75 via Google Maps) but was large to my vantage point. I looked solidly at this object for a mere 2-3 seconds before diverting my attention back to the road I was currently driving down. After a quick 2 seconds glance to the road, I looked back and was perplexed to find the object no longer was visible to me, even though, i had a clear view of all skies around me in my convertible jeep wrangler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if anyone else saw this object today.<n>

Originally we thought there was one light, then when it got close to he middle of it&#39;s track (nearly directly over the bridge) it became two distinct orbs. It may have been two crafts, but we (me and my boyfriend) think it was just one. It moved from South to North (I think, it may be the opposite), then hovered. We lost sight of it for maybe a second, then when the area it hovered in was back in our line of sight, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When one would be flying above head it seemed to multiply for there were suddenly 2 then 3 more apearing out of nowhere... criss cossing and circling around each other then proceeding straight out of sight like on a normal flight path..but much larger, faster, and encircling to be normal planes.. Once overhead they appeared triangular in shape, although the outline of the craft was faintly seen..<n> <n><n> <n><n> When one would rise/descend behind the treelines three or four more would suddenly appear from nowhere, fly tward the treelines, then take off.. At one point, a tiny version of the big/little dipper appeared above the treelines.. Very Bright!!!.. But like a tear in the middle, and these craft appeared to be comming out of that.. Larger than normal White flickery stars have been all around this region for months.. There one night and not another.. two or three at a time.. Sometimes still, sometimes rising up and vanishing.. Never any noise involved.. Last night was the 1st time we saw the individual crafts all over though.. It was just a feeling like &#39;ok..now we&#39;ve seen and know we can believe something is not right in the world&#39;.. But we will not contact authorities because what can anyone do anyhow?.. Although if this incident happens again, we will let neighbors know for it is their right...When these would get near to above us , the phone would shut off..<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I was talking to my husband about what to do..)The sound of Electricity was faintly heard every time they were popping out...Aprox. every 3 minutes..

It remained stationary for about 15 mins and proceeded to circle around the outskirts. All in the same time it would stop for no longer than 5 mins and proceed to circle, moving at an varied speeds. This happened for about an hour, untill it began moving towards the center of the city; near the capitol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been a star gazer for most of my existance, and have never seen an object move in the matter this one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors seemed to circle around the craft/object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every once in a while it would disappear then emerge in another spot, stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In more than one instance, it looked as though there was a light that would almost pop out of it then circle the craft and return back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of nowhere; two more showed up and the three of them made a line almost like orions belt, and began to move in slow pace towards the outskirts once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for another hour or so; then the crafts simply pulled up and then moved in a very quick manner away and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft has been seen for the past 2 days, and i&#39;ve turned alot of people into the idea of simply watching it and observing the movements to validate my own sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all the descriptions by other people i know, its something they&#39;ve never seen in the night sky before; and in some cases it terrifies them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(same time as on the 7th) Below is my previous report. The object (or possibly objects?) was seen under the same constellation and followed the same flight path as on the 7th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (original report) &#34;On September 7th 2008, at approximately 10:15pm, my roomate and I witnessed what appeared to be a UFO in the western sky over our house. What I saw was 2 lights that had the appearence of satelites in the sky, in a second or 2 after seeing them we noticed the third light forming a large triangle. These lights were moving in unison with eachother and were moving slowly to the southeast, I ran inside and woke up my girlfriend and had her come out and see them as well. When we came out the object was still in the sky, but started moving more in a southern direction. within a minute or two the object did another series of slow turns, first east and then ended in a southbound tragectory, flying away from us. Then the lights went out first the front then rear left and finally rear right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself could not have been made out without the lights. It made no sound. It seemed to be flying very high, and the lights appeared as satelites do in the night sky. One could have even mistaken them for stars at a glance. The three light seemed to be fixed in that pattern the single light forward and the others in back relitive to the direction it was traveling. There was only deviation in the pattern when the object changed direction, giving the appearance of &#34;banking&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the front and back lights was around 4 inches at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a flight path where C-130&#39;s do their final approach for landing. Every night we see commercial air traffic from the SeaTac airport. I have never in my life observed something like this in the sky.&#34;<n>

At high altitude was a small round object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so high as to be difficult to say if it had any shape other than round, or any distinguishing markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A high flying airliner was nearby and was below this object which in my estimation had to make the object we saw at least as large as the passenger jet. The object was moving in a strange sort of s-pattern, changing directions a number of times in a short distance. Next it seemed to go straight up, as it became suddenly smaller and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object for less than one minute. Neither of us had ever seen anything in the sky behave in this manner before. At first we thought it could be a balloon but if so it would have had to be some miles up and very large.<n>

Tumbles head over head at high altitiude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went over to my friend&#39;s house with my daughter and saw that he was scanning the skies with a pair of binoculars. I joked around about him seeing things &#34;up there&#34;, to which he calmly replied, &#34;yeah there is one up there right now&#34;. I took the binoculars and aimed it in the direction he pointed. At first I saw nothing but a high altitude plane, at about 35,000 ft. but then to my surprise I saw something else too. Beyond the plane, higher up, maybe at 60,000 ft. I saw something strange. I put down the lens and looked again with the naked eye, nothing. Again, I looked through the binocs and once again saw the &#34;thing&#34; in the bright day sky. It looked like a gold cylinder with reddish top and bottom. My brain could not quite place the object, I was searching for a connection to something else I may have seen before but could not quite understand what it was that I was looking at.The only connection I could fathom was that I looked kind of like a plane rising up into the sky at first, then, it also had characteristics of a kite, but it was tumbling, head over head, in one place. I was confused and amazed, I really could not place this thing...I could not understand in my mind what this was....strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then told of how he had been seeing these things all week and followed them with the binocs as they moved, often randomly, his girlfriend also witnessed them from time to time yet she never spoke of it and even joked around about her &#34;crazy&#34; boyfriend always looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying there where little green men in these objects but to this day I can not explain or identify this object with any one thing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a skeptic person by my nature, an atheist.

The object looked similar to the body of a 747 without the tail or wings. However, it was the size of the object that caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living near the Burbank Airport, I see many planes from varying distances. For the distance this object seemed to be, it was much larger than a 747, about 80% longer and 40% wider, again with no wings or tail. The object was very shiny &amp; metallic in comparison to typical aircraft. It appeared to be cylindrical due to the shadow and shading that implied a curvature of a cigar-shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it fly horizontally into light clouds. At this time, I had slowed down to watch the object pass and waited for it to exit through the clouds, which were sparse. I did not see it emerge. Given the time I saw it traveling, the object would have appeared relatively quickly from the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving northbound and the object was ahead of me at about 1 o&#39;clock, I had time to check the cloud as I approached and passed it. From the angles that I had, I never saw it again.<n>

I had stepped out on back deck which faces the west, in my back yard are 50 foot pine trees in a line. I noticed what appeared to be a bright light , like landing lights on a plane. I watched the light get closer but was shielded by trees as object was very low.  My mistake after all these years, i assumed this to be a plane ! Object moving , my guess 30 mph, as it cleared the trees , the object was not over 100 feet in the air. To my shock, it flew right over me silently! and disappeared to the east over the tree in my side yard. The object was triangle ,had 3 huge lights (approx 4 to 5 feet across)on each tip and a small light in middle blinking. The lights actually lite up the ground and i had to shield my eyes to get a good look at it.The lights were bright enough for me to see the shape ., triangle smooth rounded edges and corners, approx. 35 to 40 feet in length. The lights were unusual, they werent a focused light like a flashlight , more diffused almost like frosted glass, in the light it appeared like filaments with light pulsing all over it, if you will sparkly. Ive never seen anything like it , it could be military , i dont have a clue. I didnt report this for awhile on purpose hoping if military they might use this flight path again. To date have not see again ., will keep observing.I would take a lie detector test to what i saw and to all the hoaxers out there , you non believers are in for a surprise and the truth is coming i just hope its a good thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I WAS OUTSIDE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE ON HT EPHONE WITH MY FIANCE I HAD BEEN TALKING TO HER FOR ABOUT HALF AND HOUR, AND AT THE MOMENT I SEEM TO REMEMBER BEING THE ONLY ONE OUTSIDE ON MY BLOCK . COINSIDENTALLY I LOOKED UP AT ONE POINT WHILE ON THE PHONE AND NOTICE SOMETHING VERY BRIGHT APPEAR ABOUT 2 TO 3 THOUSAND FEET AWAY AND ABOUT AT 1 THOUSANT FEET IN ELEVATION. IN THIS REGION I SEE ALLOT OF LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT ITS PRETTY REGULER. BUT WHAT SEEMED TO CATCH MY ATTENTION WASN’T SO MUCH THE OBJECT BUT THE BEHAVIOR IN WHICH IT MOVED IT. VERY VERY HIGH SPEED AND ALMOST RANDOM POINTS OF EVEN QUICKER ACCELERATION, IN A VERY LINIAR MATTER. I ALSO NOTICED THERE WAS NO SOUND WHATS SO EVER NOTHING NO ENGINE SOUND, OR SONIC BOOM, OR NOTHING COMPLETE SILENCE! IT WASN’T COMPLETELY DARK AT THE MOMENT SO WHAT I SAW WAS CLEAR,( IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT WHITE AND YELLOW LIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A SHERE, AND AROUND IT A CIRCULER GLOW OF LIGHT ALSO WHITE AND YELLOW BUT MORE TRANSPARENT. ALSO IT SEEMED AT MOMENTS TO EITHER SPEED UP SO MUCH THAT I COULDN’T SEE IT, OR DISSAPEAR AND APPEAR ABOUT TEN FEET FORM WHERE IT JUST WAS. LIKE A SKIPPING ROCK ON TOP OF WATER EXCEPT THE ROCK DISSAPEARS EVERYTIME IT TOUCHES WATER. THEN I LOST VISUAL FOR A BOUT A SECOND DO TO A NEIGHBORS HOUSE, AND THEN COUGHT A DIM RAY OF LIGHT SHOOT UP STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY BUT THIS TIME I SAW NO SHAPE ONLY A DIM RAY OF LIGHT BUT ABOUT 4 THOUSAN FEET LONG AND DISSAPEARED. I HAVE TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND DON’T BELIVE IN NOTHING UNLESS I CAN FEEL IT OR SEE IT!IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THIS TOOK A LIFE TIME BUT DURING  ALL THE ABOVE I ONLY HAD TIME TO SAY “BABY” TO MY GIRLFRIEND OUT OF SHOCK OVER THE PHONE. THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL THIS WAS AN AIRPLAIN OR A BIRD, OR A REMOTE CONTROLLED AIRPLAIN IT WAS SIMPLY WAY TO FAST TO BE ANY OF THE ABOVE.

My first thought was that the object was a airliner, however the speed of the object seemed slower than usual and there was no visible vapor trail, even though there were a few light clouds in the upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object. The binoculars are 10x50 and through them the object appeared to a little over 1/4 of an inch in size. The object was reflecting light from the setting sun, which highlighted certain details. It was cigar shaped and displayed no wings, tail or visible lights. The object appeared to be metallic and was bright white in color along most of its surface with a hint of red towards the rear. There seemed to be three large circular impressions that ran along the length of object. There was no discernible propulsion that could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it though the binoculars for about two and half minutes before it flew out of my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day, very few clouds, and the sun was not in our line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was headed due north and we saw an object coming from the northwest or about 10:00 going upward from the tree line …We thought at first it might be a jet or weather balloon but it had an upside down white V shape coming from underneath and the shape did not vary or leave a “print” in the sky like a jet and a balloon is usually like an upside down teardrop and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, it came directly over us, moving steadily and seeming lower than it first appeared to be and moving toward the southeast or 5:00 direction. When it was over us we both thought it looked like an upside down lady bug in both it’s shape and as it was red with a black area like a dot on it and the “V” was still very clearly visible and exactly the same.  The bottom of the “V” never varied in its length. The V was thicker or wider, right under the object and seemed to come to a point on each “leg” of the “V”.   We had the windows down and I turned the car off but we didn’t hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trees in the yard started to block our view as it moved through the sky somewhat behind us so I started the car, did a quick 3 point turn in the driveway and moved to the end of our little road, about 200 yards.  The object was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually don’t think much about this sort of thing as we live close to the balloon base but I checked the calendar that night and there were no scheduled launched.  I was very peculiar to us in that it was red and the white “V” was so stable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband was sitting to the side a little behind a tree and only seen half of the incident. Myself on the other hand seen the whole episode front and center. We live in the country and the skies are wide open and you have a very good view of the complete sky. I seen this object move across the sky, it was only about 100 feet in the air, it was very low, it was extremely fast also, but my view was very good for the length of this object.  It moved across the sky from one side of the trees to the other where I lost sight. We figured if it did not land or crash then it probably only would have taken this object to reach daytona in just a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Oval or egg shaped lighted object, a solid object, not translucent. No light tail or anything following it or chasing it. No blinking lights like on airplanes. There was an ever so slight haze but not much. And moved at such a fast speed yet so close to the ground, still long enough in the sky to get a good look to see, there is no way this was a shooting star nor any airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t anything scary that would spook anyone looking up at the night sky, but it was definatly not normal.  As I was studying for my ccna exam early this morning (my test was today btw.. and I failed in case you want to know...)I decided to take a break and smoke a cigarette outside.  I work nights so I do this all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I go outside, I usually love to look up at the night sky.  Especially during this time of the year when the nights are cool and the skys are clear.  It allows for very clear viewing of the night sky and all it&#39;s glory.  Sometimes I can make out clusters of millions of stars if the night is clear enough.  Needless to say I enjoy looking up at the wonders of the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While smoking a cigarette last night, I observed an object shoot across the sky from left to right.  I was facing North as it moved across the sky. I&#39;ve witnessed shooting stars as they attempt to enter the atmosphere and burn up.  I&#39;ve also witnessed comets and what they look like before (not in person, but I&#39;ve watched enough National Geographic to know what it should look like).  The thing that got me eerie about this experience was the way this light traveled across the sky.  If it was a piece of rock burning up in our atmosphere, it would have traveled much faster across the sky and been in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light that I saw was VERY VERY distant.  In fact, if it were standing still, I would have said it was probably a star or a planet.  As it was traveling across the night sky last night, it did something that from everything I know about physics, should be impossible.  This light traveled across and made a sharp and immediate change in course perpendicular to the initial line that it was traveling when I first spotted it.  Then it made another perpendicular turn to keep going in the direction it was headed when I first spotted it.  What scared me the most was the way it shifted the direction of travel.  I&#39;m pretty sure this light that I saw was not anything in our atmosphere, and because of the faintness of the light, I think this was out in space. I have drawn a quick diagram using just hyphens and pipes to show the trajectory of the object.  Again.. what scared me the most was how this light went from going in one direction to a perpendicular direction IMMEDIATELY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did NOT leave a trail This object did not have any aura around it The object did not emit any other colored lights, didn&#39;t change color In fact, like I said earlier.. had it been still, I probably would have thought it was just another star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ------<n> <n> <n> <n>--------<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Coll, clear, with a pale blue sky tinged by a golden sunset. I was coming from a local department store and as I walked up an inclined parking lot to my car,I looked up and there it was!  To my surpyise was a large long object.dark gold in color and above the store,or really above the bypass behind it.It was still,heavy,and ominous.  I watched in disbelief and asked a women getting into her mini-van if she saw it too?  Her answer after observation was affirmative,and she watched it rather disturbadly and drove away.It moved very slowly and without a sound.it was in the Southern Sky,and went southeast.  As it crossed the horizen I could make out that it was a Triangle.It&#39;s surface glistened dimly in the light.  I could see no propulsion systems,windows,or lights.Of couse it was silent.This sighting has haunted me daily for four years.In subsiquent research the Triangle was exactly like the ones I have researched on You Tube,and particularly like! the Belgian Flap of 1997!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We have watched it for over a week now.  Each night it is further away and always starts out really high in the sky and then around 4:20 or so will drop right around the tree line and appears to hover for about over an hour like it is doing a survey. Like I said, each night is further and further away so by now we can only watch with binoculars but we are still fascinated. My mother is now here to visit and she has now seen it also. I have never seen something so interesting in my life. When it gets closer to daylight it almost just disappears intop thin air. It goes from just hovering to disappearing. I am now a believer.<n>

It was such a clear night sky, no clouds at all, we were just laying out in the driveway looking up. All of a sudden we see 2 lights, the brightness compared to lights on a plane, that were moving across the sky, but we heard no noise and could not make out a shape. These lights were traveling in sync with each other and I could not figure out what it was. The lights didn&#39;t flash so I don&#39;t think it was a plane, and it was completely silent, but seemed much closer than any planes should be flying. It went across the sky faster than any &#39;normal&#39; plane would have. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like it. We both jumped up off the driveway and ran down the street a little to follow the lights but it went behind a tree and then just seemed to disappear. I am a 21 year old nursing student and I will be going into the United States Army as a health care specialist.  The other observer, my girlfriend, is a 17 year old high school student.  We told one of our friends that came by later that night and they thought we were joking. I have no idea what this was, but it made me think enough to write a report and hope that maybe someone else saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

What I saw was 2 lights that had the appearance of satellites in the sky, in a second or two after seeing them we noticed the third light appear forming a large triangle. These lights were moving in unison with each other and were moving slowly to the southeast, I ran inside and woke up my girlfriend and had her come out to see them as well. When we came out the object was still in the sky, but started moving more in a southern direction. Within a minute or two the object did another series of slow turns, first east and then again in a southbound trajectory, flying away from us. Then the lights went out, first the front, then rear left, and finally rear right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself could not have been made out without the lights. It made no sound. It seemed to be flying very high, and the lights appeared as satellites do in the night sky. One could have even mistaken them for stars at a glance. The three light seemed to be fixed in that pattern the single light forward and the others in back relative to the direction it was traveling. There was only deviation in the pattern when the object changed direction, giving the appearance of &#34;banking&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the front and back lights was around 4 inches at arms length, and the rear lights were spaced approximately 2 inches at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a flight path where C-130&#39;s do their final approach for landing.

It was 4 small white lights on the corner of a rectangle object. There was the sound (similar to that of a kettle about to boil0, fast moving air. The speed was slow like a car driving past but constant. The object travelled across my line of sight and just faded into the distance as it move too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was like a mist or heat shimmer yet I could determine it was there as the clouds and stars behind it disappeared as it travelled past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m glad I saw this as it has answered questions for me, yes there is either life out there or we humans have technology we keep from the public eye, either way it means the future is exciting.<n>

I saw it going straight in a path then occassionally it would move in a side by side motion.  It then continued forward.

Weather: Broken clouds, unlimited visibilty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I noticed was first thought by my to be a bird but I noticed that there was no &#34;flapping&#34; motion of wings.  There was also no &#34;wings&#34; as if it were an airplane.  I frequently see F-16&#39;s flying out of Selfridge and this object had the same type of speed; only no wings and no noise.  I obesrved the object until it moved out of view from my living room window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance to object: 2-3 miles and altitude again to be estimated to be between 3,000-10,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later after I lost sight of obect, another object flying the same route and altitude was witnessed again.  Either the same object or an identical 2nd object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the sighting is very close to Selfridge ANG.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a physicist, engineer, and have flight experience.  This object(s) was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter, kite, or bird.<n>

My husband was outside on our front porch when he saw them.  He came in and got me to come out and look.  There were white lights that would just appear and look like stars off in the distance in the sky.  They would sit still for a second and then zig zag around and disappear.  Sometimes it was one at a time and sometimes there were 2 at a time.  Once it started out as one light and when it took off, it separated in to 2 separate lights.  They don’t leave any kind of trail behind them.  They don’t make straight lines either.  They either zig zig or circle around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has seen them once before, but I don’t remember the date or time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared about 5000 feet high.  I could see a a fulsilage.

They were running a little late so I set down on a bench, approximately five minutes after I sat down, for some reason I turned my head facing east and at that moment i saw the round craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was to run and hide in the garage, and that is what I did. After that I called my sister and told her where are you, there is something trying to land on the other side of the street. My mom was also in the car with my other two sisters as well, and she was the one who picked up the phone,she replayed what are you talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I replayed something is landing, and hanged up. I was looking at it and it was trying to land a yellow bluish light came from the center of it but there was no sound, and they aborted the landing. At that time I tried to run about a block to the gas station,I must have run about 10 feet and there it was again trying to land. So I ran back to the garage again and called my sister again and asked them where are you guys, they replayed we are six blocks a way and we see a light it must be a helicopter or a airplane, and they said it&#39;s moving away. After that they came and picked me up. As soon as we got of the driveway and on the street all of the sudden the round craft was hovering over the building where I work and half of the four lane street, and it was pulsating red and blue lights and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we drove away as fast as we could from there, and after a few seconds it vanished out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will ask at work tomorrow if they have recorded anything on the surveillance cameras at the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/6/08 22:00|Baton Rouge|LA|Triangle|1 min|A V shaped object with 5-6 "lights" running on either side and a solid mass in the middle flying over Baton Rouge on September 6, 2008.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65605.html|323|ndxe200809| A V shaped object with 5-6 &#34;lights&#34; running on either side and a solid mass in the middle flying over Baton Rouge on September 6, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staying with my friend’s house in Baton Rouge, because they were lucky enough to have their electricity restored after hurricane Gustav. I was standing out front of my friends house, for a smoke break, around 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. (I am not sure of the exact time). It was a very quiet night due to the fact that after hurricane Gustav most of the city doesn’t have power and also we had a curfew that no one should be driving or out cruising starting at 8:00 p.m. The only sound you could hear were the sounds of generators in use. So, the sky was clear, stars visible, but dark, that eerie dark without the glow of street lights and house lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up when I noticed out in the distance what looked like a flock of white birds, in a V formation heading my direction. It caught my attention for how white the birds were. But as they were flying overhead to where I got a better look, I realized they were not birds but rather something I don’t know how to explain. It was a V formation but it was, not necessarily lights spread apart but more like a reflective surface? If it were lights they would just have to be very dim I suppose. Not anything so bright that would have made it stand out in the dark sky. It was probably 1000 ft up, but honestly I could not gauge the distance because I was still trying to figure out what it was I was looking at. Also, noticed that it was a solid mass between the &#34;lights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at a good pace and made absolutely no sound. After it flew over me and crossed over the neighbor’s house it was gone.  I don’t know what I saw but I know it wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not wish to speak to anyone or have my name or information published. I am curious to know if there were any stealth bombers flying over but wish to remain anonymous. I am not crazy and not on drugs, just wanted to pass this information on in case it is useful or important to your research. And am hoping I am not the only person to have seen something strange over the skies of Baton Rouge that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am providing my email address if you need confirmation of my account.  Thank you.<n>

I immediately called my husband and son so they can take a look at it.  We looked thru our binoculars and can clearly see 4 lights 2 blue and 2 white, but sometimes one of the white lights would merge into one of the other lights making it 3 lights.  The lights changed around sometimes forming a triangle, a square, a diamond and other times three lights would line up and the fourth would stand across the them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights hovered for several hours moving up and down and to the sides.  I believe it was 4 crafts because of the way the lights moved around but we could see a dark shadow between the lights that implied it may have been one ship and it’s lights were moving around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually the neighbors started noticing the lights and at one point there were about 11 of us outside witnessing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually the lights moved out of our line of sight and unfortunately we were unable to continue seeing them.<n>

Sunset was at 7:11 and I was situated at Latitude: 35°32&#39;4.77&#34;N and Longitude: 117°32&#39;43.80&#34;W. I got my camera gear out and got it all set up so that I could be ready for anything. I sat down in my easy chair until it was time for the stars to start showing themselves to the world. One by one they appeared. If you are not fast while you are watching for the stars, they will sneak up on you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the First Quarter Moon that was to the south of my vantage point, there was a bright star/planet that showed up to the east of the moon, and just a little higher in the night sky compared to the moon. It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon!  It too was bright. I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone. I know it was not a plane as it just sat there in one place when I first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the evening progressed, I noticed two objects passing on by. One of them looked like it was headed towards LA and about a half hour later I saw one that was headed north away from LA. Ordinarily I would suspect that they were planes, but there were no strobes on these two objects that looked like stars passing in the night sky. Even though there was no strobe to them, I just noted them as planes. Same speed, no deviation whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 8:30pm when I looked to the north and off the big dipper to the right, I noticed this light. This light started to get very bright and all of a sudden, I had surmised that this thing was coming right at me. It just kept on getting bigger and bigger. I turned around and grabbed my camcorder and stand as a complete unit, and when I turned back around, I had to say to myself, what is the use. It, by the time I turned around started to get smaller again. So I just stood there watching it as it eventually disappeared.  This object did not go up, go down, go from side to side or anything. It was as if there was a very high candle power light that was being turned up and then back off. This lasted for about 15 seconds. I have no idea what it was, but I can finally say: I have seen something in the nights sky that makes no sense to me. Twice… In one night… A disappearing planet and a light that made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wish I had someone with me to see what I saw<n>

The lights have the ability to emulate small aircraft navigation/strobe lights (green/white and red).  When they are no longer visable from cockpit crews the lights return to their normal blury red/white strobe pattern.  I have never observed these lights mess with any commercial or conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The commercial flight is climbing out of Aprox. 17,500 AGL 90 degree heading East over Lake Mead and Est. airspeed at 275-325 knots.

The four lights have returned to red/white light pattern as the commercial flight passed overhead.  The Pilot/First officer probably requested a verification from Nellis AFB if they were painting any other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the communication, the four lights went from their position and elevation to the commercial flights elevation/airspeed/position in Aprox. 3-5 seconds and climbed out with them.

I checked the Vandenberg AFB website but it stated that there would be a launch On Saturday (the next day) close to Noon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving in tandem but weren&#39;t so close together. There was a high altitude Jet passing at the same time, much higher then the objects I saw were. I don&#39;t believe nor am I suggesting that it was connected. Just wanted to mention it in regards to the altitude. It lasted a few minutes. One of the lights disappeared, then the other a few seconds later. It seemed to be moving upward and westward. They were red or orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Security Guard, don&#39;t drink, do drugs. I work at that site from 6pm til 2am, Friday through Sunday. I pay attention to detail because it is part of my job as a Guard. I wasn&#39;t going to report this but I haven&#39;t found anything to  suggest that it was the launch of a rocket(s) from what I gather.<n>

I seen what seemed to be a flying triangle almost similiar to how ducks fly in a V-shape formation. With my eyes trained upon the object it looked as if there were more than one air craft more like six or seven bluish green glowing objects flying very high and fast. The V-shape seemed to fluctuate as if some of the aircrafts had flown a little to close to one side made the V-shape look a little distorted. Afterwards there were several slow flying objects in the sky. What seemed to be regular airplanes with those flashing red and blue lights that you see at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen many planes and satellites moving across the sky but this is the first time i have ever seen this encounter just curious if there was any more sighitngs . I live in sydney nova scotia and it was a really clear night last night<n>

The shape appeared to be curved like on the side of a circle. I continued east than merged onto the 202 freeway just west of Ellsworth lights were not in view obscured by a freeway wall. When I merged onto the 60 highway west the lights became visible again. At this point I could tell the lights were not connected to one object because the shape changed into a wide “V”. At this time I heard and saw two helicopters approaching. The lights were directly in front of me, one helicopter was headed from the south and stayed south of the lights. Another helicopter stayed north of the lights, so the lights were almost in the middle of two helicopters. I arrived at my destination on Power rd just north of the 60 and exited my car at this point only three bright lights remained and were not in any formation. I entered the store and upon exiting no lights were visible. I called my local news station who informed no other reports had been made at that time. Thanks<n>

It was still daylight, and this object was a bright, bright, white color.  It was slightly northwest of the car I was traveling in as a passenger.  I’m guessing it was about 8-10 miles north of me and 3 or 4 miles up in the air.  The object didn’t move at all in any direction.  The light never strengthened or weakened, until it vanished out of nowhere.  It was a sunny day but it sure didn’t look like a reflection of any sort.  It appeared to be a rectangular object that looked rounded because of the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was whitish in color but not bright. I seen it first and said to my brother in law look,look,look,( thinking it was a shooting star of sorts) he said he sees it and we followed it until it vanished. ( About 6 secs)  I never saw anything like this before.  It kind of looked like a wavy sheet without the corners, more oval in shape.  It was not a bird, plane, light beam or shooting star, and it was traveling fast and silent.  It was a clear night with a couple of noticeable clouds.  I also witnessed ( but did not report) the April 22nd. 2007 event that someone reported over Lewisville, TX  ( a triangular object that had 3 whitish lights moving at a very fast rate of speed and silent, no flashers and definitely not a plane )<n>

The lights were in a elongated trianglar formation with one leading the group. They came out of the northwest and traveled southeast. Initial rate of speed was unknown but they slowed when passing overhead. Second witness was called outside to observe. The two points of light at the rear of the formation slowly faded out. The remaining light accelerated out of sight in a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was also a high beam light on the front, and I could see it&#39;s beam across the sky for some distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a plane landing at the local airport, but I have seen a lot of such planes over the past 40 plus years, and this craft looked very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that it looked more like a stealth bomber. I watched it as I was riding my bike, and since it was going in the opposite direction as me I made a quick little U-turn (maybe 2-3 seconds). When I looked back up it was gone. The sky was very clear, and I could see the stars in the sky, but the craft was gone that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local PD to see if anyone had reported see anything like I saw, they said no. I tried to call the control tower at our local airport, but they close at 9:00 pm, so no aircraft would have been landing there at the time anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the sighting of some fuzzy object, or distant light. This was an aircraft that I could clearly see the outline of by the many blinking lights along its sides (6-8), and back (3-4), and hear the hum of it’s engines.<n>

I could see no stars visible in the sky.  I wondered if it was an aircraft, as it appeared to be moving, somewhat like a helicopter.  The color of the light was very bright, like a star.  However, the movements were quite abrupt, quick, backward, forward, up and down.  Then, its shape changed and it appeared to be elongated.  It seemed to turn like this several times and continued to move.  Bright lights seemed to occasionally shoot from it, very rapidly, and the lights were colorful, reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about half an hour.  After I had watched it for awhile, I thought I should check the time and it was about 5:40 am.  I’m not sure of the time I initially witnessed it.  It gradually moved up, down, back and forth, but was progressing in a southward direction until it became blocked by a tree.  I am not sure how long I watched it, probably about 45 minutes or a bit longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought I’d like to know if anyone else saw it and would like to compare notes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.

This path is where LOTS of commercial jets fly, with the distinctive FLASHING lights that look like a strobe at times. ( i am retired Navy aircraft electrician worked on F-14A tomcats at home and sea!) This time tho, i see two ORANGE ( DULL at that) lights together just stationary on the horizon. I stop the tuck, turn lights off and observe from inside the vehicle at first, carefully noting postion from it the light pole on the left,( pole is physically to my right tho)  and the treeline on right. At first it still appeared stationary. Then it veered slightly NE and came on approach!! I get out of the truck to observe. It comes w/i 1/2 mile to my right, at an altiude of @ 12--1500 feet! I can see what looks like a old 60`s antennae shape to the craft, glowing soft orange. All i heard was a soft whirring as it went by! Now i watch aircraft go by at night, and do alot of sky watching, the commercial and military jets are quite easy to spot w/lighting arrangement. Brothers and sisters this wasn`t one of them!!<n>

My mom said she watched it for at least a half an hour before she fell asleep. My father said he watched it for about 15 minutes before he went and got my mother. I don’t know how much longer he was outside after my mom fell asleep. (She could see it from the window in their travel trailer.) The object, as I mentioned, was round. It changed colors from red, white, blue and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom said it moved up and down and a little from side to side. Sometimes it moved slowly, sometimes quickly. They think it COULD be something military as earlier in the day they had two military cargo planes fly LOW overhead going in that general direction. My mom said the planes were low enough that she could easily see the pilots in both planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She did say that she saw other air traffic in the region, which is normal as their land is within the flight path for final approach into ABQ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all of the information I have.

It took about 8 minutes before it disappeared. There was a few times where some white lights fell off of the red one and almost instantly disappeared. There was also a time where a piece fell off and then it turned orange and split into pieces again, then it had disappeared.  At one point you can actually see an airplane fly in the same frame as the red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked similar to the red lights on radio towers, it was that bright, but it was not blinking and it seemed to be stationary, or moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, trying to decide if it was moving by gauging its position in relation to some telephone lines, it suddenly turned very white, then a smaller red light dropped down from it. As the smaller red light dropped away, the white light disappeared, but for a few seconds both the white light above and the red light dropping away were visible. Then the white light went out and we could see nothing of it. The red light then moved away and we watched it until it passed from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the light was high in the southeastern sky, then the red light that moved away was moving east. The whole event lasted maybe three minutes from the time we noticed the bright redlight until the smaller red one passed from view.<n>

There is an oak tree in the front yard ninety feet away from the house that stands approximately one hundred feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up into the southern sky, a vehicle, craft or vessel began to materialize approximately twenty feet above the oak tree.  I could not believe what I was seeing, but I immediately knew that I was looking at something that was not of earth origin.  This vessel was similar in shape and size to a B2 Stealth Bomber and appeared to be uncloaking or materializing into the earth’s atmosphere from another place or time.  As the vessel was becoming visible, the image of the craft was very wavy and distorted, like heat waves from the highway on a hot summer day.  For those of you that have watched Star Trek, when the Klingon War Ship begins to uncloak, that is exactly how this thing looked when it began to appear above the tree.   It took approximately ten seconds, from the time of entry, for the vehicle to become a solid object, at which time it began to move slowly just above the tree line, in a southwesterly direction towards a ridge in the distance.  The vehicle appeared to be matt black with no external engines, maneuvering at approximately ten miles per hour, in total silence.  From the rear of the craft, a round soft white glow was visible from each wing, which appeared to be the propulsion system.  The glow was a soft white, similar to that of a florescent bulb in a kitchen or bathroom, but had the appearance of some form of energy or plasma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the vessel moved slowly through the night sky, I could see a strobing red light on the left wing and a green one on the right.  The pulse width of the strobing was much slower than that of a jet or airplane and the colors were somewhat different from the reds and greens that we are familiar with.  At a glance or from a distance, the vehicle would appear to be just another aircraft in the night sky, but seeing it up close and personal is a totally different experience.  I observed the object until it went behind the ridge to the south and was no longer visible.  I immediately went outside with binoculars in hand, to the lower part of my driveway just below the oak tree, hoping to see the vessel again.  I knew that I had just witnessed something very special, that to me was a great privilege and most likely, a once in a lifetime thing.  I stayed outside scanning the ridge hoping to see the object once more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting for about five minutes, sure enough, it reappeared, but at a much greater distance over the southeastern part of the ridge.  I knew it was the same vehicle from the soft glowing fields of energy being emitted from the wings of the craft.  The vehicle began to accelerate toward the east at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight in less than a second.  Due to this sighting, I have been looking up for five years now, hoping to catch a glimpse of another extraterrestrial ship traveling through our night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired now, in my sixties, with a background in automotive electrical and emission controls. I do not drink alcohol or use drugs.  My mind is good and I do not have a wild or vivid imagination.  I do however have an open mind and am not naive enough to believe that we on earth are the only form of intelligent life in the entire universe.  I have no idea as to the technology that would allow a ship or vessel to materialize into the earth’s atmosphere in such a way, but I promise you, every word of this report is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of you may ask why I waited five years to post this information.  As most of you well know, the subject of UFOs is a very sensitive area and sometimes ridiculed.  For this reason, I made the decision to keep this information to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sometimes listen to Coast To Coast AM and had just recently heard the proprietor of this website mention that someone had reported a triangle shaped craft over their residence in a town that is ten minutes east of my location.  After hearing this, I decided to post this information.  From my understanding, this event took place in the late evening or night hours of August 30, 2013.  I have been checking the website daily for an update, in hopes of reading that report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank everyone involved in the development and creation of NUFORC, which has given me the opportunity to share this wonderful and truly amazing experience.<n>

Then we tried to turn around to get another look and it took off very slow seeming to take an abnormal path not straight then suddenly there was no more lights and it was gone through this whole thing there was no sound what so ever. We had our windows open and it was a very bright and clear night nothing can explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our house is at the bottom of a steep field, and perhaps 100 yards from our kitchen was what looked like a silver helicopter on the ground at the treeline.  Almost as soon as I had seen it, it lifted straight up from the ground, moved horizontally toward the house for maybe 2 seconds, and then shot vertically into the air.  It was only then that it made a very slight humming noise, but until that point, it was completely silent.  My husband ran from the kitchen to our back porch (about eight feet), but by the time he got outside, the aircraft was completely out of sight.  He did notice that our German Shepherd was looking up in the direction we had seen it move.  I did not see anyone in control of the craft, but it was roughly the same size and appearance as a helicopter.  I don&#39;t see how it was a helicopter, though; for it to have been so close to the house and on the ground, it would have been deafeningly loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My 2 good friends my girlfriend and I were driving over the St. johns river were i notice a weird light cross over the road about 2-3 miles ahead of me i was in the back seat of the truck with my girlfriend who was a sleep and neither one of my friend in the front seat seemed to make any notice of the light so i figured it was just a glare.  we continued west bound on 192 when i noticed the same light again flying towards us on the south side of the road, I pointed it out to my friends and they were just as confused as i was as to what it could be. It got about 30 yards away from us banked left across 192 about 30 feet of the ground and started west bound on the north side of the road at a speed i cannot begin to explain. I knew right away by the speed and the monuvering that this was nothing i have ever seen before. As it took of the three of us were puzzled we continued to watch it in a matter of moments it had gone from three distictive lights to what apered to be a star in the distance. It danced from one side of the road to the other like it was playing hop scotch with the stars it did this for about about a minute the disapeard behind the tree line. we were approaching Holopaw a town with on spot light when the craft returned it was heading toward us on the north side of the street about a mile ahead and slowly settled down out of our view behind some trees when we got to were the craft had settled we looked in the clearing and just of to the side of the road about 20 feet of the ground was this huge faint black craft that seemed to be in a triangular shape hovering of the ground. we rounded the corner losing sight of the vessel not seeing it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granted we were in a truck doing about 70 mph during this whole incounter but I nore eaither of my friend with me heard a noise. I have lived in orlando florida my hole life a mile north of OIA i have seen every plane come and go for 22 years. This was no Plain. I do Realize that Patrick air force base is in that area and the possibility for it to have been a Airforce Helicopter is not possible it was to fast banked to quickly and like i said before there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love to watch the stars and have never belived in UFO&#39;S. My friends and I spend alot of time in the county hunting fishing camping etc this was the first time any of us have ever seen any thing like this I cant say what it was for sure but i can tell you it was not a helicopter  and it was no plane. There for it was a Unidentifed flying object that was the fastest ive ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I believe it was somewhere between Douglas Fruit and Selph Landing.  I live out in the country in West Pasco and was heading home at 11:30 p.m. after visiting a friend&#39;s home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the left of my drivers side window and saw some sort of aircraft.  My mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing into being a plane but it was very low, possibly only 100 feet up in the air and I could see a vague outline of it.  It wasn&#39;t black, more of a gunmetal grey color. There were two very bright white lights in &#34;the front&#34; I&#39;m not sure if it was the front or not.  What I thought was weird was that there was a bright red blinking light in the center of the two white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my window as I drove slowly by and there was no noise. It was very close to the road but was over the cropland. It hovered moving very slowly.  My car was moving much faster. I started to veer off the road from looking at it and then straightened my car and continued on.  It was still there it seemed as I drove away.  I&#39;ve tried to find similar things to what I saw on the internet and haven&#39;t seen any helicopters or planes like this.  I did see a Youtube clip of  triangle shaped lights someone taped in the air at night.  It also had a red blinking light.  But this perspective was from below and I could see more of the side of the &#34;aircraft.&#34;   Another car drove by not long after me and I wondered if he might have seen it too.<n>

I thought it was an air liners landing lights, but then the light started to dim then bright again. This happened about 3 times then the light just went out. it was a sphere shape with orange copper color. I thought maybe an air liner went behind a cloud, but 1. never saw the light or a plane , and 2. it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two friends and I were fishing 45 miles offshore off Ocean City MD in the Atlantic Ocean. It was a Moonless night with no wind and you could see every star in the night sky. Then in the south eastern sky 10 degrees off the horizon twenty miles away 7 bright lights appeared in a straight line. They started with one in the middle, then one to the right came on, then to the left and when all were on they stayed on for 10 seconds then all went off at the same time. This happened 3 or four times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were always in a straight line, they didn’t move and were the color of street lights. I say that they were 2 or 3 miles high and looked to be 200 to 300 yards from outside light to out side light. Every time they came on they were in a different spots, they were in random spots not in a pattern like they were moving. When they went off you could see the stars behind them so I didn’t see a craft, a plane, nothing. In a matter of fact the night air was so calm if it was any thing with an engine you would have heard it being the way sound travels on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing: After the lights stopped for 45 minutes I was picking up a object on my boats Radar that would move around me but never come closer then 3 miles. We ran 12 miles in the dark to get to another fishing spot and the object stayed with us for 8 miles then I turned my head then looked back at the screen and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It faded out after about 5 seconds. We then saw another orange light south of the original sighting which also faded out after about five seconds. After about 10 minutes we saw four lights in a row which faded out and in before finally forming a three light triangle which faded out after approximately 15 seconds. We stayed at the beach for another hour with no further sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The conditions were clear with out a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of lights seen were 3-5 varying bright white lights moving very fast horizontally, faster then any commercial or military jet I have ever seen, northerly in a diagonal formation. The lights suddenly stopped and remained still for 10 – 15 seconds and then moved vertically straight up into the sky, again very fast. They stopped once again and then proceeded to move horizontally to the south only to stop again and move diagonally downward to the north again. This movement repeated again and again and each time lasted about 5-10 minutes. The lights would be bright and fade and get bright again. At the end of the last sequence the lights got very bright, separated, and each went in different directions and were gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second set of lights was 3 bright orange spheres and either all were lit at once or they would alternate illuminating in a sequence. These lights were moving in a horizontal direction toward the south. They would move extremely fast and then stand still illuminating and fading out either gradually or all at once. They continued toward the south appearing and disappearing 3-5 times and then immediately changed direction moving back to the north while still illuminating in the same manner. They reached the point we first saw them and again disappeared only to re-appear again much further south in a matter of less than a minute. This sighting continued for almost an hour and then stopped.<n>

I pointed them out and we watched their speed variations and odd maneuvering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed two of them flare up into orange balls of pulsating light. Then they started going behind some more houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down to the beach to keep an eye on them. Once they were over the ocean, They circled each other and rotated, I saw on at least 4-5 occasions them flare up into orange balls again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not flares, and I have no clue what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its a mostly clear night, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 min after, Saw two more sets of flashing lights but no orange orbs, here is the wildest thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One came down like a shooting star and started blinking, since I&#39;ve seen another &#39;shooting star&#39; but no lights with it. Moving at a rate too wild and fast for an airplane<n>

I am in far NE Mesa, close to the Tonto National forest.  I am fairly high up on the mountain, and these lights were directly south of my view, possibly over Chandler or Gilbert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to get my husband since I wanted his opinion as to what these were.  We were back out on the patio together within less than 30 seconds.  Within about 20 seconds the light to the right faded out, and immediately after, the left faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 minute, these lights both appeared again in the same exact spot.  They were not as bright as they had been when we first spotted them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of the next hour and a half, these lights continually faded in and out.  Sometimes it took 5 to 10 minutes for the appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that when the faded back on again, they had moved slightly - sometimes higher, sometimes lower, and sometimes spaced apart a little bit.   We also noticed a very smaller (third) light that would sometimes move around these other larger more stationary lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought my teenage out the patio to witness this, to see what he thought.  All of us were completely at a loss for what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called two news stations and reported this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to call Luke Airforce Base, but could not find a contact number anywhere on their website.<n>

I remember that it was a very clear night and you could see a lot of the stars in the distance. As I was driving I noticed a very bright light simply flash off to the right of me, in the distance. At first I though it was the light on a cell phone tower, however the bright flash diminished into a small object that began to move. The object looked like a bright star that would appear and disappear several times. I kept watching the object while still driving. Suddenly it disappeared for a few seconds and then reemerged as a bright light that split into three other moving lights. The three objects moved across the sky in different directions and then simply stopped and moved back in the direction they came from. At that point I began to lose track of them because I was driving into a well-lit town, so it was hard to see anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

What we saw was a blinking object.  It was, by our line of site, just above the tree line, and looked much like the heavy air traffic in our area except for the fact that it did not appear to be moving.  At first, we thought it was aircraft, because your perception can be “off” if the aircraft are heading towards you, but our object stayed put, moving slightly to our left only once, before moving back to its original spot.  The direction, from our observation point on our porch, would be in the south west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in and got our binoculars (we don’t have a telescope) and my daughter, and we all continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes.  Thru the binoculars, we saw it flashing red, blue, and clear or golden colored lights.  We all agreed that the object appeared to be round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and when we looked at the sky again, around 10 pm, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, the location we live has heavy air traffic at all hours of the day and night.  Aircraft appeared to be going past our object with no change in flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is 48 years old, with a high school education.  He works as an equipment operator/laborer  I am 42 years old; college educated, and work as an accountant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter is 16 years old and a straight a student.  She is a junior in high school  Both my husband and I have seen objects we could not identify in the night sky before, but never filed reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reside in Central Pennsylvania, along I-80.  We would love a logical explanation of what we saw.  Please feel free to contact me via e mail, which was provided in my contact information.<n>

A green one on the left and red one on the right. Neither were blinking. The object or objects flew without sound (at least none I could hear with my window rolled down over the sound of my rather quiet 4 cylinder Honda Civic engine) on an upward diagonal toward HSBC arena and the lake (lake Erie) to my left. I could not see a defining shape in the black night sky. Pondering if it was a plane or not and if so wondering where any blinking lights were-The craft or crafts made a 90 degree angle and flew directly over my vehicle at a high rate of speed (again I heard no audible sound.) Being on the expressway I had no way to easily turn around to see where the object or objects went and could not safely see them from any of my mirrors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She left the bed and went to the window to get a better view of the object. Its shape was sharply defined since it appeared to be quite large, and was brightly lit with a yellowish white light. I asked her to extend her arm in front of her and move her thumb and forefinger apart to the approximate size of the object as it appeared from her viewpoint. She indicated a distance of about two and a half inches between thumb and forefinger. She further stated that the object was uniformly lighted, did not cast any discernible light on the wooded area below, and did not appear to have windows or other surface features..<n> <n><n> <n><n> She described the object as a modified egg shape. The small end was pointing toward the direction of travel. The bottom side was less angular in comparison to the top, and the rear was more square than round. The object emitted no audible sound and its direction and speed were uniform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially the object appeared over the tree line. It traveled slowly west to east at a downward trajectory of about 20 degrees; almost as if on a landing approach. As its altitude decreased, the tree line began to increasingly interfere with her view until the object was no longer visible. The object was observed for a total of about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a more rural part of Vestal and there is very little man made ambient light. The sky was clear with no moon at the time of viewing, and sunrise was three hours away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, out of curiosity, I called the Vestal police department and inquired if there had been any reports of UFOs, lights in the sky, etc., and the person I was talking to said he was not aware of any such reports. Hmmm…<n>

The red color flickered at the top and towards the left, with the blue doing the exact same but on the lower right side.  I didn&#39;t give it much notice at first, being close to an airport and all, I thought it was just an aircraft.  I started staring at this object in the sky, and it didn&#39;t move. Sometimes, the flickering and the colors weren&#39;t as bright as when I first saw it, but I figured the clouds and it being an overcast night had something to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While standing on the front porch of my home, at approximately 11:45 p.m. I saw a bright light in the sky directly ahead of me. I looked at the bright light for a few seconds, perhaps four or five seconds, then the light began to slowly move to the right in an easterly direction. I then called my husband, who was just inside the door. I thought it was a satellite and wanted him to see it also.  He came out, looked at the bright light moving, and said it might be a satellite. Then suddenly the light changed direction. It moved slowly once again, but this time to the north.  It travelled in this direction for about five seconds. Then, it picked up speed and travelled the entire length of the sky in less than a second, and it disappeared. It moved faster than any human engineered craft could possibly move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was bright white in color, but when it accelerated it turned to a bright orange.<n>

The light then started moving in many different directions at very high rates of speeds and  at times remaining stationary before moving again. It then left from the horizon toward us at a high rate of speed covering half the sky in about ½  a second at which time it vanished directly above us in a blurr. The color went for white to bright orange and then a dark orange then red as it accelerated towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then phoned my parents that live close and asked them to look at the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back out to scanned the sky and spotted  2 bright white lights travelling to and fro changing directions instantaneously, at times they travelled together other times appearing to change positions with each other in a lose formation as they travelled across the sky.They disappeared for about 10 seconds then reappeared this time there was a total of 4 the color of the 4 was light orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four then flew away into the horizon, as they travelled together they appeared to change the shape of the formation every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside the house and received a phone call, my parents said that what they thought was a stationary white star all of a sudden flew away changing colours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The activity stopped after the white star left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wish it were more exciting. I was stargazing a clear sky from my apartment window. After about 10 minutes, I noticed a light approximately north-west. It could have been a mile away, it could have been 10 miles away, but I saw it for a few seconds moving straight up into the sky. It was about 10 degrees above the horizon when I first spotted it. A yellow-white moving light, about the size of a star or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though it blinked out after only a few seconds, after about 20 seconds it had risen by one or two degrees and appeared again for one or two seconds. Each time the object reappeared it had climbed about a degree. It had the luminosity of a bright star. Not as bright as Sirius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been in the proximity of Ottawa. I&#39;m just happy to have seen something I couldn&#39;t explain. After it last disappeared, I watched the sky for a few minutes and saw a regular satellite proceeding from north to south at the speed of a standard slow-walker until it disappeared beyond the trees. Not a plane, not a satellite, not a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was inside sitting on the sofa talking to a family member.  My attention was drawn to the window and the &#34;star.&#34;  I asked my cousin to look at the &#34;star&#34; because it seemed to be changing colors.  We both agreed that it was changing color from white to red and then to blue.  We then grabbed two other family members and a couple pairs of binoculars and went out onto the front porch.  Through the binoculars we could see the light changing colors in an almost fibre optic style.  The light hovered slightly above the tree line for about 35 minutes. At times it seemed to fade and then become stronger.  After about 35 minutes it began to dip down into the tree line.  After that, it just disappeared. Very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
9/1/08 22:10|Gardena|CA|Chevron|10 mins|Cheveron shaped object seen above the skies of SouthBay area near LAX.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65516.html|379|ndxe200809| Cheveron shaped object seen above the skies of SouthBay area near LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up in the evening sky, when I saw a faint looking star moving southwards.  I thought it could be a satellite, as I was watching this move, a flash came from the southeastern direction.  It was a quick white flash as if someone was trying to say &#34;hey I&#39;m over here&#34;.  My sister happen to be looking up at the time as well, and said &#34;was that a falling star or what&#34;.  I said &#34;no&#34;, I was watching that other star looking object, which was just north west of this flash, when this flash turned on and slowly turned off.  It wasn&#39;t like a falling star at all,it was if someone turned on a bright white light, then slowly it turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 mins later I happen to look up, and as I did, I noticed object fly just above me heading north, it appeared to have a whispy orange glow which seemed to have two bright lights at the front of it, almost shaped like a triangle with rounded edges. I mentioned it to my sister who was sitting next to me.  I thought did I just imagine it, or was I just really tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious to know what this might have been, so I grabbed my binoculars Nikon 10x50, I aimed towards the area where I saw the flash originally, as I was searching the skies, this object flew within my view, it was huge.  It seemed to have two sets of lights in a row in what seemed to appear as a &#34;v&#34; shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> xx     xx xx   xx xx xx xx<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure exactly how many lights were at on the object itself, however, I do know for sure it had two sets of lights in each row which outlined this object.  I watched it as it flew almost gliding throught the sky heading northest.  I was telling my sister to look up where I was pointing, I did not want to loose sight of this object within the binoculars view, she said she saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming this object must have been up pretty high for my sister not to see it, however, when I saw it looking through the binoculars it appeared to be large.  I would say it was twice the size of a jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe this object is by comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Example:  Looking up approx. 1000ft at a 747 jetliner, through my 10x50 binoculars, the plane would appear to be the size of a nickle, and the bottom of the airliner would be difficult to see clearly as it is dark, and generally there are no lights at the bottom of the craft, perhaps a blue and red light at the wings and a white/yellowish light at the front of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now looking a this &#34;v&#34; shaped object it seemed like the lights were a whitish color, yet not blinding, and the object looked to be the size of a 50cent piece, quite large.  I couldn&#39;t tell you what altitude this object was at, as it could not been seen with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: During this 15 minutes duration, my sister and I noticed the dogs next door were barking like crazy.  We thought &#34;those dogs are sure non-stop tonight&#34;. It was getting annoying listening to those dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While viewing this object through my binoculars, my sister made a comment about the dogs, she said &#34;did you notice the dogs stopped barking&#34;.  I listened and realized yeah, they did stop.  I am assuming that this could be because this object decided to fly away (heading south east).  Perhaps, it was lingering around the area above the skies unnoticable, then decided to leave.  I must say, the dogs were quiet after this thing departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this object in the skies: September 1, 2008  approx: 9:51 - 10:15pm ish, Near Torrance, Gardena &amp; Lawndale area of Los Angeles, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

9/1/08 20:47|Wilmington|IL|Unknown|35 minutes|Object flying with blinking red light, flying erratic, hovering, then doin it again 3 X.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65508.html|380|ndxe200809| Object flying with blinking red light, flying erratic, hovering, then doing it again 3 X.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is Labor Day Evening, Sept 1, 2008 at 8:47-9 02 PM Central Time.  Looking up at a clear sky I notice what I initially thought was a Blinking STAR.  After a couple of seconds, it started moving.  I immediately assume it was a jet.  It had white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  It was at a height that you would normally see a passenger plane that was so high, all you could see was the lights at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about ready to dismiss it as a plane, when it seemed to change direction. Initially it was heading in a somewhat Western direction, then it sort of headed left, but not really a left turn, simply sort of veered left. The best example I can think of is like when you were a kid playing with one of those old &#34; Etch a sketch&#34; toys. Until you got good at it, it was difficult to make turns or curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continues to go in different directions, left, right, then it seemed to stop for 5 seconds or so.  I knocked on the front window for my wife to come see.  She also noticed it.  She seemed to think that the red light was going in a circular direction, possibly clockwise.   We watched it until it was headed due south and disappeared over the neighbor’s tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not know who to call, so I hit Google and found your contact info.  Just prior to typing this report, I went back outside and sure enough, there it was again, in the exact same place as when I first noticed it as a blinking star.  It was moving back west again, but this time directly west, and seemed a bit quicker.  Again my wife seen it this 2nd time too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although, I absolutely do believe in life other than on earth, I never seen a flying object that was this high, this bright, flying in erratic directions, and seem to hover, then a few minutes seem to be coming back and doing it all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now just past 9:20 PM and it is once again heading in an erratic flight path, but in the SAME position as the 1st 2 time heading west.  Every once in a while, one of the white lights seem to blink bright enough to get your attention.  Then it disappears over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible thoughts was a satellite.  It was way too high for any helicopter or smaller Cessna type plane.  Heading in too many weird directions for a large jet plane.  And unless there was several in a row, why was it retracing its direction at least 3 times.  That was when I seen it.  Who knows how long or many times it completed this exercise?   Please advise<n>

I was 17 when this occurred and will take what me and a friend seen to the grave. we sneeked outside the side of his house in his garage ge lived in to smoke a cigarette when halo 3 first came out and we were playing xbox live all night. well we seen a bright orange yellow light in the sky. I belive its the neighboorhood between ranchwood and mustang road we were in but it was traveling from the old mill towards the highway. not sure the first entrance to his neighboorhood but its by the old little ceasers. so I know we walked a block down as we were perplexed by the strange glow of the craft. now this I know for a fact we were standing on cambridge street under the street lamp as it flew DIRECtLy over our head o my god it was amazeing. it had three 3 rockets on the back of it and was dead silent. it was thick like a brick as we could see it didnt taper off like a planes wings. it looked like something straight out of star wars. it was HUGE I have tryed reporting this before. my gf at the time worked at mcdonalds on main street and she told me cops were there that night talking about something strange in the sky later that night when we talked. but what gets me is I immediatley called the pd with my friend and they called us back saying wiley post reported no aircraft in the area yet... right after we seen the craft after we got off the phone with the pd another fried a block or two away was drinking at a party and got a ride home and called me to tell me he seen a bunch of green orbs go flying in the sky from ground level like foreflies lighting fast all swarming and comeing from some bright oramge red light I assume its what WE saw. now he was with another kid that drowned in a lake and died last year in texas who seen it also and they GOT PULLED over and ASKED if they seen anything strange in the sky. based on this and the other report I see on here that year around that time im convinced ! that there is some sort of far more  complex superior futureis! tic tech nology via be it top secret or alien in origin I have seen it with my own two hands and god whatever he may be blessed me and my friend with it flying so close over our heads im positive as it was traveling over head I could have hit it with my .308 bolt action. it was so queit it sounded like a slow bunson burner or torch on low honestly the wind from the tress and the neighboorhood dogs were louder it defied physics something that big of a mass of triangle going as slow as it did should have stalled and crashed. yet as it flew over the streetlamp the lamp seemed to grow much brighter and the wind died down as it flew off into the distance towards lake overholser. I dont know if anything extreme happend as I dont know the origin but I belive we seen this thing much closer than anyone else did that night amd there 3 of us left to confirm this it was real and theres no denying that. I am just amazed to know that we are atleast not an iscolated group to have seen it that night! and also amazed that atleast 100 people didnt see it because although it was LATE at night and it WAS silent it was a VERY populated area and somethimg like that triangle would be VERY hard to ignore or miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The state park is called Rock Cut State Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I went to sleep in our tents but left the top open with the screen on so we can look at the stars.  Off to my right I saw a so-called star that was a bit brighter than most and kept going in and out of being dim and bright.  I focused on this one single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it started going up and down quickly then right to left quickly. I immediately pointed this out to my husband and asked him it was just me or did that move.  He agreed with me. he said it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he stared at it with me and pointed out that it was going in a triangular movement. Sort of like it was making a invisible triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This seemed to be quite far away. Eventually it got so dim that it was gone. I kept questioning myself thinking that maybe  it was something else but we KNOW NOW that this was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw planes go by late at night and they were planes.  I saw 2 shooting stars and those were shooting stars.
