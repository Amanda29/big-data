10/31/11 23:00|Lakeside|CA|Fireball|8 minutes|Glowing orange orb that pulsated like fire and flew silently overhead.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94973.html|1|ndxe201110| Glowing orange orb that pulsated like fire and flew silently overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike my previously reported sighting in 2002 (which was a COMPLETELY different kind of object), I had a repeat sighting of a glowing orange orb that pulsated, as if it consisted of flame, which was seen in July of 2011.  The second sighting of this orb occurred a few months after the first, and was far less dramatic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike the previous sighting, I had no prior feeling of anything special.  However, the orb rose into the sky the same way it had on the previous occasion, from between the same trees I could see out of my South-facing window.  Like before, the orb rose to approximately sixty feet in the air and hovered before moving (again) to the Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like before, I followed the light outside where it stopped over the same hill.  However, unlike the last time, it did not land on the hill and moved, instead, Westward, until it passed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds associated with this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of December 2012, I have not had a repeat sighting of either craft.  However, my wife, children and several neighbors witnessed it, earlier this year...<n>

My friend (T) also saw very close to the same thing almost a month ago 2 orange lights hovered then went into these clouds and vanished she also reported her sighting on here. and she also saw it in Round lake not even a month ago. is this a coincidence ?<n>

It was a cool night and clear sky.  We had just gotten home from taking our 2 year old son trick or treating.  We began to clean up some of our Halloween decorations.  I had taken our trash cans out to the road for pickup when I noticed the odd object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my fiancé to look.  He looked up and said oh my gosh I see it too.  We were so shocked and excited.  We were facing the Southeast when it was spotted.  The object was an Orange Glowing Ball that hovered over the trees and a house for approximately 1-2 minutes.  The object then began to move closer.  As it moved closer to us we could hear a faint humming sound.  The object was present for about 3 minutes total and then vanished into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé’ grabbed his camera out of his pocket to try to take some pictures and video.  He was just taking videos and pictures minutes before.  The phone kept shutting off and on.  The screen was also flashing.  The phone is not even 2 weeks old yet and we have never had any other problems with it in the past.  The phone would not function properly until about 5 minutes after the object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live right on Lake Erie in Monroe Michigan.  Fermi Nuclear Power Plant is also very close to my home.<n>

They looked like stars traveling together and moved like flies zig zagging independently within the group heading in one direction.  Never reported nor have seen this before.<n>

On a back road Between Denver and Ephrata. My daughter points out a &#34;star&#34; Mommy what is that? My husband and I look and at first we think it is just a helicopter with a spot light.  As there was a blinking blue light directly behind it. We figured it was just hovering over the expressway as 222 is near by.  However there was no sound. As we got closer we notice a third light, red, just barely above the bright spotlight.  We get to be directly under it and pull into a parking lot, at this point we are directly beneath the object.  We look up and notice the spotlight is dimmer and its a triangular object literally just sitting above us.  One blinking blue light. One red one. And one White one.  Of course in the land of technology I do not take a photo or video but call my mother because at this point it finally moves, in the direction towards Denver.  I wanted another witness to see this object.  WE watch it as is leaves the area in an extremely slow fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: it is extremely low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes she says she sees it. With the accurate descriptions.  Says it stops, changes directions.  Stops another time, and then just disappears.  I have only 3 adult witnesses however my 2 children also saw this object.<n>
10/31/11 20:30|Dehradun (Uttar Pradesh) (India)||Flash|few seconds|It was a conical flare at very high speed( 50M?), no sound and it was there for few seconds.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85067.html|7|ndxe201110| It was a conical flare at very high speed( 50M?), no sound and it was there for few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on 31st October 2011 around 8:30 in evening when I was eating my bread on the roadside and suddenly a light or a thing like a flare drew my attention.  I ran behind the moving flare/light/UFO and in moments it disappeared in the night sky.  The flying body had a straight path, looked pretty defined to me.  It had a conical shape as with the exhaust on the circular end of the cone.  The direction of moving object was in the direction of the pointed side of the cone(imaginary).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One most remarkable thing about the object was that it appeared all ablaze or perhaps the body of the object was invisible desirably and just the flare was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing which I regret is that i was standing under a tree due to which I could not follow the path of the object.  Had that tree not been there I could have seen the flying object for few more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing is sure that the object was flying at a speed which I have never before seen any object flying at.   There was no sound.<n>

The driveway faces East.  Above the houses about 45-60 degrees up, I seen what looked like was going to be a shooting star because a light appeared in the sky and began to brighten.  It was not moving. Its intensity grew from nothing to brighter than anything in the sky within about 2 seconds.  At the apex of its brightness, my memory see&#39;s the shape as almost being &#34;hollow&#34; or &#34;empty&#34; in the middle...as if I was looking at a donut shape with the hole in the middle but just very slightly stretched out.  As soon as it reached its brightest point, it began to fade again and within another 2 or 3 seconds it was gone. I said something to my wife but she looked up and it was gone.  I starred into the same spot and about 20 minutes or so later it did it again.  Same pattern same spot. It did not reappear anymore. The sky was cloudless and clear.  It was not a star nor a satelli! te or flare.  It was not moving in any direction and did reappear after I first saw it.  It didnt appear to have any particular color except maybe a bit of yellow.  I took note of where it was in relationship to other stars.  I do not know the constellations but can remember where it was exactly both times it appeared in relationship to the stars in the eastern sky.<n>

The object was stationary, when first observed, due north of the city, and after 20 seconds it started moving eastward, slowly, for another 20 seconds, in a non-familiar flight path, and  then, suddenly, disappeared, when two east-west and west-east commercial aircraft flights approached at high altitude, and then two north-northwest  private aircraft passed at approximately 14,000 feet altitude.  At arm’s length, the object was one-third the size of my thumbnail. The sky area was observed for another 40 minutes, but the object failed to reappear.  The object was of continuous brightness, without strobe, green, or red, navigation lights, and was entirely silent. The local medical helicopter flies over my house regularly and I can say that it w! as not a conventional aircraft of any known kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a trained, USAF, Intelligence Operations NCO, I am totally familiar with all known Jane’s listings of aircraft, and then some.

I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. All but one light ascended down below my plain of view behind houses and trees.  I watched the one remaining light slowly float upward and fade out.  The entire event lasted around 5 minutes.  Behind some of the lights I could see the ridge of eucalyptus trees above Lake Chabot some 5 miles away and not higher than 1,000 feet in elevation.  My mother who was with me also saw the lights, as well as at least 3 trick or treaters who were filling the street in this residential neighborhood this Halloween evening.  I could also see a helicopter flying back and forth between my position and the orange lights. It was possibly just a routine traffic reporter over the freeway, but the pilot must have seen the objects. They were a deep orange, darker than air traffic lights that ! are common in the bay area of California with multiple airports nearby. The lights shone like flames. I would place there position to be right above the Lake Chabot area low in the sky possibly the size of cars.<n>

One was blue the other orange.  They were at least five (5) times larger than the visible stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they hovered then slowly separated.  The blue one remained stationary while the orange one moved further south.  As it slowed, the blue one also began to move south then both changed direction and faded into the night.  I wasn’t sure if the disappearance was due to the light source going out or they sped away so fast that they appeared to fade?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unaware if there were any documentations of the event.  My cell phone camera would not have been able to capture anything due to the lighting conditions and the other group mixed in with the rest of the family groups.  I was unable to reestablish contact with this individual.<n>
10/31/11 19:15|Seattle|WA|Fireball|2 minutes|Glowing orange orb flying North to South across Lake Washington 10/31/2011|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85077.html|15|ndxe201110| Glowing orange orb flying North to South across Lake Washington 10/31/2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir, I write to report the sighting of a flying  object that I was not able to identify on the evening of October 31st, 2011.  It was approximately 7:15 p.m. and I stepped out to get a breath of fresh air.  My deck faces East towards Lake Washington from Lake City Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon having my attention directed to an orange object in the sky by my wife I observed a glowing orange orb moving from North to South across the sky at a high rate of speed over Lake Washington.  There were no flashing lights on the object and it was moving steadily at a rapid  speed across the horizon.  The object did not change direction and I observed it steadily for approximately 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large trees in our yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that from the skyline the glowing orange orb was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from tree line.  My best estimate at the size of the object would be that it was roughly 1/4th the size of a large full moon, or roughly as large as my thumbnail with my arm fully extended towards the sky.  The object did not emit a detectable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is worth noting that about 15-20 minutes later an airplane flew directly overhead from moving from West to East.  Comparatively, the airplane was moving at a much slower speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening I once again stepped out on the deck and was observing the sky due to the earlier occurrence.  Curiously, I spotted a similar looking object in the Southern sky.  This time the movement pattern was much different.  The object was much higher (roughly 75-80 degrees from tree line) and appeared to be much further away.  Still, the object was approximately two to four times larger than any star or planet in the sky.  This time the glowing orange orb was moving much slower and was zig-zagging East to West as it continued moving South.  My second observation lasted approximately 2-3 minutes until the object again moved behind tall trees that at last obscured my view.<n>
10/31/11 19:00|Parma|OH|Light|1 min|Halloween lights over Parma Ohio|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85069.html|16|ndxe201110| Halloween lights over Parma Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its Halloween and I’m standing outside waiting for the kids to come by and I look to the south over the tree-line admiring the clear beautiful night it ended up being and I see a orange/red light in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I think, what a strange colored light, considering Parma has moderate flight traffic due to the Cleveland International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it nears, I realize I see no flashing lights to designate it as a commercial or private plane, but the level of brightness the globe indicated to me it was low flying and at a pretty good speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time it passed me, the globe of light was equally as bright from the back as it was from the front and I could see no definition of an object being present like one could observe from the multitude of passing planes heading in or taking off from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no sound as it passed. I attempted to rationalize this as a very high flying object but the brightness of the light was too vibrant to be some! thing as high as I think a plane would have to be to mask any sound or to have the clarity of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was off as well, and the fact that there was no blinking signal lights was also strange to me. It was heading north, and I lost sight of it after it passed beyond my roofline.<n>

It was brighter than most stars and with the sky being overcast, for one to shine so brightly it caught my attention.  It was north of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this &#34;star&#34; I looked in other directions and noticed two others (one further east and one south).  These &#34;stars&#34; did not appear to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking further, I observed it looked like a tear in the dark sky letting light seep through in a triangular shape.  As I was driving, the two others disappeared from my line of site, but the one to the north stayed stationary.  The star remained in site until I arrived at my home. Then I cam inside and looked for a website to report it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to the radio and talking on my cell phone all of the way and had no interference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not been drinking or using illegal substances and am not overly tired.

The object caught my eye at about the 10:00 position to my left at about 45 degrees and about the size of a pea held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was whitish yellow and pulsing at approximately 5 second intervals. At first I thought I was seeing one of the local refineries burning off gas because the light appeared to be stationary and quite bright and was indistinct through the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove north I would lose sight of it behind some of the buildings located along the freeway which indicated to me that its height was relatively low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer I got to the 405 fwy intersection the closer I got to the object until I got almost directly underneath the it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled my window down and was able to watch it for about 5 seconds due to slow conditions in the fog on the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see the Goodyear blimp almost every day and this was not it, especially at this time of day. I watch the jets come in every day at LAX &amp; Long Beach. This was not a jet. There are all kinds of floating ads all around the freeways but not ones with this kind of size and light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object is difficult to describe but at this point it was as big as a half dollar held at arms length. It was roughly a shoebox shape with dozens of lights randomly and non symmetrically distributed over a “surface” that reminded me of an offshore oil platform, very detailed, with one non blinking red light at the north end of it. No flat or curved surfaces were obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I drove under it I was unable to view it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a local Aerospace Engineer with 33 year Classified Aircraft experience at Edwards AFB, Palmdale and others.<n>

10/31/11 00:15|Colorado Springs|CO|Formation|it has been about an hour|Firework type of formation hovering south of Pike's Peak|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85053.html|22|ndxe201110| Firework type of formation hovering south of Pike&#39;s Peak<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the formation when I was driving home, South on Nevada. It caught my eye because I thought it was a firework, but then it never went away.  I was astonished, you could say, maybe confused, so I kept driving straight for about another 15 minutes to see if I could get closer to what I was seeing.  Trees eventually got in the way of my view, but as I was heading back, North on Nevada, I could see the formation in my side view mirror the entire way home. I live on a bit of a hill, so I have a view of it from my window. My window view is facing the Mountain Range.  I am seeing the formation South of Pikes Peak. It looks like a firework, a bunch of shimmering lights in a circle, but none in the middle.  The lights are pulsing, it seems like there is a rhythm.  They are colored red and white.  It seems too low for any government aircraft to be hovering.  I could email a few-second video I took.<n>
10/31/11 00:00|Hardshell|KY|Light|1 minute|Orange lights.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104904.html|23|ndxe201110| I was reading about the recent increase in the reports of orange lights.  They asked that if anyone should see any of these to report them using your online reporting system.  I actually have two reports, but I am going to file them as one because they are related and may help to add a little new light to this subject.  My forts sighting was reported to mufon and they concluded it was a real sighting.  As in there were no natural explanation.  The second sighting (which is the most important) happened the following summer when I got to see an orange light up close.  So did he rest of my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting It was Halloween 2011.  Almost exactly around midnight.  I was watching &#34; the ring&#34; while laying in my bed.  I had blue shades over my window.  Through the cracks in the shade I see an orange light shining through.  It registered in my mind as one the the neighbors outside night lights.  What we call pole lights.  About 5 seconds later it hit me like a smack to the face that I can&#39;t see the nieghbors pole light while lying in my bed.   Because of the angle.  That is also the best way I can describe the color.  The color of an orange pole light.  So.  Jump up on my bed and look through the shades and I see an orange light slowly going across the sky in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jump off the bed and run through the hallway and stub my toe.  I trip and finally make it to the living room.  I try to open the door but I&#39;m excited and I forget it is locked.  All this took maybe 5 to 10 more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally get outside to watch this orange light fly off to the east. I reported it to mufon and took pics of my shade and my neighbors pole light shining through the shade and pics of where the UFO flew off to the east and marked its path with dots.   Now to move on to the more important one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting:  This occurred the following summer in 2012, I don&#39;t remember the exact day or time.  I didn&#39;t report it to mufon but I sent an email about it to a friend who works for mufon.  It was a little after the edge of dark.  Off to the east in exactly the same place the first light flew off into I see three light .  Two white lights and one orange light in the middle.  It was almost literally scraping the hill tops.  I don&#39;t want to say it flew...  It was more like floating.  It was well below radar and it was huge. I can not stress that enough. Huge!!.  It was flying so slow that I realized I had enough time to get the rest of my family outside to see it.  So I run upstairs and get my aunt and my cousin outside to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew over it was 8 white lights in a rectangular formation kind of like a giant wing.  It had one bright orange light in the center of these 8 white lights.  As it flew over it never made a sound.  It was really close.  It occurred to me that the orange light was the se color and brightness of the one I had seen the previous Halloween.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not to much trouble to turn off the 8 white ones and you have an Amber UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over top of us and out house two smaller Cessna type planes actually flew over top to this UFO at a much higher altitude.  I could hear the faint sound of the cars as way off. It was amazing that here this was flying over us and there they were flying over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must stress these points.  It was huge.  It was almost literally scraping the hill tops, it was flying below radar, it never made a sound, it flew extremely slow, I believe it to be one craft and related to the amber and orange lights, and if it was a plane then it was flying illegally with none of the right beacon lights it should have had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle and his friend were on there way home from playing music and they saw it fly over top of their car. It flew right down the road in a westerly direction.  The number of witnesses to this are 5 that I know of.  I think this is important to the orange lights and I wonder if anyone has seen anything similar to what I saw.  I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember the exact date it happened a do should have reported it right then.  But I was one of afraid to. I will next time ..  If their is a next time.  I haven&#39;t seen then since.  My first sighting was a little dull but that only words I can find to describe the second is ........ Awesome.<n>
10/30/11 23:30|Columbus|OH|Cigar|4-5 Minutes|Possible UFO's over Columbus Ohio October 29th|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85016.html|24|ndxe201110| Possible UFO&#39;s over Columbus Ohio October 29th<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the night of the Ohio State Wisconsin Football Game in the Ohio State Stadium on campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small bridge north of the stadium, where after the game everyone walks in large crowds back to their cars, or to tailgates that are still going on. At about 11:45 I was walking back to meet up with my three cousins (who are brothers) who went to the game, because they were my ride home. On the bridge, about halfway, three round glowing lights in a perfect triangle formation came flying from the west very fast. I was walking slow in the crowd of people looking at these things honestly thinking that they were jets because of their formation. Once they got about parallel to the bridge they STOPPED.  They were close, like three times as close as a typical plane. They were very bright and clear, and literally looked like fireballs.  Orangish red, and almost pulsating like they were some sort of aircraft or something. there was no shape to them though, just br! ight lights.  Right when they stopped, i stopped walking and started asking people around me what these things were.  About 5 or 6 people stopped next to me and we started talking and looking at these 3 things in this hovering triangular formation. Ive never seen anything like this, and i am usually the type of person to make fun of people who say they saw UFO&#39;s, or religious signs.  Anyway this gets even stranger. Almost a minute of me (and now about 15 or so people around me) staring at these things, the one closest to us MOVES INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER TWO.  All these UFO cases you hear people saying that these aircrafts do impossible maneuvers or something that makes no sense.  We saw this thing just perfectly glide in between the other two, forming a PERFECT FREAKING LINE.  This was after one of the biggest games of the college football season, so MANY people were drunk, i was not though, because i had to drive home.  The people around me i could tell weren&#39;t either becaus! e we were all talking going what in the hell is going on? I ha! ve to te ll you i was on absolutely no drugs nor under the influence, because after the objects form into a line, we all start yelling because there is a FOURTH ONE coming from the west (the same direction the original three came from). This fourth one is flying. It was going so fast, almost looked like a missle or something. It was exactly the same as the other three though. This thing comes near the three that are in a line, and stops right near them. Yes, it STOPPED. It makes NO SENSE AT ALL how anything in the air can stop after going so fast. After it stopped the first three literally freaking SHOOT towards the south. I dont want to say disappear, but these things went from just being stationary to going very fast. in about 5 seconds they were to the point where we could not see them because they were now so far away. However, the fourth one that came up, stayed stationary for about 5 more seconds, and it slowly started to move to the south. We all watched this one go off for ab! out a minute into the distance, much much slower than the other three. I was standing there (and still am) trying to figure out what in the hell this was. My first guess is that it has something to do with the game, but that doesnt make any sense because THIS WAS AN AIRCRAFT, or some type of object. I want someone to tell me that it is something that i can look up and then confirm that its not a UFO, but nobody can. And this was a a pretty long sequence, about 4 minutes. Literally, like 20 people around me on this bridge one this fourth object was flying in were all talking to each other trying to figure out what was going on. I found a number of videos online that show similar looking things in the sky. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woCXh2kaw78&amp;list=PL5AA853A833B2D26B&amp;index=16&amp;feature=plpp_video This one shows exactly what they looked like, even though the ones in this video dont show the same maneuvering characteristics. I have no idea if this video is real or fake, all im saying is that what i saw looked exactly like this. Please, if someone has any idea of what these things could have been besides some type of aircraft that doesn&#39;t belong to earth, please tell me because its one of those things that if it actually was just mistaken for something, i really want to know. Also if you read this and you were on campus that night and saw this too, please please let me know<n>

I had seen several objects that looked like stars moving through the sky ( I see these things frequently and don&#39;t exactly know what they are) after the &amp;quot;moving stars&amp;quot; disappeared I walked over to my son. Moments later at the end of my driveway a red glowing orb popped out from the tree line it appeared to be around 100 feet above the tree line.  I quickly told my son to go up to the porch as this orb travels over the driveway towards us.  We watched from the porch as it slowly paraded over the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my wife she came out just in time to see the red orb shoot into the sky at a 45 degree angle and park itself in the sky it took seconds to reach its destination and was completely silent.  We stood there and watched for it! to come back but it did not.<n>

As I was on my street coming home, directly above the tree line towards the southwest.  I saw a bright white bluish light smaller than the moon but larger than the view of the planet mars from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so bright at first I thought it was a falling star but, when I kept looking at it, it almost seemed to jump slightly southwest. Then it just vanished into thin air, almost as if it closed itself into nothing.  It was so bright I’ve never seen anything like this before.  The way it moved so fast then to just disappear like that was so unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outline was like an oval submarine and had a blue purple hue to it, the center was a bright white light. When it did that fast jump/slide movement to the southwest I could see the outline of the craft.  When it disappeared it was like it closed into itself very fast.  It reminded me of a sparkler when you move it to try and write your name yet you can see the outline of the glow.  Then gone as if nothing was ever there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n>

Also, this is in a flight path of planes who are quite close to the ground - this object was far up into the sky.  (Not many planes were flying in Sydney at the time due to the strike)<n>

As i faced south  east from my balcony on the 8th floor in Hackensack there were jets of some sort  lining the sky as they normally do.  This time they were grouped, 2 here streaming, 2  more there streaming and one far behind but all going farther south*.  Then this  bright dot appeared in the sky! from nowhere.  Not from behind scattered clouds, not  from behind the falling sun.  From mid air it came, looking like a bright  chrome/metallic round thing.  No lights just an Orb, I&#39;ll describe it that way  because it seemed to be glowing or in a constant state of shape-changing but never an  obvious triangle or elongated shape, and rather than flying or propelling it would  dim and re-appear what could be miles away.  That&#39;s when I became amazed.  It changed  locations 5 times before disappearing for 20 minutes but then it returned.  I think  it would fade when other aircraft came around.  This is a busy sky but my friend  and I had never seen anything like this.  My friend and I were smoking cigarettes, he  was on his phone playing games and I gazed.  I would love to tell more, I&#39;m looking  for other means of putting my sighting out there because it was real, breathtaking  and definitely defied our science.  No jet or earthly aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen can  move from two points so far apart, so quickly, and not ever seem to have twisted or  propelled or anything.  When it would move, it would dim, as if shrinking and when  shrunk passed visibility it just appear somewhere else.  After having watched it for  more than 45 minutes, it got darker out, it moved farther east but did not dim  anymore.  This was about 10 minutes before total sunset.  I was able to put a  telescope on it (very amateur) and what I was able to focus on was something that  looked like an Atom.  2 glowing yellow orbs that never detached, which seemed to move  around this 3rd non moving yellow orb that was wrapped in a moving red octo-hexa type  of box.  That&#39;s when I started to think laser or some thing very Alien.  Please record  this sighting and inform me if anyone else saw what I saw.  We couldn&#39;t have been the  only ones  with all that time the orb spent up there but then again, this is the  eastern-city skies that no one really cares to gaze at.  But i&#39;m sure that whoever  looked up at it would not be able to identify the object just like my friend and I couldn&#39;t.  My friend was so scared that he chose not to continue watching.  He went  in and was silent.  He did choose to look through the scope.  I almost forced him to  because I this couldn&#39;t go unseen...it was obvious and really there.<n>

He saw them twice in 5 minutes around 10:00pm.  He saw them the first time and brought a friend out who saw them the second time. last night he came inside around 10:00pm and said he seen them again and again they were headed west. No sound.  Moving to fast to be a plane and at high altitude.  I then went outside and looked up for about 15 minutes when I saw a dim white light that was going the speed of a shootin star.  I thought it was a shooting start but it never dimmed out.  I saw it go all the way across the sky until it disappeared behind the roof of a house.  No sound what so ever but had to be going super sonic speeds. Last night it was clear skies.  A little about me:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a skeptic about UFOs being extra terrestrial until I had a orange iridescent orb come flying at me, get about 7 feet away then turned and flew off of a cliff.  This orb was a little bigger than a golf ball and flew at about 20 miles an hour with no sound.  After that I believe that its not all government experiments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen another UFO until last night. Not sure at all what it was, just felt I needed to report it.<n>

It was approximately 3000 feet in the air.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed, much faster than an airplane, with no sound.  It appeared to accelerate and disappear leaving an orange trail retracting (yes, retracting) in the sky just as fast as it had accelerated.  There was no sound or visible shape.<n>

It is important to not that I was not inebriated at  the time.  Nor do I believe the individual who first spotted the  objects had been drinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was engaged in conversation with this gentleman when he exclaimed,  &#34;what&#39;s that,&#34; and pointed to the east.  Looking up, I saw what seemed  like a fireball in the sky.  My first impression was of a burning  airplane.  The &#39;flames&#39; seemd to subside, leaving the object with the  shape of a sphere, glowing with an fiery orange color.  I soon made out  several more such objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the position angle of the objects and their relation to  surrounding buildings, I would estimate their size at about six feet  in diameter.  I would estimate their heading at about 340 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their speed would probably have been about forty miles per hour. There  were about six of them, and they were in a staggered line. They  emitted no sound. They also seemed to have mass; ie they were not  merely light. They travelled in a staggered line. There was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued on their north-northwest course, maintaining  their altitude.  They were followed by another group of identical  objects about a minute later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued looking at them until they had travelled a mile or so.  As  the lights reached some unmarked terminus, they seemed to extinguish  one at a time.  But I could still make out some of the objects.  They  looked almost like giant glass spheres with a smoky iridescance.  I  continued looking until the second group reached the same area, ceased  to glow orange, then disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a couple of other people watching on the patio.  I was too  engrossed by what I was seeing to pay much attention to them during  the incident.  Afterward, we speculated as to what we had seen, but  could reach no logical conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to find anything in the news regarding the  incident.  I even spoke with a couple of police officers to see if they  had heard any bizarre radio traffic during the time in question.  They  were polite, and did not treat me like some lunatic, yet told me they  had heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note for clarity:  I was in North Little Rock at the time of this  occurrence.  Do not confuse that with the northern section of Little  Rock.  North Little Rock is its own city across the river from the  Capitol City.<n>

I had my sunroof open.  I am a birder so I always have a pair of binoculars on my dash.   As a was coming down the road on a slight hill just before the state office building (Hill Farms) on the right, and the golf course (Blackhawk CC)  that begins on the left I saw a large object very low in the sky just ahead and to my left about where the Pyre Square Building and McDonalds are located.   At first I thought some helicopters were probably moving some large item but as I got closer it was not.  It was totally silent.  I quickly cross over three lanes of traffic to turn right onto Segoe Road to pull over and watch the object.  I grabbed my binoculars to look at it through my open sunroof.  As I was looking at one of the red lights the entire object just plain disappeared, no light , no anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spent the next 45 minutes driving around the west side of Madison trying to find it again and ! to find a good unobstructed viewing area.  It was so obvious that I saw something that when I got home I turned the news on since I assumed everyone would have seen it.  There was nothing on the news, nothing in the newspapers - I kept checking for a week or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the object looked like was a very large L-shaped thing with red lights on each of the corners.  I assume the reason most people did not see it is that just down the road a mile are many, many red lights on top of the building cranes at the construction sight by University Hospital, in addition to the red lights on top of University Hospital for the helicopter pad (Med-Flight).  So there are twenty plus red lights ahead in the sky as you drive down this road.  But all the red lights there on the hospital and on the cranes blink!   I am always looking up in the sky since I often see owls in flight at night..  I also spend many hours star gazing with either my binoculars or my spotting scope.  I always can see satellites crossing in the sky.  Recently I have been seeing movement in the sky that I do not think are satellites.  These star like objects are much brighter and move way more quickly and straighter that the satellites.  They have been moving from north-east to south, south-west.  I regularly spend many hours at night watch the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 13 years ago I was up in the Apostle Islands when star gazing one night I found three very small bright star like objects that were arranged in a triangular shape and kept moving around in perfect sequence in the triangular shape.  I kept viewing this sighting for over an hour.  They were very, very far away.  I know other people have seen this kind of sighting.<n>

Then as I did a double take I noticed that the perimeter of the “owl” was lit up, as if it was lined with small pin lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object glided over the back yard and headed south.  Before I could get my husband to look up it had glided away.  I told my husband, “I think I just saw a UFO!”   We talked about it for a few minutes but when he didn’t really believe it was a UFO I convinced myself that yes it was a large owl and the neighbors’ lights had lit up the underside of its feathers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later I decided to go back inside and when I stood up to get out the object flew over the front yard area of our house.  I was able to say, “Look, look there it is!” and point quick enough that my husband saw it too.  He was shocked and immediately called it a Dinosaur!!  It had the shape of a Pterodactyl with its full wing span spread out wide.  Again it glided over the house and was gone.  I mentioned the lights to my husband and he didn’t remember seeing them, I saw them plainly the second time it flew by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was ready to go in at that point, so we jumped out and headed into the house.  Once we dried off we walked out of the front door to look up into the sky but of course it was gone and we saw nothing else.<n>

We both looked out at the stars as the night sky was devoid of clouds.  A star caught our eye’s as it was pulsing red and white and I assumed it might be a planet and at first ignored it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time my wife and I both commented that we had just seen the star drop in the sky and start to dance around before returning to its original observed position.  The movement only last for a total of only 5 seconds.  I attempted to get a video with my cell phone camera and it would not focus out as far as I needed it to in order  capture the object on video.  I estimate the distance from where the object was over the ocean to where we were at between 10-15 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object and it was making smaller movements now from left to right, south to north, on the horizon.  My wife asked if she could have the car keys as she was getting cold.  I continued to watch and then when I walked back to the car I looked at the horizon again to notice the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got near the car and saw the object was back and this time the object was further to the right as to where we had first seen it and this time it had rotated on its axis and we could now see rotating lights at the cent of the object.  The lights on the axis were solid white and did not deviate from this color.  This lasted for about 10 seconds and the object rotated again and we could see the original pulsing lights only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved back to the original position to where we had first seen it.  My wife asked if we could go and I said yes.  The experience last only 25 minutes and my wife and I were both sober and did not have anything alcoholic to drink at dinner.<n>

PD))|2/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107001.html|57|ndxe201110| Formation of orange lights near Williamsport, PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard part of the Coast to Coast radio show tonight Feb 08, 2014, it was about orange lights in the sky.  This is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Halloween night, October 29, 2011 in Williamsport, Pa, my wife and I were driving wb on US Hwy 220 near the junction of US Hwy 15 we observed several orange lights (counted 15 of them) come down out of the distant western sky and were traveling toward us in an easterly direction.  They appeared to be flying in formation.  The lights appeared to be following the Susquehanna River using it as a flight path of some sort.   We pulled over onto the shoulder and watched and photographed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was raining with fog.  The time was approximately 20:00 to 21:00 hours, it was dark.  The area is very well lighted with many businesses, road lights, lighted traffic signs, moderate traffic flow and yet only two other vehicles stopped near us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights were first noticed, I was traveling at approximately 55mph.  I pulled over seconds later and began watching them.  Initially I thought they were like some kind of bag light or something to commemorate a party of some sort, Halloween, wedding or something like that.  I got out of the vehicle and watched the lights and tried to video record them.  I could not get them focused and eventually in like a panic I took photographs to document this.  The lights seemed to take several minutes to get to my location and as they passed directly to the south of me, less than a quarter of a mile in direct line of sight they quickly dropped down and entered the fog over the river and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their dissent  coming from the west seemed to be gradual, but then as they were within a half a mile they went from a height of at least a couple hundred feet, (they were higher than the power lines that cross over the river in that area) to where they dropped down quickly, lower than the bridge going over to South Williamsport and entered into a thick fog bank with all the lights following the ones in the lead staying in formation the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later the next year in July while we were at some friends, I met a young man and he and I shared our interest of UFO’s and space travel.  As we were talking about this, we both turned and were looking toward the western sky and in the day light both at the same time saw another orange light in the sky and both were very excited and brought it to the attention of at least 10 other people there who all looked, but were not nearly as excited as he and I were.  Pretty cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would swear to this report in any setting.  I am a former Highway Patrolman from a state other than PA.<n>

It did that for about 30 seconds then it started to move up in the sky.  A minute later it the same thing happened.  It sat there for another mintue or so then it started to move toward us and further up into the sky my fater and I walked out the front door and walked around the house to see it dropping more stuff this time it dropped at least ten then it started to fly further out of our site and all of a suden it disappeared.  I started to go through my pictures at first it just looked like a red dot but the further i zoomed in the btter the picture looked it looked like a saucer you could tell because the glare thay was coming off it made a shadow so you could see it perfectly. I h! ave never believed in ufo&#39;s before but tonight chamged my mind for the rest of my life.<n>

I was taking supplies outside and I glanced up at the sky, as I normally do being so interested in it, and saw what looked like the Belt of Orion.  I noticed though, that it was brighter than usual and stopped to get a more focused look.  As I did so all three bright lights, which were lined up PERFECTLY with Orion&#39;s Belt, shot across the sky and formed a perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staying stationary for maybe a minute each light blinked as if communicating before they shot off in a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being Air Force I know a decent amount about aircraft and there were no missions flying that early. Also, the lights were far too high in the sky for any aircraft to reach.  I tried to tell my coworkers what I saw but no one really wanted to believe me.  I was not able to get a picture because I had no camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After about 10-20 seconds another craft came in and moved into position next to the first craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they slowly moved as me and my friend sprinted into their direction not taking our eyes off the craft.  The first craft light blinked then slowly descended, the second craft following the movements about 5-7 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we lost track of them and just stood looking in that direction just confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10-15 minutes of discussion still steadily keeping track of the area we noticed a Chinook.  It landed in about the same vicinity of where the two craft descended. We decided to keep watch by climbing on about 10ft posts.  The Chinook ascended and ended up flying over where we were and that is when we were able to confirm it was a Chinook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got slightly uneasy about this and ran back to my friend&#39;s house to think about what we just saw and how we would describe it.<n>

I looked up to the southern horizon and observed 3 red/orange lights moving in a northern direction.  All three appeared to be at the same altitude and appeared to be moving together in a line one behind the other.  The first light was considerably further in front of the other 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to shimmer (for lack of a better word) they did not pulse or flash.  They appeared to be both red and orange.  They moved slowly like you would expect to see a high flying plane however they did not appear to be planes.  The movement was unusual and not consistent with smooth flight of a plane.  They also did not appear to be at an extremely high altitude.  Both my friend and I were having difficulty understanding what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light made it to a point in the sky east of our position and at that point disappeared from sight.  A very quick fade would best describe it’s disappearance.  The other 2 lights appeared to change position slightly pulling together closer with the 3rd light appearing to move slightly under the 2nd light.   They both continued to travel north and faded quickly from sight at exactly the same location as the first lights disappearance.  While there was light cloud cover, the clouds did not appear to occlude the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were considerably disconcerting, and we both remarked that we had just witnessed something unusual.  We both questioned aloud whether they could be flares but discounted it because of the apparent flight path of the lights.  We questioned as well whether they might be rockets but discounted that as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time observed 4 minutes. Conditions: 40’F Light cloud, no breeze.  Lights did not appear to make any sound<n>

I was in the Bluffside park in Lacrosse Wis. walking my dog on a crisp, clear night; and out of the southern sky came what I thought at first was an oddly lit helicopter.  It was about that high, when they are bookin from one place to the other.  It continued to come towards me from the south but I never heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer, I decided it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter.  It had a glowing yellow cylinder type body but not very defined (kind of fuzzy) and on top was a red light that looked like a dorsal fin (best way I can think of to describe it.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways it turned to the east and then another one came behind it and then another.  All turning and going east, real lazy, no sound.  Then they just kinda winked out, not like hyper drive wink but just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides little contact information.

The object was roughly the same size as the jet and made no noise and had not a single light on it. The jet was roughly 50 feet back from the object and was keeping up with it. I looked at eh object carefully as it was only 500feet or so overhead under cloud cover and looked for jet engine afterglow or any lights and there were absolutley non. I could only hear the jet and did not hear anyother noise as it flew over. The object can only be described as having a circular front with 2 sweeping wing type sides that came back to a point and seemed to come together. The jet and object flew in a northern direction as i live in northeast pa. My son is now a believer and is still talking about w! hat he thinks he saw and is not sure what to make out of it. After i returned home i posted a comment on my facebook and a few other actors who work in the same area of the mountain in the woods also commented that t hey saw it and did not know what to make out of it..Take this as the truth and know that it has forever changed my life<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were about 3 blocks from our house.  We were heading North on Rockford ave and to my left coming out of the west was a orange light going west to east.  I noticed it because I did not see any blinking red or blue lights that a normal aircraft would have.  It was solid orange and I thought this was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I preceded north to my street and turned left which I would be heading West.  I kept looking at the light and noticed several more were following the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and me and my sons were watching these orange lights quietly moving West to to East at a slow pace with no sounds.  I would guest they were about a quarter mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped the car to get out and watch we were actually about 100 yards from my house.  My son said hurry dad lets get the video camera, so we rushed home and he grabbed it and started to film which we caught the last 2 lights on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was home and she rushed out to see the last 2.  These lights seemed to have just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son swears one shot off fast but I did not see it shot off that fast.  We had to deal with some trees in our way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been told these were Chinese laterns and I honestly do not see the way they moved it could of been.<n>

These lights were totally silent and a brilliant orange color, almost liquid in its shimmer.  The lights were round in the middle with wisps of plasma like light extended on two opposing sides.  I followed them for about a short time (the length of time it took for my dog to do her business) and they disappeared one at a time at about the same spot in the sky.   These lights had no tail, no smoke, and no sound at all This occurred in the Machesney Park Illinois area, near the border with Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was unlike an airport beacon in the fact that it only swept back and forth over an area of nearly 90 degrees.  The airport is also in the opposite direction.<n>

I was standing on my back door step smoking and looking at the stars like I do every night.  While I was standing there I had seen 2 very bright lights following each other  across the sky. I found it odd because there usually isn&#39;t anything  traveling north over my home town.  They were moving quite fast only lasting at the most 30 seconds.  After that time they just disappeared, I could still see the stars in the direction they were heading to but they disappeared in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time is an approximation as I was outside and didn&#39;t see a clock at the time. I would estimate it to be between the times of 19:15 and 19:23 at the earliest and latest.  We do have air traffic over my town but its always east&gt; west or west &gt; east.  I would be very interested in finding out what these lights were.<n>

It was about the size of a pea to the naked eye and it was traveling in a semi straight pattern.  The colour change was going back and forth between Orangered to Red to Orange to just red. It glowed. There was not a distinction in colour like with lights changing, it just was.  As i watched it fly across the sky at speed that varied, I started to walk out into the yard to get a better look,  When i started walking to it, it stopped and hung in the air.  I stopped, then it started to move at a different speed. I moved, it stopped. As i was describing it to my cousin on the phone i watched the light decrease in size, the speed was not changing, from a Pea size down to pin point, then a bit of a white halo around the orb, all of a sudden it was just gone.  No speed increase no movement, just not there. I decided to google what i saw tonight and found this site,! Thought i would put what i saw into words. It was neat!<n>

They appeared on 10/28/2011 and 10/29/2011 between 8:00 and 9:00 both nights, in the sky east of Scottsdale, Arizona.  On 10/28/2011 they were further north than on 10/29/2011. Specific times of sight were 8:39pm on 10/28, and 8:15pm on 10/29.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flight behavior shows descent, but with sudden, curving and complete shifts in directional movement. There is no organized formation. They initially appear with long streaks of flame, already in a steep descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The relation between the ‘flames’ and objects are like that of a comet- so judging from the flames, which seem to only come from one side of these objects, I could determine a curved silhouette. Full shapes, however, were not seen. The flame will go out on one at a time, leaving a small white light, then spontaneously reignite with an equal amount of fervor. Each flame and object seem uniform in size. The colors of the flame range from white, yellow, and orange. No other lights on the objects were seen, other than the single light when the flame temporarily extinguishes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both nights these objects descend into darkness, or have fallen from view, just before they drop below the horizon line.<n>

I live in a home with an Ocean front view in Pacifica, CA.  At 1:45 PM I noticed some lights out on the ocean while I was in my kitchen.   A quick look from inside the kitchen it looked like maybe a few boats were out on the ocean and one appeared to be big. It might be a cruise ship I thought.   I turned off the lights, grabbed my binoculars and went out on the balcony to see if I could get a better view of the cruise ship at night.   The cruise ship was very far out so I was not able to get a good look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pulled the binoculars away from my face, I continued to look out towards the ocean; I noticed a large object that was not moving in the sky.  Maybe a mile or so out.   I first thought it was a plane or helicopter but it was not moving at all and if it was a helicopter, the light pattern and size were not consistent with anything I have ever seen before except in a movie theatre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rectangular in shape with the left and right side being slightly longer than the top and bottom.  The lights were mostly white and they were in about six rows.   They were not all next to each other but they seemed to have lights all along the bottom and on the top, mostly left and right sides with just a few in the middle.   There were red lights mixed in with the white lights and one or two orange color lights.  Some of the lights seem to go on and off intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> II noticed that the ocean below seemed to be lit up in certain places.   Interesting that the parts of the ocean that were lit up did not seem to have a light source.   I did not see a beam of light coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed in one place for about 3 minutes (zero movement) and then moved slowly away towards the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  at 1:00 PM this evening there was a small earthquake that woke me up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer:    I am a college educated white male in my mid 40&#39;s with a professional job.

I just happen to look out my window and I saw a bright light stop over my woods. I watched it for about 8-15 seconds and then it took off and was gone.  It came and left a a very great speed.  I told my son about it that night.  Now today(this morning) 10-28-011  I was awake in bed and so was my wife.  She was staring out through our bedroom window and the electricity went out for about 10 seconds.  I did not think anything about it at the time.  As I was just laying there staring at the ceiling.  Later in the morning she said she saw a bright light in the east when the electicity went out in the morning.  When the electicity came on she said the object dissapeared.  I asked her why didnt she say something when it happened?  And her reply was she didn&#39;t think I would off belived her.   Then I told her what had happened to me  a few weeks earlier.  She sounded relieved tha! t I told her that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bright object was moving slowly toward the southwest. My observation was from the front picture window of my house up on a hill. The object was under a solid cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the object was airplane landing lights, but out of the usual flight path.  As it got closer and larger I turned around to a nearby table to get some small binoculars out of the drawer, but when I turned back around the object had disappeared.  The object was visible and caught my eye when I first came into the room.  I observed it for a couple of minutes before reaching for the binoculars. After the object disapeared, I observed the sky for another few minutes to make sure it was not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my observation, there were no other aircraft in my field of vision, which from northern Tennessee to southern Kentucky is unlimited.<n>

Thinking it might have been a supersonic aircraft on fire, I observed it keenly, wondering what I should do next. But it moved very very fast, slowed and paused for awhile,increasing speed disappearing, and again reappearing, but now in lesser luminosity. It occured to me that I should capture a picture at least before it did its disappearing act, and was luckily able to get two pictures on the office cellphone before it became invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emitted neither sound, no smoke trail, and it was moving in a straight direction  (South East). Seemed that the object sensed my increasing surprise, excitement and observation, that it immediately responded by reducing its brilliance, and gradually faded away from my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keeny awaited its return, and checked for any other object that could be following it. But there was nothing else in the sky, except for the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I am alone on duty, I could not inform anyone else. But working near a sensitive area, I forwarded a security report as required by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear, and visibility was excellent, unlike yesterday when it was foggy. Having seen  meteorites before, I am positive that it was neither a meteor, nor a reflection, and it was moving too fast for a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be able to sense my alert curiosity, and immediately responded by reducing its brilliance as if in response. It emanated immense light, but cast no shadow did not emit any sound or odour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to add that this object moved with such immense power and brilliance and speed that my first impression was that it was the end of the world!<n>

It reminded me of the light from an electronic device so to verify I went outside to watch it alone, observing a short tail as it slowly moved from about 45degrees west of the horizon going WNW towards the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It blazed up very brightly with a very long comet-like tail colored flame red before gradually fading out to nothing as it approached the western Pacific Ocean rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was expecting a sound but couldn’t hear anything and the night was very quiet.  I have a very good view of the ocean so there was no impediment to my view from ambient light or obstructions as I live in an isolated part of the coast.<n>

Three dimly visible pairs of white lights. About as dim as your average star in the sky - nothing especially bright, but not so, so dim that you really have to focus to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking almost directly upward, and then somewhat towards the west. What I saw were three craft. Each consisted of two dim white lights at either end of what would be considered their wingspan. The eastern-most and middle craft were spaced about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch (in terms of holding up a ruler against the sky) apart, with the western-most about 1/2 to 5/8 of an inch from the middle one. In terms of my viewpoint, they were arranged like so: top--middle----bottom - top being east, bottom being west. They flew basically northeast to southwest, possibly over the ley line labeled 8 to 16 in this picture: http://www.crystalinks.com/becker-hagensmap4.jpg   They flew at perfectly equal speeds to each other.  They were at an what I would assume was an incredible distance, as like I said, they were as dim as your average star in the night sky.  They traveled at what I would also assume was an incredibly high speed, given the distance I was viewing from. I stared for about 12-15 seconds, then turned around to look across to another apartment complex where two men were sitting on their balcony, curious if they were aware of the same thing (they weren&#39;t), and when I turned back about three seconds later, I was unable to re-spot the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were absolutely not any type of stars or satellites, as there were three of them, all moving together across the sky at perfectly equal speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren&#39;t human-built airplanes of any sort, as no human craft is even nearly capable of such absurdly high rates of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A military plane (what appeared to be a fighter jet, devoid of any flashing or bright lights [which you never see around here]) flew over at give or take three to five thousand feet in the opposite direction of the three UFOs about three to five minutes after I lost sight of them, so obviously someone at some level of authority saw the same thing I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t help but believe this is somehow connected to 10/28/11 being the end of the Mayan Tun calendar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind is blown. That&#39;s all I can really say.<n>

It was very low and hovering just above the trees in one spot for over 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live outside of town in a remote, treed area.  The light was self radiating and did not shine any beams toward the ground.  There were no blinking lights, such as an airplane or helicopter would have.  The light was bright, very large and low in the sky. I had a pair of binoculars near so I took a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was shaped like a triange.  There was a row of white lights across the front and it had colors surrounding the craft.  The colors did not blink, just closely surrounded the craft.  I could only see the colors through my binoculars, not by naked eye.  I gave my binoculars to my husband who continued to watch the craft as it began to slowly move north, across the sky.  It was just above the tree line and was a very large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved past our house, he could see rows of diamond shaped patterns of! lights on the bottom of the ship.  It gained speed and moved away into distance.  We heard the sound of engines much like an airplane, but with a rumbling whine and wooshing sound.  We heard this sound for several minutes after the craft was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our three dogs were very nervous and ran back and forth inside and then outside. Very upset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident took over 10 minutes.  I have never heard of a craft that large hovering for such a time and can&#39;t imagine the power it would take.  I also have never seen anything that radiated such a bright white light.<n>

I thought at first that I was witnessing a shooting star.  I looked to my left and saw what was a triangular shaped craft with dim white-blue light along the front two edges with a brighter headlight at the front.  The craft was completely silent, headed away from my location toward the horizon. The sky was mostly clear but hazy to about 40 degrees off the horizon. When the craft was over the clear sky it was completely transparent and when it entered hazy portions of the sky I could clearly see it.  My estimation would bee that it was flying 1000-3000ft in the sky.  I have never in my life seen an aircraft like this.<n>

I heard what sounded like a glider through the wind which is unusual this time of night. It was different than just the wind or traffic noise from the street which is why it caught my attention. I looked up to see a triangle shaped object moving quickly overhead and passed over the top of my building out of sight. It was quick and a matter of seconds. I was suprised at the light noise, yet silent and also how low overhead the object seemed fly by. It was not as large as I would have expected. There were what seemed like reflective type lights on the bottom but not very obvious unless you are close. As the object passed by, it tilted slightly so the light from the street illuminated the bottom. It was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. It just whizzed on by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I liken it to a stealth bomber plane.  I had my wife come outside to look so people wouldn&#39;t think I was just making up stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft did not fly flat/horizontally like an airplane would, it was flying with the front of the plane angled upward about 45% with the back end tilting downward.  After it circled the area mentioned 3-4 times it flew directly over the trees in the woods and disappeared into the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later an area of approximately 300 square yards was illuminated in the woods for around 10 minutes!  Airplanes don&#39;t land that way and it was not a helicopter, I saw it pretty closely flying right over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 20 seconds after it landed in the trees you could hear mechanical sounding wooshes.  Then in the field, after it was landed for a few minutes, I heard a couple times a weird kind of whistling sound in short intervals and not in a pattern like birds.  This sound came from my neighbors field near his barns about 200 yards away from where I stood.  It sounded like ordered talking, not simply random sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whistling sound did resemble the tone of a birds whistles, but it sounded very large &amp; had a slight guttural sound to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to note, we did see 3 separate helicopters in the area after it was flying around for about 10 minutes.  Two of the helicopters left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the remaining helicopter flew over the woods several times after the strange craft landed and was emitting light.  After a few fly overs the helicopter left.  It was too dark to see if those were military aircrafts or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it was stationary but after 5 minutes it started to rise straight up then it changed direction going north for about 8 minutes moving extremely fast compared to the rest of the planes insight. Then it changed coarse again going back south but i seemed as if i made a type of turn because the brightness of the light increased and as it did a very dark blue light could be seen for about 2 seconds. After heading south for about 8 minutes it then stood stationary before rising again it then made a similar turn heading north were i could see the red light and blue light for a small period of time .It seemed to repeat this process several times for about 45 minutes . after this process it stopped in the south rising then slowing turn! ing to a very bright white with a small blue light then it headed north east at a fast pace in a nike tennis shoe sign .After that i could not see the strainge light anymore...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were more intense than night aircraft I commonly see and were easily noticeable.  The weather was cold and clear with no clouds, no moon, and the stars were bright.  I live in a semi-wilderness/rural portion of the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near Lake Superior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two lights approached, they at one point came together, close but did not merge, and flew in that position for about 10 seconds, then parted and flew side-by-side steadily as before, continuing west.  Curious, I waited to see green and/or white lights, such as would be visible on aircraft, but the lights only remained red and blinking.  The blinking lights were not synchronous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the duo flew (to my south) and passed my position on the ground still heading west, I expected to hear the usual sound of a jet or motor or helicopter, but my ears picked up no sound whatsoever.  However, just after the lights passed me, my adult dog began to furiously bark and would not stop and my pup as well.  We do have wild predators in our location, so having a hand-held spotlight with me, I began shining the weeds and surrounding forest around us looking for &#34;eyes.&#34;  That is when I lost track of the flying red lights, as they probably passed beyond my vision behind the spruce trees to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my barking dogs inside, and went out again alone and saw a solitary jet with running lights, flying the same path.  I estimate the speed of the jet was flying a bit slower than the flying red lights (from my observation on the ground), but I have no knowledge of the elevation of the red lights.<n>

So far there are 3-5 craft that fly around in what looks like a big circle. We can see them brighter as they get closer and dimmer when they are farthest away making this huge circle and as they move they form a triangle several times. One night there were four and I saw them for almost 2.5 hours. Another time three of them were out and they have been out almost every night since late August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight there were four of them again and they flew the same pattern for an hour. These are not aircraft.  They were filmed by Nevada City TV and I will have a CD next week. When zoomed in you can see some small orange and blue lights and you cannot see any exhaust of any kind, so they cannot be internal combustion engines. So, another option is battery power, but batteries are very heavy and I don&#39;t see how we could have anything that would keep flying for that long on batteries. So what power source? Could they be UFO&#39;s. You be the judge. They flash slowly with white light. The guy who filmed this from Nevada City TV was bit of a skeptic, but now that he saw them for 2.5 hours, he said - I don&#39;t know what they are. He zoomed in with his big camera and filmed it for about an hour and we could see a bit of orange and blue then, with mostly white light that slowly fades and gets bright in about 3 seconds. They are there every night at around 8:30 and stay for hours. There are ! always 2 and up to 5 flying around. I contacted Beale AFB and a Staff Sergeant in public relations was interested, and said she would ask around to see what they could be. I haven&#39;t heard from her yet but I did tell her anyone can come up and see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A guy from Nevada City TV said he was going to see if he could get Sierra College to use their telescope to see them. I will be calling the FAA and Sac airport to see how they respond. These appear to be about 30-60 miles away. A video has been made and can be sent next week to investigators. Everyone tells me it is military but these are not in my opinion, even though they are flying right over Beale AFB.<n>

I have seen them few times in the past, but her first. All three of us were just mesmerized during it&#39;s passing.... something estrange about it... a vibe... almost like an elder that just waved at us to say... &#34;hey, we&#39;re here and hearing your thoughts/feelings... just wanted to drop by to say we&#39;re here...&#34; (that&#39;s just my impression/feeling of the situation)<n>

We thought it was  a helicopter at first and it was getting shiney as it looked like it was coming closer.  It seemed to have a tail.  It then went back into the water and a vanished.  A speed boat raced to the scene from the south east and picked up an object and then sped off going southeast again.  This occured about 2 miles North of The Army Corps of Engineers Pier.  This is my first time at Duck Island and I&#39;m 72 yrs old. I am curious to what I saw.<n>

Looked straight out the window of my bedroom which happens to be right beside my bed and noticed a very bright gold/bronze color object slowly but steadily moving south.  I woke up my wife and told her ‘Look Honey, it’s the International Space Station going by!’, because our local news had been telling us of viewing times we could see it go by a couple of weeks ago.  But this time was different.  All of a sudden it stopped moving and just stayed there.  It appeared that the object was getting a little larger as if it were dropping altitude getting closer. During the time it was closer it looked like quite a few lights were rotating on the bottom.  Then it gained altitude again and stayed there for about 15 minutes.  Then quicker than it came it was gone. The only reason I kept my eye on it was because I thought it was the International Space station going by.  Turns out I don’t have any idea what that thing was.<n>
10/27/11 03:00|Portland|OR|Unknown|Approx 5 minutes|Was up late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and went out to the alley behind my apartment in Northwest Portland (Around NW 23r|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85055.html|107|ndxe201110| Was up late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and went out to the alley behind my apartment in Northwest Portland (Around NW 23rd Ave) for a cigarette before bed when I noticed two lights in the sky. One orange-ish red, the other blue-ish green. There was no other light so I couldn&#39;t make out a shape but these lights were not separate entities they were definitely both apart of the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I shrugged it off as an aircraft, turned the other way and finished my cigarette. 2 or 3 minutes later when I turned to go back inside I looked back to the North and the aircraft was still in the same location. I stood and observed it for another 2 or 3 minutes and watched as it seemed to hover in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next instinct told me because of the size of the lights, much larger and brighter than any of the closest stars, that it was at a lower altitude, and because of this and the fact it was hovering I assumed it might be a helicopter. However there was no audible engine noise which would be impossible for an Aircraft this size at this altitude. Unless of course I have serious hearing impairment which I do not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another remarkable thing about this object was that the lights were near perfect spheres, no blurring, blinking, or flashing. Just nearly perfect luminescent spheres. Also the Orangeish and Greenish lights were the only lights I observed. No blinking lights on the belly or tail like you&#39;d come to expect from a commercial or passenger Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly the position of the object would&#39;ve placed it between Forest Park and downtown Portland, in my opinion a precarious, and somewhat suspicious position for any conventional aircraft to be flying, especially considering it&#39;s somewhat low estimated attitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To end, I&#39;d like to add that I worked nearly 2 years as ground crew at Portland International Airport. During my time there I&#39;ve worked on all types of aircraft from small commuter planes to Airbus 330&#39;s. I&#39;d like to think of myself as fairly knowledgeable when it comes to identifying the various Aircraft the fly in and out of PDX. However I could not identify this as a conventional aircraft.<n>

It was Diwali yesterday so everyone was burning fireworks and socializing. Suddenly a friend pointed towards the sky and a very bright object was moving across the sky.  At first we thought it&#39;s some firework but it kept moving.  It didn&#39;t look like an aeroplane, was way too bright.  Then within another 5 mins a similar object crossed the sky. We rushed to the terrace and we could see it in a distant corner of the sky. And while we were looking at it, we saw that there was another one nearby.  They were moving in the sky but were very far off from us.  Then they disappeared.  And just as we were leaving suddenly one of those popped up again and this time very bright and nearby.  It crossed the sky and then got dimmer and dimmer and vanished again. Again after 10 minutes it came back.  But this time from the opposite side and again crossed the whole sky. And I haven&#39;t seen anything like it. It was so different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I captured a lot of photos and videos. I&#39;ve written a blog about the event - http://tech-junky.com/uncategorized/ufo/i-think-i-spotted-a-ufo/<n>

Sightings in Candler, NC|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84905.html|111|ndxe201110| Multiple/Re-occurring U.F.O. Sightings in Candler, NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple/Re-occurring U.F.O. Sightings -As seen by more than 4 people at once; some of which, are my neighbors-<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dated this report on 10/26/11 because this was basically the clincher after a few months of activity (starting around the beginning of August). I had been looking up every night since the very first time I saw; at night (around 1am), an orb of light that almost seemed to know that I was watching it.  Almost like it danced for me, and I couldn’t move while watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my girl-friend come out and look after about 20mins, and we watched just as it zipped a further distance away gracefully.  The peculiar thing about its movement was mainly the vast distances it could achieve in a short time; the sharp angular movement that seemed to allow easy movement in 3-D. travel (in other words, they can go any direction fluidly), and without making a single sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up to this point I have seen in the area around Candler, NC: the visit of fast, slow, lingering, and bolting away night-sightings. During the day; only most recently, I have seen silver-like, oblong, and &#34;saucers&#34; (around 1pm-3pm).  This was what really made my heart race, I had finally found that they were in our atmosphere, and I got glimpses of their minute-long little strut.  Then they just go off, and even into clouds to never re-appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe me when I say, I have been interested in the stars since I could look up, frequenting the high-powered telescopes as a youth. Never in my life have I seen any un-identifiable/irrational-anomalies that I could not disprove. Now I have many. After I started telling more people near-by, they tried to rationalize what I saw, but I put a sock in each of their mouths when I came knocking for them the hurry and run to see around the trees before they were gone. Everyone was stunned, and the all felt that same “awe” that I explained. The people I live next-to are the most skeptical people you could meet, and they had to tell me that they could not explain what they just had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the clincher tonight was a red orb being followed closely by a blue orb (maybe opposite at times). It/they moved very fast, turned a near 90-degree angle, and went over-head making no noise. The odd thing is, nearly half the time these things happen a non-commercial/unmarked plane flies near its’ trajectory. This time, there was a helicopter flying under it and making noise. The craft (or two) made that angle towards over my house, and the helicopter went off over the next ridge. As the craft/crafts went along and got closest to me, there was no noise at all. They/it soon went over another ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These have been frequent, and so much so that I sit outside in the cold every-night. It’s very hard to ignore it, and i just think that I should put it out there. This I merely a statement to tell whoever is listening, the Pisgah Mountains have unexplained orbs, crafts, and “saucers” in its’ skies. Increasingly.<n>

10/26/11 20:00|Tampa|FL|Triangle|2 minutes|Bright hovering white light and triangle craft seen over Tampa Bay.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85081.html|115|ndxe201110| Bright hovering white light and triangle craft seen over Tampa Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving East across the Courtney Campbell Causeway from Clearwater to Tampa, around 9pm when I noticed one of the street lights looked different because the light was white compared to the yellow street lamps, and much brighter, but relatively the same size. When I looked closer I noticed that it was also higher above the street lights and that it was hovering in the air independently.  At this point I drove past it and could no longer see it, but then ahead of me to the right, over the water I saw something else, at first I could only see reddish lights, but they were not blinking like the lights on a plane. It was also moving much slower, and was much lower than planes fly in that area.  It was moving slowly towards me and then at a certain point it flew across the road, a little ahead of me. It was low enough so that I could see it&#39;s shape. It was triangular, with red lights on each point and a white light in the middle. Then it flew out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it is important or not, but less than an hour earlier, the causeway had the most awful traffic. I was driving home from work and what usually takes 20 minutes took me two full hours. I only bring this up because I have a feeling that the UFO&#39;s are sometimes attracted to our energies, both positive and negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen these same crafts. In 2009 I was driving from Tampa to Miami and my friend and we saw these same triangles with the lights on them. One also crossed the road over us and flashed very bright beams of light, which seemed to come from the lights on the corners. Then a few minutes later we saw a bright hovering white light over the road, which looked like a thin metal blimp when we passed under it, and on the other side was a bright red light which hid the metal object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/25/11 23:00|Seattle|WA|Light|About 1 Minute|Star-like light with humanly incapable flight pattern|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86091.html|118|ndxe201110| Star-like light with humanly incapable flight pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frequently like to go outside or look out my window at the stars. A few times in the past five months. I have noticed what looked like stars (or indistinguishable from stars) flying across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time in August 2011, my girlfriend and I watched two fly across the night sky in the Nevada desert, about 100 miles North of Reno. They were far apart and were obviously not a single aircraft. The lights were traveling South-East to North-West at exactly the same rate of speed, never altering the distance between themselves. They took nearly twenty seconds to make their way out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting occurred in November 2011. I was walking to my car after eating at a McDonalds 16 miles South of Seattle, when I looked up and saw a single star-like light traveling across the night sky. I proceeded to watch the light for about one minute as it made it’s way out of my range of sight. I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, on Christmas night 2011, I was staring out my bedroom window (not far from the previously mentioned McDonalds) when I saw a star-like light flashing between white, red and blue while producing very peculiar flight patterns. The light would jolt randomly within a very small radius as it made a linear path across the night sky. The due path was South-East to North, while the jolts were sporadic in direction. The time for this light to traverse the night sky was also about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure this object was not an illusion produced by the lights on the underside of an airliner due to the elevation, the apparent movement of the single light and no appearance of aircraft body within the jolting radius. Also, a satellite has no way of producing this random jolting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence was by far one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed. I even woke my girlfriend up to ask if she could see what I was seeing and she was just as amazed as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IMPORTANT: NO SOUNDS WERE HEARD DURING ANY OF THE SIGHTINGS<n>

Hazel colored light that did not strobe like an aircraft that would slowly move across the sky at very low altitude.  They moved slow then would jolt about five 10 inches and dead stop then vanish. Then reappear in about 30 seconds.  I watched two of them do this until they both went out of sight.  I appologize I couldn&#39;t get a picture or video.<n>

It was in the path I was going torwards.  I pointed it out to my mother and she was also curious. We headed in the direction it was and we followed it to our street. We parked the car in our driveway and I took a closer look, it was a large triangular craft with 3-4 lights emitting a low elecrical hum. It stood out from anything I have seen in the sky before.  The lights very very bright. It seemed to have stopped above my street for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-10 minutes I noticed another object flying to the west of me and it seemed to come closer to the Triangle.  Once it came a little closer, it seemed to chase the triangle away and they moved over the mountain and I lost my vision of them both.  The next few days we saw several large black helicopters and my mother reported the sighting to Mufon but when she was emailed by them she never followed through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was quite large.  The light emminating from the object reflected on the night sky above it.  It revealed the clouds above it and reflected off of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my estimation the object was very close to Rochester New York, USA.  Given the size of the object and it&#39;s proximity to the Lake it seemed at least half way across the Lake by guestimation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained in the sky until it flashed out.  Some time later it reappeared and then flashed out once again.  The video quality is quite good and a larger file is available that I have uploaded to the You Tube site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to contact the other witness.

It then slowly moved toward the southern sky.  My 2 kids and I witnessed it and also people stopped at the light were all staring at it too.  I have contacted the newspaper and local news and they will not return my calls.<n>

I then went back inside to see them.. Upon opening the photos I saw a blue light moving around the frame by the moon..  It looked strange so I went outside again to take some more pictures and see if it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then placed my camera on the deck railing on my outside deck ant took about more photos with 5 second shutter speed to capture the light at this dark hour.  I took about 12 photos.  The hole time looking for this blue light that was moving in my frames..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept clicking until I did not see it in the frame any longer.  I then decided to take a few mor just to be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went inside to see what I had captured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened photos and to my surprise there were three green things in my yard. they seem to be moving in the frames and almost coming tward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to send photos ..

Object was stationary against a clear blue sky.  It was too low, large and stationary to be an aircraft.  I was a passenger in a vehicle traveling north on I-5 near mile 2 and saw it in the western sky at approximately 1:10 pm PST.  I lost view of it after just a minute when an embankment blocked my view.  Just moments later, the view was clear and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking in the sky a little bit south east of the road because the moon was in an almost perfect crecent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked into the sky an object appeared just a bit to the lower right of the moon. (At this time in the morning it wasn&#39;t really dark out).  The object was like a fluorescent light in the sky (Extremely bright and white).  The shape wasn&#39;t very clear but the raident light kinda gave it a Seattle Space Needle outline look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was excited thinking that I was seeing a shooting star or some kind of satellite falling through the atmoshere.  But was intrigued that it had very little light trail (like a meter etc).  What happened next, will be remembered by me for the rest of my life.  It stopped and it took a 90 deg angle back the other way.  Then stopped again.  It then took another 90 deg across the sky, stopped once again and ! then shot directly outward almost as if it shot straight to the right of the moon and dissapeared. I&#39;ve seen my share of air shows and military jets perform..etc.  I&#39;ve never seen anything this fast nor maneuver the way that this object did.  The thing I most remember, is when it stopped and turned back the other direction, I remember telling myself to clear my mind and focus on what I was seeing.  I did so, and remember my hair standing up on the back of my neck.  This was a great experience for me ans will never be forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an engineer, a video gamer, an athlete, a dog owner, an uncle, a brother..etc  ...  But definetly not a nut job.  I saw what I saw (alien craft, meteor, new military plane) whatever it was..and have no problem explaining to anyone.  But, like most it seems, my sighting was short and now is gone.  I keep replaying the scene in my head so that I don&#39;t forget the specifics and most importantly so that I don&#39;t skew any of the facts.  As I want to remember as accurate as possible forever. (we&#39;ve all played the telep! hone gam e).  Thank you and good luck with this info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P. S.--The main reason I&#39;m sending this in, is that a guy from my work referred you, Doug Dunlap.  He said he is a friend of yours.  I also mainly submitted this, to see if anyone else had seen what I saw.  There were plenty of other people on the highway at the same time as me.  I asked a fellow co worker on the Hwy just moments after me if he had noticed the crecent moon, and he replied &#34;oh yes definetly&#34;.  I kew he would because the size of the moon and the perfect shape was right over the highway and was a great view.  With the fact that the moon was hard to miss and everyone was most likely looking into the sky near it as I was, there had to be more people that saw this object as well.  I would love to know I wasn&#39;t the only one!!  Thank you for your time<n>

10/24/11 22:30|Lansing|MI|Formation|30sec. - 1 min|Seven or eight red orange lights moving slowly making no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports of this event are pending.  PD))|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84785.html|146|ndxe201110| Seven or eight red orange lights moving slowly making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off I would like to say that I am colorblind, so I’m not so sure about the color but I would have to say that they where an orangeish-red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I am an overnight janitor that works all over Lansing throughout the night going from account to account. At about 10:20 pm I had pulled up to an account  roughly on the corner of Fairview and Grand River. I had backed my truck up so that I was facing north as I always do when  I received a phone call from my boss.	 	 The conversation went on for about ten minutes (about 10:30pm now) I noticed the first object out of the corner of my eye. It was an aspirin-sized reddish light that was moving quite slow coming from the north-west just over the top view on the two storied building to my left moving vary steadily to the east. After about five seconds two or three exact same size and shape objects faded into view just in front of the first one, followed by another small grouping. All moving at the EXACT same speed and never breaking there formation witch was nothing really impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I interrupted my boss and was begging him to go outside and look to the north. He was at a location just southeast about a quarter mile from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects, seven or eight total, never making a noise started to fade out one by one after traveling half way across the sky. By the time that the last one made it to the far right (north-east) of me, my boss finally made it outside and at least confirmed the sighting of the last one left. He confirmed the location and the color, but said that it was flickering before it diapered, and overall was not impressed. I on the other hand saw the whole thing and can say that not one of the objects ever blinked or flickered even once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted somewhere between thirty and sixty seconds, and the objects moved slow and very steady. In fact I can remember thinking that they may be helicopters, But once again, no sound at all, no blinking lights, and why would they fade in and out?  I have very little knowledge of aircraft, spatial differences, speeds and heights of normal objects in the sky , But I can safely say that They where NOT Meteors. They did not move nearly fast enough or leave tracers or tails. I have seen my share of them. I also know that the direction that the objects came from was in the area of the Lansing international airport. So hopefully that will help in finding some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also drew a picture of the formation shortly after seeing the event, but I can&#39;t upload it because I don&#39;t have a scanner.<n>

Our house faces South and when he parked his car, he was leaning against it, facing West.  I was standing about a foot away from him and noticed a strange orange-red light that was circular in shape, with a section from the center missing. It was almost as if the light were two seperate pieces and were not stuck all the way together.  I said &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and he turned to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds in the sky, so at first we thought it was possibly a plane and the light was reflecting through the clouds but it slowly faded from view as if on a dimmer switch.  Right after it had faded all the way out, two more lights popped up, right next to where the other had just been.  They shimmered in and then faded out as well, almost as quickly as they had come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us were sure what we had seen, but with the Luke Boys flying overhead all the time, among with all the other planes we see flying in, we are pretty familiar with our skies.  This was like nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have witnessed other phenomenon like this, but never as close as this felt.  I am hoping we weren&#39;t the only two people to see this, which is one of the reasons why I am reporting this sighting.<n>

This light seemed to change between white, green and red while very slowly moving about the sky, though not straying far from the original location.  Without a point of reference it was difficult to detect the movement.

The object was cigar shaped, yellow and orange in color with a short white tail.  At first I thought that someone had shot off a firework, but I didn&#39;t hear the whoosh sound which typically precedes flight.  I watched it travel in a a fast, horizontal trajectory, no sound at all.  I then lost it as it passed over a grove of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This observance was at 7:25 pm in Charlotte, NC.  It was a very clear dark evening and I know that it was not s shooting star as it was very bright.  I was the only one in my family to see it and unfortunately did not have a digital camera at the time.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was an airplane light.After watching it for 4 or 5 sec.and seeing other airplanes to the south of it that were extremley smaller, I noticed it falling down at a very fast rate.  It was just left of a bright star or planet in the eastern sky.It was about 4 or 5 times as big as the star / planet.  As it fell it started producing a burnt orange and red  flames on the bottom giving the appearnce of it being bigger on the bottom.Just above the treeline it just disappeared.  I thought a plane had gone down but there were no fragments, it just disappeared.  I even called the airport to see if a plane had gone down.  They just kind of laughed and said no.  Watched the object maybe a total of 20 seconds.  On the 25th I even called nasa to see if a large meteorite had fallen, but no response.<n>

I saw what I figured was a plane because the red flashing lights and it was flying straight. I watched it for about 30 seconds and it stopped moving. The lights were still flashing, now from red, blue, green to yellowish. More morphing into each other than flashing. Then it started to move around and hover. I looked down to focus my eyes, notice the pattern the street lights were in, looked back up and saw the same pattern (5 stars). So I looked above that and saw a pentagon of which all had moved or I saw lights. Shape from where I was at; if you lift your hands straight up and out, and have a two inch space between index and both thumbs, that’s roughly the size of the pentagon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the first one and it was slightly moving and lights still, fairly, going. I then focused and physically saw my vision make a tunnel to the “UFO” and I then immediately saw 1-3 shooting star looking lights fly between the two sets of  stars.  (My mind is kind of fuzzy, it was either one with 3 points that connected, or 3 different ones that mesh together) I, then again, look back at the first craft I saw and watched for another minute and then it had dropped something.  A very small, smaller than the stars around, object/s lofted off the craft.  I keep watching for awhile, they do nothing but slightly move and just hover.  I look back towards the first one and made a connection in my head that I had seen a UFO and then I saw another craft take off as if it’s a shooting star.  Then I start to go back inside, decide to take another look, walk back and look between the trees (where my first sighting was at a different location) and see another one flying.  Then it stops! directly in the center of the surrounding trees, hovers, lights are going, and it just stayed there.  Then it took my breath away, and I went back inside.  (My other report of the same craft different night is posted as 9/5/11)  Both times of which i could not record :(<n>

My 10 year old granddaughter saw it once it was making the u turn and went over the house and my grandson saw it light up behind the tree. I actually saw it forming from the golden sparkels and when when it was coming at me I jumped out of my chair and said what the f was that.  I told James Gilligland about it and he thinks it was an ultradimenisional being,  I think so too. I don&#39;t know if it was a ufo but I have seen a few of those to.<n>

We were over there for about ten minutes when slowly a very large circular space craft moved from among the tops of the trees on the ridge we were facing.  It came from the northwest and slowly moved along north east.  I watched it for a while trying not to freak out and once it had fully got away from the trees into the plain air a little behind it in the sky little star sized lights flashed in the sky. We watched it for a pretty short time then ran back to my house to try to piece together what we had just seen.  But once we were already back at my house we didn&#39;t see anymore space crafts, but we did hear strange sounds in the woods from my front porch, like a dragging crashing of the leaves sound.<n>

The light were extremely bright and were visible for at least the 10 minutes that I was outside.  The lights were staggered both horizontally and vertically.  They did not appear to make any sudden movements, they just traveled from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The number of lights visible during the time I was outside exceeded 40.  As they passed overhead the lights were no longer visible, which made me think that they were possibly aircraft or helicopter forward-facing-type landing lights.  However, there was no sound at all coming from any of the &#34;craft.&#34;  I can see (and hear) aircraft landing at the Sarasota Airport across the bay all the time, so surely the airport spotted these on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my basic digital camera&#39;s video recorder to record @ 5 minutes of the flyover, however the quality is quite grainy and the file size is @ 418mb, which makes the clip too large to email.  I have made shorter clips of 17mb and 58mb from the original as well.  I could forward a copy of the entire 5 minute clip on CD if requested.<n>

It was heading smooth as silk across the sky northwest I believe.  The lights were very faint and if I had not been looking at that part of the sky at that exact moment I would have missed it.  Although faint the white lights were much, much larger than stars in the night sky and they did not break formation which along with the documented shape led me to believe I was looking at a flying craft.  I have seen bright flashes in the night sky before that I cannot explain but this to me is hard proof.

She went out to see if the neighbors were screwing around with fireworks or something.  She ended up screaming for me to come out side and look out over the neighbors... Is that what I think it is, she asked?   I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  It was bright white, saucer shaped craft with a red blinking light at the top and a red blinking light at the bottom.  It made absolutely no noise what so ever! I ran in the house and grabbed my field glasses and looked at it again and it appeared to have sequentialy flashing strobes and what looked to be a string of windows about a third of the way up from the bottom continuing around the craft. It appeared to be spinning.  It was heading from the east (Ringoes NJ) to the south west(towards Lambertville NJ)and it seemed to be following Route 202 southbound at approximately 800 to 1000 ft of alt.  At a distance of 2 miles it was 1 and 1/2 thumbs wide and 3/4 of a thumb tall.  In 43 years of living in West Amwell, Hunterdon County, NJ, I never saw anything like this. I have heard on facebook that it may have been a blimp, but I am a private pilot(around avaition equipment quite a bit) and I think I know what a blimp looks like by now. It scared me enough to chase my family inside, turn off the lights and  call 911 and report it to Hunterdon County Dispatch. Of course, the craft flew off before the police could see it. I didn&#39;t have enough time to take a picture, but other people saw it, including some of my son&#39;s friends and their parents. Please post any info you can as we are scared shitless, and the local authorities and the faa aren&#39;t any help!<n>

The one we saw was a black pod like ufo that was cylindrical in shape and it was black. It just hovered over the honolulu zoo. This was also seen by another friend on kapahulu that was around the same area.  He said that he saw it as a black cylinder/circle once it got over his head and it was right above him.  he also said he saw a type of antenna on it.  It is odd that these sightings are happening right when they are preparing for APEC here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We saw a silver black banded cigar shaped object The sky was clear no clouds.  It was traveling in a north to south direction. I did not make note of the date because I had no intention of reporting it at the time. I had time to run inside and get my camera, but I just stood there dumbfounded and stared at it until it past the tree line and it could no longer be seen. We were talking as we watched and we agreed it looked like a missle or torpedo it was silver with a black door on the side of it, but it was horizontal and not going very fast. What we thought was a black door I guess could have been a black band that wrapped around it. It was like a low flying passenger jet maybe a 747 or something. (a big one) Shiny silver with no wings only the black in the center. It was in the afternoon when we saw it maybe 3 oclock or so. It was a Sunday and I would have to guess it was 10/23/2011.  Wish I had took a p! icture and noted the date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was hovering in the sky, it didn&#39;t fly by me. I think I had about a 2-3 minute view as I was driving, before the trees blocked my view.  I was seeing it at about a 67 degree angle on the horizon past the southern end of the lake, past the trees.  It was a really sunny, clear day, only a few clouds, and it was hovering below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I kept watching the thing and I thought  it must be a dad out flying an inflatable with his kid somewhere around the lake.  But, the shiny thing did not move or waver or flutter in the wind, and it was pretty big. Then I thought it must be a blimp.  I&#39;m not a good judge of size or distance, but as I got closer I could see that it was not moving, it had a distinct saucer shape (two saucers on top of each other) the top was very shiny and the bottom was dark or in shadow.  It appeared to be larger than a car, but as I got closer I decided it was not the shape of a blimp or as large as a blimp.  I wanted to pull over, but the road didn&#39;t have a good place to pull off, and I figured that once I got around the trees I&#39;d get a better view of it and there would be a place to park  down the road.  But, when I got around the trees, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think the object was right above the lake, or the trees, I think it was off in the distance and it must have been pretty big.  Larger than a car or a semi-truck, but smaller than a blimp, I&#39;m sure.  I didn&#39;t see any lights, just the shape of it and the shiny reflection.  I thought I saw panels on it that were reflecting the sunlight.  From where I was driving south on Creve Coeur Mill Rd, it appeared to be close to Olive/Clarkson Rd, right around where the 141 construction is going on.  I&#39;m asking myself why a UFO would be in that area.  It would have had a view of the Missouri River bottom on one side and Hwy 40-141 on the other side.  There are many large electrical lines running through that area. Also, it would not have been too far to see the Chesterfield Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects were in a dispersed pattern with no apparent organization.  The only relationship the objects appeared to have was that they began disappearing at the same time.  The were fairly stationary, moving very little and after watching for approximately 8 minutes, 2-3 objects began to ascend into the sky.  The objects began fading after witnessing for 15 minutes and after 20 minutes they were no longer visible with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object Description: The objects were quite a distance away, perhaps about 10-15 miles away.  They appeared small, but again their exact size was hard to judge from such a distance.  They were very shiny almost appearing as aluminum foil floating in the air.  They were very brilliant as they were visible in the peak of daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: The weather was clear, and I do mean clear, I did not count a single cloud in the sky.  The temperature was approximately 87F, with the wind blowing less than 5 knots from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aerial Traffic: I witnessed multiple civilian aircraft going to and from ELP International flowing along their typical landing/departure pattern.  There was also an air show underway at Biggs Army Airfield, the air show was NOT visible from my home.  The craft in the sky were not parachutes, as they did not descend they remained stationary occasionally ascending higher into the sky.  They were also not aircraft flares as they did not descend.  Civilian transport aircraft even seemed to fly amongst the objects at one point to avoid the temporary flight restrictions over Biggs Army Air Field.<n>
10/23/11 12:15|Phoenix|AZ|||They moved through the sky and seemed to glimmer from the reflection of the sun as the made “falling moves with quick pivot positions”|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84739.html|183|ndxe201110| I was in my patio that faces west and sitting facing north, around 12:15 pm on October 23, 2011.  I was in conversation having a smoke when I noticed a white string of balloons floating across the sky towards the west.  The angle was about 35 degrees, distance not more than 2 miles in the sky (guessing), from my sitting position.  This was no big deal but as they floated the objects started falling out of formation in the sky, kind of like RC planes.  I’m staring at them trying to make out what they were.  The shape was hard to make out because there were no distinct edges or sharp lines to make out the object shapes.  They all were similar to a balloon and had flattened edges at the sides.  On the flattened edges, one side seemed to be thicker than the other.  They all were the same size and color, white with a dark bottom.  Then I start to see them move erratically, one at a time like dominoes, going downward and at different angles like in “flat Z” free f! all, some left to right and to and from me…2-3 others moved curving towards the ground and eastward.  They moved through the sky and seemed to glimmer from the reflection of the sun as the made “falling moves with quick pivot positions” (the “flat Z” free fall). The movement would be similar to a butterfly falling from the sky.  They all changed direction at the same time, came to a weird shaped “V”, moving northeast, and with a change of angle of about 5 degrees from the Earth’s surface.  They floated in the sky away from me, back in a straight line, and then formed a “V” pointed towards the north, and it did not seem to be parallel with the ground either.  The fascinating thing is as the objects were moving this entire time through the sky they still seemed to be “floating in the wind” when not moving erratically. They dropped down about 3 inches from my vantage point in the sky when completing the “V” and went behind a roof.  I was in shock and ran through the house, gra! bbed my cell phone on the couch (try and snap a picture), and ! ran out front door.  I went in the middle of the street and witness them still flying in the “V” formation, again not parallel to the ground, towards the north and then they completely disappeared!!  They were not high in the atmosphere nor did the duck behind a building.  They completely disappeared into the “big blue sky” without a trace. The objects were West of the Sky Harbor Airport in Central Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was drifting westwards from me towards the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects may not have been &#34;ufos&#34; but weather or atmospheric testing devices.

There was a lot of white gray cloud cover this morning.  There was a fairly loud, distinctive whooshing sound, I looked up into the northwest sky and saw two lights, two large, bright, white lights, traveling extremely fast in a circle, perfectly opposite each other, every one and a while crossing each others paths, but remaining in a circular motion – (the sound was not that of a helicopter or airplane and the speed the lights were traveling were extremely fast – and perfectly circular even when the every then and again the two lights would cross paths through the center, but while remaining in that circular formation)  I would have to say the size of the lights were very large, it would be hard to guess, as I was looking up from the ground but I would have to say at least the size of a house or school and the size of the circle would have to have been at lease the of a football field, but probably larger.  I stood there watching for at least four to five minutes, but had to go in to shower, when I went back outside the lights were gone (by 6:30a.m.).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were driving home on highway 50 in the western direction from a weekend trip. My husband and I both witnessed what seemed to be a large circular light hovering in the sky. It seemed to be stationary in the sky so we assumed it was something like a light pole. However, the closer we drove towards the light, the light literally zipped across the entire night sky away from us. It then zipped both up and down across the sky, all very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the night sky being fairly clear that night as I was able to see stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we reacted the California, MO exit (Highway 50 and Highway 87 crossing), there was a women in a van pulled over who was also watching the light. We do not know who this woman was but stopped to see if she needed any help. At this point, she explained to us that she too saw the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time that I have ever seen anything like this before and after a few days I was no longer thinking about that night until it happened again the next week.<n>

We have been followed and chased by triangle shaped ufos with a large white spot ookin like on front and two red blinking lights on the back two. at first we dismissed the idea but quickly realized we were wrong. we went to a pasture of a friends a week ago and saw yellow lights crisscrossing running our way then we hit the headlights and saw four large glowing eyes and the dark out lines of two very skinny large headed creatures. about 5&#39;5 in height with large gaping mouths. we got very frightened and left but came back the next few days and heard droning and humming sounds as well as grunts and otherworldly growls. as well as the yellow lights. then days a few days later we all realized we were bein followed by low flying triangular shapes with 2 blinking red lights on the back and a bright spot light on front. it follows us around in o! ur cars flying right about the tree tops very fast with no noise at all. wen we park they stop and watch and wen we leave so Do they. 5 of my friends including me have had them follow and hover outside our houses. As we sit they spin in a rotating motion hovering noiselessly. we are all frightened and this is no joke. we need answers asap...this is the real deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Immediately upon looking out the window we saw 2 glowing orange spheres traveling in a south/south east direction.  One of the UFOs was slightly above and to the right of the other. I ran outside and could still see the objects clearly, as did my friend.  At this point our two girlfriends were also looking out the window from the inside, seeing exactly the same thing.  After roughly 30 seconds the first, higher in the sky and to the right, object began to disappear. I would describe the disappearance of the UFO&#39;s as a very drastic fade.  The objects were extremely bright one moment, and once they began to fade, within 1-2 seconds the object was comletely gone.  Seconds after, the second disappeared. After 5 to 6 minutes two more crafts appeared from a more northerly positio! n.(UFOS 3 and 4) These UFOs were in the same formation. With one slightly above and to the right.  The bottom/left UFO disappeared after roughly 10 seconds, but the 4th UFO stayed glowing orange for a full minute.  This 4th UFO was traveling south and was clearly gradually rising in the sky.<n>

We&#39;re just about to put the tire back on when one says HEY COME HERE! I thought he was joking because he was so serious. I look up in the sky and it looked like 50-100 stars clustered together in a line. Not a specific formation or anything just a line of about 50-100 stars. They were no brighter or dimmer than any other star in the sky. I thought we were looking at some phenomenal constellation or something but stars just aren&#39;t that prevalent where we are. These stars moved at about the speed of far far far away airplane. They flickered (not flashed) but flickered like stars would. Then they floated or flew behind a tree about 3 minutes later. There were no dramatic movements of this formation just all going in one direction. I couldnt stop saying &#34;What the f*ck is that?&#34; If I had to conspiracy theorize about ufo&#39;s it looked like 50-100 ufos scouting just outside our atmosphe! re. Honestly the weirdest thing Ive ever seen in the sky. 3 of us saw it and I still honestly have no idea what it was we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were orange glowing objects all in same general area, almost in a line, moving across the sky.  We both had never seen anything like this in all our life.  We traveled to the top of the hill on Marzolf Road to get a better view.  There ended up being about 10 of them, maybe more.  They were all moving in the same direction (S-SE), coming from the same direction(N-NW), moving very quickly, making no noise.  There were no blinking lights on them. We attempted to get video on our cellphone, but of course, cellphones don&#39;t make the best cameras for night video recordings or nighttime pictures.  It was a very interesting sight.  I am sure there is an explanation for the sightings.  I don&#39;t know if maybe they were weather balloons, perhaps.  I&#39;ll probably hear of it on the news sometime soon.  I&#39;m sure! we weren&#39;t the only ones who saw these unusual objects.  Never saw anything like it, so I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we got closer, we noticed them slowly moving to the south or southwest.  As we passed the Fox Lake Metra station, I noticed someone had pulled over to watch.  There is a bar just past that on the left and that is where I believe Chinese lanterns were launched from because that is about where we passed under several of them.  They were probably around 50 to 75 feet in the air and looked like lanterns in the sky.   As we approached Wilson road, I noticed another car pulled over with 3 or 4 people watching.  It was pretty cool until we were underneath them and I was convinced they were nothing.<n>

It was as large as an aircraft but made no sound whatsoever.  At first I thought it was a glowing balloon or lantern (but more circular in shape), but it did not ascend and moved laterally instead.  My husband usually has an answer for everything, but not for this!!  I have noticed upon doing an on-line search that others witnessed a similar object in our area (10/18 in Munster, IN, as noted on the MUFON site; and 10/8 in Crown Point, IN on UFO&#39;s Northwest site).  We&#39;ve never believed in paranormal activity, including UFO&#39;s, but this was so unusual; would love more information!<n>

They were moving slower and at what seemed like a higher altitude than airplanes. We deduced this because several airplanes were in the sky at around the same time. Six of us saw the lights move in a general direction of west by southwest. The lights appeared to be in a triangular formation and several in front seemed to slow down for the remainder. The lights stopped moving and formed a generally straight line. Then, a few at a time, they began to dim down and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed immediately the lights where not coming from a plane, instead were three individual large glowing red crafts.

The lights where appearing from the west and moved east counter to the direction of the wind.  The night was clear and partly cloudy. I was with my fiancé at the time, now my wife, unfortunately she is visually impaired and was unable to see the phenomenon well, however the craft were hovering so low to the ground she was able to see the light from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to my home, I called the local police and was instructed to call the local air force base (177th air nation guard) and I left a detailed voice mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also instructed by a friend to call the UFO reporting center Hotline and left a voice mail there also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early the next morning I visited by two men in suits who claimed to be from the air force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took asked all about what happened, then strongly suggested that I keep quiet about my sighting.<n>

Just prior to turning onto our street, while heading east, we saw up in the night sky, a large number of bright pinkish glow lights, possibly with a pale light blue haze behind the pink glow.  Compared to what stars sizes appear to be, these looked ten times bigger.   Once on our street, we were headed south &amp; continued to observe them.  It was something that neither of us had seen before.  We pulled off of the road to the right to better observe them.  I got out of the car &amp; was looking at them, which would have been in the northwest sky.  At first, it looked as though they were stationary in the sky, but after a few moments, some appeared to be moving, but others weren’t.    I think the count was between seven and nine total from when we first saw them.  Each light I observed was separate from the others.  The distances b! etween them were different too.  They all appeared to be the same size, so I assume they were all the same distance from us. !  I’m not really able to know for sure, but they appeared to be at a 3000 foot elevation, maybe closer.  The sky was completely clear &amp; calm.  You could see the stars, no fog, no clouds, nothing.  No winds prevailing either.  I’m not confused over what I saw.   As I got back into the car, the lights seemed to leave our area of the sky that we’d been observing them in.  That’s when we lost track of them &amp; we came on home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the six years I’d been in the military (Air Force), specializing in radar &amp; weapons, I had dealt with a lot of anomalies &amp; false blips on our radar screen.  One of my assignments was with the Air Defense Command that later became the Aerospace Defense Command.   I’ve seen night flares, helicopters, airplanes, gunships, fireworks, hot air balloons, landing lights on aircraft, all in night skies, but these are totally different from what we saw last night &amp; different from anything I’ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/22/11 19:10|Madison Heights|VA|Sphere|5 minutes|Pink spheres hovering and moving near our home in Amherst County, VA|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84730.html|219|ndxe201110| pink spheres hovering and moving near our home in Amherst County, VA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening, October 22, 2011 around 7:10pm, in Amherst County, Virginia, my family was in the car coming home from dinner.  While heading east toward our home, I, my husband, &amp; our three year old daughter, saw what appeared to be large pinkish lights in the sky.  At first, I saw three &amp; thought it looked like what would be seen at the top of three towers, because they were stationary.  But, living here, I knew there were no towers in that direction.  Plus, the color was wrong &amp; the lights were too large to be on a tower.  Then, as I asked my husband what the lights were doing just hanging in the sky, he said one of them was moving.  Sure enough, one was beginning to move toward the northerly direction.  Then, we saw more coming from the south, moving slowly.  At that point, I turned onto our street, heading south.  My daughter, very into looking at the moon &amp; stars whenever we are out at night, asked, “What is that daddy?”   My husband told her he didn’t k! now.  Coming down our street, we saw three or four more coming from behind the tree line down our street.  One at a time, they came in a northwesterly direction &amp; we pulled off of the street into someone’s front yard so my husband could get out &amp; watch them as they went behind us.  Other cars were driving by in both directions.  We’re not sure if they saw them too, but no one else stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could have probably blown it off, but my husband has a military background, specifically Air Force, and he was unable to tell me what he thought they could be.  I knew they weren’t fireworks, or airplanes.  I’ve never seen anything with pink lights hovering or flying in the sky, especially lights that large.  They made no noise that we could hear, like if you heard a helicopter or airplane fly over.  They did not act like Chinese lanterns, which could be sent out into the sky, for traditional celebrations.  I talked my husband into getting back in the car, so we could drive another half a mile to our house.  We all got out, but didn’t see anything else.  Apparently, they had all passed over by the time my husband got back in the car to come home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the website for the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration to see what the surface winds were, according to the Lynchburg Regional Airport, &amp; it said calm.  We didn’t feel any winds when we all exited the car in our driveway either.  Once home, I asked my daughter what she had seen.  “Pink lights”, she said.  I asked her what they had been doing &amp; she replied, “Floating in the sky.”<n>

At first I thought it was just the lights on the power lines.  Then I saw one of the lights turn to a brighter orange and pick up speed and move at a fast pace across the sky off into the distance.  While the other ones were a paler orange and they remained in the same spot.  If they were moving it was not at a fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

In the sky, suddenly I heard a big bang, and as I looked up, at first I saw nothing. I really don&#39;t know how to describe what happend next.  A wave of relaxation sprung through my limbs and into my fingers. I could even fell the sting in my finger nails. It felt like when you fall asleep and accidently block the passage of blood to your arm, and a million ants start to crawl up the muscles, chewing away. As this happened, it was as if (and this part will sound most strange) me and this formation of people, suddenly felt the same thing. But not merely felt the relaxation, but felt instead  each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if there was a third arm infront of me, I would try to move it, but could not. Another bang interupted the flow and the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen appeared infront of me. I could not begin to explain it. I can hardly even remember the shape of it, as if my brain is unable to fathom it&#39;s form. I feel strange even typing this. There were five of these things, and they flew perhaps a 1000 feet above us , watching. Seconds later, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just looked at each other, as if in denial, looked at each other with this look that I&#39;ll never forget, as if we were discusted with the other persons behaviour. As if the moment it happened, we didn&#39;t believe it. That is why I write this so late. I hope that others do the same, so that the story goes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was between Boyce and Paris when I saw a dull gray colored oval object crossing Rt 50 a few miles ahead of me. It was hard to judge the altitude, but it wasn&#39;t very high...toolow for a plane.  I initially thought it might be a balloon of some sort, but it was moving too fast, was too small for a passenger balloon and too big for a small child&#39;s balloon.   I had my video camera with me and and initially was going to wait until I cleared a line of trees to get a better shot, but decided to get what I could from the car.  What I was able to catch is very short, but I was fortunate to get it.  It went behind the treeline and when I got past the trees about 30 seconds later, it was gone.<n>

I thought it was a star at first, and then I noticed it pulsating, and growing dim at some points then regaining brightness back.  As I grew closer too it driving I realized it was a craft of sometime I kept seeing it for a couple of miles then I drove under it as it was flying above the Interstate.  I looked up at it and saw an addition three landing lights on the bottom.  I would say it was flying under cloud cover and it was very clear morning.  I wanted to stop to take pictures of it, but  if I stop I would be running late for a meeting/audition in St. Louis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional info from interview: It was to my right.  Or the left side of the interstate.  I don’t think it was a large commercial airplane because St. Clair is about 30 miles or more from St. Louis, and I would think it would be higher up, plus the lights on the bottom don’t blink  When I drove under it seemed to be hovering, but I don’t if that is because I was driving under it and we were going in opposite directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t completely sure what I was looking at, and it was still pretty high up that it wouldn’t have turned out.  I also didn’t have my camera with me as they were forbidden at the Auditions.   It wasn’t lite up all bright when I went under it, it was dark with three lights on the bottom, one being red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rick Childers&#34; cityadmin@stclairmo.com  October 27, 2011 7:00AM To: &#34;&#39;BBecker&#39;&#34; &lt;ufomig@yahoo.com&gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good morning Ms. Becker, The St. Clair airport is a very small recreational airport with a 3200-foot runway.  We have no way at all to track take-offs and landings unless the pilots have filed a flight plan, and it’s my understanding that most don’t unless their flight is intended to be fairly long.  I’m not a pilot, but I’m told even the smallest jets can’t land at our airport.  Not sure if you got any indication of the size in your report, but if it was any larger than a small twin engine propeller-driven plane, it’s extremely doubtful that it came from the St. Clair airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rick Childers  End report<n>

It was a metallic chrome with hardly any sound, very slow and low to the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alright, so around 3:15am CST on (Oct. 22nd, 2011) In Wausau, WI.  I was laying in my bed facing northeast, when I noticed a very bright light behind my neighbors house (I thought it was them pulling out of their driveway with their brights on), but I didn&#39;t have my glasses on so I tried to find them so I could see it better.  Once I found them, it was now over my neighbor’s house, in a crop field behind their house.  Since these are my only two neighbors and I live in the country, no other cars were on the roads or fields or anything.  It seemed that the UFO was right in the field. The object had 3 bright &#34;headlights&#34; and 1 red light on the backside of it.  It was somewhat hard to tell the size and shape of it at this time. I then went to wake my mom up, so she could see it too.  I had to go lookout my kitchen window which faces northwest so I could see it and we could, since it was moving so slowly. We then decided to go in the car and try to follow it. We got i! nto the car, and got to the end of our street, which is about 50 yards.  We got to the end of our street and then I looked up in the sky and noticed it was way up in the sky now, about the normal height to fly an airplane. It was just sitting up there, not moving at all. (Impossible for a plane to do this, and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter) We decided to then turn off the car. And then all of a sudden it started coming toward us, very slowly. We stayed in the car until it was directly above us; I then stepped out to see if I could hear it. It was a silent, clear night, and even though the moon was full, it was still extremely bright.  The sound could only be heard when it was close to us.  It sounded like someone exhaling, not like a normal &#34;engine sound&#34;. Once it was past us, now going backward (to the southeast) and still at the same height in the sky. Also, another important note, is that when I first seen it, the headlights were in front, as if it was a car. But when it went of u! s in the opposite direction the 3 lights were now in back of i! t.  Since the moon was bright and it was so clear out, I could now see the shape of it and the color due to the reflection of the moon. It was a metallic silver and oval shaped. Its size would probably be close to if you would take two 727 planes and stuck them together and took the wings off, but then made it more oval shape and a little wider. After this we then watched it until it disappeared into the southeastern sky. All in all its pattern that it fly could not be a plane, or satellite. It didn&#39;t have any blinking lights under the wings (if it had them) which a plane is required to have. Also, a helicopter is not that quiet and wouldn&#39;t be flying like that. I think that&#39;s about it though, and that&#39;s my experience with a UFO. It all ended at 3:45am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I couldn&#39;t get any pictures or video. I tried to, but my phone isn&#39;t that good, and I don&#39;t have a good camera at my house.<n>
10/22/11 01:50|Waldenburg|AR|Triangle|5 mins|October 22nd, 2011, 1:50am Waldenburg, AR, on AR-14. Triangular UFO.|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84698.html|233|ndxe201110| October 22nd, 2011, 1:50am Waldenburg, AR, on AR-14. Triangular UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were passing through Waldenburg, Arkansas on our way to Little Rock. It was somewhere between 1:40 and 2am. Just a few hours ago. For the record: it is October 22nd, 2011. We were headed down AR-14 going toward US-67. It wasn’t long, after hitting Waldenburg, we saw it. We’d pass the closed liquor store and over the railroad tracks. We were just riding and talking with the cd player on low. If you’ve rode down AR-14 at night you notice the red lights on the towers. I’d noticed those because I was watching the road pretty closely to avoid deer and other animals that like to jump out in front of vehicles. We were passing one of the towers, when out of nowhere, just above us,  appeared this huge, dark, black, triangular shape, with three, eerie, and distinct red lights on each corner. I hit the breaks because it freaked me out. I yelled for my friend to look. We both leaned forward and looked up into the sky while still slowly driving at about 3! 0mph in amazement. As it passed over us, or rather we passed under it, I begged her to look out the back window and see if it was still there. I turned the music completely off to see if I could hear any engines. It was completely silent. It seemed to me that the craft was hovering, directly above us. It wasn’t much higher than the tops of the trees.  The lights flashed on and off but not in a specifically timed manner. For lack of better words they sort of dimmed up and down. Never completely off. Whatever was above us was a solid object because within the triangle the stars weren’t showing and all around the object the stars were visible. My first thought was, “Oh my god this is a UFO!!”. My second, was to stop and try to take a picture, but my friend was freaking out as much as I was. She talked me into staying in the car rolling up the windows, locking the doors, and flooring it until we hit the interstate. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about calling the police bu! t they’d think we were insane. We picked up our friend just ou! tside Li ttle Rock and headed back the same way we’d come. It was a few hours later, and feeling braver, we’d tried to figure out logical explanations. The object was gone by then. Whatever it was must’ve descended straight down because we hadn’t noticed it driving toward it. I don’t know of any craft that silent. At least not one that’s also able to descend straight downward so quickly. We tried recreating our first pass by but to no avail. I have no idea what I’d seen. We both agreed on what we saw. Even what it looked like. All I know is after seeing it I must’ve been driving 80-100mph the rest the way toward Little Rock. I was honestly disturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else had seen it. I&#39;m making an anonymous email address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up, and saw a whitish-cream orb followed by what appeared to be four military aircraft.  The craft were moving from my right to left, south to north, approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, not completely overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft following the orb looked to be military fighters, and one of the broke off, and was joined by three others. The three craft following the orb had to catch up when it turned right, and started heading east. The craft stayed on it, and we watched until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the orb and the three planes following it were out of sight, other airplanes appeared, flying in a grid pattern. Lost sight of the orb at 10:07 p.m., and the other craft were in the area another 15-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe it was Friday, October 21, 2001 between 10:00-11:00pm local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was scanning the sky, I kept thinking I was seeing something flash, but when I’d look in its direction, it would be gone.  Then, I finally zeroed in on the area catching my attention and saw what appeared to be a flashing stationary light about the same size as surrounding stars, almost directly overhead.  It would flash on and off in about half second cycles for maybe 5 or six times then disappear for approximately 7-10 seconds, before repeating the flashing cycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed this approximately 5-7 times before the last cycle became increasingly dim before it disappeared all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t recognize any of the constellations accept for Cassiopeia, which was approximately North-East, maybe North-North-East of where we were looking.  My first thought was maybe we were catching a reflection of a rotating part of a geo-synchronous satellite, but decided to report it just the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/21/11 22:00|Maricopa|AZ|Triangle|5 seconds|Triangle formation of lights followed by single light|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84742.html|239|ndxe201110| Triangle formation of lights followed by single light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us where standing out in the backyard at 10pm watching the sky for shooting stars. I looked up and saw what looked to be 3 points of light forming a perfect triangle in the sky about 50 degrees up from the horizon. The object was moving very fast, I yelled to the other two people by me to look and they also locked into it right away. As I first saw the object I stayed locked onto it and never took my eyes off it. Out of my peripheral vision I noticed a 2nd object dip down in the sky and then back up, it then followed the triangle formation on the exact line of flight in the sky. The 2nd object was only one light and about the same brightness as the triangle formation. It trailed the triangle by about 2 hand widths if you held your had out at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle consisted of a point of light in the front and flanked on each side by one light. The brightness of these objects was pretty much equal to your average star in the sky. I have witnessed and track satellites with computer software and have also seen the Navys NOSS Satellites pass over before and this was not that. Size of the triangle was equal in width to a penny held out at arms length. I know how fast satellites travel when the pass over and this was these objects were traveling 3 to 4 times that fast if not even faster. They covered about 35 percent of the sky in roughly 5 seconds or less. The sky was clear except for a one small cloud. The objects passed above this cloud and then faded out and we lost visual on them. Also as the triangle formation went across the sky in between the 3 points of light there was kind of a shimmer of very dull light for a brief second. No shape could be observed and as the object traveled through the sky it didn&#39;t pass in front ! of bright stars so I can&#39;t say if it would visually blocked out the star or if it would seemed transparent. That remains unknown. There was absolutely no sound from either objects even after they had passed from sight. We live in a small town out in the desert and its dead silent out here if was a jet of some sort we would have heard it. We also live in close proximity to the Barry Goldwater Bombing Range so we see our share of military jets pass over but they do not fly as fast as these objects where traveling. I have no idea if this something traveling in our atmosphere or if it was in space. Normal orbit speed in space is roughly 17,500mph and as I said this was 3 to 4 times as fast as that. If it was something in the atmosphere I would have to estimate the speed in excess of 2000mph, there was no sonic boom either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a amateur astronomer and I am also heavy into civilian and military  aviation photography. This was nothing like I have seen before. If I had to guess I would say it was some sort of military object that isn&#39;t known about yet? All 3 of us where at a loss for words as to what this could have been. I would really like to know if anyone else beside us saw this that night? All 3 of us were glued to the sky for another 1/2hr as we were amazed by this. Nothing more was seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/21/11 21:00|Monterey|CA|Chevron|10-15 seconds|Reverse wing craft moving very fast down the coast with no lights, noise, or contrail.|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84706.html|244|ndxe201110| Reverse wing craft moving very fast down the coast with no lights, noise, or contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of the event was approximately 2100 hours on Friday October 21 2011.  The writer of this report has 2 BS and 2 MS degrees and a military background.  The writer is also 40 years old and has never saw or reported a UFO event in the past.  This is my first real experience.  I do have a background in science so I do believe that there is other life in our vast universe but until this event I had never really given real credence to intelligent life being here on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening in Monterey, CA was very nice at around 60 degrees and very clear.  We were celebrating the birthday party of my 12 year old daughter and decided to take all the helium filled balloons outside and release them for good luck.  The whole party included 3 adults, including myself, and 12 children with the average age being 12.  We were all looking up and watching the balloons go up when I noticed the object streaking across the sky.  I pointed at it and said out loud “does everyone see that thing.”  We all did except for one of the little girls.  We followed it until it was gone and then we all were sort of dumbfounded as to what it was.  On any other evening we would not even have been looking up but because we were watching the balloons we just happened to be looking up at the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two other adults, one of which is my wife, were really sort of at a loss as to what to tell the children other than we did not know for sure what it was.  There were also some shooting stars and an actual airplane so we were able to judge that it was not anything conventional that we were aware of.  It was moving from north to south and because we are on the coast I believe that it was using the coast line to navigate in a southerly direction.  The speed was very vast coming in from north and only staying in view for approximately 15 seconds at an angle of about 120 degrees, almost horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked industrial or what I would say on earth as manufactured and not like a rock or some other type of object.  It had sort of an airplane shape but the wings were in the reverse chevron direction.  It had no sort of tail wins but there was a nose with a bit of a cone shape.  It was moving very fast with no sound at all.  There were no lights on the object so it was not a plane.  It sort of looked clear as if you could see through it but I believe that we were seeing the reflection of the city lights on the bottom of the craft.  At the same time there was a human airplane flying higher than the observed craft flying perpendicular to the UFO.  There were also several shooting stars so we were able to determine that it was not any of these things.  And because we had released the balloons for the party we could see depth to the space between us the balloons and the real airplane and the unidentified craft was sort of in the middle space flying across.  The speed ! was nothing I had ever seen in all my time in the military or observing other aircraft including military aircraft.  And it was also in an absolute straight line trajectory.  It was not threatening or anything like that but rather peaceful in its movement.  This experience has changed all that I believe about what is among us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not rule out the fact that this could have been some type of experimental aircraft.  I do live in an area that is in close enough proximity to military bases that work and do research on military operations that it is conceivable that it could have been an experiment.  That being said it is still out of my realm of understanding of physics and science to totally let this one go as the speed and lack of sound of the object did not fit into the conventional paradigm of conventional thinking on my part.  There was no streaking or any type of contrail and there were other examples in the background to go off of.  I have also observed satellites in the sky and this was larger than that and also moved faster.  It also did not seem to have any noticeable propulsion system as it trailed off.  We did not see any fire or thrust. This was definitely not anything that I have ever observed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone at length with this witness, and he seemed to us to be unusually eloquent and objective in his description of the object.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally good witness.  PD))<n>

Too many to count. I thought it was things going up a mountain but it was to the right of the mountain. Dont know when it started but I watched for about 5 minutes. It was a lot of little orange balls that were moving up toward the sky. They started low and you could watch them move upward and then fade away. They didnt all stop glowing at the same time. Some faded or disappeared much lower then others. Some went really high before fading away. They all just either faded away or stopping glowing. You could watching them moving, not all in a straight line. They were not moving fast or zig zagging from side to side. It was like they were slowly climbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is dark enough at this hour to see the stars clearly.  We are in the mountains and are away from light pollution.  Near 8 pm I was jogging back in an attempt to return home when I noticed a very bright red object in the sky. It was perfectly still at this point.  At first I thought to myself &#34;that is one odd star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the realization that that couldn&#39;t be a star hit me. It was far too low, blazing red, and brighter/larger than any star that I have ever seen. Just then the object moved down and went rushing off to the left behind some trees. It took me 5-8 seconds to run to the clearing. It had completely vanished. This was seen near the Deep Gap area.<n>

The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, much faster than jet aircraft.  The object was in the distance by several miles but very bright and behind the object was a silver trail.  The sky was dark, clear, no clouds or moon and stars were visible.  I observed the object for approximately 10 to 12 seconds as it traveled at a high rate of speed heading east and then it simply blinked and was gone.  I continued to observe the sky in all directions but never saw the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It began directly above me, and was out over the horizon with 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was nearing our driveway (around 19:25) when I saw the object above the tree line.  It was very large, red, and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I spotted the object I realized that it was exactly like what I had reported on 10/21.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was running the object rotated to it&#39;s right.  As it did so the color changed from red to orange and faded away before my very eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds.<n>
10/21/11 19:00|Pelham (Valleydale exit getting onto I-65 N)|AL|Circle|10-12 Minutes|Objects of light, with a tail falling from the sky, then stopping mid-fall and moving independently around the area unlike an aircraft.|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84686.html|253|ndxe201110| Objects of light, with a tail falling from the sky, then stopping mid-fall and moving independently around the area unlike an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the objects as I was driving towards the interstate.  At first there were 4 objects falling from the sky,  that looked most like fireworks.  Each object had a “tail” streaming behind just like a firework that had just exploded in the sky and falling back to Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to stare, it reminded me more of a comet, especially with the tail and because they were evenly spaced in the sky and falling at the same speed.  They looked more like concentrated balls of light than a firework explosion would.  The objects were higher in the sky but definitely at a very close range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, all at one time, the 4 objects stopped mid air (a short ways above the tree line). The “tail” behind them disappeared, and they were clearly circles of light floating, now not moving at all. Then they started moving side to side, up and down, in all directions. The movement was easy and fluid and when they moved the “tails” reappeared. I’m starring wide eyed, not knowing wha! t to make of what is actually happening, then it really got weird. The objects, together as if perfectly synchronized, moved to an aligned position. It wasn’t a straight line, but more like 3 in a line, then the 4th to the side, like it made a pattern. But the way they moved to this position was the strangest. Each object moved independently, but knew it was going to that particular spot. It reminded me of kids that file into a classroom with assigned seats. It’s as if you could tell they were communicating with each other. It wasn’t a star, and it definitely wasn’t any airplane of any kind. The movement of these objects, the quick speed the floating, the dynamics indicated that it in no way could be an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was getting on to the interstate, already in the turning lane, I couldn’t pull over to watch them. But as I drove onto the interstate, they were still there, floating close to the tree line. They were no longer in my line of vision, so there is no telling how long there were really there. My husband was in the car behind me, and saw the same exact thing. My mother was about 7 minutes ahead of me, going in the same direction, and she also saw the same situation. Above the objects in the sky was there was an actual plane. I’m not sure if they were watching the object. But it was there the entire time. I drove up I-459 North, and looking in the direction that I saw the objects (to the right side of the interstate), I thought I saw one of the objects again near the tree line, but I really can’t be sure of that. It was much more difficult to see from that side. There were however, a lot of planes in the sky. Planes that were not commercial airliners headed toward the airp! ort. But they seem to be staying around that same side of the interstate in the same area as the objects. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life, but I know it was definitely not a plane, not any sort of firework, it was not natural.<n>

The smaller light looked like that of the type you would see when a satellite would go over!They both flew over the Granton, WI area around 7:35 P.M. 10/21/2011.To me the brighter light looked more like a huge Asteroid with no sound of any entry being heard before it happened!  I also noticed a jet with one red light in follow in the sky in the same direction of the brighter light heading east!Don&#39;t know if the jet was part of the situation.  There was no way to tell how high or if they were out of the atmosphere or even if it was a UFO. If I could make a guess:  Maybe just out of the atmosphere, or it could have been a older satilite getting ready for entering and a landing.  The thing I did notice is when the smaller light passed under the brighter light, that brighter light acted as if it was hit..it started flickering like a light bulb going out, then just went out after a few minutes.Very different from  odd lights noticed before. So this can be reported as a odd incident to take notice for other possibilities also!Which I feel is just as important!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The time date stamp should be on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This video does not do justice to what we saw.  It’s was large!  Way bigger than a helicopter.  This shot is looking towards two Union Square from Capital Hill  It was stationary for about one minute.  There were five bright white lights in a circle around the object flashing in a type of rotation.  One stationery bright light directly under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute it swooped downward to the northwest disappeared behind a fog bank.  FREAKY!<n>
10/21/11 06:00|Northridge|CA|Triangle|10 Seconds|V shape dim orange "lights" moving fast and silent then faded into night sky|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84703.html|263|ndxe201110| V shape dim orange &#34;lights&#34; moving fast and silent then faded into night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK this is the second time I am posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Searched through your sighting database and found first posting of my sighting on 10/31/10 at 19:30 in Northridge, CA, posted on 11/21/10   I had described as “rounded “boomerang” shape of about seven or nine dark circles”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I was up early around 5 AM on morning of 10/21/11 so I grabbed a cup of coffee and went in backyard to watch the meteor shower from Halley’s debri.  Was an absolutely clear sky and I did see a couple good meteors and several weaker ones.  Also saw a couple satellites pass.  Was actually watching one of these when something else caught my eye.  At first is seemed like a very dim and tight cluster of stars, like looking momentarily at the little dipper.  And then I realized it was moving. It was a V shape with very dim “Burnt orange’” colored round objects, I can’t say lights, or globes, or even circles because I just couldn’t see that kind of detail.  It moved from the Northwest and to Southeast di! rection.  This time I really focused on it until it just got so faint it “disappeared”. Like last time it did not travel so far from sight that it just got so small or distant that I could no longer see it, it just kind of faded into the night sky.  By this I guess I mean the object was so dark and dim that it was hard to see in the first place, as it moved away it got dimmer and until it was no longer distinguishable from the dark of the sky. It was so quiet out I could hear the leaves rustling from a very light breeze.  This thing did not make a sound. Description: V shape, point of V was the “front” of the object, or at least pointing in the direction it was moving. The point was one of five orange “lights” for lack of better description, the left side of V was three more orange lights, right side was one more orange light, I assumed it could have been at an angle where more lights might have been on the right side I could not see. Totally estimating/guessing elevation of ! around 1000 feet? Speed again guessing 50 to 70 mph. Seemed to! glide o r float but pretty fast, and again dead quiet. Sighting location was the same as last time, Northridge, CA, just above the 118 Freeway, my backyard which is south facing. Seriously have no idea what this was, but it definitely seemed to me to be some sort of propelled object, not balloons, not a plane or helicopter.  Again no idea what it was, but this time I know I saw it.<n>

I am going to do it one more time. There is a very large, bright light that starts in the lower mid sky over Katy Texas. I see it by 9 pm every night for over a week. It is moving very slowly but by midnight it is directly over the roof of our house. By morning, it has moved behind our houses.  By 9:30, I can see two saucer shaped crafts in the distant sky. One is on the left of the bright light and the other on the right. Both have blinking white and some red lights. They are moving, floating, not sure what to call it, but all over the sky in that area. By 11 pm, the one on the left side has moved closer and lower in the sky. I can clearly see the shape and the lights by then. By midnight, the craft on the left is close enough to see that it is a saucer. It looks like it is floating side to side, lights blinking. The craft that is on the right is farther out but by 12am, it has moved closer in too. I ca! n see that it has the same shape as the one on the left. They both have blinking lights. While and red. I can clearly see the shape by midnight. I can see the bottom after midnight. Early in the morning, you can see that both crafts and they are very close to that bright light. I know this sounds crazy, but I have four neighbors that have seen it too. I can walk to my back door now, and see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/20/11 23:00|Plano|TX|Triangle|:30|V shaped objects, no lights, no sounds|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84672.html|266|ndxe201110| V shaped objects, no lights, no sounds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was exiting my car last night, Oct 20th, at approx. 11 pm when something caught the corner of my eye up in the sky. I looked up to see a V-shaped object that was silently gliding fairly slowly across the sky. It went out of my view so I changed locations only to see it make a large circle and then head back north. It was in sight for approximately 30 seconds then moved out of view completely and about that time a smaller object of the same shape and opacity shot from the south heading north behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it looked like a flock of birds then realized that it was too perfect and when it circled around I got a better view. There were no lights and no sound. The objects were almost transparent, foggy kind of like a cloud but in a V shape and glided very eloquently and smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything other than normal meteorites in the night sky. I was very excited yet perplexed. I do feel validated though when I read on the Examiner that there was another sighting extremely similar just a few miles away from me and only 30 minutes prior to my sighting last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was needless to say surprized!! becouse these sighting all in the same place, about 10 min! drive from here there is a army base close the site, and there is a radar tower there as well that is usually very lit up that was pretty dark when the event happened im thinkng they caught it on radar and there is alot of cattle in the area as well im not sure whats going on there but these sightings have been going on for about 10 years now but yea?! we sure need someonne to talk to about this. thanks!! Oh yeah I tryed to take a pic and video of it with my cell and all of the pic and video that I took of it came out blank strange dont know what to make of it??<n>

They were following each other and then turned due east. Suddenly the first blinked out and the other two did the same. About the time the first three blinked out, two more appeared in the same location the first came from, now the count is five. The fourth and fifth were following the same route as the first three and they turned at the exact same location as the first, how do I know that? It was at the upper point of Andromeda. The last of the five was the most spectacular, it had the same bright yellow light as the first four but this light was suspended below the object and illuminated the craft above it. The craft above this light was round and it was huge, all I could see was the very bottom of the craft and it was light up by the light {same as the first four} directly below it...excuse this, but I had to laugh when I realized what I was hearing was myself saying.! ..WTF,WTF over and over again..it made me laugh...at me!<n>

I noticed a bright white/yellow light near the Armada Hoffler building.  As I pointed it out to my cousin it started to sway back and fourth.  The light then moved very fast, bouncing across the sky.  It would slow down and the light would get dimmer and sometimes it would go completely out.  When it was out I could still make out an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time it came back on, three lights came on and we could see it was actually a triangle.  It hovered for a few seconds and then shot off out of site. We were sitting in a car with the windows down and engine off and were not able to hear it make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin wanted to get it on his camera phone, but I was so frightened I wouldn&#39;t let him.  This lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes over an area with hundreds of people.  When the person we were waiting for at the apartment came out, we told him we had just seen a ufo and he said he had seen a triangle hovering near his apartment several nights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived near Oceana Naval Air Station all my life and have never seen anything like this.

This object was motionless for most of the time, but would occasionally begin vibrating or wobbling intensely.  We also noticed that intensely focused beams of light would shoot out from different positions and for varying distances.  Since I have never before seen an unidentified flying object I alerted the other guests to witness what I was seeing, which they all did and I asked each of them to write their names and contact information down.  My friend used his digital camera to take several photos, which I can send you, although the pictures are not as detailed as what we saw. One of the witnesses had a contact in the Colombian military, but just as he was calling to file a report the object darted off at a fantastic rate of speed.  Although I have no proof, I had the impression that this ship was collecting information.  I know this was not a conventional aircraft nor was it a figment of my imagination since there were multiple individuals who saw the same exact thing, as did I.  I also know that it was not a planet since the lights of Cali obstruct the possibility of seeing any stars or planets.<n>

It was thanksgiving weenkend of 2011, we had spent many hours driving with many pictures taken (to many in my opinion.) but my wife wanted to cherish the memories, this particular sighting wasn&#39;t seen until we had returned home. when my wife was going through the 100&#39;s of pictures taken. this picture was one of a few on top of the banff chair lift, in the background there is an object approximately the size of a fully grown spruce tree, which looks to be flying behind or from behind the mountain. the image seen is blurry but all other images are clear a day, even the smallest tree seen on the next mountain west of banff was clear, this image wasn&#39;t seen by me neither by my wife, i imagine it moved at such a velocity that even the people around us had no clue. this image has astonished my wife and i as well as every person i show. Also worth mentioning is this a national park which has a no fly zone, if it was a helicopter it would be for search and rescue, or for blasting for avalanches.  (Again this was thanksgiving and avalanche season was not even close) i don&#39;t recall seeing any such aircraft&#39;s.i don&#39;t quite know how to explain what i seen besides posting the picture which i will do.<n>

I pondered the idea of going outside on the back porch to admire the beautiful stars.  No moon present.  I spotted an object moving across the western sky in a straight line.  It stopped for eight seconds and then pivoted downward.  Then it moved in a circular path.  It completed about 80% of the circular move and then stopped again for about ten seconds.  The spacecraft then illuminated itself very brightly.  It shot out a white laser beam light which then created a huge circular bright white energy field located in front of the craft.  The craft then got larger and brighter as if powering up.  Then it flew straight into the energy field and disappeared.  Another eight seconds and the energy field started to shrink in size until it disappeared.<n>

Neither of us consumed alcohol or any other perception-changing substance in the evening. As I crossed the field near my house I lit a cigarette, and some distance away saw about four other people in the school below who were drinking. I stayed on the field for a while, then noticed above me a glowing object with an unclear shape. The light of the cigarette was distracting so I put it out. The glowing thing was a dull green and just hung in the air, far above me. It was not unmoving however, as it seemed to be slightly blurry, making its exact form difficult to make out. But it was not travelling in any direction. After about a minute a red line came from the object. It was also glowing and was much brighter than the main body of the thing. At this point the people below at the school left. I believe they saw the object though can&#39;t be certain. The glowing red line cast a light on the green object and I could now see ! that it was quite cloud like and slightly transperant. It had no exact shape and appeared more like a floating blob. I was reminded of an amoeba. At this point I noticed, though with much difficulty, many tiny lights cluster around the red line, which were very small and hard to see. I watched this for a few more minutes. The red line did not go back into the main body as the object went away. It is hard to say how exactly it left as it left behind a &#34;stain&#34; like after image in my vision from staring at its light so long. This made it hard to tell where it had gone and how it had departed. For a short while after it had gone I noticed a quiet ringing in my ears, but am unsure whether the thing was the cause. I went home and went to bed, thoroughly mystified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I seen airplanes flying back and forth across the sky with stars in the back ground and then i seen what i thought was a fallen star it look just like a normal star in the sky it began to descend toward earth like a normal falling star i was getting ready to make a wish like we always done since we where kids and all of a sudden it stopped and shot up in to space in a flash of light i thought that wasn&#39;t no airplane  and I&#39;ve never seen a falling star reverse itself and go back up into space.  I ran inside told my wife and kids what had just happen and then i called my daughter in austin Tx what i had just saw.

My husband is currently aircrew in the US Air Force. We both have exceptional vision, and are trained observers of areal phenomena…  For the last few months, we have observed multiple orange orbs maneuvering over, what we think is the Pontiac area of Michigan. The orbs move back in fourth in the sky, and periodically dim to black. Sometimes they flash between white and red, or vanish instantly. These orbs are extremely bright. We began noticing them regularly, over the past month. We first started seeing them periodically, back in July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 9th (approximate date), four of these orange orbs moved directly over our house at about 1,000 ft. They moved slowly and silently. Three stayed in a triangle formation, while the fourth flew behind, varying its direction, just below the others. After moving above us, they slowly dimmed, and appeared as black spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been watching for them nightly, and we are able to see them between 3-5 nights out of the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only have a few good pictures, as we don’t have a camera able to take good night photos, and lately, we’ve been seeing them much farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has made every effort to debunk these objects as celestial phenomena, however, he cannot do so.  A few nights ago, we witnessed these objects in their usual place, moving back and fourth in the southern sky, just above the horizon.  When my husband went to work at 5am Saturday morning, he saw them maneuvering in various formations in the distance. He watched them until they were obscured by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects are not leaving the area.  Someone with the resources needs to investigate this further. I have never heard of UFOs hovering over an area for such a prolonged time.  So far, we have had up to 7 witnesses to this phenomena at a single time, all of whom I believe, are willing to discuss the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects are extremely brilliant; just as bright as Jupiter appears in the sky, if not brighter.  They are not stars or planets, and they are not any recognizable aircraft.<n>
10/19/11 20:37|Maricopa|AZ|Other|10 seconds|Boomerang aircraft 15-20 white lights on leading edge Maricopa Arizona|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84656.html|299|ndxe201110| Boomerang aircraft 15-20 white lights on leading edge Maricopa Arizona<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off let me say I am 46 years old and have served in the Navy back in the 80&#39;s ad 90&#39;s as an F-14 mechanic. I have been exposed to just about every type of military aircraft and their general capabilities. I am also a Cessna private pilot. With that being said what I observed tonight while sitting on my back patio went against every type of known aircraft I have been exposed to including any on TV.This occurred in the City of Maricopa in Pinal County Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2037 hours (8:37PM) I was smoking a cigarette on my back patio sitting in my chair facing directly North. Out of the corner of my right eye I caught a movement and turned my head to the right and saw what initially appeared to me to be a flock of birds glowing pure white flying due West. About 2 seconds after my initial observation I thought to myself wait a minute, its nighttime and birds don&#39;t glow in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized what I was observing was some sort of aircraft that was in the shape of a boomerang that had on the front leading edges of the aircraft approximatley 15-20 white lights from wing tip to wing tip including the center. At that time it was now directly in front of me traveling in a due westerl course following highway 347 almost to the center of my town. I live in a small town. I estimate based on my military and private pilot experience it was traveling around 500 knots. It passed to my left and I was not able to observe any red or green anti-collision lights or the required white tail light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my experience I knew a military type aircraft flying at this speed would have some tailtale sign of emmission from the tailpipes and none was observed. I was approximately 1/4 to no more then 1/2 mile from this object that appeared to be the size of a standard size house I estimate its altitude to have been around 1,000-1,500 feet. It made zero sound. When it was in my center field of vision I could see clearly it was a boomerang shaped aircraft that had a very dark skin color that caused it to contrast with the night sky and allow its shape to be easily seen as it flew by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft traveled for another 4-5 seconds and then made a very abrubt course change to a due north course from its easterly course. This course change caused me at that time to lose any sight of the aircraft. It appeared to follow the Union Pacific Railroad line going north and then west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my sister inlaw who lives about a 1/4 mile to my northwest as it appeared to have changed course right over her house and asked her if she was outside smoking and did she see any object fly by. She stated she was outside at that time but did not see or hear any aircraft. She was under her patio cover so if it went over her house she would not have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called Luke Airforce base 556th Fighter Squadron and inquired as to whether they were currently conducting any night time operations in this area or the Barry Goldwater range about 40 miles southwest of me and the duty officer stated no, they were not currently conducting any operations in our area. Note: we sometimes see Lukes F-16 fly over us on there way to the range but it is always in the day time and not at night. I gave the duty officer a brief of what I observed and he entered it into his duty log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my local police dispatch and inquired if anybody including any of the on duty patrol officers had reported any unidentified aircraft flying over town at a low altitude in the last 15 minutes and she responded that they have not received any other reports at that time. I gave her a quick brief of my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Closing comments: I have never seen an unidentified flying object before and this is the first time I have ever made a report on one to anybody. I was not drinking and I am of sound mind. I have usually laughed about other people alleged sightings including one my brother and mother reported to me awhile back. What I saw tonight was not anything I have ever seen before and the flight capabilities were not of anything I have seen in my F-14 experience or in other military jet aircraft I have been exposed to. Its ability to make such an abrubt course change defies newton law of an object in motion stays in motion. We currently don&#39;t have any known advance technology to effect that sort of abrupt course change. If this was infact a secret military test aircraft then I would say we have advanced significantly in our technology and have somehow been able to develope structual technology that is able to resist high G-force levels both positive and negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What disproves this theory to me is it takes a lot of energy to make such a turn and it requires extremely strong flight controls to force such an abrupt course change and that would have caused the aircraft to emit some level of noise and this aircraft was extremely quite. It would have caused a significant amount of stress on the airframe and on the flightcrew.<n>

It is very bright. I thought it was a satelite or something but it comes up every night.  About 9:30 when you look up at the sky to the left, you can see blinking lights.  Sometimes they look red. When you look straight out over the garage to the right, you see a second one doing the same thing. It is much further out though but still you can see it. Over the course of 3 hours until after midnight the &#39;bright&#39; satelite looking light moves up and by midnight, it is directly above my back door.  As that light moves up, the light on the left moves up and comes closer so you can see that it.  The one up in the right side you can see it but not as profoundly as the left side. Last night I was able to see that it looked like a saucer, it has lights around it so you can see the shape. It seems to be spinning and moving side to side but it stays in only these areas. In other words, it does the absolutely same thing each evening.  I have been watching this now for two weeks. I can see that is is a saucer with lights.  Last night an airplace flew across the sky and went over it. The &#39;saucer&#39; dimmed its lights to almost zero.  After the aircraft move away, the lights came back up. There are two crafts here.  There is no doubt.  My mother, and neighbor have both been here and seen it. I do not understand why this is not being investigated by our government. There is absolutely something over Katy Texas. It comes back each evening and does the same thing. As the bright star moves up, these two saucers come in closer. Last night I could literally see the shape and lights. My neighbor has taken photos of it and there are hieroglaplics that look like a #3. This may be our technology. I suspect it could be because it seems to do the same and stay on the same track every single evening.<n>

Upon turning from an intersection onto a straight away that led to my house, I saw a bright light up in the sky. I was confused as to what it was so I kept my eyes on it. As I was driving towards it, I realized that it was also coming towards me at a very slight slant. It started out as high as a plane might be, but I noticed it was coming closer than I first thought. I kept driving and the light was dimming slowly to where I could see that it had two blinking lights. One red light at the front and one green light on the back so I thought that it was just a plane. Problem was that it was too low, much smaller than an average plane and it wasn&#39;t making noise. When our paths met, it was a few hundred feet above my car and the bright light was gone making the shape of it evident: a disk. It hovered over, past my car and that&#39;s when I pulled over to freak out and try to process what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the road in front of me for a second then turned my head to follow where it was going. I made a quick u-turn and pulled over on the other side of the street to watch it glide over the neighborhoods and that&#39;s when I decided to follow it, but it went over an area of trees with no road. After about five minutes of driving towards it, it was no longer in sight and I decided I needed to go back home to do some research on UFOs.<n>

I took one more loop around a traffic circle, which meant that I would now have to take a right to progress up the hill on which I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came to the stop sign I notice 3 distinct lights flashing.  These lights were in a straight line and appeared about 150 to 350 feet off the ground.  I saw in what appeared to be a straight line of 3 lights of equal spacing at a distance or roughly 75 to 100 feet apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two outer lights matched, meaning they were two pulsating lights, one  was orange the other red. The middle light however remained constant and was orange.  This linear shaped object turned to the right and progressed up the hill appearing to ascend slightly on the way up the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the object and took a right to begin my ascend on my motorcycle I thought to ask the man walking his dog if he saw the object, as he appeared to be looking up in that direction.  I also, thought to pull over and take a photo but my phone was in my bag and I was fearful I would lose the object as it continued to ascend up the hillside and over the wood line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed behind this object for perhaps a quarter mile at a speed of 26mph.  My first thought was that it was 3 helicopters flying in a tight formation.  Then I noticed that the middle light was different and that the object  seemed to turn with the middle light being the center point or axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  have seen and jumped out of C130&#39;s from 300 feet.  And this was much larger. I could not make out the object, in terms shape, but it appeared like a large looming dark silhouette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan on asking the guy who was walking the dog if or what he saw   Given the size and time, I could not be the only person who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally lost the object behind some trees.  When I came to  the clearing I could not tell which way the object was going.  Very interesting and odd, I know I saw something because I could not focus on the road nor my motorcycle.  I stared at these lights until I lost them in the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally well-spoken and objective.

It was raining slightly and I noticed what looked like the moon trying to peer through the clouds.  As I drove towards the Dresden Nuclear Station it became apparent that this was not the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be a blimp traveling west and it was ahead of me and to the left.  I noticed the “blimp” had a greenish – blue glow around the bottom, a metallic whitish gray just above that and a white glowing dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned left on North Dresden Rd. The “blimp” was now on my right and we were on a path to intersect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange lighting had my attention and I began questioning whether it really was a blimp. I drove on, keeping an eye on it out of my passenger window.  The closer I got, the surer I was that this was no blimp…it was no helicopter… and it was not an airplane!   It was moving slowly across the sky and looked to be within a few hundred feet of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept asking myself- “what the hell is that?” out loud…  I could clearly see it now. It was only about 300 yards away, but it was now going to pass behind me.  I stopped and rolled the window down to get a good look- I saw a somewhat domed top and a flat bottom.  It made no sound as it passed within a hundred yards of my car.  I would guess it to have been at least 100 feet across, maybe bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it floated/glided over the road and across the fields on my left. For over a minute I sat and watched, but I had to get in to work so I drove on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still watching this object out the window I pulled up to the Security Checkpoint (it had passed within ½ mile of the plant).  I asked the guard if he knew of any blimps that may be flying in the area and he said no…I then pointed out the object to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The look on his face was enough for me- but he maintained his professional composure and jokingly said…”huh, may be a weather balloon!”  After I parked my car I began walking into the plant, still watching this thing in the distance now. I asked a co-worker if he had seen anything in the sky. He told me he really hadn’t looked up so I pointed to the object and it got his attention too. We watched it until it disappeared behind the steam of the cooling towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next day or so I found 2 other co-workers who witnessed this event.<n>

My son and I were heading home from taking care of our horse.  As I was driving, I observed Jupiter in the sky to the front right of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded a curve in the road, I noticed a extremely bright blue light thru the tree tops to my left.  I have driven down this road countless times in the past year and I knew that light wasn&#39;t there before.  I said to my son&#34; what is that blue light over there, do you see it?&#34;  He replied &#34;ya, I see it.  I don&#39;t know what it is.&#39;&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then came to a point in the road where we could pull on a side street.  We sat there for a minute and watched in wonder.  This bright object was moving from side to side, even doing a &#34;figure eight&#34;. I drove a little further down the street to get closer to it.  We sat and watched it for another minute, then it just blinked out.  Gone.  And before I could say anything, it was back, bright as ever, just in a different spot.  I&#39;m sure this was the same object we had been watching. To me, the shape was oval, but there was a time or two when it moved it almost seems to get longer.  We had the windows in the car down,there was not any noise that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, so I really wanted the validation of another person.  I tried to flag a car down, they wouldn&#39;t stop.  Cant say I blame them, but that didn&#39;t stop me from flagging another car down.  He did stop. I said &#34;thanks for stopping, and i know this is going to sound crazy, but do you see that blue light up there?&#34; as i pointed to it.  He looked and said &#34;yes&#34;. I said &#34;don&#39;t you think that it looks weird, the way its moving?&#34;  I believe his reply was &#34;  I think its a police helicopter&#34;.   Um.... Are you kidding me? My father is a pilot, fixed wing and helicopter.  I grew up in a plane. I&#39;m pretty confident I could figure that out myself if that was the fact.  The guy was still watching the object and then he says &#34;maybe it a searchlight, ya know, like when a new place opens and they want to draw attention&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, Im pretty sure those lights just don&#39;t stop and make a oval in the sky.  There was no ceiling....no clouds. Nothing for the light to bounce off .  Disappointed that the guy wa! s not as amazed as we were, I told him thank you for stopping, and he drove off.  I hope he got down the street and looked up at it one more time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rushed home to get the camera, but of coarse, it was gone when we returned.  I even dragged my grumpy husband out of the house to go driving around to look for it.  Im bringing my camera with me from now on.<n>

The object was much larger than a star, was very bright and had no color and had no tail like a comet. It did not move as fast as a shooting star.  I observed the object at about a 60 degree angle moving in a SSE direction. Due to large tree I could only see the object for 1 or 2 seconds.<n>

I&#39;ve always been one to check out the night sky looking for meteors, satellites, planets, etc. But, I&#39;ve never seen what I saw this morning in over 40 years of sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a bright light moving from the NorthEast to the South, below the moon which was directly overhead. The path was not low, but not high in the night sky, about the level of Orion&#39;s belt to the right of the moon. I originally thought it was a satellite that had caught the morning sun not yet above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the bright light became fainter, almost disappearing, but the object was still visible on it&#39;s path. Then, the object became really bright again, then fainter, then bright, then faint before disappearing totally.  The speed of the object as it moved across the sky was similar to a satellite - not fast, but steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no jet noise, that I would have heard if this was an airplane of some kind.  Jets fly overhead all the time and usually there is some level of noise even at the highest altitudes, especially during the quiet morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what I saw, but there was something unusual in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW - there were no clouds - not even wispy ones - in the sky for the object to &#34;hide&#34; behind this morning.<n>

We went outside to have a cigarette.  As we were talking we noticed to the south of use four pulsing lights in the sky.  Two of the craft seem to try to get our attention by doing semicircles with one another, well it worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts stayed in the same position for several minutes.  These crafts moved at amazing speeds as they widened their gap between one another to for a straight line across the night sky.  After a few minutes the craft to our far left took off sideways heading southeast as the second one appeared to head out of the Earth’s atmosphere, and the other two disappeared downwards below the tree line, so we did not get to see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after they were all out of view there was the sound of a high flying jet.  This I know because my job in the military was working with military aircrafts.  There were not lights for this craft and the direction of its sound could not be determined, and it was not the sound of a civilian jet.  I have heard this sound before.  I could only speculate that it was stealth in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have not thought anything about it, but for its timing after the foreign craft left.  The jet made may passes over the area before it could not be heard again.  The funny thing is that in that area there is normally civilian air traffic; however, there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one other thing to add.  The night before, around the same time, I was getting up to use the restroom and have a cigarette like I normally do.  I tried to sit up out of bed, but there seemed to be a force that would not allow me to.  There was chatter all around me.  I tried to look left and right, but could not seem to focus on any given direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it appeared I was no longer in my bed, but hovering in the doorway to my room.  Another force pulled me forward.  It made me feel uneasy.  I could feel whatever was controlling me felt my unrest.  I was suspended in the doorway for an unknown period of time.  The next second I was on my bed on my back looking up at the ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ceiling started to glow a bluish white light, or that there may have been a light behind it.  Right above me was a symbol of a blue cross inside of a rectangle that was pressing itself through the ceiling as though it was a type of branding tool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I remember was my alarm going off at seven thirty in the morning, and I was no longer on my back, but on my stomach faced down on my pillow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what this experience was about, and nothing like this has ever happened to me, but I have known all my life that I was not alone, and that I was meant for something.  I hope this helps figure out what is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I immediately looked up and saw this bright light at first I thought it was moving very very fast across the night sky, however it then seemed to change direction and appeared like it was either falling or crashing.  BY bright I mean it looked like it was on the horizon but was almost ¾ the size of the moon.  The other witness seems to think that the top part when it was crashing also changed colors from green to red to white.  Instead of crashing though it appeared to just disappear.  It was a inch or two in our line of sight between where it just went off above the tree line.  No fading, landing, or going into the tree line just stopped and went out before the it hit the tree line (might have paused or floated before disappearing it all happened so fast).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the next couple of turns in the highway just outside of her house their where at least 8 orangeish to bluish lights just floating over the direction of Campoint Il.  I myself have been coming over and leaving her house for over four years and never saw these lights before.  These where much smaller and more spherical shaped than the other thing we saw.  When I asked if she knew what these lights where she said she never saw the pinkish/bluish lights before and immediately noted that they where higher up than the radio tower lights which some where next to or possibly floating over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also when noticing the first UFO of Unidentified Crashing Object the lights on the Bright and dim lights on the car started to flicker on and off while the regular lights kind of did a reboot type thing where they went off and came right back on like nothing ever happened.  This all took place on Highway 9 between Adams and Pike county on a fairly dark night for the moon being so bright (the moon did seem rather close and large though too).  We for the most part where looking at it driving going downhill and to the west of the first object and to the east of the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

What was noticeable were three large orange orbs of light in a triangle formation, the orbs seemed to be connected to a much larger object that could have been about .25 to .5 miles long.  It seemed that these orang orbs were connected to a much larger object due to the way they maneuvered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that the large triangular object was hovering and rotating in the same location, and then very slowly moved behind a tall building, which was in the line of sight of the witness, and disappeared.  While this occurred both an airplane and a helicopter flew by, both being much closer than the object, and each orb was significantly larger than either the airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is a recent college graduate, with a degree in psychology (which trains people in proper observation and recording techniques).  Observer also is not 100% sure this was an extraterrestrial vehicle, however believes it very well could have been one.  Observer also managed to obtain both photographs and video footage of the object.<n>
10/17/11 23:00|West Walworth|NY|Unknown|15 seconds|Very large aircraft with lights as bright as the sun hovered near West Walworth New York|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84600.html|326|ndxe201110| Very large aircraft with lights as bright as the sun hovered near West Walworth New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very large craft with very bright lights descended very fast over Kutruff Hill near the hamlet of West Walworth.  Although it was nearly the middle of the night, the lights lit up the neighborhood as if it was mid-day.  These were not meteors emitting a quick burst of light, they seemed to hover, nearly motionless, for about 15 or 20 seconds. I could see my shadow on the ground.  There was absolutely no sound as the lights appeared, and the craft took off at an astonishing rate of speed. Almost immediately, our property, which spans many acres, was inundated with very loud aircraft, all without any lights.  I have been to NASCAR events and the way these aircraft were flying over my home would best be compared to the &#39;flyover&#39; at the beginning of every race, except they went over our property multiple times.  We live within 20 miles of an international airport, so I am not unfamiliar with many types of aircraft flying over our property, everything from homemade on! e-man contraptions to huge commercial airliners.  This object moved in a manner I have never seen any identifiable aircraft move with lights as bright as the mid-day sun, which in and of itself was puzzling to me, but when it was followed by the roaring sounds of what appeared to be jets flying without any lights, it really drew my attention.  I have lived in the area for over 25 years and have never seen a UFO here during that time.  But I did live in the Hudson Valley region of New York State and witnessed several mass sightings in that area, some of which made headlines in local newspapers and television. This object was not as big as those I saw decades ago, but I would estimate it was at least three times the size of a 747.<n>

It lasted around 8 seconds, then just went out like someone turned a light switch off.   Very weird.  I wish I had my camera.  I was the only car on that road within a mile.<n>

Bolth were of a triangular black craft with approximately 6 pulsating, flashing lights. The object hovered silently and gently moved through the sky at around 5 miles an hour to possible even slower. I was about 200 ft away from the craft at one point and managed to take 1 photo and one short video that did not come out clear but perhaps with some photo cleaning I can get a clearer view. On the same night of 10/17/11, I seen a faint light way over head that Seemed to be a satellite. All of sudden the object became extremely bright and maneuvered a zig zag pattern at astounding speed. please note that this event happened 1hr prior to sighting of the triangle.<n>
10/17/11 21:30|Temple|TX|Triangle|about 5 seconds|I saw a triangular shaped "object"|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84594.html|330|ndxe201110| I saw a triangular shaped &#34;object&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in a dark unlit open area (golf course) about half of a mile wide with star-gazing class of about 18 people, this just happened about 40 minutes ago.  I was looking into the southern sky and I noticed above my head, to the left of my periphery I saw a triangular shaped object that was semi-transparent and was definitely a solid shape and maintained its proportions and there is no way it could have been anything other that some kind of flying vessel! moving at a slow speed (for a flying vehicular) directly in the direction that I was facing and I saw it with eyes locked to it for a good 5 to 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My teacher was talking about a constellation and when I saw the object I pointed at it immediately and &#34;said what is that&#34;, I kept saying it and the guy next to me saw it too and was excited about it, my girlfriend was standing next to me and saw it as well, I was so excited that I interrupted my teacher in the middle of him speaking!   The object which was semi transparent had a whitish-grayish turbulence looking feature across the face of its surface.  This surface seemed to move but I believe that I was seeing like a distortions of the stars above the object as it passed underneath them. There were absolutely no clouds in the sky that were visible and it was actually kinda light out . There is no way this was any kind of light reflecting on clouds or anything like a light beam. The object seems to kind of reflect light but did not give off or have any lights that I could see.  Also this smokey &#34;turbulence&#34; surface (that seemed to be moving) had a greenish kind of tint to it or at least that is how the image in my memory is fixed.  The object did not do anything except silently flew forward until at a certain point even though I was looking right at it, it kind of just disappeared before my eyes.  I could only see the bottom when the face of it was kinda parallel with my view, when it got further in front of me i couldn&#39;t see it like the kinda no-outlined-distorted triangle with kind of a glassy looking distortion like in the movie predator literally!  I know that may be a cliche but it honestly looked exactly like that to me.  I have never seen any kind of U.F.O. before this event tonight and although I have considered that aliens probably do exists somewhere out there I didn&#39;t think I would ever see something like this unless this and much less be writing all this about it online!   Also this thing had sort of features on it like extruding out of it but I don&#39;t know if it was the kind of cloaking distortion thing or what but there were definitely some kind of features, it wasn&#39;t flat looking. In other words I saw this thing in perspective from almost directly underneath at a 10 degree-ish lean to my right, and then this object flew towards almost the center of my perspective view, it seemed like it was less than a thousand feet in the air, honestly it looked like it was just a few hundred feet overhead, but no sound at all no engines, no fires, no lights, nothing.  I  am estimating (roughly) that this U.F.O was about only a few football fields in front of me when I lost sight of it completely, it couldn&#39;t have been that far because the object when compared to the size of my hand (average size) when I held my hand outstretched completely to point at it, the object when directly overhead was larger than my hand although dimly visible and when it was in fro! nt of my view about 30 degrees up (star class remember) it was smaller in comparison than my hand but became more brightly visible I think maybe because of the city lights in the low background, it seemed to somehow kind of reflect the light around it.  I don&#39;t know if this helps anyone or if anyone has seen something similar, it is very weird for me to have seen literally what looked like the predator cloaking device type of Klingon bird of prey from star-trek as it de-cloaks looking stuff but I don&#39;t really have anything to compare it to as it did look rather like those types of effects to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember the sky was completely cloudless and this could not have been a lighting effect as the object clearly maintained it&#39;s shape and proportions and moved at a consistent pace until it was not visible. I don&#39;t really know what else to put I didn&#39;t see anything else really the whole night and this was definitely not a plane as I had seen at least 10 planes fly over and they all had lights and were much smaller in comparison to this object and moved slower across the sky although remember this object looked really low to me, and seemed to be moving less than maybe 100 miles per hour or so. I don&#39;t really know the accurate speed of the object but I know I couldn&#39;t see any features of planes except for the lights... and this had no lights at all and I could see it quite clearly, it was incredibly eerie how long I was able to focus on this thing...  Also there were planes in the sky when this object was in the sky but not directly in view they were behind me going in the same direction as this object as well as other directions and coming from that direction. I doubt that they were related but I don&#39;t know, it was a lot of planes in the sky even my teacher said it himself that there was a ton of planes in the sky.  I don&#39;t know if my teacher saw it but some of the other students were talking about about seeing a weird light flash (but I did not see a flash) and I don&#39;t know if it was the same thing that I saw since we were kind of spread out and looking in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought this would ever happen to me. I hope someone can tell me what is going on??! I can&#39;t believe my girlfriend even is blowing this off and she said it herself that it looked like a manta-ray to her and it looked smokey but I am completely freaked out and blown away by this event as nothing like this has ever happened to me.<n>

I was outside on the phone, and I looked to the west and saw an amber or orange colored light that was oval shaped in the sky.  This object looked like it could have been as far away as downtown (7 miles).  It was definitely below the cloud ceiling, maybe 10,000 ft, best guess.  So I wasn&#39;t really that close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw this oval, amber light, I thought it could be a meteorite, but what it did next nullified that explanation. It was moving from south to north, left to right from my vantage, and it was moving up and down as well, much like a sine wave. The size was almost as large as a full moon. And the light was bright, but not shining.  It was just a steady orange glow. It didn&#39;t move unusually slow or fast, maybe a little faster than the speed of an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it either shot due west, away from me really fast, or it slowly dimmed to a small point of light.  I believe it moved away, because it seemed to get lower in the sky.  The light disappeared, and a few seconds later reappeared as a dim light.  It did that twice, and that was the last I saw of it.<n>

I could estimate the distance to be 3-4 miles in the air, it was quite bright and moved slowly away from me in an easterly direction (away from me).  It was the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky (about 5 times more bright than Jupiter is now). I felt as if I was being told (although I don&#39;t know how) that the object was leaving and not coming back.  I can not make sense of this message, however, I felt as if it was a download of some kind.  I may understand it&#39;s meaning later but I can estimate that this &#34;quit&#34; message came to me as it moved more eastward (maybe after 60 seconds or so after I saw the object). The sighting lasted about 2 minutes.<n>

10/17/11 19:45|New Lenox|IL|Disk|3 minutes|Two witnesses watch 30ft disc fall from high altitude in seconds, change axis, stop 30ft over highway, pass slowly and silently between|6/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89586.html|336|ndxe201110| Two witnesses watch 30ft disc fall from high altitude in seconds, change axis, stop 30ft over highway, pass slowly and silently between<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, October 17th, 2011, at approximately 7:45pm, I was traveling with my spouse on I-355 southwest towards New Lenox.  We were roughly four miles from the US 6 Southwest Highway exit when I noticed a small, extremely bright silver and amber hued light flare violently in the southeastern sky.  After momentarily intensifying, it began to soundlessly plummet towards the earth at a 75-degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light, which at first resembled a pulsating silver and amber flame, was falling so rapidly I estimated it would collide with the terrain just a few hundred feet from our car in seconds.  Unconsciously bracing myself for impact, I was startled when it began to decelerate, releasing four amber-hued jets or streams of what appeared to be flaming gas as it declined to an altitude of 200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment of intense anxiety, I was able to discern that the light concealed a dark object, roughly disc-shaped and tilted at a 45-dgree angle so that the amber jets appeared to be issuing from its underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I was able, I drew my spouse&#39;s attention to the disc and she began to reduce her speed to between 5-7 miles an hour.  The disc was roughly 200 feet from us at this time and we were gradually approaching it from the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was virtually no traffic on I-355 at that time and I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were alone, venerable and potentially in danger.  I felt the onset of panic but tried to remain calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amber jets issuing from the disc cut off abruptly and were replaced by a vaporous fog which enshrouded it as it as it hung suspended in midair roughly fifty feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc had become a black silhouette which did not move or sway in the wind.  The fog quickly began to dissipate and the disc tilted from 45-degrees to 180-degrees and began to glide very slowly across the shoulder of the road and into the oncoming lane as if on an invisible track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached it began to descend at a 45-degree angle, but did not change its axis.  The descent was surreally smooth.  The object did not waver or rock in the wind. I suddenly felt an intense, unaccountable feeling of calm come over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the disc neared the well-lit median, a small teal (the color is still difficult for me to describe - this is approximate) light or beacon slowly appeared under its outer lip or rim.  The process of illumination reminded me of the irregular flickering of a fluorescent bulb when first switched on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light emanated from an object that superficially resembled an ornate cylinder lamp or lantern hanging from the underside of the disc&#39;s outer rim.  It also seemed as though portions of the disc had suddenly become internally illuminated by the same unusual teal light, giving the impression of an ornate inner framework and a large window-like area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued its descent it passed between two median streetlights and paused directly in front of our car.  We had slowed almost to a halt at this juncture and the object proceeded to slowly move directly in front of our vehicle.  I was now able to confirm with certainty that the object was disc shaped (although observing it from its side caused it to momentarily appear football-shaped).  It was roughly 30 feet in length and perhaps 9-12 feet in in height.  It emitted no sound whatsoever. Its surface was metallic and highly refractive like an intensely polished mirror.  Its undercarriage appeared to be corrugated in the light of the teal lamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object kept an even 30 foot distance from our car at all times, moving silently forward as we approached it while remaining directly in front of us at all times.  Again, it did not rock or sway in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc remained in front of us in this manner for about 20-40 seconds, then slowly moved west to the shoulder of the road where it continued to follow us from an approximate 30 foot elevation and 30 foot distance for another 20-30 seconds.  It then proceeded into the darkness over an adjoining field.  As it moved out of the street lamp&#39;s illumination, the disc’s internal illumination dampened and gradually went out - leaving only the glowing of teal lamp to identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it had passed completely into the darkness the disc became almost totally camouflaged, except for the teal light, which had become faint and ghostly.  My spouse and I strained to observe the object as it begin to climb in elevation and pass over the (then) unfinished structure of the Silver Cross Hospital near the US 6 Southwest highway exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traveled towards our home, I was able to observe the object by following the small teal lamp.  I was also occasionally able to see the entire disc as the ambient light beneath it caused it to become visible.  The object remained visible in the night sky for a distance of about 5 miles and a span of about 5-6 minutes before it vanished moving towards the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

After about 30 seconds of moving east, it dimmed and disappeared.  My wife and I just went out to walk, which I turned on the sprinklers.  I checked to see if my wife was clear of the grass, which is when I seen it in the sky.  Amazing scary and kind cool.   I wonder what it could have been.  It was close to the flight pattern into san Jose, but thus went directly back into it quickly.   Plus, there were no indicator lights.

Not sure how good the video will turn out but you can clearly make out what looks like a star in the picture.

(est.).|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84603.html|342|ndxe201110| Bizarre light seen streaking across the clear and cloudless evening sky, covering 120 (+ or -) degrees of arc in 15-20 sec..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just completed my nightly walk on the 9-hole Harrington Golf Course, and was standing beside the practice putting green, located at the north end of the course.  I had paused, to enjoy the beautifully clear, almost cloudless, night sky.  I was facing generally north-northeast, and could see the star, Capella (I believe), almost straight in front of me, just to the left of the town water tower, and at approximately 20 degrees angle of elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was suddenly drawn upward to a fast-moving light, the approximate size and luminosity of the International Space Station (ISS).  When I first observed it, I estimate that it was located approximately 30-50 degrees to the left (west) of Capella, and at approximately 60-70 degrees angle of elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first instant I saw the light, as it coursed toward the east in the northern sky, I assumed that it was probably the ISS, or perhaps the German ROSAT satellite, which is currently anticipated to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere at sometime between October 22-24, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, within probably a second, or so, of my first having sighted the light, I realized that it was not the ISS, which I have witnessed on many occasions, and that the object&#39;s angular velocity across the sky was far too high for the object to be either the ISS, or any other man-made orbiting object.  Whereas a typical satellite in low-Earth orbit has a maximum angular velocity in the vicinity of one degree per second, the object in question appeared to be moving at perhaps 5+ degrees per second.  My impression was that it was &#34;streaking&#34; across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, the object may have had a very faint blue, or perhaps purple, tinge to it.  Its color was not quite that of a typical star in the night sky, although the color distinction was very faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued coursing to the east, and disappeared from my sight when I could no longer resolve it visually.  It did not fade out, as satellites are seen to do when they enter the Earth’s shadow (or &#34;terminator&#34;).  It simply got smaller, until I could no longer resolve it visually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately opened my cell telephone, and noted the time to be 18:42 hrs. (PDT), and it took approximately 30 seconds for the indicated time to turn over to 18:43 hrs..  Consequently, assuming that cell phone time is accurate, the time of the sighting may have been 18:42::30 hrs. (PDT).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object coursed from approximately 340 degrees (true) to approximately 90-95 degrees (true) in, I estimate, 15-20 seconds, again, at a much higher angular velocity than satellites are seen to move across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event is somewhat complicated by the fact that the ROSAT satellite had passed through the same general area of the sky some eight minutes before my sighting.  The website, www.Heavens-Above.com, indicates that ROSAT was first visible in the northwest sky at 20:34::37 on the same date as my sighting, October 17, and that it would have been at an angle of elevation of 56 degrees, at its highest elevation.  However, that satellite would have traveled from the northwest sky to the south-southeast sky over the course of 240 seconds, at a much lower angular velocity than that of the object I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the possibility that the object might have been a fragment of the ROSAT satellite, but even that possibility does not seem feasible.  The object disappeared from my sight when it was within a few degrees of true east, and the ROSAT had coursed to the southeast, approximately 4 minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also considered whether the object could have been a meteor, but that does not make sense, either.  Its luminosity did not fluctuate during the entire sighting, and no fragments were seen falling from it.  Moreover, 20 seconds is a very long burn-time for a meteor, particularly a small meteor, and there was no terminal burst, which commonly is seen for long-duration meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has me thoroughly confused!!  This was a very strange occurrence, for which I have no ready explanation!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold a commercial pilot rating, and I am a former flight instructor.  In addition, I am a frequent and avid viewer of the night sky, and am able to identify many of the heavenly bodies and constellations by name.  I own a number of reflector telescopes, and several pairs of high-quality astronomical binoculars, all used for night sky viewing.<n>

As I was logging on to my PC, I noticed something moving in the sky out the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on the balcony and observed (1) sphere looking object hovering and moving very fast, laterally and longitudinally, below and above the clouds over the ocean. The object appeared to be approx. the size and shape of a dime.  The color of the sphere was about the same of the surrounding clouds, not very bright.  The duration was about 20 minutes before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went downstairs into the lobby and out the hotel to see if anyone else observed it.  A looked up and there was a young couple on the 6th floor who were peering in the same direction as the sighting.  I asked them if they had seen what I saw- and they were very excited and said yes, we saw it too.  So I wasn’t seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also spent over 20 years in the Air Force, so I know how various aircraft operate, to include weather balloons.

The moon was nearly, directly overhead and the air was very clear and crisp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and noticed several &#34;stars&#34; moving at not only different speeds, but they were moving in different directions.  I started to count the objects and decided to stop after about 10.  Some would move faster than others, some would stop and start moving in another direction.  These circular objects were very bright, and none of them gave off a blinking pattern that might be confused with an airplane.  The circular shapes were very different than the actual stars observed in the night sky, in that they were slightly larger,and moving at variable speeds and directions.<n>

I was standing outside my back deck smoking a cigarette when a small flash caught my eye.  When I looked I didn&#39;t see any flash but what I saw definately caught my eye.  It was the chevron shape just like I saw in reports of the Phoenix lights.  It had round orange lights on the bottom of the front and back two corners.  The lights were not bright enough and also far too large to be a normal aircraft lights.  I was able to pick out its actual shape as it flew by.  The most astonishing thing was how fast it was flying.  It took approximately 12-15 seconds to cover the horizon from south west to north east.  It did make noise but not like a jet engine.  I live in a big military area with an army base, an airforce base, and the airforce academy all within close proximity.  I see all sorts of aircraft flying around.  This was faster and and shaped different than anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be much closer yet flying much slower than the passenger planes and it was maintaining its flight trajectory.

It comes from a different location each time, but mostly comes from either the north or the west, goes in a straight line across the city then when it gets over the mountain it begins to dim.  It first turns yellow then red then with a small flash like a camera flash it disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been happening nightly to several times a week for the past 2 months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the bright white is like a very bright halogen.  Brighter than any star or moon or sun. It’s white light is just as bright if it is coming towards us or going away from us.  It’s intensity never changes. There are no blinking lights of red or any other color. It is steady and strong till it dims and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport nearby but no airplane has anywhere near this bright intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is probably around 10,000 feet, moves very smoothly. No beams of light come from it. The light is just itself glowing brightly. When viewed via binoculars or telescope the shape cannot be seen until it dims and turns yellow or red. Then it is clearly a round object. The flash is almost as if it is entering some type of fast transport mode either leaving with a speed beyond visible sight or entering something and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was first noticed by my wife and I while dropping kids off at grandmas. Then the following day it came again. Since them we make it a nightly ritual to be outside by 8 to wait for it. When seen it is enormous. Larger than any star or plane in the area. It is relevant to 2 or 3 times the size of Jupiter as seen from our yard. The intensity of the light gives it a starry appearance with offshoots of brilliance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night we had the whole family over, 8 of us and we all watched it as it came over then disappeared over the landslide area in the canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star, we suspect.

10/16/11 20:30|Fort Wayne|IN|Circle|1 min.|My 3-year-old child, a friend and myself were sitting outside on my porch at our new home together one evening.  It was a pretty chilly|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84659.html|354|ndxe201110| My 3-year-old child, a friend and myself were sitting outside on my porch at our new home together one evening.  It was a pretty chilly and breezy fall Sunday night but we wanted to look at the stars since we had just moved recently and were excited to view the night sky since it was so clear out.  Within just a few minutes an unusual traveling bright circular bluish white light caught our attention at an instant.  At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then it appeared to be moving closer towards us and not disappearing we knew such to be.  We watched it travel closer towards us for about a minute staring in amazement, disbelief and even a little fear that it may be an asteroid or bomb. We watched it get closer and brighter for about 30 seconds, moving further east then remain quite stationary for about 3 seconds when it was at its brightest before vanishing into the eastern night sky at a rapid but steady gliding speed for about 6 seconds until it totally disappeared.  It seemed to have come into our atmosphere from space, descend and then leave a different direction. I noticed an orbiting satellite and airplanes in flight and compared how different the light and motion of travel was in every way just to rule out things from our planet that travel regularly.  We had cancelled out everything and both believed we had encountered an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was convinced within 5 seconds that it could possibly be an UFO because of a prior experience.  While walking my dog a few years ago with my husband I noticed a black triangular object in the sky just before dusk thinking it was a bird at first until it just kept descending and appearing more like the size of a helicopter. and then within a few blinks of an eye went back up into the sky faster than I’ve ever seen anything move that distance.  What I saw in both experiences are almost exactly the same as far as the flight pattern and vanishing so fast.<n>

Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not certain, but I think there was at least another light when we first saw triangle, but that other light disappeared as we focused attention on triangle of lights (thought it might be helicopters but there was no copter noise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting home, looked up &#34;ufo triangle lights&#34; and some of the videos we saw on youtube were EXACTLY what we saw.

As I was pulling in I looked up at the sky and noticed a strange light appearing out of the northwest and moving towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite bright and seemed to move very smoothly across the sky.  I first thought it was a plane but it seemed to have too much red and orange colors on it.  As it continued to move south , I grabbed my cell and called my neighbor and told her to come out into her front yard.  When I hung up I saw another light appear out of the Northwest and start moving in the same path as the first.  As the first moved further to the south, I was able to get a better look and it seemed it had fire coming from the bottom of it which caused the orange-ish-redish  color – above the orange it was a bright white but I couldn’t really distinguish a particular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was another light appearing out of the northwest (now 3 in total) that started following the same path as the first two – they seemed to all gather in the south hanging suspended.  I tried taking a picture with my cell phone but no luck.  My neighbor was looking as well and trying to take a picture with her cell phone.  I think there were 2 more lights appearing and moving the same direction. I then ran into the house to get my camera and by the time I got back out there, my neighbor said they were “all gone”.  She then asked me if I had seen them form a triangle in the south but I didn’t as I had run into get my camera.<n>

The sky was clear of any clouds and the sunset was receding in the western horizon. It was when I was turning and looking at the southern sky when my attention was focused on what I believed to be a star at first, low in the southern horizon.  It appeared too large and too early in the evening to be any known visible  star, but as I was looking at it I commented to my wife, if she thought it may be in motion. She said that it was moving towards us.  I then spotted it through my binoculars and could see it was not an aircraft because it had no navigation or anti-collision beacon lights and it was a constant glowing ball of yellow light. It took me about two seconds to realize that it was not any possible aircraft of any type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my wife to go inside and grab my video cam while I kept visual on the object. She returned just as the object now appear! ed closer, but maintaining a constant altitude and distance from my point of view. By the time I got it in my cam viewfinder it had already traveled half way across the eastern horizon from my vantage point.  The object was moving from south to northeast and made no sound what so ever and it emitted a constant yellow-gold brightness to it, but clearly spherical in shape.  On two or three occasions it slowed down to a point that it may have stopped in midair. When it continued it started moving much slower than before.  I would estimate the image size to be about 1/8th of an inch diameter at arms length, traveling at the speed of a Cessna 172, (when I first spotted the object) then slowed down.  It would be difficult if not impossible to tell at what distance it might have been or altitude.  All I can say is that it was moving in a very straight path at about 30 degrees off eastern horizon from south to northeast.  I continued video recording until I lost sight of it low in the no! rtheastern horizon. I captured 1 minute and 35 seconds recordi! ng time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My total observation time was 2 minutes 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light conditions outside at 6:09 pm were very low yielding very low recording image on my digital 8 video tape, but the image was captured enough to see an object moving over our community. My wife was the only witness present and she observed this with me the entire time.  I checked weather conditions for wind in my location and winds were recorded at 13.8 mph WSW.  Had this been a balloon or Chinese lantern it would have been very unusual for it to travel against the wind. This sighting would have been clearly visible to anyone outside having an unobstructed view to the eastern horizon as it was still light outside and the object was moving rather slow against a blue sky. I&#39;m confident others witnessed this unusual glowing object.<n>

It was your typical looking UFO from what I see in pictures, not triangular like some describe, but more like disk or saucer shaped.  Inside of it were what appeared to be 8 to maybe 10 round super bright lights shining.  It hovered in the sky for a little bit, with an amazing haze of light around it and these round bright lights shining, all white, I did not see any color.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then appeared to be coming closer toward me, would hover there for a few minutes and then retreat back to where it originally was.  It did this several times.  I called a friend and was describing it to them.  This went on for about 25-30 minutes.  And it just disappeared, retreated the last time and was gone!  I have no idea what cows and aliens have to do with one another, other than the things I have read about them doing surgical procedures on cows and other such gross things I have read and seen on the internet.  But I do have a pasture with cows and horses just at the back of my property line, to the west of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 3 dogs that I made go inside while I sat out and watched it.  I took a picture with my 3G iPhone, which has no flash.  That&#39;s really about all I can describe about what transpired.  I have lived in my house for over 6 years and have never seen there, nor anywhere else in my life, such a thing as amazing as this.<n>

10/16/11 06:30|Orlando|FL|Cylinder|15-20minutes|I saw a dark rectangular object with three bright lights hovering in the sky for about 5-10 minutes before it transformed and flew off|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84608.html|365|ndxe201110| I saw a dark rectangular object with three bright lights hovering in the sky for about 5-10 minutes before it transformed and flew off<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog this morning at about 6:30 am when I looked out into the horizon and saw a dark rectangular object hovering in the sky with 3 bright lights on it.  Two lights were yellow, the other was red, and the light in the middle was rapidly pulsing.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed that it was not moving constantly like a plane does at night.  It was just there hovering in the sky. I looked closer to see if it was a tower with lights on it like an antannae but there was no tower attatched to the object.  At that point I was pretty certain it was a UFO.  I dashed back into my house, grabbed my camera, ran to a nearby neighborhood to get a better view, and began to film the object as it hovered there in the sky for about another 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I noticed that the object was emanating a sound from it that sounded a lot like helicopter blades.  So I paused filming and began to look at the footage to see if was a helicopter.!   But when I looked back into the sky, the three lights had now transformed into an object with just one bright light, it flew higher into the sky, and then began to fly off. I filmed again for a few minutes as the object flew off.  There was no doubt in my mind at that point that what I saw was a UFO.<n>

It looked like it was pulsating and then slowly faded in the distance.  But not but 10 seconds later from the tree line 1 mile away another orange light same idea brighter though lifted up and away, but then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 started following that 1 that came out of the tree line.  At certain areas in the sky it looked like it was forming a half circle then they would fade away and then 6 then 7 then 8 coming from the same distance would rise and take that exact same route.  I actually called the police to ask if anybody else reported weird lights...no body.  But myself and a friend saw the same thing!  Funny part is back in June of 2010 I was at my house and I saw the EXACT same thing!

I pointed them out to my father, who confirmed that he saw them too.  We watched them closely for several minutes, and discovered that they were not moving in a linear or repetitive pattern like a spotlight should.  There were two, sometimes three, visible light sources.  No beams from the ground were visible, and we drove around for a long time looking for any possible source for the lights.  We discovered none, and continued on our way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way home, we looked again for the lights, but they were no longer there.  The next day, I was having dinner with a friend of mine who lives in that area, and he mentioned something about seeing the same lights that we did, completely separate of our experience.  He described them in exactly the same way without me telling him what I had seen, down to the time, duration, number of lights, and location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were vaguely round or oval, and had a white, almost fluorescent color to them.<n>

We arrived at approximately 1830 PST.  After eating and gaming for about 2 ½ hours, I went into the hot tub with my friend &amp; his wife.  It was a very clear and beautiful night, plenty of stars and a bright moon.   Given the location of our homes against the nearby Los Angeles National Forest mountain range (6 – 8 blocks to the foothills), we are usually treated with superb visibility, allowing us to see satellites, the Space Station, Shuttle, etc, on a regular basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their hot tub is circular, about 6 ft across and I was oriented at the 5:30 o’clock position, facing north (or about 345 degrees).  My friend was at the 11 o’clock position (facing south), and his wife was situated in-between us (2 or 3 o’clock) and facing due west.  We are all in our 40’s, married for 15 – 20 years, and been friends since the mid 1980’s / early 90’s.   There were no exterior lights in the yard, as the moon gave a constant soft light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes after we entered hot tub, and while I was scanning the sky for items, I noticed a light in the western sky, approximately 10-20k ft high, moving towards us in a due east flight path relative to our stationary position.  The light was not travelling in the typical approach or departure pattern for the nearby ONT, BUR or LAX airports.  The light appeared to be moving rather slowly, coming directly towards us.  It was a dark yellow or light orange color, with only the light visible.  There was no discernable airframe, external nav lights, no noise – only a light.  It was a constant light, no changes in its intensity, direction or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented to my friends that there is something we don’t normally see, meaning it was not apparently a plane (with the normal navigation lights, sounds and profile), and not a satellite (it was far too low, a medium brightness and noticeably larger than other satellites and space station lights we’ve seen).  All three of us looked at the light coming towards us for perhaps 1-2 minutes, with his wife asking if planes didn’t have special colored lighting to distinguish them?  I confirmed that since the object was moving towards us, there should be a red light on the right-hand side, and perhaps other lights (strobe lights, landing lights, take-off lights, anti-smack light, etc).  None of these were distinguishable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we watched and speculated, the light began to slow down, and then completely stop in midair.  I picked up my flip phone camera, and attempted to get some video.  I took (2) 30 second clips of the stationary light, though the resolution quality was quite low (essentially worthless).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We of course sat stunned and stared in some genuine disbelief.  There was no sound of any rotor blades (we get them around our house ALL THE TIME for a variety of reasons, so we all know typical helicopter movements, sounds, etc.  As we watched the light it moved slowly &amp; slightly to the south (our left as we were still facing due west).  After perhaps 30-40 seconds, it then returned to its original stopping point for perhaps another 10 seconds.  Then it slowly started back the same way it came.  The light did not turn direction away from us, it merely moved in reverse away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched in silence, a small series of lights came out of the bottom of the larger light.  To me, it initially looked like a flare dropping straight down from the craft, but it did not burn with any consistency.  It alternated between mildly bright, to barely visible, back to mildly bright, then nearly disappearing, before becoming mildly bright once again.  By the 3rd time it got bright, the trajectory of the dropping light changed, and it headed due northwest and quickly disappeared.  It did not move off for miles before disappearing, it was gone with 3-5 seconds after changing direction.  All the while, the main light continued back on its westward path, going behind some trees and disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us could explain what we saw, and none of us have ever seen anything remotely similar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be truthful, my friend had 4-5 shots of whisky since about 5 PM that evening (he’s about 250 lbs), so there wasn’t much impact by 21:30 PST, as his consumption was in a measured pace relative to his tolerance and size.  His wife had just returned from taking the girls to “Booing” some of their Jr. High friend’s houses.  She was still working on her first mixed drink of the evening at the time.  I had 3 shots of 75 proof whiskey during the previous 3 hours, and was for all intensive purposes – still completely coherent and alert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course when my wife called to see when I’d be coming home, I was so excited to tell her about what we witnessed that the phone slipped out of my wet hands, and straight to the bottom of the hot tub…before it unceremoniously powered off.  Though I’ve tried several methods to dry and revive the phone, nothing has worked yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and his wife have lived at this location for nearly 10 years, and he is fairly familiar with local traffic patterns.  He has an App on his Android phone that allows us to quickly pin-point stars, constellations, space debris or even rocket launches from Vandenberg AFB.  He and I have attended several air shows @ Apple Valley and Edwards AFB.  His background is in the high-end automotive field, and he is one of the top specialists in his field in the world.  His wife is a part-time real estate agent, and full time mother to their only daughter.  My background includes a BS degree in management, with a minor in Computer Management Information Systems, a Master’s of Science in Organizational Management and a nearly complete BS degree in Criminal Justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally I have 13 years studying (numerous technical certifications) and working in military &amp; commercial aerospace operations and manufacturing (all in the avionics realm) from 1982 to 1997.  My hands-on technical training, support and management experience includes a wide variety of light, single &amp; twin engine general aviation craft, military helicopters (UH-1N, AH-1J), attack aircraft (A-4M), observation planes (OV-10 B) and medium to large jet aircraft (MD-80, MD-90, MD-95 and MD-11).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been to dozens of air shows, was trained at / stationed at military airfield facilities including NAS Memphis, MCAS El Toro, MCAS Tustin, MCAS Yuma and MCAS Pendleton for over 3 ½ years during my tour of service.  My civilian experience includes 6 months working at the El Monte and Fullerton airports and 7 ½ years with a major manufacturer at the Long Beach airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Currently I’m an NCO in the state reserves and have split 50% of my duty time for 2011 between the airfield at Los Alamitos and my normal drill station.  I’ve written an article for Air Safety Weekly (in 2006), and had one of my comments to the editor published in Aviation Weekly (April 1998).  Finally I was interviewed by Swiss Public Radio in 1999 after the Swissair Flight 111 MD-11 crash in Canada in 1998.  Suffice to say I have a passing knowledge of the aerospace community… &amp;#61514;  There are only 3 explanations I have for what we witnessed.  It was (A) a lighter than air vehicle of some kind, (B) a helicopter, or (C) a tilt-rotor aircraft.  Options B &amp; C do not seem plausible, given the amount of noise a hovering aircraft would make.  If my altitude guess was correct, then option B is out the door, as few helicopters will operate in the 15-20k altitude range without pilot &amp; crew oxygen, especially in the heavily regulated LAX TCA zone, and close to the climb-out area for jets departing ONT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are hoping your team might be able to shed some more light on this situation!<n>

Light gained speed that would exceed that of a plane and turned red.  Light suddenly stopped for a few seconds while pulsating white light and before moving again towards the south.  Light changed colors from white to green to red to white.  It then accelerated rapidly and shut out of sight, towards the south.  Observed through binoculars it appeared to be a small cluster of 3 or 4 lights.  At least one of them green and one of them red and one of them white.  The lights didn&#39;t change color themselves, but switched on and off.<n>

I am an avid astronomer and didn&#39;t make the lights out to be any stars or planets.  Shortly after my two friends noticed the lights as well and we were all looking.  We made them out to be three bright points, each about as bright as Jupiter, which made the shape of a long, skinny, isosceles triangle.  We kept an eye on them as we quickly turned and stopped onto a side road.  I got out of the car and watched them as they faded into the distance to the east (this is the way they were generally moving).  They didn&#39;t make any noise that any of us could hear.  After they faded into the distance, I got back into the car and we drove off.  We later saw on Facebook a similar report of this sighting in the same place.

We then saw what looked like a moving star coming from the north, but we didn&#39;t really recognize it as a UFO and disregarded it.  We then saw it again coming from the west and then thought it was an airplane coming in to land, so once again we diregarded it.  Next my friend, brother, and I went for a walk around 19:30-20:00. We noticed it again coming from north.  We kidded about it for a second with my brother saying we were wizards and moving the star, but then we realized it was abnormal. It wasn&#39;t a plane.  It had no blinking lights, no sound, moved swiftly, and looked like a star.  We stood and watched for about 3-4 minutes in shock. It started to get brighter and then suddenly began to shrink and turn into a light tint of red.  Then it just disappeared into nothing but the black sky.<n>

I was walking and she was riding my bike ahead of me about 50 yards when I noticed a flame-like light below the clouds approaching from the West.  On 8/30/2010 I had seen the exact same type of light above Veneta about 15 miles away.   As before I stopped to watch it approach.  Its speed was relatively slow and its altitude left it below the clouds. It then slowed gradually to a stop at which time I called for my girlfriend to come see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time she reached me the flickering orange-yellow light had come to a stop where it remained as we watched for about a minute before it moved away in the opposite direction.  This was exactly the same behavior I had witnessed the year before.

There was mostly farmland around us.  My husband was driving and I was writing an email on my cell phone, which was on my lap.  I saw a very bright orange glow out of the corner of my left eye and looked over toward my husband just in time to see what appeared to be a large and very bright ball of orange light fly away from the car, going in the direction behind us.  My husband was a little flustered, trying to figure out what it was - he said it was a ball of orange light, too, and that it had stayed with us for a few seconds as we drove.  As my husband was saying this, I happened to glance in his side mirror and saw a very large orange ball flying off into the sky in the distance at an incredible rate of speed and disappear just above the hills (it was at the very end of sunset.)  From the time I spotted the light until I saw it disappear in the mirror was maybe 15-20 seconds, tops.  We briefly considered pulling over to search the sky but didn&#39;t have the nerve. I saw a &#34;UFO&#34; in 1998 and that experience was totally different.  This happened so fast and was so bizarre I wasn&#39;t even sure what to call it.<n>

I just happened to look up and I saw the two “U” shaped UFO’s fly over the top of my head in a north to south flight path.  I did not hear the sound of their engines.  Both of them were no more than 1500 feet above the ground.  I would have heard them way before they passed over me because of how slow they were going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were both an Air Force gray with black highlights.  Once I lost sight of them, I saw the cigar shaped one come out from behind the trees.  It couldn’t have been more than a quarter of a mile away from where I was standing.  It was moving slightly slower than what the other two craft were moving. It had lights all along the bottom of it and some on the side of direction of flight. It was mostly blue with white highlights, and was trailing a bluish white mist.  Again with how slow the 3 craft had been moving I should have been able to hear the engines running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this event I called one of my co-workers, who I knew would be awake at this time of night, he happened to be outside smoking as well. I began to tell him what I had seen and about 10 seconds after he heard my description, he saw them too.  Only this time there were four “U” shaped craft, along with the cigar shaped craft.  There was another co-worker with him that night. He witnessed the now 5 aircraft as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in the military for 10 years in the aviation community.  I know that at certain distances I should be able to hear their engines. I could have easily dismissed the 2 “U” shaped craft as UAV’s, but I, and my co-workers, did not after seeing the cigar shaped UFO.  I have been in military aviation my entire career, I can tell the difference between aircraft just by how they sound, from quite a ways away.  These were close enough that we should have heard something, anything.<n>

I looked at my friend asked her what that was, she looks up and says airplane, i look at it again and asked is it on fire? we both looked at it for a  while at the same time aircraft were moving east to west landing at KPHX sky harbor. So this was considerably higher than the aircraft in the pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i was watching it it went from a bright orange, to a dull yellow started as a large &#34;ball&#34; as it transistioned from an angle to overhead it became more of a pin point, with a light &#34;orb&#34; that seemed transperent in nature. i couldnt take my eyes off it, it passed then outside my visual range because it went behind the structure of my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m ex military, current airline employee i know what should be in and out of sky harbor and i have no idea what that was, i checked mufon and there was one sighting that seemed to describe what i saw but the pics they posted were not it.  would love to know if there was any other sightings of this.<n>

The sky was pitch black when I noticed in the top right corner of my windshield a bright green light.  It caught my attention right away and looking up at it noticed it was 3 green lights.  The center one being the biggest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was “wow” that is a really neat meteor shower as the lights had haze around them. With a slight trail behind them. Yet, they were moving together and at a decently slow pace.  As soon as I started trying to figure out what they were.  The 3 “lights” moved very quickly through the sky and darted beyond the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved so quickly off into the distance they could have been falling, or just went that far out, hard to explain. The center light was alittle  ahead of the other 2 lights that were off to the side.

I can&#39;t believe more people haven&#39;t come forward to report it, it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I got out of the car, grabbed my clipboard and seen lights passing through the trees.  I went up stairs to our third floor apt. I got to be honest, it was kind of frightening.  I went in and called out to my wife to out on our balcony, she tried to tell me they were planes, I told her plane planes aren&#39;t orange amber, they have blinking lights, etc...  she went to the bedroom to look again, because she didn&#39;t want to be on the balcony; cold.  I called 911 to report it, the operator said, &#34;maybe their the presidents planes&#34; (The President was in the Metro area that day, but he left at 4:00pm accord to Fox news I spoke with as well.) I told the operator how many I was looking at, and he said he hasn&#39;t heard anything.  When the 911 operator answered my call, he answ! ered, &#34;Clinton Township Police &amp; 911, whats...&#34;  I recalled that, so I asked him if he was in Clinton twp., he said yes, so I told to look out the window to the south west, he claims he did, and seen nothing, I asked him how can he not see that, he hung up.  My wife, now with a warm view, could see it as well.  They were oval translucent orange amber color, solid.  When looking out over next buildings roof, and in the distant s.w. sky, there was a lot of them, they appeared to be coming up from the ground, then at a certain point leveled off from west to east, then went up on a 45 degree angle upwards to the southeast, and gone.  If you were to put my view of what I was seeing in a screen shot, there was a group of twenty to twenty five all together, with two here, and three or four to the right, and five or six to the up left of them, etc.  All in a group going in one direction, but not a conformed group, kind of a scatter pattern, but the group followed a pattern.  They&#39;d! pop up, level, 45, and gone.  Then the next group scattered d! ifferent ly, but follow the same pattern.  I called news, nothing, called the selferidge air national guard base, as it is five minutes from me, couldn&#39;t get through, I did the next day, they claim nothing was on radar, and no reports.  I had no way to record, or take a picture then; I do now!  I did try to take a pic with my phone, but nothing appeared; range,I think. I then looked more up to see if I could see anything more, and I noticed way up to the south east, which would have put them in plain view of the base, by the way; I seen four stationary ones just sitting there.  They were in a box pattern.  Then I noticed the top two seemed to be fading, and the two bottom slowly slide up, and two from departing group would now take the bottom two box spot.  After 15 minutes eight groups went by, of the big wave, you know the 20-25, started to decrease in size numerically to groups approx. 10, then 5, 4,3,2.

I called everyone, and anyone, no one, nothing. By the way, the air base gave me a direct number if it ever occurs again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling across the sky horizontally headed northeast. As it got farther away the orange pulsating was now a white light that diapered as it went farther away. It took about 15 to 20 min. from the time we first noticed it. There wasn’t any stars to be seen at that time, we were in a store parking area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, a businessman, and we found him to be sincere and sober-minded.

10/14/11 18:30|Strawberry|AZ|Flash|1.5 seconds|White flash appears in Geosynchronous orbit lasting for 1.5 seconds.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84812.html|406|ndxe201110| White flash appears in Geosynchronous orbit lasting for 1.5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the early evening of 10/14 my wife and I saw what can only be described as a flash.  Sky gazing in the high desert of Strawberry AZ near Fossil creek just after sunset I saw a flash of light.  In a dark area between stars the flash occurred lasting about 1-2 seconds.  It reached a brightness dimmer than ISS but brighter than many stars. It went from 0 brightness to full brightness and back to 0 at equal speed, I&#39;d say 1.5 sec total.  I did not move at all.  I am an amateur astronomer and I know the stars and satellites, this was nothing I&#39;d seen before. If it is a man made satellite then it&#39;s a geosynchronous one but why would it flash?  If it were tumbling like an iridium flare it would pulse at an even rate not flash once.  This flashed once and then again about 10 min later in I believe a different area but close. My wife saw it the second time, I did not.  This exact same report came to me from a friend of mine when we were home in Phoenix, he had been on a h! ike in the mtn preserve and when he came home he reported the event, just like what I had seen.  I figure it has to be a satellite but doing what? Rotating a camera, antenna, solar panel???  it&#39;s strange.  I&#39;d be curious to know if anybody else has reported this type of observation.  The color was white-ish blue very star like.<n>

The location of the ballpark allows for a panoramic view of the entire Westside.  At approximately 6pm I noticed a perfectly circular orb floating in the sky. It was reflecting the sunlight and was shining silver.  At first glance I thought it was a mylar balloon floating up into the sky but I kept watching and this orb was not moving. It was just sitting there in the sky perfectly still.  It did not deviate at all from its position or shape. The wind was blowing and this orb never moved, which led me to think this was something else entirely.  It was silent.  One of the other parents who were sitting alongside me noticed me staring up and asked what I was looking at.  I pointed the orb out to her and she commented on how it wasn’t moving as well. Before long all of the parents were looking at this thing.  As the sun began to set we noticed the orb getting darker and by 7:00 it appeared to be dark gray in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 1 ½ hours it sat perfectly still in the same exact spot, then it just disappeared.  We did not see it fly away or shoot off. It just disappeared. All of us were left scratching our heads. Very strange.<n>

And Ocala, Fl.  On highway 27 eastbound.  The sky was very clear, no cloud cover, still very light out. At approx 5:45 pm.   We both noticed an object to the S.W. in the sky.  I know airplanes generally travel at around 30,000 ft.  The object appeared to be at a greater altitude.  We were traveling at 70 mph. The object appeared o be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be Metallic cylindrical with dark line wrapped around  the  center of the body. It almost looked like it was 2 pieces that were attached. I was driving and there was no traffic in  front  of or behind me. I kept looking up at it. I looked at it probably 10-15 times in a matter of 30 seconds. The objet appeared to sit in the same location for about 2 -3 minutes so I got to look at it a lot. Then it started moving S.E. and gaining altitude. I watched it keep getting further away and higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until I lost sight of it.  My girlfriend could also see it but with limited detail. She did not have her glasses on.  The whole incident lasted about 5 minutes.  I don’t believe it was a commercial airliner due to the altitude. I don’t think it was a weather balloon because it kept in a straight line the entire duration.<n>

Recently there have been (more than usual) very loud military aircraft flying overhead, and I heard one.  I stopped on the walkway to see what kind of plane it was, and saw a jet, a military F-15 or something (small 1 or 2 man plane), flying loudly from right to left.  It had probably just taken off from Hickam AFB.  It flew out of sight, and I looked at the sky to see if there were any more, though I didn’t hear any. Then I saw something kind of sparkling and thought it was another one, only this time much higher in the sky. I watched it and could see that there were two seemingly identical but separate objects, flying together in exact and tight formation, both bright shiny silvery and thin triangular/arrowhead shaped, and flying very fast and very high in tight, eccentric circular movements. I first thought they might be two birds flying together, but they were so high up and so large that they would have had to be giant pterodactyls or some other mythical giant silver birds. No, they were definitely not birds. I watched them for about two minutes and they could not have been military jets, as no aircraft I had ever seen or heard of could perform such maneuvers at those heights and speeds. I kind of waved my hands in front of my eyes to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things and was sure that I wasn&#39;t hallucinating or delusional. I  was, however, a bit startled. I had not been drinking or taking drugs. I went back into the house, as I had forgotten to take an item with me. When I returned to the walkway, they were gone or out of sight. I am currently retired after working the past 26 years as a medical transcriptionist. I had never previously seen a UFO.<n>

Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on my front porch in Carterville and talking on the phone to a friend I noticed an unusual object moving slowly through the sky in between Carterville and Carthage Missouri.  I mentioned it to my friend I was speaking with in a sort of nonchalant type of way and continued my conversation.  I observed it for about 5 minutes before my suspicions were raised due to the size, shape, and lighting of the object.  My interest was sparked, so I told my friend I would call back once I got on the road.  I got in my car and drove  to the edge of town, then north on I 71 highway.  Aside from the thirty or so seconds of driving down my street to enter the highway, I maintained visual contact with the object for the full duration of its appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited the highway at the Brooklyn exit and parked my vehicle on the edge of the overpass.  The object appeared to have a lower altitude than regular air traffic.  It moved in a slow manner and did not have a predictable trajectory.  The object itself was dark and was the shape of an equilateral triangle.  There were three stationary lights visible to me, all white with a yellow hue to them.  I attempted to call my friend to tell him what I was seeing, but my cell phone experienced problems establishing a signal.  The phone is an LG G2x phone, less than two months old.  It hadn&#39;t malfunctioned prior, nor has it done so since.  I have never completely lost signal on this phone.  There was no signal.  Yet there are several towers in the area and I can usually maintain 3G and 4G coverage.  I did not attempt to capture video or photo footage of the object because the quality would have been so poor as to offer no significant gain and would most likely do nothing but draw spec! ulation.  The object did not seem to be moving at all for the final few minutes of my observation.  At the end, the lights went out and the dark outline of the object could be seen moving and an increased pace in a northwesterly direction.  The speed appeared to be faster than commercial air traffic.  If it did travel faster than the sound barrier I couldn&#39;t hear the signature sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent four years in the United States Navy, stationed overseas the entire time, first in the Middle East, then in Southwest Asia.  I was exposed to a wide array of civilian and military aircraft.  Helicopters,  Commercial and private jets, fighter jets, etc...  This object displayed no characteristics of flight that any of these aircraft did.  There are only two types of helicopters in my area.  Emergency Medical Service helicopters from the hospital located in Joplin, and an occasional National Guard (UH-72A).  They make a noise when they fly and do not hover at that altitude without search lights.  They also have running lights and are not triangular in shape.  There are no nighttime hot air balloons in the area, and even if there were, they are not triangular in shape and are incapable of rapid acceleration.  After the deduction process I went through I can only conclude that the object was either an unknown military aircraft, or something which remains unknown.  There! are no testing facilities close enough for me to think that anything would be tested, and not at this time and location.<n>

I had my I Phone with me and so I started taking pictures as the lightning inside the storm was unusually fast and colored. It had an aproximately 10 lightning flashes per second with no sound. I called my wife and instead of keep on taking pictures I start recording the event. It lasted about a half an hour. When there was almost no more flashing I observed as a white bright flashing sphere came out of the storm cloud and then split in two white bright spheres. They hover after geting out of the storm cloud for about 10 seconds and then changed course from south to north in a fraction of a second.

We had just finished dinner and went to our cabin which had a balcony on the starboard side of the ship on deck 9.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out onto the balcony to have a smoke and it was pretty stormy.  Couldn&#39;t see any other objects except the sea and the misty dark sky.  All of a sudden a well defined pill shaped object with a dull glow went in a perfectly straight line from the front of the ship to the back.  When it reached the back it took a sudden turn downward and I thought it was going to go into the sea but instead it curved around the back of the ship.  This only took less than 10 seconds from start to finish. Because it turned I estimate that it was only about 100 yards away and approximately 150 feet off the water.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw and debated whether or not I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out on the balcony for about twenty more minutes hoping it would return but it never did.  I told my wife but did not report it to the ships crew because I thought they would think I was some kind of a nut.  I currently live in Las Vegas just 90 miles from Area 51 and I have never seen anything like this before.  I want to be clear that it didn&#39;t look metallic.  It was closer to being some kind of dull light or energy but shaped like a pill with crisp edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I saw 2 more cruise ships headed back to New York City.  They were lit up all over which led me to believe that the object I described didn&#39;t actually emit any light on its own but was iluminated by the lights on our own cruise ship and was just a dark object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a web designer and self trained graphic artist and have done my best to recreate what I saw.  I just wish someone else would have filed a report and I could have backed up their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective, in his description of the event.

We thought originally that an airplane had emerged from and then disappeared back into the clouds.  It then reappeared and disappeared several times in various locations across the horizon.  The final image appeared to have one central light with 5 to 6 lights jut off to the left.  After the lights disappeared, (perhaps 15 to 30 minutes) a very low flying plane appeared to follow the horizon from North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I missed this first sighting.  However, he insisted that it was exactly what a stranger in Garden City had told him about.  He thought that guy was crazy in the same way that I was wondering about him. Until suddenly as I was starring up at the sky they reappeared.  It was three yellow/orange spheres of light that appeared in a triangular formation lingered for about 20 seconds and then it looked like they got sucked right back into the sky and they were gone.  There was no movement other than the fade in and fade out of the lights.  We are going back out tomorrow night around the same time to see if they will be there again.<n>

They almost looked like tower lights but they were orange and far too high in the sky.  We commented on the oddness and decided to take a darker &#34;back road&#34; to see what the lights were. When we turned off the main road and drove out of a tree set, we could see there were two lines of 3 lights, both vertical and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off the road and we got out of the car to watch them.  They were not moving and there was no sound.  They were far above the horizon and were obviously not connected to anything from the ground.  There were no other colors other than a bright orange and they did not flash or blink. We watched as the left hand set of lights seemed to move a little to the left and then the bottom of the left hand lights started to move a little away from the line and faded.  One by one they faded out.  It could have been cloud cover as the night was very cloudy.  But after the fading they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an interesting sight and I was hoping someone might have seen it and reported it to local news so that we might get an explanation but nothing seemed to be in our news.<n>

I ran upstairs to view it more clearly as it had disappeared between the rooftops of neighbouring houses. Upstairs the appearance was a distinct oval shape with bright lights around the outer edge.  I ran downstairs and outside to get a better view but it had disappeared even though the view was unobstructed. I searched the sky but despite it being a cloudless sky I saw no further evidence of the object.  I have never seen anything quite like it and have been amazed since seeing it. It was most definitely not a plane or helicopter as it was too large.<n>

At first I thought it may be a helicopter because it was just barely moving (almost hovering), but then I realized it was much too large and made no sound.  There were 5 large and equal size bright lights that formed an elongated triangle shape.  Although the lights were bright, they didn&#39;t seem to shine in a beam but they did illuminated the boy of the object.  It seemed to be moving very slowly, or almost pivoting at an upward angle. I re-focused on the road and hit the brakes, but when I looked up it was gone. I scanned the area for another 10 minutes and never saw it or any aircraft again. I estimate the object to have been 500-1000 feet off the ground and about the size of a medium to larger size passenger jet. The entire event lasted around 15 seconds...<n>

As I was about to look out the window to see what it was my husband woke up.  Our bed is next to the window so as soon as he opened his eyes he saw that there was a beam of light coming from the sky.

The back of my house points to the north.  I turned to my east (right) to look at the stars like I usually do, and saw a fast moving object come into view.  It came in like a meteorite, but slowed down to the speeds of a helicopter at about 145-165 mph.  It kept horizontal from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was the object was a quarter of  the size of the moon (5x time bigger than the north star). It was yellow in the center to orange with a outer glow of red.  The object was about 1000-1500 ft in altitude and was about half mile to mile out.  The object was about 60 degrees from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that what I saw was something that I have not seen before.  I knew that this was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the back door to call my wife outside to come and look at it.  She got up fast and came to the back yard with me.

I have an interest in astronomy and am always watching the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wed. night, Oct. 12 around 8 PM, I was at a beachfront house in Ocean Isle Beach, NC facing East observing the full moon and lightning flashes far out to sea.  I began a 20 minute Video recording with my Sony SR11 AVCHD camera to record the distant lightning which according to a weather website was over a hundred miles out to sea.  During my recording, I captured about a dozen total orange glowing stationary lights similar to lights I observed on three separate nights last June while at the same beach.   In June, the lights would stay on for up to 30 seconds and sometimes rotate around each other.  This time, they would light up for only a few seconds before fading out.  The orange lights appear as white on the video due to camera low light limitations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that Myrtle Beach, SC, is just south of Ocean Isle and I have read multiple reports of orange glowing lights recently from that more populated tourist area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My video is aimed  East looking down the beach.  Among the recognizable items are a neighbor’s  white stairs to the beach, A lighted bouy about a mile away, a flashing beacon to the left which I think is Brunswick Co airport about 20 miles away.  Old Baldy lighthouse on Bald Head Island is visible flashing to the right which is about 25 miles away.  In the sky the full moon is a somewhat fuzzy large orb and the planet Jupiter is constantly visible to the lower left of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are 5 separate times from the video beginning that had one or more lights appear and fade out. They are at the 2:52, 4:12, 12:33, 18:50, and 19:20 marks.  My favorite was the 12:33 minute mark where at least 5 orbs were visible at once.  I will attach a freeze frame from the video showing 4 of them.  The 2 most far right orbs appear again at the 18:50 and 19:20 marks.  It almost appears that those two may be actually one object with 2 lights due to the exact same spacing each time. I would estimate the objects were between 1 and 2 miles away at between 500 and 1,000 feet altitude. And objects were totally  silent as they were in June.<n>

I heard a helicopter fly overhead (which, oddly enough, airplanes and helicopters have been flying over quite frequently, recently).  I ran outside to see what it was.  When I got to where I could see, the copter was going in an approximately NE direction.  It looked like any other chopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, before I turned to leave, I saw lights flashing in the sky going in an approximately S-SW direction.  The lights were very small, so I figured it was high in the air, because it didn&#39;t look that far away by land.  The lights were red, white, and blue, with the white lights showing up more frequently.  They were in a random order, the colored lights never being in the same location.  I could not see a craft of any sort attached to the lights at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a circle that the lights were attached to on one end following the lights.  It was the same color of the sky (a dark, almost grey-blue, as it was almost dusk).  It moved steadily across the sky until it left my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted about 30 seconds.<n>

Looking out of the window it had turn cloudy all of a sudden and in the middle of the cloud there was a picture of a man’s face turn sideways he was facing toward the west on the cloud. He had a long head like a dunce cap, a flat forehead and a long nose with his mouth a little open and a long chin with long wishers. It was only a picture, but it really scared me. It was kind of weird freighting and amazing wonder what this would mean. I started to call my husband, but change my mind, because of the lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lighting coming out of the cloud thru the head of the man. I kept looking at it because it was like a 4 of July fireworks. It was amazing. (Not knowing how long I looked) When I finally came to myself, and realize I could draw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought to take a picture with my camera, it only took me a few minutes, to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not realizing it turn dark that fast, I put my eyes in the camera to take the picture of this man’s head figure, all of a sudden  this Red, Orange, and Yellowish Fire Ball from where the moon usually rise in my back yard from the South.  (I think) came from no were.  The disappear picture. because it had  got dark (which I did not realize it had got dark ) so looking to take the picture,  a little fire ball started  coming right at me thru my camera it got bigger and bigger and bigger until it cover my whole camera it came real fast, look like it was spinning. I jump away from the window.  I have never been so scare in all my life doesn’t know what happen after that I was scare to go back to the window.  Realize I had the fire ball on video in the camera.  To my surprise, this is what I got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something I will never forget. I would like to know if anyone have ever seen a picture like this, or did they see a ball of fire coming out of the sky.  What do this mean?<n>

At first thought it resembled a flock of birds . Until it began to change shape rapidly . It made no noise and gained altitude very quick and then formed into a solid shape of either a egg or circular object . there were many small objects cirling one larger object . Almost like a bunch of guards protecting a mothership . It was really kind of creepy . It wasnt any kind of aircraft that i know of . It first was seen by me in the northwest and was at a heading of south east . It was first seen as many objects and left the area as a soild object .  And as i said it was first seen as 5 to 9 small objects and left the area as one soilid object .  And each object joined the large object one after another in some sort of uniformed fashion .  All the objects one at a time joined the large object until they were one . they were in a somewhat clear sky on the evening of october 12 2011<n>

This report is EXACTLY accurate, so I am sending it as is.  NOTE:  The &#34;orange light&#34; looks just like the one on your homepage from the Rense Radio show (NJ sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Man spots UFO in Monroe, CT.  October 11, 2011  The newsroom recieved the following account from a reader who said he spotted a UFO in Monroe, Connecticut:  Witnessed (along with a stranger who’d parked her car in front of my driveway to jump out of the car and witness it as well) the event described below over the sky of Monroe tonight and can discern no viable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When:  Tuesday, 10/11 @ appx 9:00 PM EST<n> <n><n> Where:  Fan Hill Road, Monroe, CT outside (from WSW sky below treeline to NE sky directly overhead)<n> <n><n> Duration:  approximately 5 minutes from first sighting the lights til they passed, reverting the sky back to darkness<n> <n><n> Event:  7-10 red/orange lights of undulating brightness (like fire) appx 1/16 to 1/8 diameter of a full moon and brightness equivalent to Venus or a low-flying plane light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All lights sat motionless in sky in a formation pattern roughly a rectangle or triangle--or a pattern with even spacing among all lights that just hung in the sky, covering a large portion of the sky overhead.   Then entire formation began moving as one object (from a complete stop in the sky) generally NE in direction before all lights went dark nearly simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes were overhead after the event and their plane engines could be heard  but during event lights in question generated no sound whatsoever.  Complete Silence.  Initially suspected these to be meteor shower but they were below the cloud cover and quite a bit larger than any meteor I’ve ever seen and no trail left as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After initial formation moved and disappeared, an additional 4-6 lights came, single file and well spaced, across the sky from the WSW one after another towards where the first formation had disappeared and each proceeded to disappear as it reached that general destination.  All were the same size as the others.   After flying  After that the sky was dark and clouds could be seen with patches of sky/stars showing thru and plane in the far distance, which could be heard, but no residual evidence of the lights. Again, it was completely silent during this light formation motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absence of any sound and a combination of stationary lights coupled with movement makes a plane/fireworks/meteor explanation questionable.  Same as for ball lightning, swamp gas ignition, etc. all of which I’ve seen before and this did not match any of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: On after sighting report to local police:  Monroe police said the lights were caused by rice paper candles lit by kids behind a local church.  The children lit candles under rice paper bags.  When ignited, the bags flew into the sky.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I (the woman cited above) took photos w/ my cell phone be I do not seemed to have captured the &#34;orange light ball.&#34;   However, it does show the blackened sky around the vicinity--if that is of any help.<n>

These dazzling fireballs displayed complex patterns of symmetrical movement.  Although he was only a few blocks away, he immediately phoned us so we went out into the street to observe it.  Sure enough, the objects were flying over our house in single file and they made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon about every 30 seconds.  Each appeared as an orange and red fireball.  The size of these fireballs was a little smaller than the size of your pinky’s fingernail if you stretched your arm out in front of you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved past us and onto their rendezvous point just above the eastern horizon where groups of two or three of them would congregate and then disappear together as a group.  One of the fireballs changed color to white and merged with an orange one at their rendezvous point.  The last ship disappeared at about 8:10 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not get a picture or a video, but we found plenty of videos and pictures of these same objects on the internet.<n>
10/11/11 19:40|Des Moines|IA|Light|90 seconds|An unexplained, unidentified flying object.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84864.html|451|ndxe201110| An unexplained, unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, October 11th, at 7:40pm, I was heading home when I saw something that resembled an object on fire. It was a reddish-orange light, about the exact color of fire, and was traveling in a northerly direction. I stopped the car on the off ramp and got out for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a nearly full moon behind me as I watched the light move across the sky. I hold a private pilot&#39;s license, and although at this time I am not &#34;current&#34;, I&#39;ve been around aircraft all my life, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. There was a thin/broken layer of clouds I estimated to be about 4,000 to 5,000 feet above ground level. The light was below the clouds and appeared to be the size of a BB held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I applied &#39;critical thinking&#39; in my attempt to identify the light. I asked myself &#34;Why couldn&#39;t this be _____?&#34;   No aircraft I know of produces a reddish-orange light.  Plus there were no position, navigation, or anti-collision lights visible.  Also, this was not a landing light, as it was Omni-directional, not shining ahead as a landing light would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I considered it may have been the ROSAT satellite, which is due to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up.  The light had no trail of fire in its wake, and it appeared to be traveling in straight and level flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the light appeared to be moving fast, so this was no &#34;Chinese Lantern&#34;.  I would guess the light was at least 3,000 feet, and traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also filed this report with MUFON.<n>

I was in construction, so I had to keep looking away, but I looked down then back up and it grew brighter and brighter, until it looked like a very bright planet but a little bigger. I thought it was a plane, banking, with the sun reflecting off of it, but it dimmed again, grew bright again, then disappeared. I kept looking for a plane for minutes after and there was nothing.  Only other thing I think it could&#39;ve been naturally was a meteor that was coming straight at me and burned up, as it didn&#39;t move, it hovered.  Amazing as a skeptic... very excited, as it was my first UFO experience!<n>

As I was on my patio I witnessed what seemed to be a fairly large object at high altitude hovering for more than 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am a pilot, I do not take this lightly.  My best guess altitude would be 50,000’ then directly up to an unknown altitude out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be two small spheres or discs that were connected by a straight bridge.  I am convinced that this was not a weather balloon because it was too large, and not of the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also convinced that this was not a satellite as there was no horizontal movement for the period, until the object moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this report now certain that ufo’s do exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The quick movement of the object was by no means made of current technology that we have at hand.<n>

As we watched it the bright light faded and was replaced by 1 green light one red light and two orangish-yellow lights and started moving at a pretty good rate towards us.  The ship passed directly over us and disappeared into the horizon to the south. About 15 minutes later the craft appeared again and we decided to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not far after we started to go to where it looked like it was we heard a strange humming noise and looked up to see the craft, now a definite triangle, passing over we could also faintly see a weird spinning thing almost like a fan or propeller in the center of the craft. The craft itself was black except for the 4 lights that were on it and would blink occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting we followed it for about 15 more minutes before we lost it and decided to go back to the place where the initial sighting was.  At 11:45pm we saw the craft pass over our location again and then 3 more times at 12:00am, 12:15am, and 12:30am.  Then at 12:45 we saw four of the strange crafts flying in formation off on the horizon. This sighting at 12:45 was the last sighting we had for the night.<n>
10/10/11 21:55|North Platte|NE|Circle|3 seconds|Object over North Platte Nebraska|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85252.html|456|ndxe201110| Object over North Platte Nebraska<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:55 on 10-10-2011 I was about 2 miles south of North Platte on hwy 83 headed north. I was on a section of the hwy that had a view of direct north with no obstructions. As I approached the highest elevation of that section of the highway I saw a bright light that lasted for about 3 to 4 seconds.  I was on a direct north route and the object I saw was in the upper right corner of the windshield.  I was unaware if the object was there for some time,I believe I saw it only as it came into view of my windshield.  I would say it was about 20 degrees to my right traveling a direct south to north route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no tail so I believe it was not a comet that entered the atmosphere. The best way I can describe it in size and shape would be the same as the planet Jupiter.  I am very familiar with that planet as I see it the morning from my back porch (I use Google Sky Map on my phone) It was round and it moved very quickly.  It was very bright and it was a white light with no color at all.  I see planes and helicopter in this area all the time and it was defiantly neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude I cannot determine as there were no other objects to reference in the night sky. It seemed to be going due north but not descending.  At one point it was gone I am not sure where it went as I had to get my eyes back on the road.  As I looked again it was gone.  The weather conditions were clear and cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not claiming to have seen a &#34;UFO&#34; or &#34;spaceship&#34; what I saw was a large round bright object in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed.<n>

It was bright orange but once overhead the color was gone.  As it headed over me and went in a straight line to the northwest it became black.  It made no noise, and did not appear to be decending. I would not have been able to see the object if I had not saw it coming in.  It was not visible at all before it made it to the horizon.<n>

Well after she came in screaming UFO we all went out to see what she was talking about. Well, there was a cluster of lights (mainly red green white) flashing or rotating at a high speed.  It was hard to tell as it was quite a distance from us.  When we retrieved our scopes and binoculars, it amazed us at what it looked liked.  We eventually quit looking at it(except my daughter in-law). I went back out to check on it with her.  This time it appeared to have a what appeared to be a couple orangish colored lightes leave the object at a high rate of speed.  We went back inside for a couple of minutes.When we went back outside we could barely see it through the tree tops.  Appeared to be traveling SSW.

I was traveling alone on I-95 southbound near exit 88 when I saw it. It was a completely cloudless sky and I was traveling at 70mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see a small shiny object, about 2000 to 3000 ft in the air and was probably the size of a school bus or perhaps even a small plane.  I was looking out my front windshield and off a bit to the right, which would have put the object to my northeast.  It caught my attention due to the fact it was extremely shiny.. more shiny than anything I had ever seen on a plane flying across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back a second time after I had glanced down at the road while driving to see if it was still there.  It had not moved at all, which I thought was odd if it were a bird, plane or even maybe balloon.  I looked back down at the road again to drive, and looking up again a 3rd time, the object was no longer! in sight.  I thought if it was a balloon, it would be moving slowly enough where even at my speed, given the altitude of the object it should still have been visible.  I did not think it was a commercial plane due to the fact I did not notice any landing gear, windows, engines, fuselage or wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say for certain that it was not a reflection of some sort, but I thought it worthy enough to report it. No other witnesses were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be a sincere, and sober-minded, individual.

I looked at it through binoculars and saw that it was in fact a higly polished stainless steel object.  It had the form of a beer barell but about 5 times bigger.  No openings or windows of any kind.It was moving and was inclined at a 45 degrees angle.  I think that the reason it changed intensity was that it had such a polished reflective surface that it was changing the way ambient light  was being reflected on its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it was so far I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

What surprised me was the mention of circle shaped objects that looked red or even like fire balls. I had no idea it was a common description of UFOs.  What I saw that night was a circle shape that was reddish orange with a dull glow in the sky towards the east.  It almost looked like a large planet glowing low and far in the sky, but then I noticed it was moving slowly.  It could not have been an airliner because they have more than one light and usually have one blinking, and it clearly looked like a single large circle of light.  I wondered if it might be a satellite, but it was too large to qualify as one.  I was stumped.  I&#39;ve never witnessed anything quite like it.  I watched it for about five minutes as it slowly drifted away eastwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was overlooking the East side of the Tom Hannock Reserviour in Upstate Albany, New York.  We used binoculars to take a closer look and were shocked to see a triangle formation with a red blinking light at the left hand corner, a green blinking light at the right hand corner, and an orange blinking light at the top, the orange light would change to a normal light then back to orange again.  Overall the formation was swirling which created a circle effect, it was go very fast at points, then slow down speed, to me subjectively it felt like it was doing some kind of work, but unless it was a satellite or gas from a star which my friend said could be possible, I feel its worthy to be reported.  It did move slowly across the river, and was directly above the tree line, we saw a plane fly under the formation and the red light was pale and small in comparison.  The best way to describe it was disco lights, the green and red were very prominent, it was wonderful to watch, yet intriguing to find out what it actually is.  We stayed there for 2 hours and it was still there when we left at 2am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  PD))<n>

While sitting in our car waiting, I noticed a couple somewhat orange looking lights in the night sky.  These lights appeared to be located a couple miles south of our location at an altitude of approx. 2000 ft., probably slightly to the west of  Rt 16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw two (2) orange lights (somewhat brighter than stars)  moving very slowly in a southbound direction, then spotted a third light traveling from a west to east direction (also traveling slowly).  There was some distance between the two original lights; about the width of your thumb if holding it up toward the sky.  After a couple minutes, the southern-most light was no longer visible, then the other one also disappeared.  This left the third light still in sight.  This light now turned and headed north toward us. We were hoping that it would pass over us so we could get a better look, but it turned south again and disappeared after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what these lights were, but I did wonder if they were flames suspended below small balloons.  The only problem with this theory is that they changed direction. How would two move north to south, and a third move west to east, then head north before turning 180 degrees and heading south?   One other note: while watching this, we saw a police cruiser with blue lights on heading south on Rt 16 in the direction of the lights.<n>

Then another two followed it they seem to glow but also looked like a balls of fire.  They seemed to move quickly but where silent and it was hard to judge the height.  I told my girls to let&#39;s go around the corner to get a better look as we turned the corner we watched them go southeast towards St Lukes hospital.  My daughter then said look daddy theres more, which was another three that travelled the same route but seemed a little lower. We are now walking down Court street which is a oneway heading east we watched them as we walked about three blocks we seen the last three come over the house behind us again going the same direction.  As we walked another block we seen a lady walking on James St turning on Court and I asked if she seen the lights she said yes.  My youngest daughter was cry! ing about she was scared of the fire.  The four of us seen a couple on a porch on Court between James and Tremont he was recording the last ones  we seen which actually looked like they moved together as one.  Then when we got closer to the house we seen a group of teenagers 6 of them or so who said they had seen them also.  I tried to take two videos only one could you see a little but it&#39;s only a two megapixel phone camera. I would like to know if anyone could explain these.  Thank you.<n>

At 7:42 PM, my son was driving his car near Buttonwood Park, in the City’s West End, when he saw five bright orange fireballs in the night sky.  The fireballs seemed to be playing tag with each other, and their movement formed symmetrical patterns.  He phoned us about it so we went outside to check them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once in the street, we immediately saw the objects flying over the house in single file, and they made no sound. Every 30-seconds or so, a new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon.  It followed the same path in the sky as if in a procession.  Our son arrived at the house and the three of us continued to watch from the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireballs were orange and red on the outside and using binoculars, the center looked bright white. To the naked eye, the fireballs appeared to be about two to three times the size of Jupiter.  Jupiter gives the appearance of a big bright star, and is currently the largest object in night sky beside the moon.  I would guess that the objects were flying well above the stratosphere at tremendous speed as they covered half the sky in about 30-seconds!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireballs moved past us and onto a point just above the Eastern horizon where they would congregate in groups of three.  Once the third fireball arrived and completed the group, the three would move close together and then disappear.  One of the fireballs changed color to white and moved just above an orange one.  The two merged together and then disappeared together.  Evidently they don’t need three to make an exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see that the fireballs seemed to be playful in their movement about each other, and they were capable of changing color to yellow, orange, red, or white.  The last fireball reached its Easterly destination at about 8:10 PM and then disappeared with its two mates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not get any pictures but found many videos and pictures of fireballs just like them on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I approached the formation, I realized each individual object was much too large to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pulled my vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway where there were three other cars parked. The drivers of the cars and myself stood on the side of the road and looked into the sky.  One of the drivers counted 30 objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was in the sky approximately at the height of what an airplane would fly and was moving very slowly as a unit from south to north.  There was no noise and the unit appeared to be “floating”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gradually, each bright light would fade out as it moved to a certain point.  Finally, the last bright light faded out but came back to partial light again, showing the formation of what appeared to be a disc with lights encompassing it.  Gradually, this object once again faded out, with the duration of visibility being approximately 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be exceptionally sober-minded and objective, in her description of the sighting.

Because it looked strange and not like a plane or a shooting star we rushed downstairs and outside. It was easy to follow in the clear sky.

The light was bright white and descended very rapidly behind tree line, perhaps into the river.  The weather conditions last night were absolutely clear with a bright, nearly full moon.

Weird jelly fish like spacecrafts<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was on the way to pick up my mother from the Memphis international airport, I witnessed a strange object in the southwestern sky. At first I thought it might of been a weird drift of a cloud that drifted away from the cloud mass. As I was observing it closer I could tell it was definately not a cloud. It was a long and slim. It seemed to have a rounded front and what seemed to be long tentacle like rods coming out the backside. My 5 year old witnessed it and said it was a jellyfish, and no doubt it looked like a metal machine jellyfish. But it seemed like it was south of the airport but within 50 miles of it. It did not move it seemed as though it was hovering. I know what an airplane looks like becuase there were many airplanes in the sky at this time and it was not an airplane! As we observed this strange object we found two more that were very close to this one. They created a line that  seemed to lead to the Mississippi river. By this time we were f! reaking out and as we approached a tree line, we couldn&#39;t see them for less than 10 seconds, when the trees cleared they were gone, nowhere to be seen, as if they vanished into thin air. Another good description would be, if you&#39;ve ever seen war of the worlds, the huge tripod machines is what came to my mind but these were airborne not walking around zapping people. I have heard of &#34;probes&#34;?? and this seems to be the case. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but I&#39;m pretty freaked out by this.<n>

(It looked more beautiful than the picture shows)...   I asked T to take pictures of the circular cloud as I was driving (she tried to focus on the circular formation cloud on the lower right side of the picture).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I downloaded all of my pictures today from my camera to my laptop and casually looked through them, I am uncertain as to just what was to the right of a plane captured in the left hand side of the picture?  This object is not in the other pictures she took so it can not be from the windshield...  I have other pictures and the object is not in them!... Just wanted to share and see if anyone else wanted to take a more in depth look…<n>

She was adamant that it was more than clouds, I strained to see it (only slight dawn light).  She noted that it did not have lights like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her it was a promotional balloon likely for a car dealership in Sherwood Park.  At this point I was at Ellerslie and Parsons Road intersection.  I could make out the orange tail in the shape.  I had decided to drive east to watch the sunrise and my daughter watched the shape (which I thought was nothing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove east on the Anthony Henday, we noticed the shape started moving and quite fast.  It had appeared almost suspended previously, thus the promotional balloon explanation - except quite high and large.  I then realized it was forsure not a promotional balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we got to Hwy 14 and the Anthony Henday, I pulled over and we watched the shape disappear into the clouds.  There was a white suv heading east on the Anthony Henday that would have seen it too if they were looking into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter drew the image immediately after we returned home.<n>

10/8/11 23:58|Redondo Beach|CA|Circle|7 mins.|7 spherical orange lights/UFO's w/ rectangular aura sighted in night sky at Redondo Beach, Ca.  10-8-11 at  23:58|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84605.html|495|ndxe201110| 7 spherical orange lights/UFO&#39;s w/ rectangular aura sighted in night sky at Redondo Beach, Ca.  10-8-11 at  23:58<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:58 on Saturday 10-8-11, I was smoking a cigar by the pool in my apartment complex when the security guard on duty came running by shouting to follow him quickly.  When we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation.  By the time I was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky.  They seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear.  Duration was about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single UFO moving toward us slowly. It was closer this time. The best description I can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn&#39;t a lantern. It was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. The rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. It soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. Almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 00:05 10-9-11, another single UFO appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. Again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. There was never any sound. There was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. Almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. I have posted the videos I took from my Droid3 phone onto Youtube. The cell phone videos don&#39;t do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. But at least it was recorded! Here are the links for your review. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to send it via email because the file sizes are too big. I work in sales/promotions at the Los Angeles Times and the security guard was an MP in the army during his tour in Iraq.

I&#39;ve been scouring the internet but, to my dismay I have not found anyone else who has reported seeing these things.  I see them all the time.  The other night I saw one driving north on route 29 near Charlottesville.  It appears at first to be a star shining quite brightly but not moving very much if at all.  Then, getting closer to it, you begin to make out a red light and a blue light, one on each end, and the bright white light in the center.  They fly very slowly, at a few hundred feet in the air, and the lights seem to flicker in a random pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, after you&#39;ve finished laughing and saying &#34;Um, yeah, they&#39;re called airplanes....,&#34; last winter one flew directly over my house and didn&#39;t make a sound.  It was NOT an airplane.  It was first flying in one direction, sort of in the direction of my house but not completely, and when it turned towards my house fully the bright light appeared to be a spotlight--I could see the light reflecting off of the ground--it appeared as if whoever was flying it was looking for something.  As it flew over my house, maybe five hundred feet above, I could see it was triangular with that same configuration of lights that seem to flicker in a random pattern and again it was completely silent.  It really freaked me out.<n>

As it approached the white flickering light appeared instead to be a flame. The object was not a hot air balloon, though, as the light was in front of the bright sphere, not beneath it.   I could tell also that the object clearly was not a helicopter.   I tried to get my passenger to look at it, but by the time he looked up the view of the sphere was obscured by the roof of my car.   There were planes in the distance, but none near me.   Even after opening my window I heard no sounds which would have been from a flying craft.   I have never seen such a brilliantly glowing reddish-orange sphere before. It looked large, but as I had no real frame of reference, I cannot say the actual size.<n>

I will describe this as best I can.  For lack of anything else we have seen like this I will use the Space station for comparison.  Seen at an altitude less then a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are avid Sky gazers and regularly catch the Space Station when able to view. First let me say what it wasn’t.  This was not the Space Station, even though it went across the sky at the Speed of the Space Station. Nor was it at the altitude of the Space Station.  This was much closer, half the height of the highest commercial plane.  The Space Station, even at it’s lowest points on the horizon is a bright white and shiny, with straight definable edges and moving super fast across the sky.   My wife and I seen a Bright, deep burnt orange colored  ball with No tail, such as a shooting star, moving through the sky. Darker at the center, slightly lighter at the leading edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting behind our house on the west side facing north.  The object came from the East South East direction across the north end of our house.  moving North at about 30 to 35 degrees at it highest point, in comparison to our regular sightings of the space station.  The object  was around 3 times the size of the Space Station at it’s closest point right after it came out from behind the house and diminished as  moved away toward the north..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don’t’ think it was a space craft, it never changed direction or speed.  Don’t’ think it was a comet or shooting star, it had no tail, yet it looked hot, glowing as if still burning hot from entering from outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what this was but after passing Peoria Illinois, someone, Some Where between Rockford, Il. and Chicago, Il. Had to of seen this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the most highly visible skyward events we have ever seen. And that is saying something for us, because within the last week or so we seen a shooting star moving east to west that brightened our  backyard before burning out. We were not looking up at the sky at the time, it was our yard getting brighter that made us look up to notice this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone else out there enjoyed the bright burnt orange object in the sky tonight. We sure did!<n>

There was a bright orange coloured ball moving silently from east to west.  I couldn&#39;t tell how high in the sky it was, but it was brighter than the north star and larger, so it was probably lower.  It was moving at a good rate of speed, but much slower than a satellite, faster than a passenger jet.  I thought it may have been a satellite, but if it was it was enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen fighter jets coming out of the American air base south of us before, in the daytime, flying in formation, and they are loud and obvious.  (And they probably shouldn&#39;t be flying into Canadian airspace, but they do.)  This was quite different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the first orange sphere proceeded across the sky in a straight path, two more appeared behind it, one on either side, then another two, and finally one at the tail end.  So kind of a formation, maybe a pentangle shape.  This kind of freaked us both out. All of them appeared to be travelling together, same rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued east to west until we could no longer see them. There was absolutely no sound at all. They were very round, but at the rear end (facing east) they looked blurry.  Strangest thing we have ever seen! Too bad nobody can actually say what they are.<n>

It will sit still for about 30 minutes to an hour then move north.  At first I thought maybe it was a star but then it moved north at a slow rate of speed.  It could possibly be a helicopter but for it to hover for so long seems odd.  There are no flashing lights like an aircraft but it shimmers and it looks like a spinning top.  It appears as if it is watching Dulles airport in Virgina as we are in the flight path of planes taking off.<n>
10/8/11 20:15|Indianapolis|IN|Triangle|About 2-4 mins|It was one craft with white lights going very slow, then stopped, then the craft went back the way it came 3x it's original speed.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84437.html|511|ndxe201110| It was one craft with white lights going very slow, then stopped, then the craft went back the way it came 3x it&#39;s original speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of this sighting was at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis, IN.  But i live in Brownsburg, IN. I was there for a marching band competition, and I was facing east, and the object was heading to my left. My friend which was standing next to me also saw the object.  I saw the object for maybe 2-4 minutes, and the time was between 8pm-8:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed large, and it was maybe a mile or so from where i was. I only saw the lights of the craft, I never saw any body to it.  The lights on the craft, which were white and there was two lights which did not change color.  The lights were close to each other, and appeared to be just a straight line. It was about maybe at a 40-45 degree angle from where I was standing. The reason I was watching this was because it was moving pretty slow, slower than a man made aircraft, and the lights were not blinking like planes, helicopters, etc usually have.  The lights also seemed like they were flickering a little ! at times but neither light was ever turned off.  It traveled east and it stopped after slowing down slightly, then stayed in the same spot maybe 3-5 seconds, then the lights became a little brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that without turning around it went the way from which it came, and now i could see a third white non-blinking light which was the same size and color as the other two. These three lights made a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After starting back from the way it came, the craft was going maybe two to three times it&#39;s original speed. My view was blocked by a tree in the distance, about a minute after it starting going back from the way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after that my view was blocked because of buildings and trees etc in the distance. I do not know if there were any noises or anything because there were bands practicing around us, and lots of people talking. I did not see it again after that for the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Please, if an investigator calls me, I cannot accept calls during school hours, which is 7:50 am-2:50pm.  Any other time on a weekday after 3pm, except Tuesdays and Thursdays between 6:30-9pm which I have marching band practice.  Or after noon on Sundays would be fine to call. I am busy with marching band on saturdays until the season is over in a couple weeks. I also could communicate through e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this young witness, and he sounded to us to be a quite sober-minded young man.  We hope that the other witness to the event will submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

Left of the moon. I saw them one at a time about 30 seconds apart turn a light yellow and disappear as they got to the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they passed in fornt of the moon one by one and turn to a black large disk. They covered half the moon in passing.  I then went to get my binoculars and camera.  Me and 3 other people saw them as very black circular objects traveling through the sky, viisable to the eye.  Through the binoculars i saw a very large disk traveling towards Hermiston Oregon.  The last object i saw appeard left to the moon.  It was very bright red, and did the same as the others, but did a little zig zag motion. After it passed the moon, I looked through the binoculars again and was very amazed at how large and somewhat slow motion it was traveling.  The black disks were very visiable.<n>

They traveled in front of the moon one at a time.  They were oval shaped and very black in color.  As they got passed the moon I could clearly see with my eyes very large and black disk shaped objects travel towards the hill.  The last ball of light that appeared in the sky was very bright red, then turned orange.<n>

It was traveling towards the moon.  As it got closser to the moon it got smaller and changed to light yellow.   Then it disappeard.  It then passed infront of the moon, it was black oval shaped.  It got more of a circle shape as it traveled thru the cloudy sky.  I saw a total of 7 objects tonight.  They were about 30 seconds apart from eachother. As they passed infront of the moon, they blocked out half of the moon.<n> <n><n> The last one was bright red and did zig zag motion once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got binoculars, I clearly saw a very large circle shaped object black object.

It was partly cloudy that night, but in the area I saw the flash, it was pitch black and this flash was almost pure white.  I turned and went in that direction to see if I could see anything else but didn’t.<n>

As usual, I stood on the edge of the deck looking up at the sky.  This position puts me facing almost due north. It is a perfectly clear night with minimal light pollution.  Just as I started to look down, I caught a glimpse of movement and looked back up.  I saw 6 cigar-shaped objects appear in the area where I saw movement.  They were very high and faint, but were light orange-colored on the tips, with a darker appearance in the center.  They  moved quickly from East to West in a straight line, then as I watched, moved into a delta cluster of 4 objects, with the remaining 2 tucking in together to the north side of the delta.  They were out of sight in 8-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we walked down the sidewalk, I looked up and saw an orange orb/fireball thing heading across the sky.  I kept saying to my husband, &#34;What is that?   What is that?&#34;   But he (who is usually my debunker) had no response.  He kept saying it had no propulsion.  (I had to ask him what that meant.)I slowly took out my iPhone and just snapped.  The fireball object traveled slowly and steady NW, (maybe towards Lake Erie?).  We watched it until it was out of sight.   I will email two photos.  One is the fireball object, and the second is what it looked like after it traveled further away and was almost out of sight.  I’m not sure how high up it was, but it was low enough to catch our eye.  We were near the airport, but in this area, we are used to the landing patterns of the airplanes and this was definitely not an airplane.  Also, the airplanes that evening were landing to the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love it if someone looked at this and could explain what we saw.  So, if it’s not a UFO, oh well, but we are still scratching our heads!<n>

There was regular commuter air traffic at high altitude from west to east, just south of our position.  Lower in the sky to our south, but slightly west of our position, we observed a ball of orange light moving in the sky that was peculiar in several respects: first, unlike an aircraft, it exhibited no strobe or other marker lights.  Second, in its undeviating travel, it was moving due north; as it passed us, it made absolutely no sound--we had been able to hear the faint whine of jet engines at an apparently much higher altitude, but this object made no sound at all.  I was hoping to hear something-the buzz of a propeller that would explain what we were observing-any sound at all, but there was none.  Finally, the apparent size, shape and luminous output of the obje! ct remained constant as it crossed the sky from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be traveling at approximately the same altitude as many small aircraft we&#39;ve observed over the years at our location: approximately 4,000 to 5,000 feet MSL.  This object appeared to be moving more quickly than most aircraft in our area, completely transiting the sky in about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be an orange sphere (deep orange-red at the perimeter, a similar color to an NBA basketball at the center, where the glow was brightest).  Its luminosity was similar to an aircraft landing headlight, but this glow did not change during the entirety of its transit, neither to diminish nor to increase as it passed.  This indicates one of two things: a luminous sphere (which is what it appeared to be); or an orange-colored landing light aimed directly at us during the due-north travel of the object (obviously improbable).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be similar in size to the cabin of a small aircraft, such as a Cessna 182, though the transit appeared to be faster than a typical propeller-driven aircraft; .  The object appeared to pass within a half mile or so to our west at the indicated altitude, at about 30 degrees declination from zenith.  Again, per GPS it was moving due north (not magnetic).<n>

I was on the telephone (connected to my car speakers) with my friend. While I was sitting in my driveway for an elapsed time of about 20 minutes talking to my friend, I noticed a dark large object very low in the sky that had caught my attention from my peripheral vision. I could not believe my eyes. I was staring at this bronze flying object gliding extremely low in the sky with colorful flashing lights.  It was an oval shape, a dark bronze color with very large square windows that had red, yellow, and blue (and/or green) lights that flashed in a circular motion throughout the craft (at very fast speeds the lights were flashing around). I was shocked and while still connected to my friend on the telephone, I explained what I was witnessing and said &#34;I cannot believe what I see! I am witnessing a UFO fly over me right now&#34;.  Of course, mos! t people&#39;s responses are &#34;Yea, right&#34; and that&#39;s exactly what my friend said. I opened up my car window and stuck practically my entire body out the window while I followed this object and did not take my eyes off of it.  It was gliding effortlessly throughout the sky, as it floated on by me with no noise coming from it. While it increased in height, there was an airplane within within what I presume as 150-300 feet moving in the opposite direction.  I watched as this airplane came so close to this object that I was fearful the airplane was going to collide with this object. Comparing the airplane to the craft, the craft appeared to be much larger to scale than the plane. This flying object had no wings, was a deep bronze color, and had brilliant colorful lights radiating from the 360 degree windows on the craft. As the plane flew past this craft, I continued to watch the craft get smaller and smaller as it flew further, and higher into the sky. I tried photographing what I w! as witnessing with my BlackBerry, but unfortunately could not ! get the camera to focus on what I was witnessing. As I watched, still with my head out my car window, the craft continued to float further and further away, and simply vanished into thin air. There was no clouds from what I saw in the sky, so unless it went into a fog, this thing literally vanished from my eyesight. I am 100% certain what I witnessed was a UFO.<n>

I was at Silverside Rd and Concord Pike in Wilmington, Delaware getting into my car at 13:00 when I looked up into the southwest clear blue sky and noticed something hovering and flashing in the sky.  I watched to see if it was a helocopter but it wasn&#39;t a copter or a plane.   I saw a plane on approach to Phl airport and the plane was aprox. 4000-5000 feet in the air and this UFO object was about 10,000 feet not moving in any one direction I couldn&#39;t hear any sound and it just seem to flash white light.  There was nothing in the sky and I was looking almost directly up so it was not a reflection.  I looked away and then could not locate the object as I searched to see if I could locate it again.<n>

This light was traveling from south to north.  The light was not white.  It was very bright, somewhere between the colors orange and red.  It was larger than any star in the sky; maybe 3 times the size of the largest star you see.  Of course it could be a meteor; but I do not think so.  It did not look like any meteor I have ever seen.  I have seen a lot of meteor showers.  It seemed like it was flying level and just over the lowest cloud layer.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is not much to this sighting.  It only lasted a couple of seconds.  If you extend your arms at full length, just over one and a half feet apart----the light traveled that much space in the sky in less than 2 seconds.  If you consider straight up as 90 degrees, then the light was traveling at about 70 degrees south to north.  I was standing near the corner of Washington Street and Front Street here in San Diego.  Front Street runs north and south, so I knew the direction the light traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have my watch with me to get the exact time, but the sighting was between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had rained earlier in the day; so there were patches of clear sky and low patches of rain clouds.   The light was not seen further north because the clouds blocked the view further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area has a lot of jet traffic for the San Diego airport.  This light was traveling at least 5 times faster than any jets in this area.   And again, no sound and the light was nothing like a meteor in my opinion.  The light seemed self contained and traveling flat just over the lowest clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar sighting reports from the same source.

I kept looking to see if it was the moon or what it was that I thought I saw.  As I continued looking at the woods I saw it again.  It came straight at me overhead when I realized I had no idea what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was red that looked almost like it might have been on fire but there wasn’t a flame.   It was coming from the northeast moving southwest.  It was much larger than a bright star but not as big as the moon.  It was round to oval in shape maybe the size of a quarter of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m going to guess it was flying as high as jets but maybe higher and if it was higher than I was about 50% larger than a jet.  There were no blinking lights as you would see on an airplane, just solid bright red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a visual on it for a total time of 1-2 minutes.  As it was flying southwest after it passed overhead it appeared to almost stall for a several seconds then just started moving again and got went out of sight.

Then a car was coming toward me on my left (at this area there is a large open field on my left).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what at first I thought was a falling star then I realized it was much larger maybe 2’ to 3’ in diameter, about 150 yards away.  It had colors flowing from it like a falling star.  They were red, yellow, blue, and orange flowing from around it and from behind it.  It was coming down toward the ground at about a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was just below tree tops and just above power lines it looked like it exploded as if it had hit the ground with all kinds of colors coming from it.  Then it looked like it continued going down the road in the  direction I was going staying below the tree line and just above power lines.  It had more of a yellowish/white light coming out from behind it at this time and was going about the speed you would think of a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a slight turn and went out of sight which was about direction road made at that point.

As I was driving I&#39;d gotten chills out of nowhere and looked around, my normal response to chills.  Thats when I&#39;d noticed a giant, bright, green ball of fire in the sky, with a trail of green and white light coming off of the back of it.  It looked as if it were literally glowing green, and when I strained my eyes to observe it a little better, it seemed like there may have even been something black inside of it.  It had appeared to be falling from the sky.  Immediately, I&#39;d turned down the music and turned to call my mom so I could make sure she, my son, and my family were okay, worried that it may have been falling towards my house...  But by the time I looked back up after dialing her number, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen a UFO incident, just the first time it&#39;s scared me enough to want to tell people, as well as the closest (even though it really wasnt very clos! e) I&#39;ve ever seen anything like this.<n>

I had been out with another one of my classmates by her house.  The light was great, the sky was completely clear.  I hadn&#39;t seen a cloud in days.  After a while my dog looked really tired so I decided to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the field that we were in to walk down the hill to get to my house (the whole neighborhood is on a giant hill) and as I turned the corner I went to take a picture that would show the Rule of Thirds (you could see a couple miles out down by the Golden Mile) and I noticed a weird sphere to the left of the water tower right before I took the picture.  I zoomed in and saw that it was a yellow, almost golden sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped 10 good photos of the object before I had to hurry in because my sister was cooking dinner and had gotten in over her head and needed my help A.S.A.P.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got in and helped her, I sat down and uploaded the pictures onto my computer.  I was amazed because there were some lines to the bottom left of the sphere that I hadn&#39;t seen when I was looking at it in person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appear to maybe even be a series of small spheres floating a little ways from the craft.  So close they look like a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time I made my way down the hill I could see it. Sitting in the exact same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know if anyone else in the area saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t really think of what it could have been. Some may say it was a planet, but if you could see a planet that well with the naked eye, then I would be scared that it was that close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately North/North East.  And appeared like it may even have been over Camp David.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, and another thing is, I saw an unusual number of planes in the sky at the time, they weren&#39;t really near it, but there were more than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Just a side note that you can delete before posting this, I would like to be contacted by an investigator, but I would prefer to be contacted through email as I do not always have access to my phone because of school, work, etc.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the series of photos, and the object appears consistent with a helium-filled weather balloon.

After stepping into a location where I could see a larger section of sky, I finally located a sillhouette of what would appear to be a passenger 747 at standard crusing altitude for commercial traffice in the area.  This had no visible contrail and compared to a typical passenger jet appeared to be flying at around 3 times a normal jet.   Based on the altitude the jet could be heard as well, very loud as well as clearly which was unusual in this area, much less at that volume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on my normal views of airplanes this should not have been heard, again it was the sound that caught my attention to begin with thinking a military jet was approaching as I had seen f-14&#39;s in the area a few days prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cell phone has a compass on it and after tracking the object for approximately 10 seconds by sight it dissapeared much quicker than any 747 at that altitude I had ever observed.  I had aproximately 20 seconds of hearing something approach and 10 seconds of visual on the jet.  Using my compass, it was headed at aproximately 225 degrees sw of my location. I know this doesn&#39;t fit into a typical report, but the whole scene did not fit the general feel of a typical 747 commercial jet , altitude, sound and speed of what you would normally think. If it can be determined this was a normal commercial flight, at least maybe weather patterns and temperature etc would help identify other things that you get reported.<n>

One of the boys sighted a swarm of about ten (10) fuzzy white orbs zig-zagging through and about the clouds in the overcast sky just east of the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA.  They watched these &amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot; white lights for about five-minutes as they turned west onto Avenue 12 toward Madera, CA.  As they drive west, the boys encouraged the mother to turn the car around, which she did, to return to the intersection.  The mother then turned north onto Highway 41 while  they all watch the lights swarm around through the clouds.  Just east of the same intersection is a barn and many ongoing acres of open farmland/ranchland.  According to the boys, some of these fuzzy white lights had a small star-like center to them.  Additionally, on the ground, to the viewing-right (e.g., south) of the reference barn (as see! n from the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12) there was also seen a large triangle-shape (tip of triangle pointing upwards).  This object had blinking white lights at each tip of the large triangle.  The mother turned the vehicle around, from north to south, on Hwy 41 and drove home.  They do not have any explanation as to what they saw in the distance that night.  There is a creek that runs north to south near this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on my back deck star gazing and enjoying some beverages.  When I looked in the sky to what appeared to look like a star but it was shimmering orange. I t stayed stationary for at least a minute.  I took my eyes off it and just figured it was a star.  Then I decided to check and see if it was still there.  When I looked it accelerated and started breaking apart. It looked like it had a spot light in the front as it was breaking apart.  It flew right above my head in the night sky.  As it flew above my head it formed a triangle shape and had 3 red lights and a black mass in the middle.  It continued threw the sky until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strongly believe what I saw was not from this planet.  I do not know the exact trajectory or elevation. If I had to guess I saw it rise in the West and then fly above me and disappear in the East.  Elevation I would say when it was at its highest point maybe a couple thousand feet but it was not flying extremely high at all. It did accelerate quickly and then stop on a dime and break out into the triangle with red lights then it cruised slowly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you for your time what I saw was incredible I have also seen 4 other UFO&#39;s through out my life time.  It is an incredible adrenaline rush to see them.  I have had witnesses before but this time I was by myself.<n>

The large object had a boomerang shape with one light on one end, a light on the other end, and one light in the middle.  My daughter and I both were surprised by what we were seeing and told her to roll her window down and look out the window.  She heard a humming sound.  Nothing like a helicopter or plane sound.  It moved above us real slow and low.  We continued to watch it until it was out of sight.  We both got chills up our back and didn&#39;t know what it was.

The first night I was leaving work and noticed a large glowing fireball low in the sky directly down from my work. I sat and watched it slowly hover and brightly glow for about two minutes.  It then separated into two pieces and flashing red and white like a normal plane.  They then began to loosely circle my location moving very slowly.  I looked around and noticed 4 or 5 similar plane like crafts hovering at the perimeter.  These events all took place near Corparate Drive in CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began my trip back to Norwalk a little shaken and realized while traveling route 8 that they were everywhere in the night sky flying low and making moves atypical of a plane. I noticed 4 distinctive types so theses may have been different crafts or the same craft changing forms. The first craft is a glowing or burning ball usually rising up or sinkin into the horizon. The second ! craft appears as alternating red or white strobe lights. They would flash in a line across the sky extremely quickly but occasionally they would jump backwards. I noticed as many as 10-15 of these flashing probe crafts in a grouping. At times it appered they were going to crash into the highway due to the deep dives they woul take. The third craft resembled a small black plane but it was octagon or triangle shape. These could pass as military planes if they weren&#39;t so low to the ground and making such dangerous moves low to the highway and trees. These are what I think the glowing balls turn into. I did notice that some of the black triangles were often shadowed by a small re or white light craft that would stick by it&#39;s side for a while or dart away. I also noticed black craft that might resemble a helicopter but clearly were smaller almost like they were seated bodies encased in metal flying around. These types of events replayed themselves over the evenings of Oct 5th-7t! h from Trumbull to rt 8 to 95 south to Norwalk heaviest betwee! n 7 and 9 but sporadically all night. I caught some of the sightings from the second floor of my building which has twin 8 foot windows that look out over a few miles. Most of these indoor sightings were glowing balls that morphed into triangle crafts with rows of red, white and green lights. The important thing to note is I rarely heard any type of noise from any of these crafts except for a couple times that the glowing balls morphed to crafts and made a faint helicopter sound. Many sightings took place in my condos parking lot with three other witnesses. The date was Oct. 6th, 2011 at 8:30 PM and we saw the strobe lights countless times all over the sky,  approximately 6-8 glowing balls morph into planes, 8-10 low flying black triangle craft with red and white rows of light, and finally 2 apparent military craft long and skinny very high in the sky leaving behind a long smoke plume. One followed behind the other in a perfect line. Myself and the other three witnesses realized tha! t despite how high these were and how incredibly fast they were moving in the direction the black craft went, they were the only crafts we saw that made any sound whatsoever. I was unable to film or take pictures of any of this but I am purchasing a high quality video camera to film because I have a nagging sense that this may start to be a frequent occurrence.<n>

Sky pretty dark for urban area.   Looking with 12x60 binoculars in the &#34;summer triangle&#34; for asterism called the &#34;coat hanger&#34;;   I was looking up toward zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then,  I saw an oval, dim, cloud-shaped object speeding  from north toward south across my field of vision. ( size in 12x60 Oberwerk binoculars was approx. 1/6 the diameter of my field).  This thing moved too quick - it was not familiar.  (I know how fast a satelite moves when viewed through binocs and this thing was moving 10x faster than any satellite!   In fact, a north-south satellite came a few minutes later and it was moving comparatively much slower than the &#34;oval cloud&#34; that preceded it.)  It&#39;s possible that the light source for the &#34;fast moving cloud&#34; may have been moonlight.  There was a moon just past first quarter to the east of the north south traverse of the &#34;object&#34;.  It&#39;s, as if,  a  translucent substance  with an oval or circular structure, passed above me and somehow refracted some moonlight ( or else had a dim light of its own).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look at the &#34;summer triangle&#34; area with the 12x60 binocs but only saw a &#34;real&#34; satellite running its North-South traverse approx 2 minutes later.  I noted that the satelite had a characteristic &#34;drift&#34; towards the west; whereas, the previous, suspicious  &#34;object cloud&#34;  ran a perfect straight line from North to South. at a speed that was easily 8 to 10 times faster.<n>

It was approx. 7:30pm and just approaching dusk.  I had gotten up to go into the house (walking towards the back door up the driveway) when my husband said “What is that? Come look at this” I turn back around, looked south (our home faces south) and saw a very large and bright orange/red glowing object. It looked to be heading in a strong North/West direction on a steady path.  I have lived on this same block for 40 years and I am in the path of arriving and departing planes from Metro airport.  I can tell you that there have been only a couple of times when I’ve seen a plane that low flying in an East or West direction. We continued to stand in awe and must have asked each other five times “what is that?”   I want to say it looked like something large was on fire. Its diameter was approx. two to three times the size of our brightest stars. It was not an airplane I know that for sure.  The s! ky was clear and beautiful and there was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my binoculars and when I came back out it was still in sight.  There are a lot of trees so my field of view was becoming limited.  I have a powerful pair of binoculars and it is often hard to find objects right away because of this (plus I was nervous).  I had to keep taking them down to estimate the position because it was still traveling on its path.   At one of these times, my husband gasped and said “It stopped glowing; now it’s black.”   I had only maybe 30 seconds left of viewing and I still couldn’t bring it into view with the binoculars so I just stood there staring at the black object until it left our view.  After the fire faded, the object appeared to be a lot higher than I had originally thought. It was so far up there that I could not discern the size or shape of it. It did seem like I was seeing a flat object though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still dusk so it was light enough to know what it was not.  It was not a lantern, hot air balloon, or airplane.  Aircraft lights are not huge, orange, or glowing.  Even at this time of day aircraft lights are not even visible yet.   Wind does not usually carry things westerly as far as I know.   I am more than curious as to what this was.<n>

It was orange and bright very fast i was going 60 mph to catch up to it everyone out that night had to of seen it.  The others i see quite frequently ive seen nine at a time but they are extremely high in the sky i show my oldest son them and we watch them as if they are playing in the sky they are bright white kinda like a star they move in odd formations very acute angles.living in the country is a big plus due to visibility in sky due to artificial lights.  My parents seen two triangular ones playing one night they had three lights on them one at each point as the crafts got closer to land they disappeared fast as lightning. Ive also encountered a strange beast in 2000 with my friend..<n>

I originally gained interest because it was just too high and too near the airport to be an airplane, being that airplanes are either descending or ascending in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a special object which seemed to almost have an aura around it.  My sister and I were both looking at it when we mentioned it to one another. It drifted, very slowly, from east to west. It was almost slug like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it drifted, it seemed to almost disappear at times but would regenerate right after.  My sister claimed to lose sight of it, but i maintained an eye on it. It did that about two times and just shortly after its last reappearance, its completely disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most compelling thing about it was that there were ABSOLUTELY NO clouds in the area which it was in.  It was also nothing like an airplane in that it didnt have that distinctive shape nor did it have a trail. Which is a characteristic of airplanes that fly at that altitude.  It also moved so slowely that it was surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest thing that I could compare its disappearing and reappearing to, would be how a flat object with a lot of surface area is clearly visible, but when its rotated to a side view, its nearly invisible.<n>

It was hovering for about 30 seconds, pretty low in the sky and appeared to be moving very slowly at first.  Out of curiosity, I got up out of my bed to get a better look, the disk than seemed to have vanished towards the east and was no longer visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object was much larger than a plane - It was a clear sky; no clouds or other visible objects in the sky -<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer was very bright, Unlike any other structure explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the best way i can explain its shape is somewhat a cheeseburger appearance :P<n>

However, as I was looking at it, it grew brighter, and appeared to become 3 glowing objects close together.  Just then two other orange lights appeared in the same area of the sky, forming a triangle (for a split second it seemed to be one giant object).  The first object went back to one glowing light as the other two went out.  Then the object faded out, as if moving away.<n>

I watched it for another 10 minutes until clouds moved in and obscured the object.  It appeared to be very high in altitude but was very stable, not moving, not varying in shape, and had very defined triangular shaped points that were very bright.<n>
10/5/11 04:00|Idaho Falls|ID|Disk|5-10 minutes|Bright neon flashes seen across city along with power outages, and a molten-gold colored disk with smaller disks coming off of it.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104135.html|584|ndxe201110| Bright neon flashes seen across city along with power outages, and a molten-gold colored disk with smaller disks coming off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all in the garage listening to music at late hours of the night. My friend and I noticed a very bright, aqua-blue flash in the window and at first disregarded it but then the power started cutting in and out along with the flashes, so we got very curious, and decided to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now the rest of the crew inside noticed it too, and it was quite the sight. It was the early, darkest hours of the morning but the sky was ablaze as if the sun were up, only in strange, neon colors. The best way to describe it would be like a massive lens going across a light source that was as bright as the sun in mostly variations of blue and green, but also with some brief flashes of pink and red colors. To get an idea of how bright it was, at least two other people that weren&#39;t with us at that house saw the light too with the same intensity and they were at least a few miles across town!  These lights went on for at least another 5 minutes, and all the while, the power was cutting in and out which had to have meant there was an EMP or something like that. Another part of this experience is very noteworthy. We also noticed a floating object in approximately the southeast direction of the sky. It looked like a huge disk made of molten gold, almost like how photos of the sun look. It also had about five other smaller disks that looked the same, attached by some type of energy bolts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just like that, it was all over.  We were all exhilarated, afraid, and amazed.  Most of us described it as &#34;the sky getting hax-ed.&#34;  Ever since I&#39;ve wondered if there was some type of glitch in reality as we know it, or if there&#39;s some type of technology we haven&#39;t been told about, or if we were visited by extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, there had to have been amazing power behind it to do the things it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve also looked for answers as to if it could have been a power outage, the Northern Lights, or meteors, and none of those explanations make sense.  I checked the news and there wasn&#39;t a single report of it. It still boggles my mind to this day, so I&#39;m still looking for similar accounts and telling people about it whenever it comes up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope something other-worldly like that visits me again someday!  But if it was some low-key technology, I hope the government grows a pair and informs the public. The search continues, I guess!<n>

10/4/11 20:30|Pohang (South Korea)||Light|45 min|Over 70 soft lights seen hovering over Pohang, South Korea.|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84483.html|588|ndxe201110| Over 70 soft lights seen hovering over Pohang, South Korea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, October 4th I was walking east to our car as I had just left my cousin’s football practice on the campus of Handong Global University in Pohang, South Korea. As I was walking, I observed many of the students (over 30 of them) stopped in the middle of the street staring, pointing, and taking pictures of the sky. This was just around 8:30pm and the sun had set a while ago. I stopped to see what they were looking at when I noticed about 10 soft floating light suspended in the sky. I took a few pictures from that spot [location 1] and then tried to get a better look by moving to the other side of the building (since I could barely see them, as they were blocked by trees and a dormitory).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the other side of the dormitory [location 2] and took a few more pictures. Still I could not get a good enough view. I then walked east a bit more and walked down a path through the trees that led me to a field where I had an unobstructed view of the lights [location 3].<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time progressed the amount of lights grew from around 10 to a final count of over 70. The lights were soft and in the shape of a sliver. They did not move up or down, nor side to side. They just hovered in the sky. Some were white while most were yellow/amber with a handful of them almost chartreuse in hue. They looked like a distant street lamp seen through the fog. I didn’t see any certain point of light, just a glow. I could not tell if the “sliver” shape were light flares or if it was the actual shape of the object (all of the lights kept the exact same shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few more images of these lights from the field before my cousin called me to tell me that we had to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin tried to tell me that these were military flares, but I have seen military flares before and they looked nothing like these lights.  These lights did not move!   At this point, we drove back to his house in Pohang, which was about 10 minutes away from the campus.  He dropped me off two blocks away from his house at my hotel.  When I got back to my room, I told my friend who has been traveling in Korea with me about the lights and showed him my pictures.  He was as dumbfounded as I was. After an hour we left the hotel and walked over to my cousins house.  As we were walking we noticed the same lights now hovering above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my friend took some pictures with his camera, but recently lost that camera in a taxi here in Seoul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached some of my photos in a separate email.<n>

I have some college education, but no degees.  I have lived in all over the USA but am currently residing in the area I was born in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 4Th, 2011, around 8:00 pm, I was driving home from a day of running errands.  As I drove down the street I live on, I glanced down another street that angles off at a Y intersection.  Above our neighborhood clubhouse, I saw a mass of lights that were appeared to be stationary and about 200 to 500 feet above the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  stopped my car, backed up a few feet and turned down that street to see what it was.  Of course I was thinking, &#39;It&#39;s a UFO!&#39; &#39;No, it can&#39;t be.&#39; &#39;Oh my gosh, it&#39;s a space ship!&#39;  I drove slowly as I looked at the mass of lights until I got almost directly under it.  I could see the whole underside of the craft and it was enormous! I could see that it was a triangle-shaped craft with lights running parallel to the edges but about a foot away from them.  The underside was slightly rounded and completely smooth.  I couldn&#39;t see any openings or interruptions in it&#39;s smooth, Grey-black metallic surface.  The lights were white, orange, red, green and blue and very bright. They weren&#39;t inset nor did they protrude.  They seemed to be a part of the underneath, which appeared to be almost fluid, like mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I slowed down to a stop in the middle of the street, it suddenly rotated and then moved up and across the street at an angle.  It was moving slowly enough that I could almost keep up with it, but I lost sight of it as I turned the corner.  Just past the corner there was a small group of people running toward the next corner.  One of the men yelled to me,  &#34;Did you see it?&#34;   I answered, &#34;Yes!&#34;   He replied, &#34;That was a freakin&#39; spaceship!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After slowing down at the stop sign, I followed the streets around toward my house and, as I turned back onto my street, I saw that it was moving right in front of me. It was then that I realized that my heart was pounding so hard that I could actually hear it.  Then I noticed that the craft was going straight toward my house, but, for some reason, I wasn&#39;t afraid. I was in awe of it&#39;s enormous size and the fact that I was witnessing something so spectacular!   As I approached my house, I realized that it had stopped again, this time just past my house, as if it was waiting for me. I pulled into the driveway and started honking the horn for my daughter to come outside and see it. I jumped out of the car and just as I was turning to run inside, it rotated and then darted over the trees, up and away so fast that it disappeared completely within a second. I was almost to the front door when I realized that I forgot to turn the car off or even shut the door. My purse was still inside it so I ran back, gathered my things, turned the engine off and ran inside to tell my daughter. I&#39;m still not sure if she believed me, even though my heart was still pounding really fast and hard and I was talking so fast she could barely understand me. I went back outside to see if the other people who saw it were still heading down toward my house, but they were gone. I couldn&#39;t find them and I don&#39;t know which house they lived in or if they were even ne! ighbors or visitors. I couldn&#39;t imagine going door to door asking if anyone had seen the UFO. I did ask my immediate neighbors but they were either gone or not looking outside at the time it appeared. I later watched the local news but there was no mention of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life! It was not any kind of aircraft I have ever seen. I have been online reading about new aircraft designs all day and can&#39;t find anything that looks in any way like what I saw. I also can&#39;t find any articles about aircraft that have been developed to move the way this space craft did; nothing that rotates before it moves away or hovers, even though it was as big as three large houses. It was totally silent and very fluid in it&#39;s movements. It really doesn&#39;t matter to me if anyone else believes that I saw a UFO because I know what I saw and it wasn&#39;t of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I think back about the incident, I realize that I was drawn to it in a strange way. The fear I expected to have was non-existent and was replaced by excitement and awe. I almost didn&#39;t have a choice of whether I drove away from it or straight toward it and, when it was gone, I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t coming back anytime soon. I didn&#39;t even think about driving around looking for it to appear somewhere else because I just knew it was gone. I had seen what I was supposed to see. It had fulfilled it&#39;s mission. Those were the feelings it left me with. But why did I need to see it? What happened to the other people I spoke to? They ran about a half mile from where I first saw them and yet, when I went back outside less than a minute later, they were gone. Where did they go? Isn&#39;t it human nature to stand around talking about something so unusual? Yet none of this seemed strange to me two nights ago when it happened. This has changed me forever. Even though I&#39;ve always believed t! here is life on other planets, this made it much more real than I could have imagined!<n>

The fireball had two swirling tails. One was the same orange/red color as the fireball and one was a lighter yellow.

I saw it one moment and it completely disappeard the next.  It did not appear to fly away, but rather just disappeared.<n>

Our Windows were down and there was no noise.  The UFO had white lights on its bottom.  It went over road just behind us and as soon as it passed over road it turned north north east.  It turned maybe 45 degrees. I could see lights under it when it went over.  It went over kohls and due to,traffic we had to go light wE green. I tried to,get a picture, traffic light cause too much glare.  However I just saw video of it on news. I can&#39;t imagine this object flying,so slowly and quietly and so low.  Maybe because it was so large but I&#39;ve,never seen anything like this.  I know at,least 10 other cars witnessed exactly what I did.<n>

Near our neighborhood, they spotted a large aircraft hovering above the road.  They said as they approached it, the craft did not move.  It was hovering in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they drew closer, they lost sight of the craft as their car drove under it. My daughter turned back and could still see it hovering behind the car through the back window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both described the craft as a distinct boomerang shape with a single, very large white light at the end of the two boomerang arms and a smaller yellow light at the tip of the “v”.   My wife said that it appeared to be the size similar to two large passenger jets hovering side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not stop, as there was no place to pull the vehicle over.  When they saw the craft, they were about a ½ mile from our home.  They pulled into our neighborhood and my daughter lost sight of it due to traveling down hill.  The trees blocked their view.  They phoned me as they were looking at it and I went outside with a video camera but was unable to see anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is an illustration based on their description:<n>

And about 10 minutes into throwing i look up and all of a sudden i see three bright lights.  Kinda looked like a triangle but the only thing i was only able to see were the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as soon as i saw it i kept calling my girlfriend about 5 to 6 times but by the time she got up it vanished.  I tried to see if it would appear again but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious and sober-minded.

I was aloneisa in my room trying to fall asleep but was having a bit of trouble due to the fact that I work a night job, and its difficult for me to fall asleep before the sun comes up (this was my night off by the way) so I&#39;m just laying on my bed, just staring at the ceiling.  Now, my room is totally pitch dark because of these huge curtains that block out the sun during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m staring at the ceiling, I have this sudden &#34;urge&#34; to look to my left were my television is up against the wall.  As I looked for about two maybe three seconds, I saw and heard two separate flashes of light along with two almost silent beeps simultaneously directly above my t.v. maybe about an inch or two above. the light was just pure light that&#39;s the only way I can explain it, no color, just white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I say to myself is &#34;what&#39;s my cell phone doing over by my t.v?  &#34; When I got up to investigate I found nothing there.  No cell phone, nothing electronic in that area at all. My television wasn&#39;t even plugged in at the time.  I don&#39;t have much more to say about this other then I&#39;ve thought out all possibilities and I just can&#39;t explain it.  It wasn&#39;t frightening at all, I was more in awe, just fascinated by the event. I then took a walk around my neighborhood just to think things out but then returned home and fell asleep.in the living room.  That is all<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for reading, and showing intrest. This is my first experience like this by the way. I&#39;m just an average 22 year old who works and goes to school like most young men my age.  I grew up here in Orange County California my whole life and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  Thank you!<n>

The sky is very clear here and I see satellites all the time....they basically look like moving stars as opposed to airplanes which have flashing lights, etc.  I was looking toward the northeast somewhat and fairly high up in the sky.

It followed the regular flight path of incoming flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was very odd shaped and all lit up in a bright neon green color, we assumed it was an explainable aircraft heading to the airport.  The shape looked like a life saver candy but the bottom had a large dimple similar to what a red blood cell looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passsed behind some trees, and we assumed it was going to the airport, it returned in the opposite direction and then stopped and hovered.  It dipped straight down very fast and just as fast, it rose again and hovered.  It then took off toward the northeast at a very high rate of speed (NOT toward the airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what we saw, but it did not seem to fit into any explanation we could come up with.<n>

It was moving at least twice as fast as the jet and was a few thousand feet higher that it as well.  We watched this object for about 3 or 4 minutes, then it was too far to see.  Twenty minutes later we seen an object that looked much the same as the last, except it was flying at a lower altitude.  This one we watched fly for a minute and then it stopped and hovered for about 20 seconds and then just completely disappeared like a bubble popping.  We were completely shocked!  Over the last month we&#39;ve been seeing a lot of these kind of sightings but never 2 in one day like this!<n>
10/2/11 17:44|Lake Springs|MO|Oval|1 minute|Three  opaque oval craft sighted over mid missouri.  with witnesses|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84510.html|610|ndxe201110| Three  opaque oval craft sighted over mid missouri.  with witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching a commercial air jet fly over my property toward Rolla, Missouri. which is north from where I live.   The jet passed and I saw these three crafts flying west.  The crafts were oval and opaque colored.  They seemed to have this slight glow about them.  The were high up and I saw two craft at first and they were flying close to one another, one was on top and the other flying underneath it,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed the third following the other craft slightly behind.  That is when I started seeing squiggles in my eyes and thought I was about to get a migraine.  I asked my neighbor and husband who were also outside talking if they could see it, and my neighbor said he could, but it was hard to tell, because he was getting a migraine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said it looked like those parachute spiders, but i don&#39;t think it was because these were high up, and disappeared finally in those wispy clouds.   Plus they flew in a straight line and sometimes they pulsed as if ! to stop in mid air then continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they were gone, my squiggles disappeared, and my impending migraine was gone.<n>

I suddenly got a migraine, and then I saw these three craft flying around the same vicinity.  These were headed west and they were oval shaped and looked opaque.  I had trouble seeing them because I had squiggles in my eyes (I get these when I am about to get a migraine)   I asked my neighbor and husband and they said they saw them too.  The male neighbor told me he was having trouble seeing them too because he was getting a migraine.  That maybe they were the parachute spiders and I didn&#39;t think so because they disappeared into the light wispy cloud cover.  What is really weird is that I never experienced a full blown migraine after the crafts left.<n>

10/2/11 04:50|Alligator Alley|FL|Triangle|10 minutes|Blinking Light on I-75|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84505.html|613|ndxe201110| Blinking Light on I-75<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occurred on Interstate 75 going from Naples to Miami on Sunday October 02, 2011, around 4:50 am.  If memory serves me correct, I was past the midway point from exit 80 to exit 49.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the only witness that I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That morning, I drove past electric banners displaying messages for me to slow down.   At some point, I noticed a blinking white light off in the distance.  I thought it might have been a light pole or one of those radio towers.  However, radio tower lights are usually red in color and light poles usual don&#39;t blink on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I assumed it was some kind of special speed sensor.   Anyone who&#39;s been on i-75 knows there are banners posted along the entire interstate cautioning drivers to slow down.  As it was still dark out, I couldn&#39;t see the banners until right before I passed them, naturally I drove the speed limit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lost in thought and what seemed like forever, I realize that I didn&#39;t seem to gain any sort of distance on the blinking light.  I became slightly curious as to why and what kind of light this was, as there is none on the highway and certainly none I have seen behaving like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sped up to 90mph out of curiosity so I could slow down when I approached the light.   As I gained distance, I leaned forward to look up and what I saw was a &#34;triangular shaped object&#34; with lots of light patterns that looked like they were from the movie Tron.  There were lines of light and half circle patterned lights connecting the lines.  The object in question was VERY detailed from my perspective and it could not be too far off the ground.  Perhaps 50-100 feet?  The sight of the object covered one quarter of my sight from the driver&#39;s point of view.  I slowed down dramatically and looked at my dog in disbelief.  I looked up again to confirm what I was seeing.  Then I looked behind me to see if there were any cars behind me... which there wasn&#39;t.  Instead, I quickly scanned in front of me for cars... and there were none either.  I looked up again and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to 45 mph while keeping my eyes peeled and waited for the blinking to happen.  There were no signs; it simply vanished.  There were no such audible noises either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find it hard to believe how the object projected a blinking light because the lights I saw were underneath the craft (which seemed flat) and while I had my eyes on them, they did not blink.  I&#39;m not sure if there were lights on the side or on top that caused the blinking.  From a distance, the blinking appeared to be bright, steady, and fading in and out at 3-5 second intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also note, my car did not experience any interference and my dog did not behave strangely.  I do not believe the craft to be malicious?   I googled my experience and have not seen a report of lights simular to what I saw that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am positive what I saw is not an aircraft.  I am in the military and have worked on an aircraft carrier for 5 years and I still work at an air station.  I know what aircrafts look like at night, how they take off and how they land.  I know how helos look like, how they look in the air at night, how they take off and land.  I&#39;ve seen hundreds of aircrafts and their associated behaviors.  I don&#39;t know what this object is though.  I hope someone can shed some light on this report.  I&#39;m interested to find out more.  Before I forget, I&#39;m also hesitant to drive i-75 at night anymore, but next time I&#39;m out there, I&#39;ll bring a camera.<n>

As I was walking toward the work truck, my mother became frantic saying she could see a blinking light in the sky.  I walked over and looked to where she was pointing and saw a red blue and red light in the night sky.  At first, I thought it was a star, but it was blinking in a sporadic manner.  I then called for my father to come look.  His initial reaction was that it was a plane.  The lights, however, did not move, just hovered.  Our next reaction was that it was a helicopter, but it stayed aloft for too long and was too high for a helicopter to hover from.  Plus, there was no discernible noise coming from it that we could hear. My father, as a sceptic went to grab his binoculars to try and identify what it was.  When each of us looked through it, the lights seemed to be moving in a circular pattern.  I tried to explain this away saying that my hands were shaking, but both my parents said it was mving in a circle when they looked, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes, my parents went inside and I went to leave for work. As I was pulling out of the driveway, though, I thought I saw 3 orange dots. I&#39;m not sure, because when I looked back a second time, I didn&#39;t see them.  Four hours later, when I brought the truck back, I again saw the flashing light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 4, 2011 at approximately 03:45, I saw the light for a third time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??

A few planes were in the sky also and could tell that this craft was at a further distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the craft for another 15 minutes as it moved up and down, side to side so very quickly.  I know it&#39;s not either a plane or helicopter because neither can move quickly from vertical to horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a female, 59 years old who lives in Texas where my husband sighted a UFO on our ranch in College Station about 7-8 years ago.  We own an oilfield service company.  My companion at the sighting today is my sister-in-law.  She&#39;s 61 years old and a psychologist.  The other person who witnessed this event is a friend who is 60 years old and teaches 5th grade in the local elementary school.<n>
10/1/11 22:00|McComb|MS|Rectangle|10 seconds|On a clear night while laying on a table witnessed a silent rectangle fully visible craft cross the sky aprrox.500" over trees|10/19/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84489.html|622|ndxe201110| On a clear night while laying on a table witnessed a silent rectangle fully visible craft cross the sky aprrox.500&#34; over trees<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending an event inside Percy Quinn State park. There was an after party/concert going on for riders of a MS150 tour for cure. I had donated work for the  event and was getting tired of the too loud not so good band playing. I rode my bike into the park to distance myself, bringing my dog with me to explore and get her in the woods a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while the band stopped and it was completly silent and i sat on a park table/bench and laid down on the table and stared up at the stars. My view of the sky was about 3/4 because of the tree line that i was near. My dog was about 20&#39; away laying in the grass on guard. As i was randomly picking stars to focus on a rectangular object crossed my line of sight fairly slowly from my left to right. It wasn&#39;t directly over me but slightly lower in my sights.  Altitude was somewhere between a high flying helicopter but to low for a plane.  Each end front and rear had a large white light shining. Moved very steadily! and silent.  The sky was clear so i could see around the object, it seemed narrow from front to rear. As it flew out of my vision to my right i noticed it pass in front of stars,blocking them for a second then gone.  My impression was that it had a taller top causing it to block out those stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We looked to the north of us and there was a very bright orange flickering ball of light in the sky with a slight halo.  It looked like it was burning and I first thought a plane was on fire and expected it to descend at any moment.  I judge the height to be between 1000 to 2000 feet. There was a sound similar to a plane moving across the sky.  But I saw no other planes while looking around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a flight path to Seatac international airport and a few miles south of a regional airport so we are use to seeing and hearing planes.  This was very different.  This light was too low for the jetliners that fly much higher and too large for the smaller cessnas that fly out of the regional airport nearby. This was not typical of the different planes and their normal lights  It seemed to move a few degrees to the east but very slowly. The cloud cover was sparse and low but I thought perhaps the light of this was diffusing oddly through the thin patchy clouds.  The stars were viewable throught the clouds and the light was shining down rather than horizontally. T he plane like sound diminished and the light seemed to hover in place for about 30 seconds.  I kept watching to see if it was a plane flying.  Then it just went straight up and suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description I can give is that it looked like the firey engines of a rocket as it is ascending.<n>

It traveled Northwest 20  degrees for about one minute.  The orange &#34;fire like&#34; glow pulsated consistently for about 55 seconds.  Then the light pulsated to nothing in the last 5 seconds.  The height was about 20 degrees from the horizon.<n>

Neither of us had seen it&#39;s likeness and as we watched it it appeared to flicker as if on fire, moving sometimes closer (larger) and farther (smaller) away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40-45 seconds it entirely disappeared.<n>

I saw 3 bright|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84276.html|626|ndxe201110| I was driving south on the 5 Freeway this evening.  I was passing Canon Road in Carlsbad, San Diego County, California.  I saw 3 bright orange lights at 9:20 pm Satuday, October 1.  These lights were only about 200 feet high and just east or inland from the freeway.  Thousands of people had to have seen them.  They were not planes.  They were not flares.  The only possibility, besides UFO&#39;s, was Chinese Lanterns.  I have never seen Chinese Lanterns; but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what they were; because these were low enough, if they were Chinese Lanterns, I should have seen the balloon part illuminated by the flames.  Plus, these lights seemed like they were larger than I would expect a Chinese Lantern to be.  The lights were about the same size as a police helicopter light at 200 feet; but again, the lights did not shine light down----they were just bright orange lights---very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with my window down.  I did not hear a helicopter sound.  I pass Camp Pendleton Marine Base all the time----if these lights were helicopters, the helicopters would have easily been heard.  In fact, they would have been loud.  I heard nothing.  And I did not have the radio on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These fiery lights were orange (and one may have had blue on top).  The lights were a different color than any police helicopter light.  The lights were low.  2 of the lights were almost above the freeway, and the third light was more inland; so I got a good look at the 2 lights.  Anyway, I saw the 2 lights for about 10 seconds---again, as I was driving.  These 2 lights were not connected; they moved independent of each other.  I have seen many hot air balloons in Del Mar area.  These lights were not hot air balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind was calm tonight.  2-5 mph.  I checked the weather channel as soon as I got home (about 10 pm)----winds were variable about 2 mph.  These lights were moving more than 5 mph (more like 30 mph) and heading north along the freeway ( I was driving south).  I did not look very much at the third light-----I focused on the 2 closest lights.  Again, These lights were low.  My guess is a couple hundred feet.  They were bright; but did not emit towards the ground.  The lights were not flares.  There were no sparks or smoke being emitted from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what they were.  Carlsbad in about 15 miles north of the air show at Miramar----which did occur earlier this evening.  These were not helicopters or other air craft.  I see military jets every day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It will be interesting to see if others. There had to have been thousands of people driving on the 5 freeway at 9:20 pm Saturday night October 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar sighting reports from the same source.  Other sighting was over San Diego at 22:05 hrs. on Thursday, October 06, 2011.  Source of report describes himself, suggesting that he has scientific training in his background.  PD))<n>

We discussed what they could be - they remained motionless, as stars, but many times brighter.  After approximately five minutes they rapidly moved upwards until they were not visible any more.  The other witness is a retired Civil Engeer who had claimed he&#39;d never seen anything in his lifetime that he could not explain.   He had no explanation then, nor to date, and we have discussed it a several times..<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights we are bright as little mini suns and were perhaps about 10 times larger in appearance to the largest stars in the sky.<n>

I played in the fire for about a minute and looked up to peek at Jupiter again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see an orange light moving at me from the East, approx. 10 -20 times the size of Jupiter, or a small pea at arms length.  It then shifted color to a pretty red, back to orange, then back to red.  I say “shifted”; it did not blink, just changed color in a relaxed manor, about every second.  Pretty cool. I was very excited at this point, I finally was witnessing some orange lights.  They seem to be quite prevalent in many reports, lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light kind of meandered slightly, did not seem as if it had a constant speed (about that of a single engine plane), or a consistent direction.  It was difficult to really focus on, a few times I found myself playing with my vision through my bi-focals, because it seemed like I should be able to focus a little better on it.  This light had no sound attributed to it, and appeared to be about as far from me as a single engine aircraft. I would put it’s altitude at about 2500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light slowly meandered to a more southerly direction. Now looking SE at the light, the pulsing color began to have some white for a couple of pulses, then back to O and R.  It then began to dim quickly, to about the size of a star, then just faded away, heading South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had made a report in February of ’07, witnessed a number of interesting occurrences until August ‘07 that I just didn’t report; many other reports and in my mind there is something to all of this, I’m already convinced, but this was so interesting and seems to be very prominent now, I figured I would add this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eyes to the sky, folks.  Never any sound, if you are not looking, you’d never know.  If I would have played in the fire for another 30 seconds, I would have missed this.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I live 20 or so miles NW of O’hare airport.  I have craft over my house constantly, and numerous pilot friends, always looking up when I can.  This was nothing of the ordinairy.<n>

Not in the direction of our planets rotation, but rather racing back n forth, turning on 90 degree n less angle turns. Also swaying back n forth. The movement from here on the ground would travel to what appears up to be about 1&#34; to 1-1/2&#34; before turning or curving back around in a different direction. That doesn&#39;t sound like much distance but if you consider that these objects are in our atmosphere, a star moving 1-1/2&#34; in the sky must be a pretty good distance of travel. And the speed that they travel this distance must be great as well. They seem to be in patterns and holding there positions for the most part and have been there a while now.... As crazy as it sounds and appeared to me myself, I had to get some other person/s to see this as well to insure i wasn&#39;t seeing things. So I had my kids come out as well as a few of their friends to see these objects as well.. The did in fact see t! hem and noticed there movements just as I was... I myself do not the equipment or resources to film these objects, but believe someone should try to document them with a high powered telescopic/camera. Just have to get this out there n tell someone...Thanks...If you witness this as well please comment back, also if you have the equipment to document this please send me a copy...Thanks again...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Complete testimony at GEIPAN. Investigation in progress october and november 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of the object indefinite but probably higher than 10 meters. aspect metal, rigid, perfectly regular rotation movement. Reaction of all the witnesses: stupor and escape because impact awaited on the ground.The object didn&#39;t touch the ground but went up in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a video/simulation:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFRdXy0Xt-Y<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Story : On Saturday October 1, 2011 about 17:00, we were 4 people in the garden of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us noticed in the sky an oval object of form (cylindrical) descendant at high speed in our direction.  We could very clearly distinguish its form of gray &#34;capsule&#34; like the simulation on video, smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object rotated rather slowly without noise.  Thinking that this mass which seemed metal came from a plane or d&#39; a satellite in perdition we jumped in the car as soon as possible to move away.  At this time this object quite visible, was located at Carrières sous Poissy near a pond.  We lost sight of the fact in our escape then it was perhaps in a stationary state with less than 2 km d&#39; altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned 10 min afterwards;  The object was no more there and nothing abnormal produced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later other witnesses saw the object going up in altitude while always spinning on itself.<n>

There was only one. i watched it for about 45 to 60 minutes until the tree i was under blocked the view. when i moved to look for it in the sky it was gone. a few seconds later i saw several jets flying over the same area where the object was. It was not a small object. it did not glow but stood just a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason that we do not understand, the witness indicates that the date of the sighting, four days earlier, is approximate.

There was somebody right beside me at the time.  I was explaining to her a story about the night sky, when I had this sense something was there.  As i looked back up in the sky after being interrupted, I saw this &#34;T&#34; like figure, only one side of the &#34;T&#34; was visible, as in it wasn&#39;t a complete &#34;T&#34;.  There were approximately 9 lights, all very dim.  The possible craft was translucent, silent and using the stars as a camouflage. Only visible for 4 seconds as i glanced down in my amazement to get my friend as a witness, but as I looked up it was gone. I did not however, see how the craft took off.  There are more details i have yet to explain.  As I saw the craft, it started to turn 90 degrees in all directions, left to right, spun from side to side.  It shouldn&#39;t have been more than 200-250 feet in the air. The object was almost hovering above me when I looked up.  Relative to the size of the moon, ! it was about 1 1/2 times bigger in comparison. As I spoke to somebody who had previously reported a UFO sighting as well, that person told me to look for anything unusual on my body which I have not done yet. I didn&#39;t get ANY documented proof, as it didn&#39;t appear on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like this:   0 000 00000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated above I couldn&#39;t see the craft as it was translucent. I do not know the count of the witnesses around the Thunder Bay area, nor did anybody see the craft at all.  My hair did not stand up, but i did feel like something though was watching me.  I had a tingly back like something was standing over me,and that&#39;s when I looked up.  That is as much detail as I can give<n>

Me and my brother both saw an orangey fireball slowly move across the sky, the descend below the horizon over Staten Island.  It moved to slow to be an airplane, and there are no airports in that area.  I have seen this object several times during October of 2011 and my brother is a witness to it as well. Me and my brother are both sane, honest young men, ages 25 and 18.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
