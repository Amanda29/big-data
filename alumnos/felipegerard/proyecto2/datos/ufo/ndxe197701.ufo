1/19/77 20:30|Coventry|RI|Triangle|2 minutes|Huge wing craft - 1000 feet in width hovered over house, no noise or lights|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64693.html|1|ndxe197701| Huge wing craft - 1000 feet in width hovered over house, no noise or lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my house looking out of the sliding glass windows and saw an odd six-pointed light that was very bright and hovering over the trees in the distance. I flashed the floodlights from the side of the house and as a result, the points of light came together creating a flat linear shape that proceeded to accelerate in the direction of the house. As it approached the house, it was silent and approximately 300 feet over the house and trees. There were no lights (except for the floodlights) and it hovered making no sound! As I looked out the window, I noticed it was enormous, so large that it must have been at least 1000 feet in width, resembling one large wing in a wide triangle shape. I noticed enormous, cavernous bays (similar to aircraft carriers) underneath the wings yet there were no lights and there was no movement. Out of fear, I hid behind the curtains for about one minute and then built up the courage to run outside and look into the sky – there were no traces, no noises, nothing. It simply had disappeared, yet could not have turned as its wing would have hit the house and trees. It made no noise and had been attracted by the floodlights on the house. As we were younger children, our babysitter would not allow us to go outside out of fear as she could not figure out what it was either. The location of the sighting was approximately 12-15 miles from the military base in Warwick, RI.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/15/77 20:10|Scottsbluff County (rural; western)|NE|Chevron|30+ seconds,|Popped up over hill out of nowhere, bright lights flashing|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20736.html|4|ndxe197701| Popped up over hill out of nowhere, bright lights flashing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though this happened when I was 19, I remember it *very* vividly - although at the time I was oddly unconcerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not positive of date, but know it was after the holidays, dead middle of winter, no moon but lots of bright stars against the black night sky.  I was taking a &#34;back road&#34; (i.e. proverbial dirt road, maybe 2 old cowboy jalopies and lots of cattle had used that week) to see my boyfriend; probably not the smartest thing for a young woman to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling north, on my right was a ridge about 100 ft. high that ran parallel to the road for about 1/2 mile, ending just past the road&#39;s sharp left turn to the west. (ridge was 1/4 mile away from road) This corner was known to be dangerous:  cattleguard, deep gravel, slightly on sloped angle, and narrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was slowing down for this corner, the radio started losing the signal (bunch of static) and car started sputtering, trying to die, then did.  (no previous car problems, just serviced, gas tank full).  Momentary panic, put my head down on steering wheel (who&#39;s going to find me &amp; when?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked back up, I saw something coming over ridge.  I just sat there as it slid over the top coming closer to me, confused image of what I thought of as carnival lights - red, gold, white, bluish-green - all along outside edge of what seemed to be a triangle shape, lights running in fast &#34;chaser&#34; pattern (like popular Christmas lights 5-7 yrs. ago).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, just long enough for me to realize it was happening (and probably had been for a few seconds) there was a &#34;spotlight&#34; beam of bluish-white light traveling next to the passenger side of the car.  Beam went out; a few more ticks of what seemed suspended, unreal time with edge lights still blinking; shape rotated up about 30 degrees.  (that&#39;s when I realized it was chevron shaped, not triangular - I could see the stars between swept-back &#34;wings&#34;)   It starting drawing away still on an angle until it was about 250 ft. up, then *poof* it was gone.   No sound through *any* of this - and believe me, a deserted dirt road at night in winter in western Nebraska is about a quiet as it gets.  I even had window down an inch or so since I was smoking a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have sat there at least another 15 minutes before I attempted to start my car (it started fine) because when I got to my boyfriend&#39;s he was about to come looking for me - I should have been there around 8:30, it was now 9:15.  I know I drove much more slowly than usual, but wasn&#39;t thinking about what happened (how odd!) and didn&#39;t even discuss it with my boyfriend, just said something about being behind a slow truck and what bad shape the road was in, blah blah blah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s a relief to finally get this off my chest.  Whenever I hear of UFO sightings, it all comes back to me in a flood - like I&#39;m there watching it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness holds very responsible position today.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response.  I expected nothing beyond, as I said, getting the story off my chest in a forum where I could be reasonably certain folks wouldn&#39;t laugh... and if they did, at least I couldn&#39;t hear it!  (The good people of western Neb. are nothing if not pragmatic and have no time for &#34;that kind of foolishness.&#34;)  However, I&#39;m leary of hypnosis and don&#39;t really think I *want* to know more.  That may change someday, but for now I&#39;m blissful in my ignorance.  Also, I&#39;ve read a great deal on the subject<n> <n><n> since that time (as you may imagine!) and have probably clouded things to the point it might very well not be successful anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to share two further things.  First, I realized I never specified the size of... whatever it was.  It was on the smallish side, not more than 50 yds. across at the widest point (where the &#34;wings&#34; swept back).    That&#39;s probably why I got an impression of Christmas lights.  As it slid over the hill, my mind desperately wanted me to believe it was some kind of decoration turning on from the bottom up.  And it was that time of year, if a little late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, and probably the real reason I&#39;m resisting hypnosis, is that since I was a very small child my biggest fear has been looking out a dark window and seeing a white face look back in at me.  When the original &#34;Halloween&#34;  movie was released, some friends visiting me drug me with them to see it<n> <n><n> (talk about unwilling, I must have left heel indentations in the parking lot cement).  I literally did not sleep for a week after that.  The first two nights were the worst even with people sleeping in the same room - I laid there in a cold sweat, paralyzed, thinking every sound and shadow was something evil &amp; bad coming to get me.  (that sounds so babyish, and I was 23 at the time)  I&#39;ve never liked that kind of movie to begin with; I&#39;ve never gone to another even at the risk of offending friends/guests.  I&#39;ve also read that owls are often used as memory &#34;screens.&#34;  From the time I was 6 (my parents moved me to the attic room when my baby brother came along) I&#39;ve been haunted by owls.  I swore for years that an owl on-and-off sat on the peak of the roof on the end where my bed was.  No one believed me.  We<n> <n><n> moved to a huge new ranch-style house 2 miles away when I was almost 13 - one night later, an owl was now sitting &amp; hooting on the corner of the house where my bedroom was!  Finally about 6 mos. later the teasing quit when my Dad said he&#39;d found bird droppings of some kind on the cement sidewalk under the corner where I&#39;d sworn the owl sat.  That didn&#39;t really change things,<n> <n><n> but Mr. Owl didn&#39;t seem to visit so often after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reading this over, I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;ve rambled too much (kinda seems that way to me).  But thinking about this has triggered one more memory of something that happened about 5 yrs. ago that I even went to the doctor about.  This happened at the far western edge of Arvada (Denver suburb)<n> <n><n> about 2 a.m.  I suddenly woke up and heard a kind of &#34;swoosh&#34; sound.  The first thing I thought was that someone was in the bushes below my window (it was 1 1/2 stories up on the back side of a split-level home).  No sooner had I thought that but what seemed to be a bright spotlight shown through the<n> <n><n> shade at the window.  My next thought was &#34;oh no, the cops are chasing some criminal with a helicopter &amp; spotlight&#34; although I couldn&#39;t hear rotor blades.  I glanced at the clock to see what time it was and that was the last move I was able to make.  The light intensified for a few seconds, I heard a roaring, and I thought I should get out of bed to look out the window, but I *could not move*!  I struggled mightily, but was immobile.  I could feel the sweat break out on my body and heard a roaring in my head and felt it in my body (it was steady, not like a heart beat), and still couldn&#39;t twitch a finger.  I&#39;d estimate this went on for 2-3 minutes.  I thought I was having a heart attach or more likely a stroke.  I cast around my mind for another explanation but always came back to physical problem.  During this time I was aware the light at the window was fading away - I couldn&#39;t look, my eyes weren&#39;t responding to the &#34;move&#34; command either.  The feeling passed all at once; it didn&#39;t &#34;ease up&#34; but was just gone - like when a blood pressure cuff releases.  The next day I tried to explain it to a coworker; she didn&#39;t know what to think but advised me to see the Dr. anyway.  I did at 2 p.m.  They found nothing wrong with me and *strongly* suggested it was a dream.  (Why do male Dr.s seem to assume women are all<n> <n><n> hypochondriacs or hysterical?  I was truly concerned!)  And I know it wasn&#39;t a dream - I&#39;m neither Dickens nor his pal Scrooge.  I believe in being open-minded, but not so open your brains fall out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, enough.  Again, thank you for both your response and your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

In binoculars, appeared to be a brightly glowing object (not flickering like flames would do) of orange/yellow coloration that seemed to eminate from 2 side-by-side sources, close enough to appear as one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather Conditions:  Very Cold (zero or below zero degrees F), Clear, Ground Frozen Solid, Snow Covered.  No Moon, but Starlit Sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circumstances/Description of Sighting:  In January of 1977 I was 24 years old and I worked in construction, but for the winter I took a job as a security guard at Wild Acres Lake in Dingman’s Ferry, Pa.  This was and still is a gated homeowners community in a rural wooded area.  In January of 1977 it was being actively developed with new lots being sold and new homes being built, while many homes were already occupied in the lake community.  My duties were to patrol the roads of the community at night to watch watch for illegal or unusual activity.  As background, I had been in the US Army from 1972 to 1974 with MOS of 95B, Military Police.  I had been stationed in Kaiserslautern, Germany, working with the enlisted rank of SP4 in 15th MP Brigade Headquarters in the S-3 Operations Center working with war contingency plans, a job which required a Top Secret security clearance and required a background investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mid to latter part of January 1977 was very cold in Pike County Pa and most of the northeast, which was one of the coldest Januaries on record.  I don’t recall the exact date of the sighting but it was in the mid to latter part of the month with a moonless sky, very cold, very clear with bright starlit sky, the air crisp, the ground frozen solid and snow covered with at least a foot of crunchy powdery snow.   The night of the sighting I was patrolling the roads of the development routinely, looking for anything unusual.  At this time, the developer had been clearing one of the swampy areas to create a lake, and this entailed logging off the larger trees, bulldozing the stumps into big piles, and burning the piles openly.  At night the piles glowed brightly as the fires continued from the daytime burning, and I kept an eye on them in my rounds to make sure the wind didn’t send embers into surrounding woods and start another fire.  (they didn’t, the piles were in the middle of the frozen swamp removed from the surrounding woods, and the ground was frozen solid and snow covered).  On the night of the sighting I was driving slowly south on Wild Acres Drive between the Long Lake on my right and a low lying frozen swamp on my left.  Across the treeless swamp at a distance of about 1200 feet was a road called The Construction Road in 1977 but now shown on maps as “Luciano Rd”.  At the time the construction road was used for exactly that, for construction vehicles to enter the property instead of entering through the gated main entrance.   Just beyond the Construction Rd the ground rose in elevation above the swamp to maybe 20 or 30 feet.  At the top of the rise, through the leafless trees, I thought I saw a large fire burning on the ground.  As I mentioned above, the size was about the size of my closed fist at the end of my extended arm, at a distance of about 1500 feet.  From my position I was looking towards the east.  Since this was not in an area where the developers were doing any clearing, I was conc! erned th at the woods were on fire, and I stopped my car, rolled down the window and looked at the fire through a good pair of binoculars I had in the car.  Through binoculars, I could see that this wasn’t a fire, which puzzeled me because I was expecting to see a fire.  Instead I saw two side-by-side brightly glowing lights the color of bright fire, but not flickering like fire does, but rather glowing steadily.  The lights seemed to be side-by-side but overlapped, close enough together to be one light with two sources.  I still didn’t know quite what to make of the lights at this point.  However, as I watched through the binoculars, the lights suddenly rose off the ground though the trees which I could clearly see, and actually rose above the top of the tree line about 10 or 20 feet and hovered there for 15 seconds or so.  As the light hovered, I could clearly see the trees underneath, the light was above the trees.  Then after about 15 seconds of hovering, the light ascended at an unbelievably rapid speed not quite straight up, but at an angle just a few degrees off vertical, and left a light trail as it did so, as you see when you quickly waive a light wand or flashlight in your hand in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise of any kind during the sighting, it was quiet.  No cars in sight.  The area is adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, a wild and scenic nature area, very rural.  No military bases nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not think at the time to investigate the site at close quarters, I cannot explain why.  I had never seen anything like it before, nor have I seen anything like it since.  I wish I looked at the site immediately afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location is approximately -74.90 lon, 41.22 lat.   On a Google Map, I was on Wild Acres drive to the east of the long pond and to the west of the now-wooded swamp area and about 500 feet north of the T intersection.  I was facing east looking across the now-wooded swamp area and across what is now known as Luciano Ln to the wooded rise just to the east of Luciano Lane, at the top of which I saw the light on the ground and saw it rise above the trees.  (It’s about 500-600 feet west of the dam at the end of Wild Acres Lake).  I haven’t been back to the site since, and it might be my imagination, but on the Google satellite image it looks like there might be a bare spot on the ground where I saw the object.  I’d like to go back and have a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was at a cricket match with friends. It was a fine day with blue sky and no clouds. If I had to estimate the size of it I would say it was about the size of a car, a small car.  We were standing in the shelter at one end of the oval looking straight out towards the other end of the oval. The object came over the top of the pine trees to our right and stopped right in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was enough time for me to gesture to my friend by touching his arm and pointing. I couldn&#39;t speak. I was renderred speachless. Not by the object but just by the shock of seeing it. It sounds so cliche that it was saucer in shape but it was and it was a distinct black on the underside and the silver of a wine bladder on top. The was no noise but if there was any we couln&#39;t hear it from where we were at the other end of the oval, and it didn&#39;t get the attention of people on the oval, that I know of. As it moved away it seemed to move in about before it went towards Para Hills at incredible speed and agian making no sound. During the time it was in front of us it was about 50 feet off the ground, and as it moved away it rose up to several hundred feet. When it sped off it did so in a straight line, then it disappeared out of sight in a split second, as though it had vanished. We expected to see reports in the paper about others who had seen it, but there was no mention of it. To this day, when we talk about it, the hair stands up on the back of my neck. I had always scoffed at other reports and they are lights in the night sky, I still do. But this was a clear day. It was about 26 years ago, but I can still see it. We have relived it dozens of times. I wish I had a camera, but I didn&#39;t and it&#39;s gone. It hasn&#39;t affected my life, and we haven&#39;t kept it a secret, and I don&#39;t expect this report will be any different to dozens just like it. I&#39;m glad I did see it though, because it confirms to me, that there is more than just this world, Iv&#39;e seen proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

1/1/77 20:00|Westminster|CA|Disk|5 minutes|There were two ships, saucer shaped, silver grey..like pewter, soundless, drifting over our neighborhood like silent boats on the water|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74285.html|8|ndxe197701| There were two ships, saucer shaped, silver grey..like pewter, soundless, drifting over our neighborhood like silent boats on the water<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening.  It wasn&#39;t too late, being a school night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a distance, my mother and I thought that it was a blimp preparing for an emergency landing.  When we drove closer, we realized it was actually two ships.  They were larger than cars, maybe 15 or 20 feet radius.  They looked like what you would see in a Hollywood movie: disk-like or saucer shaped.  The center seemed more spherical.  They reminded me of pewter or stainless steel - a dull shine.  There were lights going around the outer edge, although now, we can not agree on the color.  The lights did not shine down on anything.  I didn&#39;t see any seams, doors or windows.  I remember getting out of the car and thinking that it was all true...all the reports that had been made at that time of sightings in our city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two ships were just above the two-story homes in the neighborhood.  They made no sound.  I remember only hearing the strange buzz of our street lamp.  It seemed like one ship was following the other, just above our street, just above roof level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I got the impression that they were trying to hide from us...they went down one street, them came back into our view...maybe they knew we saw them and came for a closer look at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had run into the house and got my father, then the three of us were now out standing on our front lawn with our dog. The two ships slowly rotated, or maybe the lights were revolving around their perimeter. I took a step forward, thinking I would be one of the first humans to meet these visitors...but my father said, &#34;Stay right where you are.&#34;  And being only 13, I did.  I wasn&#39;t afraid, but the tone in my father&#39;s voice scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as the ships slowly went down the street, one following the other.  They were over the elementary school I had attended, and for a moment I thought that perhaps they would land there.  But the leader seemed to move forward - like a slight pull or jerk - and then shot off to the right with a streak! of white light.  The the second one did the same thing.  They were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went into the house with our groceries, and I wanted to call the newspaper, or maybe the police...My mother looked very concerned and my father just said no.  He didn&#39;t want anyone to think that we were a bunch of nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, at school, I told my science teacher what I had seen.  He listened respectfully, since I wasn&#39;t the type of kid to be speaking up and never known to lie.  After a few minutes I kept asking him what could fly like that, without sound or air movement or anything...just gliding along like a boat on water.  Of course he said there wasn&#39;t anything and then I could tell he didn&#39;t believe me and some of my friends were looking at me kind of funny....so, I knew what my father meant...&#34;Some kind of nut.&#34;<n> <n><n> But it really happened and it certainly peaked my interest in science, especially astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now teach Math and Science courses at the high school level.  I tell my story to my students....but only on Halloween and April Fool&#39;s Day....after all, I don&#39;t want them or my principal thinking I&#39;m some kind of nut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

1/1/77 20:00|La Crescenta|CA|Formation|2 to 3 hours|Triangle formation in foothills.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60013.html|9|ndxe197701| Triangle formation in foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived up at the top of Briggs on Freeman, way up by Angelese National Forest.  Very few lights, very little people.  I went out of my house to walk down the street to babysit the neighbor&#39;s kid.  I was in an astronomy class in high school, so every time I went out at night I checked the skies to identify constellations.  I looked up, as usual, and saw over in the north-northeast three &#34;stars&#34; in a triangle shape.  It stumped me, because I could figure out what constellation it was.  I remember thinking something about the Summer Triangle; most likely that it couldn&#39;t be the Summer Triangle because of the time of year or location.  I assumed it was a constellation that wasn&#39;t easily seen in town, and I was just lucky to catch it on a clear night, up in the foothills where there were no lights to interfere.  I went on down the street to babysit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later I returned home.  It was close to 11:00 p.m. or so, and I again looked up into the sky.  The same &#34;constellation&#34; was in the same location.  I knew at that point that it was impossible, after several hours, those stars should have moved.  I stopped to watch them.  I noticed they were brigher than the other stars.  As I watched, the three points of the triangle came together in the center, scrambled around each other, then shot off in three different directions at an incredible speed.  Needless to say, I was a little freaked and ran into my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I heard my parents talking in the kitchen before I got up.  They said something about not mentioning anything to me, because with my imagination it would scare me.  Years later I asked them both about the incident.  They both remembered that my father had gone outside after I had left to babysit.  He went to close the garage door.  He also saw the lights.  Something happened, he never did tell me what, but whatever it was was more than just three &#34;stars&#34; up in the sky, otherwise there would have been no need to protect me from what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, apparently I saw them in formation, went indoors, and in the interval between my two sightings of them, my father also saw something.  Maybe they broke formation and scrambled off, like they did with me, but for what ever reason they came back in time to put a show on for me when I went back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I didn&#39;t feel like sleeping so I knelt in my bed and leaned on my windowsill looking out at the city. Almost at once there was a small dark gray or possibly metallic ball moving steadily past my window. It was about 8-10 inches in diameter and had no distinguishing features at all. There was no sound or light associated with the ball. It was probably about 6-12 inches away from the side of the building and moved from left to right, which would have corresponded roughly to moving north. Our apartment was on the 15th floor and the window faced west-ish. (It faced in the direction of central park from the east side which is roughly due west.) The ball was not moving very quickly and I remember thinking that if I ran I would have time to get my babysitter to show her the ball before it had moved past the window. Which I did but of course when we got back to my room it was gone. I hadn&#39;t anticipated the time it would take to find her and convince her to come to my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I remember one night being floated against my will down the stairs of our house. I was terrified , and my feet were about a foot off the ground .there was a short figure (even seemed shorte than me )which I took to be a which and it was beside me the whole time. I tried to grab the wall and the bannister but could not get a firm hold. My next memmory, can&#39;t say wether or not it was the same night, occured in my driveway. this one happened repeatedly. I would find myselfe being floated down my driveway towards the road by little grey men . that they conformed so accurately to the modern stereo-type is the reason that I am reporting these events.  thes e guys seemed very real to me. after the first time I seemed to recognise them and them me . like with the witch, my feet were about a foot,maybe two feet off the ground and I would keep trying to find the ground so i could run, with my legs moving in a cycling motion below me ,but i never found it. This hpenned about three or for times and at least one of the times one of my little sisters was there with me. At the time I thought these were morethan dreams and wondered if maybe they were real but in another dimension or something that shared the smame space that I normally lived in but was normally not accesible. I also remember finding myselfe in my next door nighboors back yard in the middle of the night and having to climb up the hill back to my house. I moved to Scotland when i was therteen and didn&#39;t have anymore of these dreams. But I did have another strange dream when I moved back to connecticut for university I was staying at a freinds house in New Canaan durring the summer when I had this dream where I was on my back on like a hospital bed , being steered through a huge well lit place by two people. there were many other people , in groups but I didn&#39;t take much mote of them.when i was left olone on the bed I tried to run but my feet had some kind of glass sandles or something crudely stuck to the soles. as I ran back the way they had brouht me these sandles slid arround on the mettalic floor.  I ended up in some kind of smaller darker room with some people who were doing a project and were very calm and made me feel more relaxed. this could have just been a dream,I really dont know ,but I mention it just in case anyone else has had a similar one I am 27 years of age and fairly well educated and work as a deck -hand in Miami by the way- about a month ago I saw a green/blue fireball looking north west from my balcony .It was bigger and slower than a shooting star and move more horizontal than virtically. it dissapeared after lees than two seconds. it was almost the sise if the moon.<n>
