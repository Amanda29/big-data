The sky was barely lightly because of these low clouds upon my head but there was a bright moon above.  So I could see this triangle craft crossing among the little low clouds,for about 15/20 minutes.  It seemed to me that I was beeing able to touch it.  I could see very clear two little tails on both sides of the triangle back that was moving from southeast to northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry for my english.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

White in color, north to south trajectory.  Then instead of continuing on it&#39;s downward trajectory, it began to move horizontally.  Very strange.......<n>

We heard no sound.  They seem to go vertical and disappear.  At first, we saw 5 lights all moving in the same direction at the same speed.  I was able to take pictures of the last one (passing in the direction of Venus).  We called the police and the newspaper but no one else reported seeing the objects.  They were bright red/orange in color and were in a semi formation of 2, 2 and 1.  My pics aren’t very good as I took them with my cell phone, but you can see the “red light” and Venus in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 21:00 on April 30, 2012.  I was looking north when I saw a red triangle with four green circles (one in each corner, and one larger one in the center of the triangle) moving in an arc from my right to the left.  This object was a perfect geometric shape and was semi-transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I could alert the other two people in our group, the object quickly and completely faded.  Also, the points of the triangle were beveled.  I have not seen this object again.<n>

It was such a beautiful night that I decided to sit in a patio chair and watch the stars.  I looked up and saw the Big Dipper and at the end of the 2 stars that are part of the tail, there was what appeared to be another star but it was much brighter and had beautiful colors of blue, green red and yellow.  I thought that it was a plane but the planes flew right by it.   What was interesting about this object is that it was stationary at first then it would bounce around like a fly in a window pane trying to get out, or someone walking with a flash light in the distance.  This went on for more than an hour and finally I ended up having to go to bed so that I could go to work the next day.  This object seemed to be much higher than aircraft could fly.  I attempted to take pictures, but my phone camera wasn’t able to catch it.<n>

Then we grabbed our camera and snapped a couple photos as fast as we could.  In about two and a half minutes the strange craft the craft did a zig-zagging motion and vanished.  There was only one craft and the back ground was a blue sky with no clouds.<n>

At one point the bright orange would just stop and only the flashing white, blue and red lights could be seen. Others flew around with white lights on the bottom and blue and red lighting on the side with occasional flashing and a slight orange tint.  There was also one that was fairly large that just hovered for 30 minutes or so then dissapeared below the horizon.  Speeds varied for each craft.  At one point two crafts seemed to have nearly collided but hovered directly above one another for about 5 minutes.  You could faintly hear a whirring of a jet-like engine as one passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I watched for the usual red and green lights but none ever appeared.  Then the light went brighter, then dimmer, and then lighter again as it traveled across the sky.  There was a center mass but no vehicle discernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, no red or green lights, or white headlight as usually seen on a plane. When it went overhead there was no sound, coming or going.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen satellites over the years and they are always white and much higher in the sky. It wasn’t a meteorite for there was no tail and no sound for how low it was.<n>

I presumed this dot was nothing more than a planet my first guess was mars for its orange/red color.  I began to become more curious as to why it was so prominent and bright in comparison to any of the other stars or planets that i had seen in the past. is stepped outside and really started to pay attention to it and within 5 seconds the dot expanded to be atleast 10x its original size if not more. it sat idle for a split second being a non circular shape glowing red and orange above the horizon. it then shot down below horizon seemingly going away from me rather than down, it moved faster than anything i had ever seen.  I had been a skeptic my whole life but now i&#39;m left wondering......<n>

Right after passing the intersection of Lake Underhill and Econlockhatchee Road, travelling South on Econlockhatchee Rd., heading to home in Orlando, Florida , we saw a car in front of us pulled ooff the road on the right with its lights still on, door open and 2 young men outside the car. I was looking to see what they had pulled off for, and as we passed I saw that one person had either a camera or phone pointed up at about a 45-50 degree angle in front of him. It was odd because it was dark and all that was in front of him at that angle would be either a fence, a house&#39;s rooftop or the sky. So I was &#34;rubbernecking&#34;, then some lights caught my attention in the dark sky, in the direction where he was pointing his camera/phone at (West of us). I saw a line of a number of glowing reddish orange glowing orbs, lighter and bright at the center, lined up in an arc formation moving from left to right and up, in the sky. I shouted out to my family to look, look, look, a line of strange reddish lights. I realized why the people had pulled off and what they must have been taking pictures of. My husband who was driving, also saw the lights I was shouting about and pulled off the road too. We were now ahead of the other car, with their headlights facing us. My husband and I got out of the car and watched, calling our daughter to come look. She did, but seemed scared and hesitant. None of us recognized what they could be, orb shaped, with that reddish orange glow, brighter and lighter in the center. It was obvious to us that they were not planes from how they looked, moved, lined up and disappeared. There was also a plane flying in the opposite direction toward them off to the right, likely intending to land at the airport in that general area.. They were moving up and rig! ht and were disappearing one by one as they moved to the far r! ight. Th e largest was about the size of a pea the distance. My daughter couldnt get her iphone camera to work properly as she frantically tried to get a shot, she says it froze but managed to get a picture, though thee photo looks very red in color.   The lowest one was largest and as they moved up to the right they were either smaller or farther, then disappeared one at a time. There were about 3 lower down and 2 up to the right. I don &#39; t know if there were more or not before we saw them since they were fisappearing. The people in the orher car had left. I only indicated 3 who saw this, counting only my family though I know at least 2 other strangers saw it as well. I wondered if the people in the plane did also. Eventually all disappeared. We went home, somewhat in shock and a little scared. I figure I would be the last person at this site reporting this but it just happened and we all saw it, though I am still having trouble processing what we saw, and wondering what people will think when or if I tell them.<n>
4/29/12 21:22|Kingwood|TX|Other|30-60 seconds|Organic E.T. Craft|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100113.html|12|ndxe201204| Organic E.T. Craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday April 29, 2012, I was visiting my mother at her apartment complex in Kingwood, Texas that is just outside of Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this part of the year, Texas was experiencing a drought, and on this night, we caught our first rain and thunderstorm in long while.  After the storm passed, I decided it would be the best time to leave as it was getting late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking alone in the open parking lot when I looked over to my east at two tall trees.  Above these trees, I noticed what I believed to be at the time a large plastic bag in the sky, white but more like a boomerang shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that the object was far too large to be any plastic bag and moved at greater speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind then confirmed it to me an elaborate kite.  I thought to myself that has to be one of the best kites I have ever seen, not to mention the biggest.  However the object moved at a greater speed then any kite, as it began to approached me I realize it was not a kite but so! mething otherworldly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my head I kept hearing, this is not supposed to be here, things like this just do not exist.  It was then that this object was directly over my head.  It was purely organic, meaning the being itself acted like its own craft.  The closest thing I can compare it too would be like a centipede slithering the sky like a snake in a side-to-side motion.  It was white but it not seem like it had a definite shape to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as its composition, it looked as if it could be made out of some kind of plasma strands meshed together.  It had these tentacle-like arms reaching out with blue orbs connected to the ends of these arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This being would be close to a half a football field in length.  It flew just above the cloud line, which would be significantly lower because of the stormed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above this creature was a smaller craft that looks exactly like the tip of a number two pencil, charcoal black, and roughly the size of a 747 jet engine.  This smaller craft, I am guessing, could only staff one or two individuals at the most or possibly unmanned.  This smaller black craft was emitting a blue LED looking light onto the organic entity as if was releasing this being into our skies, or projecting it as hologram.  Both the organic being and the tip-pencil shape object traveled at a speed much slower than an airplane, as it seemed like both were gliding through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only sound I heard can be described as waves at the beach.  This sound was faint and I cannot exactly confirm if this entity was producing this sound or if I was hearing it in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe these too be extraterrestrial in nature verses governmental as I have never seen anything on this planet that can resemble what I saw, however one cannot rule out the idea of Project Blue beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted between 9:20 pm -9:22 pm.  I do not know exactly how long I was viewing both E.T.s but I defiantly know that the incident ended at 9:22 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I believe that this being was extraterrestrial, I can say I felt that it knew I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if it was somehow feeding off the thunderstorm as it seemed to be going in the same direction, or if this was merely observing humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this encounter, I have had nightmares at least once a week involving this entity.<n>

The light appeared to be a particularly bright star with other small glimmering lights underneath it and appeared to be approximately 40 degrees above a level horizon.  Approximately three of the smaller lights were present and glimmered with purplish, reddish, or greenish tones respectively.  The objects seemed to have a flowing but erratic motion with a small range, no more than a few degrees north and south and unknown degrees east and west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 40 minutes later, at around 9:45p.m., the position of the object had changed approximately 11.75 degrees Northbound and had stayed at the same approximate altitude and distance from my vantage point.

I have an amazing view of the city from my balcony; I can clearly see the airport. Often, I sit and look out while smoking a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The past few nights I have witnessed a strange light. At first, I thought it was just a star. The longer I looked at it, the more details I could see. It almost seems shaped like the symbol from the Blair Witch films (best way to describe it). It&#39;s a cross with ends pointing out in different directions. Two red lights can be seen circling around it at times. It appears in the same general location of the sky almost every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems to move at a painfully slow pace.  It just hovers for a long time. I check back on it every few minutes and it has barely moved from view behind a large tree outside my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The even stranger thing is that very small looking planes seems to fly right past it constantly.  These are tiny red lights that flash quickly and fly fast.  One night it seemed like two of them were harnessed together and then the one in the back just dropped from the sky and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my strange star in the sky, slowly shrunk until it was almost invisible to me.  It was strange because at first I thought a cloud had passed in front of it (though I believe it may be too low in the sky for that).  But it just appeared to get more and more hazy until it was just a pin prick of what it once was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I have no idea what to call this thing that appears here nightly.  I&#39;m beginning to be a bit freaked out, though.  I urged my boyfriend to look at it.  While he had no explanation for what it was, he didn&#39;t seem nearly as intrigued as me.<n>

If I&#39;m outside and an aircraft goes by, I&#39;ve never been able to keep from observing it. my Grandfather was in the Air Force in his day, and instilled in me a deep appreciation for aviation at an early age. what I&#39;m saying is, although I&#39;m no expert by any stretch, I pay an above average amount of attention to passing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving through a neighborhood just after sunset, I noticed an object in the sky, to the west of my location, headed east. at first I thought it was a helicopter, because through the trees, it&#39;s perceived size, altitude, and speed, matched that of the common medical/news/misc chopper you see frequently in the area. we also have frequent, often daily fly overs of apache helicopters as well, but this object seemed to move, at first sighting, a bit faster than the typically observed apache cruising speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> intrigued, I exited the neighborhood and got a better look, with no obstruction from trees. although with RDU very close by, and the area not far from a large commercial flight path, I ruled out fixed wing aircraft immediately because I noticed the object was clearly round, or egg-shaped. within a couple of seconds, a light coming from roughly the center of the object became very bright. I originally mistook this light for a typical forward facing nose or wing-mounted &#39;headlight&#39;. but, as the craft got closer, and also slowed down very rapidly, and began to hover, the light began to burn bright like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at this point, I turned in to another neighborhood street and immediately parked with the object in clear view. it had slowed to almost a complete stop, but with some slight drifting. it&#39;s shape was somewhat oval, like an up-side down egg, and had a bright light burning in the center. on a quiet evening with almost no noise pollution, I could hear no sound from coming from the object. all of these characteristics combined to remind me of the many hot air balloons I&#39;d seen growing up in the midwest. however, when it slowed down, it&#39;s size and structural shape where much smaller, darker, and solid in appearance. based on it&#39;s distance from me, I assessed it to be roughly the size of the average mid-sized suv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the light quickly grew so bright and firey that I realized it was not being put out by the object, but was actually a reflection of the sun, that had just dipped below the horizon. over about 10 seconds, it slowly drifted out of the waning sunbeam, and went completely dark. it had no lights of it&#39;s own, but was still very visible in the still back-lit light blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after pursuing it&#39;s original course when I first sighted it, which I perceived to be eastward, and then pausing to drift for 10-15 seconds, it begin to move and pick up speed in a north-west direction. I pursued it through the neighborhood, but came to a dead end, and the object quickly disappeared behind a treeline. when I was able to get out to the main road, and searched in the area I thought it to be headed, it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so, overall, I observed an object that appeared to be several hundred feet up, and several hundred feet away. round or oval shape, dark, with no lights. no sound that I could hear. this was right around the intersection of High House and 55 in Cary.<n>

My husband &amp; I were having a BBQ on our deck facing east across Utah Lake.  I heard a plane so looked up and saw 3 round bright objects above the plane heading south.  The plane was heading north to the airport.  I grabbed my binoculars and called to my husband.  I saw 3 round metallic objects traveling fast in a V formation.  I gave the binoculars to my husband and he also saw them and we both agree they weren&#39;t birds or jets because they were very high and didn&#39;t have wings.  They were bright gold and metallic and round.  We have never seen anything like this and don&#39;t have any idea what we saw.  We did not think to get a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We see an orange glowing ball of light  - kind of reminiscent of fire.  It was moving towards us at first and got to about 1/4 of a mile away.  The craft was approiximately 500 feet up and we could see a definite saucer shaped craft encased within the orange glowing sphere. It almost seemed like a hologram but was not.  Once it got to about 1/4 mile from us, it turned and continued to go fairly slowly around the tree tops and out behind our property where it disappeared.  This craft was completely soundless.<n>

It appeared to be at a elevation a report helicopter would be at. The light is what attracted my attention very bright red similar to the intensity of a rescue flare. I have never seen a light like that on any flying aircraft. Shortly after the 1st 3 more appeared from the same eastern point but continued due west directly over me. Same elevation following roughly the same path the 3rd craft did close the gap of the 2nd so they were traveling at different speeds. A very few low clouds were present at the time and i witnessed them change elevation as the lights flickered as they passed through the clouds. No to light winds were present at time of sighting.  The strangest thing i witnessed during the event which was the deciding factor for me to submit this report.  With no wind and 4 low flying object traveling at a reasonable speed as any average plane would fly, I heard absolutel! y no sound, not one hint of an engine was present during the entire event and even after they disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 47 yr old university educated male who travels for a living. I have never seen or reported anything like this in my entire life. The second witness was sitting on a street bench talking on his cell phone when i pointed out the last 3 crafts that appeared directly overhead. He confessed to me he too had never seen anything like this before. With the intensity of the lights i would be very certain others have witnessed the same objects.<n>

One of them that was flying overhead at one point turned the lights off and all you could see was a black object circular.

While watching nothing was behind it.  Suddenly a craft was directly behind it, following it, or so it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft’s fuselage was very similar to that of a B-29 Super Fortress.  There were no wings or conventional tail.  It appeared to be about five times the size of the 737.   Where the tail should have been was a sort of cone assembly similar to a clump of jet engine nacelles.  Just aft of where the wings should have been was a gull shaped “wing”/vane pointed down with a slight angle aft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fuselage was a shimmering silver, while the wing/vane was a dark grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it behind the 737, all of a sudden is faded from view.  A couple of seconds later it reappeared in the same fashion as it disappeared.  It continued to fly for about four more seconds then slowly faded again, never to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was a clear dull blue.  I never lost sight of the 737 and watched it fly out of sight long after the ufo disappeared.<n>

They were not next to each other, probably a few hundred feet apart.  I was driving so I pulled over to try and see what kind of craft the orbs belong to, but I couldn&#39;t tell. I thought possibly they were helicopters, but there was no noise. Definitely not lights from an airplane. I kept eye contact with them until I pulled into my garage. When I walked out of the garage,the lights were gone, but I saw an extremely large black amoeba looking object moving low above the houses a few blocks down. I watched it and it just disappeared within a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not see any physical craft in the lights, no smoke , no contrails, no sound.  The lights seemed to appear from no where as a group flying at the speed of single engine airplane and later at very high speed, I heard no sonic boom either, I am in my 50’s and I have never seen anything like these flying bright red-orange lights, I have seen squadrons of jet fighters flying at high altitude at night, airshows, and life-time of observing aircraft including supersonic jets and sonic booms all of which looked  and sounded nothing like these flying lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My girlfriend and I we&#39;re looking out of our bedroom window, which you can see the &#34;Limerick Power Plants&#34; Clear as day. Well upon looking out of our bedroom windows we saw a very bright Orange sphere to the left of the power plants. This orb was pulsating orange, dimming and brightening. We thought it was &#34;Venus&#34; or &#34;Mars&#34; but we used &#34;Google Sky&#34; and there we&#39;re no stars or planets in the area.  So we continued to watch the orb for about 10-15 minutes, noticing that it was slowly dropping to the treeline.  Once it touched the top of the treeline it vanished.  So i continued to just watch the sky as my girlfriend went down stairs. Literally 5min after her going downstairs, i see a Oval like UFO, changing Multiple colors (Red,Blue,White,Green,Orange)  Almost all spectrum&#39;s of the rainbow.  Which had came from the treeline&#39;s, Dash past the Limerick Power Plants. Going behind the smoke from the tower&#39;s to the other side of the treelines, and dove back in. Let me remind you that is a &#34;NON Fly Zone&#34;.  Noticing what i did, i rushed downstairs to tell my girlfriend. Once i did we went to the backdoor (All Glass) and watch the treeline. Literally as I&#39;m mentioning what i saw, we heard 1-3 Helicopters with no lights in the sky. Sounding like they we&#39;re heading to the power plants. Once we heard the copters, The UFO Burst out of the treeline continued towards the power plants smoke. Once it dove into or behind the smoke, it took off with the smoking almost blocking everyone&#39;s view.<n>

We pulled into the parking lot of Jake’s Diner on New Garden rd in Greensboro, NC.  As soon as I took off my helmet and sat down I looked up and said, “There is an UFO”!!  It looked just like Jupiter maybe a hair smaller but just as bright.  It was moving very, very slow across the sky no blinking lights.  I started to video tape it and my girlfriend was giving me a hard time saying it is not a UFO so I only captured some of it going across the sky.  Sure as shit when I quit recording, the light was just past half way across the very clear night sky then all of a sudden it turned red and a little fuzzy and cut an angle straight up away from us like it was going into space and disappeared in 2 seconds. I do have the video of it before it took off into space!!  Nothing nowhere, no lights could be seen it was gone.  She looked at me and said, “I guess you were right! ” WOW! That was the second time I have ever seen one. The first time about 13 years ago was very close and much more in our face with a military helicopter chasing it just 100 feet over our heads. That was a very cool sighting!!!  Living out by Belews lake near the Duke Power station a bright orange sphere the size of a large Bradford pear tree flew a 100 feet over our house.  A week before in the middle of the night I was woken by a helicopter buzzing our roof.  A week later around 8:00pm I heard that same helicopter so I told my wife quick I hear that helicopter let’s see it.  We ran outside and leaned against the deck and watched over our roof line waiting to see this loud helicopter.  It was getting louder and louder then we saw a large glowing orange sphere it was very peaceful not a sound when we saw it you could not even hear it moving in the air above us and it was only a 100 feet.  It moved like mercury very fluid then it went over the trees. Then we saw the military copte! r and it was as loud as can be.  We even saw the pilot look down at us with in a black visor helmet.  It was the type like Blue Thunder back in the day with the gun turret and small wings on the side.  They were flying straight towards the power station!  That was cool!!<n>

At first I thought they where airplanes but they never moved and where much brighter than an airplane would be.  Also, there where 2 other lights to the side a little further away.  The whole time on the highway I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, it clicked these were some kind of UFO when they never moved!<n>

They would fly in a pattern of 2 or 3 over the horizon.  They would go vertical, and sometimes in a horizontal pattern.  There would be 5 or 6 in the sky, turn right shoot up in the sky and disappear.  Then a couple more would come up out of the horizon and repeat the same pattern, and I know for sure it was not an airplane because we were next to an airport and heard a plane take off.  These were quiet and too close together to taxi that close together.  Then looking up into the sky directly above us were com trails from an airliner.  These were like nothing I have ever seen, and had no sound and moved beyond any speed in the sky that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My initial thought was that they were streetlights going up a tall mountain, but even though it was dark, we could see sky behind them and remembered that there are no mountains that tall around Conway.  The lights were staggered and did not form a pattern as far as we could tell.  My sister thought maybe they were several  radio towers, but the highest ones were way too high to be radio towers and the lights (whitish-yellow)did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance that the lights were staggered was large in both height and width,giving the appearance that they spread out over at least a mile.  As we approached the lights, I wondered if they were Chinese lanterns, but they appeared to be stationary and did not appear to flicker.  I recall the lights being squarish, or at least similar in size (it&#39;s hard! to remember exactly)  There could be a logical explanation for these lights, but I cannot find anything on the web.  We do not live in Arkansas, so we don&#39;t know who to ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we drove back by Conway (in the daylight) on our way home on May 1, we did not see anything in the sky that could account for the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish we had taken photos the night we saw them, but there was not time and our view was periodically obscured by trees.<n>

We thought it was an airplane on fire since it was so high in the sky.  We watched it move across the sky and then it just disappeared.  Two additional flaming balls appeared separately and disappeared as well.  While the second one was crossing the sky, my husband ran into the house to get binoculars to see if we could figure out what they were and I took pictures with my cell phone, but it is hard to say what they were.

My friend and I were visiting outside and she had noticed the object. I looked over and saw the craft, noticed that it was making zero noise, and took a few snap shots and a short video on my phone before the object got out of my focal on my camera.  The object traveled at a somewhat slow but constant speed, was very bright, but had a constant slow flicker. It continues outward into the sky and after it was out of the focal reach of the camera, I continues to watch the object until it was too far up to be seen.  Not sure what it was, but a stone shouldn&#39;t be able to reach those heights, and would make noise. It was round with no distinguishable &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; of a craft, so in this case it was purely an orange globe of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen I things in the area, but was the first that was not only close, but very close. Last time I&#39;d noticed something was a group of what looked to be stars moving very rapidly, and in a pack of at least thirty tiny white dots, all in a tight pack but dot of moved around quickly and again, moved off into very high reaches until out of sight.  I don&#39;t report this one because I&#39;m not even sure what it was, but this recent one was a bit too distinguishable, as well as it coming out from near ground level and out of the middle of a mountain...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I have been fascinated by being able to see the International Space Station during my walks (and subscribe to a NASA feed from http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/ that lets me know when I can see it) and I enjoy watching the stars and their different position in the sky at different times of the year. Tonight the moon and Venus are farther apart than the last two nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking my dog tonight (in a neighborhood behind First Colonial High School in Virginia Beach), I saw an orange sphere floating approximately 50-100 feet above the street/sidewalk. It looked like a home-made see-through contraption that someone put a candle or some other heat source in to make it rise like a hot air balloon. It was only about a foot in diameter.  It seemed as if one of the neighbors had launched it from their back yard.  It floated in the air and slowly, steadily and silently rose and traveled northwestward toward Venus.  As it got farther and farther away, its course gradually became more westward.  It had no tail or exhaust or contrail, just a glowing orange sphere. It became smaller and smaller like the size of a star to the human eye and then was no longer visible. The total duration of this encounter was approximately 2-3 minutes.<n>

There was still daylight and the sky was blue. I happened to glance up through the front windshield and saw an object in the sky which grabbed my attention.  At the first instant, I thought to be looking at a plane since there is an airport in the area. Also, the end of the object nearest to me had a strobe light; the other end had a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I noticed the object was stationary, not moving in the air, i.e. hovering. The object was approximately 200 feet above me and continued to remain stationary.  From the ground, the object was about the length of my index finger.  It was black, rectangular in shape, silent, and had no wings.  Part of the rectangular end with the red light had a “missing” space shaped like part of a circular radius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stare at the object to make sure of what was being seen, but then had to return to watching the road.  The traffic light at the approaching intersection turned red (SW 20th &amp; SW 60th) and I stepped out of my car to get another look at the object, but there was no sign of the object neither from looking directly above me nor to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second report of a sighting since living in north central Florida.  My first sighting was on March 2, 2006 and is posted on www.ufoevidence.org Case ID: 841. I’ve never seen anything unusual in the sky that could be termed a “UFO,” until 3/2/06 at age 53.

Something red and low flying appeared over the river I live on.  At first it looked like maybe a glowing orb.  It started out as a dark red and then it became a brighter red.  It went up over the river and proceeded to fly over M-50 and then over the fields.  The shape seemed to change from what looked like an orb to more of a triangle, but it was upright. So not flying on the wind, but against the wind.  It was still flying low, and it changed from red to more of a bright gold.  Then, something white shot out of the sky at the triangle. It looked like it entered the upright triangle craft.  The triangle was sizeable, not sure how big, but it looked bigger than a helicopter.  As it ascended into the sky, it was followed by a loud, low rumbling sound.  I put down that there were two crafts because of the one main upright triangle, and the white thing that shot into it.  The white thing looked like a tail as it flew! in.<n>

I was traveling about 60 MPH and I looked up to the left in the sky and saw a huge triangular shaped object that appeared to be ascending upward.  I saw the underside of it and it had vertical lines (rows) of red lights aligned in straight rows.  The lights were fading on and off, not quickly but maybe 3 seconds on, and 3 seconds off.  It was traveling West and since I was traveling East at 60 MPH, I only saw it for a brief time.  I tried to pull my car to the side of the road so I could turn around and watch more, but by the time I did, there was nothing more to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The pulsating light moved up and down and displayed a light that changed from purple/red to blue, a spectrum of color, like a rainbow.  My husband thought it was a star but I used my Google sky and the light was south east of the moon, white there were no displayed or obvious stars or constellations.  I watched several other woodcrafts fly pass the pulsating light.  The light then faded away about 21:30. At 22:48 my sister was looking out our patio door window which only faces South, screamed &#34;It&#39;s back!&#34;. My husband ,sister and myself then witnessed a light with two points illuminating the color of a very vibrant and dark red color.  It descended down South of the 118 free way.  It had no sound, moved extremely fast, and was very eerie for my family and I to see. I took photos with 12.1 mega pixel sony camera.  I have my bachelor degree in psychology, my husband works at a! airline valve company and my sister is a high school student.  The light at 21:48 descended down in tremendous speed and could only been seen for a min.  The pictures provided were photographed off my galaxy S blaze 5MP camera of the sony display screen and zoomed.<n>

So tonight i went to Google and typed boomerang shaped UFO in Miami Florida and came across this site and saw that a woman saw exactly what i saw that night, i can&#39;t say it was the same night but it was definitely around that day, she saw it coming from the south towards the north and it was the same shaped as what i saw, it had small lights they looked like stars forming a boomerang shaped or v shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> here are some links of what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.mufoncms.com/files/12493_submitter_file1__boomerangUFOGER.JPG<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIp_exFN_Ys<n>

I was in my truck talking on the cell phone when I noticed, through my windshield, a very large bright orange ball of light which appeared well above the horizon of the Galiura Mountain range east of the city of Mammoth, Arizona. It was at least 8 miles west of the city.  At first I thought it might be an aerial flare used by the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming that this object was facing me another object of the same size appeared just to its right but a little lower in elevation.  Then the second object temporarily “turned off” when a 3rd object appeared to the left of the first object but just slightly higher in elevation but of equal distance from the first object as was the second object.  As the 3rd object appeared the first object went out or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ended my phone call rather abruptly and headed to my trailer to get my camera.  This all happened within about 45 seconds of the first appearance of the first orange ball. As I headed to my trailer I had noticed that they all had disappeared but as I got to the door of my trailer I noticed that one of them had appeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it went out just as another appeared but farther to the south and then it went out as another one appeared giving it an effect of “cycling” one to the next.  There were a total of five objects that were cycling and they were in a straight line at about an 8 degree angle. I use the term “cycling” because I had read another persons description from another UFO reporting website use this description and I thought it fit best.  If anyone has ever seen the lights on a Marquee at a theater you would notice that the lights seem to move but it’s really an optical illusion because they are only going out in a pattern and it’s the adjacent light that goes on making it appear that they are moving.  The orange lights that I saw were similar to this but a lot slower and much further apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the five lights had gone out I thought that maybe the “show” was over but I got my camera anyway.  One more orange ball appeared but much lower and at the other end of the 5 lights that had appeared and then went out after about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen hundreds of thousands of landing lights from aircraft in my life and there wasn’t any possibility that these were aircraft landing lights from a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these orange spheres over the Picacho Mountains about 60 miles to the west several months ago.  It starts out with one orange ball glowing and then another one appears just to its right but a little below the first one.  Then another orange ball appears to its left but slightly higher.  The sightings over the Picacho Mountains lasted for several minutes but didn’t have the 5 lights that were “cycling”. I took pictures of the lights but they came out streaked because of the cameras movement.  A fixed tripod would have been the best to use for this purpose but I didn’t have one available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this is an elaborate hoax someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make it convincing.  The only way this could be done would be to use helicopters or ultra-lites. The timing would have to be perfectly set up to have the lights go on and then off in the order that they were seen. Plus, there would have had to have had 6 aircraft there at the same time. Who knows, maybe someone will figure out what they really were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had all spent a good deal of time on this base over the past 10 years, so we are used to military and coast guard aircraft, but this sounded very different.  As the aircraft got closer we could see that it appeared to be an unmanned drone of some sort, but not like any we had seen before. It was white, and very short, with 2 small wings on top of the front and longer ones lower and toward the back.   It appeared to have a single prop engine in the rear.  The aircraft was flying very low, and did a number of loops around the area.<n>

Object made no audible sounds and did not blink.  Steady orange glow that seemed to have a halo around it. It seemed to travel about the same speed or faster than a rotor craft.  Contacted the local FD and Anderson Hospital, no knowledge of incoming emergency helicopters.  It flew directly into thunderstorm. Object appeared to be about 2 to 3000 ft above.  Object flew in straight line directly over town, blinked 3 or 4 times and vanished. Speed of object was consistent. We live close to Scott Air Force Base. I am used to experiencing aircraft on a daily basis.  This object headed north of SAFB from the southwest (St. Louis). I&#39;ve never seen an object so brilliantly orange, like a very large candle.  The brightness didn&#39;t change at all until it exited several miles from town. It made absolutely no sound.  Rather shocking. I have four photos of the object from my cellphone.<n>

The sun was reflecting off the object making it easy to see its shape and size.  It had to be at least 30 feet wide and 8 feet in height.  For nearly 11 seconds it hovered and just after that it instantly launched Northwestern across the town of Pella.  With a slight incline of perhaps 5 - 10 degrees in a perfect straight line for 1 mile before blasting at a complete verticle line through the clouds.  Estimating that the clouds were perhaps 10,000+ feet in altitude.  This craft was easily travely 3+ miles per second without any sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We carpool because my car broke down a couple days ago.  We don’t know each other every well but we experienced something amazing.  Our shift ended around 2:30 am and both of us living in a suburb of Yakima it took us about 30 minutes to drive home. 20 or so minutes into our drive my friend’s car mysteriously shut off. Being two women and it being dark and late we got nervous.  That’s when we heard it.  It was quiet at first a little buzzing noise and I thought I was just hearing things.  But when my friend pointed it out as well I knew it wasn’t just me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car and walked around trying to see where the noise was coming from.  Then in the sky we spotted two &#34;teardrop&#34; shaped figures, they were silver and moving very quickly.  It was odd as if they were jumping from one place into the other but instantaneously. It freaked us out. For a moment we both felt as if we had left o! ur bodies and were looking down and watching the scene unfold from above.  Then black!  And when we awoke we found ourselves in the car and it was running again.  Only now it was 6:00 am.

Cloudy with different color tones white,dark.As the clouds broke i noticed a oval shaped white light..  At first thinking it was a trace cloud..or a puff of cloud..But no it was a white oval shaped dense light..its altitude was high(not sure#)The small oval object hovered and as the clouds closed disappeared.  Then reappeared as the blue sky broke.Hovered there ,never really moving..a little slightly to the left it moved..  This was an object,it had mass.. Maybe a satellite, Not sure???????..  Object(white oval)size (very small-considering distance-compared to clouds still seemed small)...Time (about 15-20 seconds before cloud coverage-then another 15 sec when clouds broke.(clouds closed).seen maybe another 10-15 seconds then disappeared into clouds.. apprx.1:45 pm.....ty.<n>

Our sky was illuminated enough as backdrop to make the object&#39;s appearance unmistakeable.  The size was much larger than airplanes appear so it was either very close or very large.  I mentioned it to my spouse after seeing it and told him I either saw a UFO or a flying witch.  I had been taking the dog out for his potty time when this siting occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was hovering high in the sky above Brown Rd.  It was bigger than a plane and very high.  It was quiet, didn&#39;t hear much of any sound besides the wind. It started to move after we pulled over and got out of the car to view it.  It was floating slowly down a back road.  We followed it down the back road and it disappeared.  A second small craft with three white/yellow orbs/lights was seen briefly after the big craft disappeared.  That quickly disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the first light dimmed, the second would appear,then third, sequentially from the right side to left side very quickly.  The speed of the sequence and steady &#34;right-center-left...&#34; pattern gave us the impression that the lights were rapidly orbitting around an unseen center in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first appearance was toward the western sky and the brightest,possibly closest, that we witnessed. It &#34;popped up&#34; with its racing serial pattern, showed it off for 10 or 15 seconds, then it disappeared just as quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scanned the sky for a bit and caught the performance 3 more times for about 10 seconds (each time), as if advertising its path across the Northern sky, heading further away heading towards Northeast, in the direction of the upper Savannah River or South Carolina.  We believe it was one object that reappeared, not multiples.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise coming from the light show.  A few actual planes passed through while we waited for the lights to reappear, and we heard their engines fine.<n>

I believe it was Southwest direction.  As I was watching the light for a few seconds, it vanished, however; just a little ways over, another appeared like the first and vanished.  Then the same thing happened 3 more times.  It looked like it was moving in a straight line. Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to my back porch to see if I could see it again.  All kinds of planes were flying back and forth where this had occurred, as if searching for it.  I called the newspapers and news channels in my area to see if anyone else had reported seeing the mysterious lights.  But no one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second time I had witnessed something similar.  About 2 years ago, on the same porch, I saw 3 lights in a row hovering over my house.  I stepped off the porch to get a better look; I watched them hover for a few seconds, not making a sound.  Then the lights began to move at a fast speed in a row towards the stars in a Southern direction.<n>

Also the sky was clear so there is no chance of it to hide in the cloud. the sky is full of star.  Me and my friend witness it. we were talking over the phone then i saw it and i told her. she saw it too.

I had no internal lighting in my room, the windows were clear and I had a very obstructed but comfortable view of a low wedge of northern sky from aprox North to North East (&lt;45 degrees azimuth arc), and &lt;45 degrees inclination arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cloudy, lots of sodium light pollution, very orange tint, a relatively low layer of disparate cloud allowed some view of the night sky. There was little to no wind judged from tree movement, it had been raining recently quite heavily in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on looking at stellarium I think I was looking at either Deneb or Vega, East of North, low to the horizon just above a houses pointed roof as seen from my vantage point, it was not particulary bright as I remember probably due to the cloud cover veiling it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a point of light, orange tinted that preceded to get very bright, within a second it was very bright - it is hard to define but I would say brighter than I have seen Venus or Jupiter, not as bright as a very low magnitude Iridium flare that I have seen before, brighter than any chinese lantern I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very noticeable and after a second at full brightness it dimmed down again. During this time I did not notice movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then dimmed to the level of a rather bright satellite and travelled slowly across the sky from left to right, before dissapearing behind a tree. At its dim level of light I did not notice flickering, strobes, or any indication of size of other detail such as nav lights etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled very slowly at the speed of a light aircraft and slower than Iridium sats I have observed, it also seemed to travel at a constant altitude and I did not discern any indication of a curved trajectory during the brief time I observed it (5 seconds or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no trail or any other indication of its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alerted someone in my house to this and we looked in the area for it, about a minute after the first incident another light source of the same luminosity characteristics of the first travelled along the same path and dissapeared behind the tree again, this light source did not get bright or change in any way other than moving across the sky at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my sighting :) Sorry for lengthy description of simple sighting, I believe that a more likely but not certain explanation for this is a satellite flare, though the &#34;pause&#34;, speed, and seemingly flat path of the light source(s) I have not witnessed before with LEO man made satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I&#39;ve hiked and climbed all over the hills and mountains in my area and know that there was no road for it to be a car.  After 10 minutes of watching the object bob up and down and back and forth it dipped into the trees and was gone<n>

I live in the flight path of an international airport so it’s quite normal to see low-flying airplanes moving overhead, and at first, that’s what I thought I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the object in the sky that I observed was traveling at a high rate of speed, and, with the light pollution making its outline visible, I could tell it was boomerang shaped.  Several dim lights emanated from its undercarriage.  This “craft” was flying quite low, much lower than typical airplanes, and it was silent as it glided overhead.  I ran onto my walkway and could still see the craft, which kept its rate of speed. As it disappeared towards the east, (meaning, I couldn’t see its outline as it faded into the darkness), I was startled by a shooting star that seemed to have streaked into the craft’s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe this was an airplane or a bird. I have never seen anything like this and I tend not to jump to conclusions, but this was just very, very odd.<n>

Just as I went into the house, my wife yelled for me to return because it had dimmed.  I came back to see the light fade out and go completely dark for a few seconds.  Then it returned briefly for a few seconds and then disappeared completely.  After it disappeared, we noticed a much dimmer light in the general vicinity that also faded to nothing after a few seconds.  About 10 minutes afterwards, a helicopter flew over the house very fast and low, but it was headed from east to west rather than northwest.<n>

It mimicked the ripples of a stone being thrown into a body of water. He said it happened at least 10 times.  Later that night-- around midnight -- my younger son (18) saw bright white lights in his room, much like camera flashes.  One was over his chest area as he lay in bed, one was near his window and the third was at the foot of his bed coming up from the floor.  Needless to say he was freaked out. He got out of bed and went outside in the driveway to see if there was a storm approaching, thinking that it might be lightening.  The sky was clear last night for the exception of one cloud that my son saw while he stood in the driveway.  It was in the southwestern sky and he said that it was emitting white horizontal flashes --nothing like typical lightening and NO thunder.  I would love to know if anyone else s! aw these lights last evening.<n>

This object did not have any blinking lights associated with commercial aircraft.  he light&#39;s intensity was about that of the planet Venus.  Neither of us ever witnessed anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS??  PD))<n>

This was NOT anything I have ever seen or heard in my 33 years of life. My husband is also ex Army he did not recognize these things. At approximately 9pm est.  I heard over my TV set a loud sound causing my house to  vibrate. I turned down television and stepped outside. There were 3 low flying craft making tight circles over head.  The seemed to be circular in shape had 4 large glowing red lights on the underside, the lights did alternate but not in any pattern. At times all lights would stay on. The lights were very large.There also was a pale orange glow emanating from the bottom of the crafts The sound was unlike anything I have ever heard, it was low and all encompassing these crafts would circle over head and then make wide circles covering the area of my small town. They did this for approximately 20 minutes. My 13 yr old son, my self and husband, and toddler began experienci! ng severe headaches and nausea during and after these craft appeared. It was terrifying. I people down the street heard and witness this event as well as I could here them down the road taking. Eventually these craft took off out into the distance and appeared to disappear into space. We are familiar with the normal commercial aircraft patterns and these flew boldly against these patterns and at times hovering in the air over head.  My husband attempted to video using his phone but nothing appeared on the video. I have been watching strange  objects appear  in this area for the last 5 years. This was unlike any Ive ever seen.<n>

I could not tell the shape of the object, it looked like a star. I know it wasn&#39;t a star because you could tell that it was lower than the stars. At first I thought it could be 2 satellites, one in front of the other. Except I have seen satellites and that isn&#39;t what this was. It actually could have been one craft with one light in the front and one in the rear. I saw it move across the sky, away from me, for about 20 seconds before it just disappeared.  It didn&#39;t appear to just shoot off into space. I just moved across the sky and disappeared.  If this was 2 objects, they were moving in formation at the same speed.  This wasn&#39;t a know aircraft, it was completely silent. From my point of view the object looked like this: .    .   Could this have been 2 satellites moving across the sky in formation? Sure. Only I&#39;ve seen satellites before and satellites always appear smaller, and stay in the sky a lot longer.  Plus I&#39;ve never seen 2 move across the sky in a formation like this.

Although I stay near an Army Post, I don&#39;t believe it was anything military. When I looked into the direction into which I had seen the light before, I saw nothing but stars, until I noticed one that looked out of place.  I continued to walk further into my back yard and the light I thought that was a star began to get brighter.  Soon it was a really bright orb of light hovering and If I looked at it closely it was making small movements up, side to side, and even small circles.  The light began to dim and fade till it was gone, then it would begin to appear and get brighter than the other stars around it. It continued to this for 5 or 6 times then remained solid in the sky.  No flickering lights were visible, just a change of color from white to a dim yellow and back to white.  Partner and roomate also witness the scene.<n>

I had just gotten home from work, and was kinda of watching the clouds rushing across the sky pretty fast, lot of wind, it was blowing maybe 15-20 with some gusts around 30. Not incredibly unusual but a maybe a little unusual. I always look at the stars, anytime i can, we see a lot of shooting stars where i live, there isnt much light pollution especially when looking westward, we are on the Gulf of Mexico so basically its a black out. I noticed a line of four lights, vertical, which at first were all white, then as drew closer could distinctly see 4 colors, blue white, red and yellow. keep in mind they were all white-ish but they had distinct like almost florescent tone to them like a reddened white and so forth. The craft, I guess i have to assume it was a craft as it came within maybe 2 miles of me also had noticeable light beams nothing different than you might see coming out of a helicopter in t! hree rays on both top and bottom of the cylinder. I couldn&#39;t say if they were actual beams or just light reflection like from the four lights, but why would there only be three? and on top and bottom. I watched it clearly for maybe 15 seconds or so and noticed it start to turn (the light arrangement went slanting, like it was turning sideways they went from vertical to maybe 15 degrees from horizontal.  I ran inside to get my roommate off the couch it was clearly moving away, we came out maybe 10 seconds later and i could see it faint really fast, like impossible speed.  I watch planes, jets, helicopters all the time at night, they move maybe like 120 times slower than this thing did. I am making my calculation on this assumption. A normal helicopter moves maybe 150- 225 mph, a commercial jet plane, flies around 500-600 mph, we have air-force and navy jets within a hundred miles in two directions that zip through quite often around 2000 mph. When i watch a jet it will enter! and leave my sightline in about 15 -20 seconds, a jetliner ta! kes mayb e 45 seconds to a minute to go across the sightline. This thing was basically not moving at all, just sitting there, and then when it started to move it went from motionless to gone from sight in about 2 seconds. Roughly at the minimum 5 times faster than 2k is mach ten, we have nothing remotely that fast in the sky. The fastest jets in the world go 6k mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I was leaving the park, turning West, I noticed a red light in the Western sky moving slow and steadily from South to North.  I proceeded to drive and turn onto Sabana Grande Avenue.  This was when I noticed the orange hugh in the middle of the red aura.  I kept driving and turned left onto Riverview Drive and kept a watchful eye on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane because, at the right angle, you can see a light that isn&#39;t flickering, and, after some time, when they turn or keep moving, you cansee the flashing light.  I waited for this object to do so before concluding it was a UFO.  It never turned  and simply kept moving into the light cloud cover, dimmed, and vanished.<n>

It was huge and by that it looked to be several miles long in mass and length if it were in our lower atmosphere! If it were higher in the upper heaven then it could even span perhaps hundreds of miles!  There is not telling how far up it was or how big it really was. Measure from the top of a car&#39;s rear view mirror to the middle of the windshield and that is how much space it took up of that area and it looked as high up there in space as the stars look among the constellations, then it tilted downward as if it were dipping low and vaporized right before our eyes but left a faint flash of light o! range yellow in an oblong design along it&#39;s outer perimeter between the bottom and middle lights. She had been looking at it and trying to figure just what it was while talking on her cell phone which she immediately told her sister she had to hang up and then it disappeared in a second from her hanging up the phone. I saw it no more than perhaps two no more than three seconds. She saw it maybe seven to eight seconds also. But boy is it etched into my mind! It reminded me of how the triangle craft in Arizona looked that made UFO history. But this dwarfed that image. And it was slanted sideways at an angle. It was super massive. This is happening during a near full moon on a clear starry night. There were no clouds or obstructions for it to disappear in or behind. It startled us very much and we were so relieved it disappeared as it scared us good! The wife commented how glad she was it was gone. We rode home looking out the windshield fervently and methodically paying close! attention to the skies. I actually veered of the road once an! d she be ing a woman of no nonsense would usually get on to me about watching where I&#39;m going but she was too mesmerized at gazing out the window that it did not phase her much which trust me is highly unusual behavior for her! We slowly rode home watching the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home a bright light came over the trees from the woods near our home as I was talking to my son on the phone about that massive UFO in the backyard. I was still watching the skies because of the earlier observation. This was perhaps twenty minutes later at 9:34 pm. I opened the back door and called for the wife to please come see this strange light. She came outside and we both agreed it might just be a plane as it was on the path planes usually come up over the woods from. But I noted there was no noise and the light was going too fast for an airplane. She said...  &amp;quot;That s just a plane&amp;quot;...&amp;#12288; but it reminded me of an encounter we reported on your site just after Christmas about a fireball we encountered up close because it was unusually bright and commanded your attention. As it rose higher into the airspace it was dazzling bright then instantly dimmed away like a vacuum tube does when the power is turned off and simply disappeared right before ! our eyes just like that last fireball did we had saw right after Christmas. The sky was clear and the bright moon was lighting everything up and there was no place for that craft to hide behind or cloud to absorb into and it was getting closer to us not going away into some other area. I&#39;ve seen planes disappear like that before and wonder what causes that effect but this was totally different in the way the largeness of the craft was becoming and the brightness it was emitting. Well she exclaimed...&amp;quot;That&#39;s two UFO encounters in less than a half hour&#39;s time!&amp;quot; I noticed also after that episode that all of the planes traveling by were all smaller and dimmer and had flashing lights that you always take mental note of when seeing them passing over in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was listening to all of this happening on the phone so he is an audio witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this out of great concern and if anyone reading this account had seen this very frightening event then you would be thinking like I am that it has nothing to do with our technologies and it certainly is nothing we have in our hangers! It is just too massive to hide anyplace. I&#39;m never going to be the same about what&#39;s out there! I saw this mother ship even if it were just a few seconds and it was truly a life changing event. I am so glad also I did not behold it any longer than I did because I&#39;m spooked just writing this.<n>

It just evaporated like mist.  Then later on that night, I had just gotten into bed and heard random weird voices loudly saying something, but it didnt make sense.  I sat up and looked for something, then a bald thin but big thing popped its head up from the end of my bed and started walking side ways like a crab, and went out my closed window.

It was a rather  cloudy night, however my gaze turned  towards the sky and at the corner of my eye I saw the intense bright   moon casting its luminescence  hiding behind the clouds, suddenly the next minute I  glimpse at and I just saw  it just moved.  That&#39;s when  I paid attention for I assumed this is rather  bizarre ,more so  strange for the moon to move at that velocity, subsequently as I observed the cloudy night sky ; There was a white globe of light which one could visually measure it to  the size of the moon  around the Maney hill area where I live . I was entranced and mesmerised as   it started moving in a random yet circular fashion. I wasn&#39;t convinced so I looked more closely to find 4 to 5 more globes of white light similar to the size and shape moving in a random pattern. I ran upstairs to wake my husband up ,for this wasn’t a visual hallucination as I don’t drink , it was fascinat! ing as  he too witnessed it and presumed  they were laser beams .... I wasn’t convinced at the explanation as I seen laser beam displays, besides I questioned him “who would have a laser display at 2.30 am in the middle of the night”. Besides if the light is reflecting from below one can visualise the path or beam from below.  There wasn&#39;t any trace of torch or laser light shining from below  as it was above the clouds and very high . He  assumed it was perhaps solar flares and is the aurora borealis.  I disagreed as  the pattern had no resemblance to that of a  veil of northern lights, it was just pure white globes  of light , which one can  purely mistake it for a moon hiding  above the clouds . My hubby tried to capture it on camera, as we couldn’t capture the image we concluded that the digital camera was inappropriate and didn’t work for night vision images. Consequently I just watched intently and the pattern repeated itself once more and the globes of light disappeare! d, eventually the globe of light moved in the opposite directi! on of ou r house and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I posted a query in our local Sutton Coldfield observer if anyone had witnessed anything or perhaps experienced what I had visualised for indeed it was rather strange and mysterious   phenomenon. There were no replies as it was late Sunday night and not many people would be awake when Monday commences as the working week. I am very analytical and believe in the rules of science, nevertheless still pondering if it were a natural phenomenon ... Not sure. I am convinced that this is not a prank. From my understanding of physics the incident light whilst shining from below wouldn&#39;t reflect in such an intensity , more so from above no way was it a real image  . The globes of light were too bright and too large... It doesn&#39;t sound logical at all. Either it is perhaps a military operation or something that cannot be elucidated. Rather unfortunate that the images we captured are not lucid. Furthermore as I was flabbergasted during the incident consequently my adrena! lin pumping impeded my ability to reflect or perhaps act logically to record the occurrence on an iphone was indeed an utter failure. Nonetheless I am convinced what I witnessed from the inception of my peripheral vision was not an illusion or a visual hallucination. It will be etched as a memory in my subliminal system ... That I am affirmative!<n>

It&#39;s far from the city so there is a bright sky evey night if there are no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From time to time I see these strange bright lights going slowly across the sky at night.  The light is not flashing like that of a plane or helicopter. I would know because we are near a flight path for jets and see them go by every night.  This light is always moving at about cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another tonite so I feel I must report it.  Me and my buddy who I work with out here with were sitting outside at night and we saw this light moving across the night sky, not flashing, just slowly moving.  All of a suddan we see it get dim.  Then it flares up again.  Then it goes out.  Then we see it get bright again then disapear out of nowhere.  This was not in a regular pattern either.  I might also ad as a sky watcher,   I have noticed these objects in the sky here for the past 4 years about.  I also saw some of these last wee! kend. 3 of these objects in one night. I saw 2 heading north over the mountains.  Then an hour later I saw onw slowly zig zagging across the night sky.  And these are just the ones i can remember.  What I&#39;m seeing here is very real and to the untrained eye they can be easy to mistaken for a man made object.  I see so many I make a report almost once a year.  Keep your eyes open for them up here because man i&#39;ve been seeing alot of then since 2012 has came around.  Almost double than what i&#39;ve noticed in past year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No date indicated by source of report.

I live in an urban area so only bright stars are usually visible through the street light pollution.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite to the west at about 45 degrees off the horizon and above the trees moving in a south by south west direction and continued to follow it.   About 15 seconds into its movement it seemed to make a short burst of speed and move erratically which made me think my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Then the object began to turn in a easterly direction and finally continued on a straight course to the North East for about 20 seconds, then flashed brightly green and vanished from my vision.  I did not see ant streak or trail indicating it has sped off, it just vanished.<n>

Walking southward to northward I looked up in sky and spotted 3 lights, at first I tried to comprehend what it was I was looking at.  Trying to make sense of it I first thought it was a reflection from street light  on wires but there were no wires.  Then I thought it was the branches on the tree making a reflection.  I moved to the other side of tree and my wife asked me what I was doing ?  I told her to look up and asked her what is that.  She watched these three objects of light and moving around in the sky above us and they the two objects at the top looked like they were playing and the 3rd object was below the other 2 objects not really joining in on the maneuvers the other 2 were making.  I was going to grab my blackberry and try to film it but it was too high and too late they were gone out of site too fast.  Just a foot note, my wife is a none believer in UFO&#39;S but she could not explain what we both had just seen.  There were 2 smaller planes just above us,   One plane was flying west to east and the other plane was flying south to North most likely going to land at are small airport outside our small city .<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a shooting star or stars I have seen them before.  I just wanted to share this experience with who ever else might have been in the Lower Georgian bay area last night in the 22nd of April at around 940pm and looked into the sky and witnessed these objects playing a cat and mouse game with each other .<n>

Although I have never heard of “PROGRESS46P”, it was also included in the NASA listings, so I thought I would see what I could see of that, too. I didn’t really know what I was looking for, but it was a nice evening and decided to watch the sky for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, what I saw was a thing shaped like a perfect triangle with all three points a bit brighter, plus another point of light in the center equally bright. There were “lines” connecting all 3 sides, but nothing to the center light. It moved swiftly across the sky, but slow enough for me to focus upon it. It moved much faster than the ISS I had just observed. It was a very pale amber color overall. It followed a path similar to what I was expecting from both the ISS and PROGRESS46P, as their times were similar, as follows:  [9:26PM--ISS tonight viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 87 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 36 degrees WNW, and a departure of 23 degrees ESE.] A few minutes later, PROGRESS was to be as follows:  [9:34PM—PROGRESS46P viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 83 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 34 degrees above WNW, and a departure of 31 degrees above ESE.]  I never saw PROGRESS—not sure what it looks like. I have seen the ISS many times if the sky is clear. But I have never seen a fast-moving “Triangle On a Mission”! How interesting!!<n>

It was much brighter and larger than other stars, so I figured it was a plane or something like that. But I can recognize a plane&#39;s green and red blinkers, and it&#39;s steady movement; this was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was distinctively bright dark red, and bright orange (it would seem to alternate between the two, but definitely red and orange could be discerned clearly). I looked at it for a few minutes, then realized it was actually moving slightly, and would temporarily completely vanish for a moment, only to reappear at a slightly different location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This process of &#39;pulsing&#39; red/orange and &#39;vanishing&#39; to re-appear close by continued for a few minutes. The very last time it vanished, I could&#39;ve sworn i saw it &#39;release&#39; some sort of a trail, similar to a meteor tail, but it was a red-streak, and bent slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was simply amazed at what I had just seen, so I kept looking at the sky, but eventually clouds moved in, and the object never re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went online to do some research the next day, and sure enough, one lady in the area has caught it on film and uploaded to youtube. (unfortunately, the video is of poor quality and hardly shows a faint but bright red light flickering slightly before disappearing)  I&#39;ve contacted this person, and I found out that she was looking in the same direction, at the same time I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother claims to have seen the light return the next day, although I wasn&#39;t in the area at the time, so I can&#39;t confirm this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, both Texas and Georgia also reported bright orange/red lights around 9:00pm on that same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am under the impression that this object may have been the very same, headed for the Gulf, giving each state a different point of view.<n>

We saw Mars and Venus, plenty of stars, and a couple airplanes   But what kind of creeped us out were two reddish lights that we saw on the horizon, exactly South, after sitting up on my car.  They were flickering, so we knew they weren&#39;t planets, and they were too reddish-orange to be stars.  I pulled out my phone and pulled up Google Sky maps and there was nothing similar in that area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were lined up and spaced apart, so we thought they might be radio towers or something, and we ignored them. About 2 minutes later, she gasped and pointed.  They had not only moved, but were very noticable now, flickering between orange and red.  We kept a close eye on them, and they began to move towards each other, and they almost traded places, since they were moving straight, i thought they were planes, but one gradually slowed down and stopped again, while one kept moving, but slowing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked her back to her house, and when i went back to my car and looked, they were both stopped, and noticeably smaller. I marked it off as helicopters or something, and drove home. I didn&#39;t notice it again, but i thought it&#39;d be worth it to look around on the internet, and bang, i see videos posted within the last week that look EXACTLY like what we saw. We only saw two lights, though, while most of the videos have 4+<n>

The objects moved slowly to the west for 1 to 3 miles, in generally the same direction, disappearing into the overcast at around 1000 feet.  Each object was visible for approximately 15 to 90 seconds, and flew at random speeds, but all heading up and to the west.  Many of the objects appeared to fly in loose formations of two or three, for at least a portion of the time.  One observer said they were pretty.  Two other observers said they were not aircraft but UFOs after only a few seconds of observation.<n>

This object did not change shape or altitude, nor did it make any noise, but every so often had what appeared to be an array of yellow lights on the underside that would come on and turn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed this object with 2 pairs of Binoculars of differing power,  One pair 7x35 wide angle, the other 8x32, and a 5x monical. I could not make out any major details other than a basic shape, being circular and white.  No military aircraft were seen any were near the object, though at least one Civilian Passenger plane a 757 and a Private Lear Jet flew in the vicinity of the object.  There were two other witnesses that saw the same object as it floated by.  Both of these witnesses saw nothing different than I did and said it was white and circular.  At 13:50hrs the ! object had floated out of view to the North.  There were no reports on the news that night of this object so I do not know if anyone else saw it other than the 3 of us.<n>

We arrived at the lake around 6am.   At approximately between 7am-7:30am I happened to look up at the sky towards North West of the way I was facing and saw up in the sky something that resembled a falling star.  It was coned shaped at the front and the color of the front was a bright white (like a bright light bulb). But the shape of the object behind the tip/front was what puzzled me.  The best I can describe it is sort of like the width of how planes leave a trail of clouds from the wings but the color which would normally be white was instead bright and resembled the color of a arc welding torch(super bright shiny blue). The object didn&#39;t leave a trail like how the trail of a normal plane is even visible after the aircraft has moved on, instead with the unknown object the &#34;trail&#34; so called seemed to follow right along each side of the bright white cone shaped center/tip leaving no! residual traces after it moved out of view.  I only observed the object for approximately 5-7 seconds before it fell out of view behind forrest trees in the distant.  If I had to estimate the distance the object appeared to be from where I stood maybe 1-3miles I can&#39;t be exact. I was sort of stunned/shocked when I looked up and saw the thing in the air and I was actually expecting to hear a loud boom or sound from the impact of the object which was descended at slight angle not straight down, but I didn&#39;t hear a thing.  Being stunned and caught in the moment I wasn&#39;t even able to sum up the wits to shout to my family members who were fishing down a couple of yards from where I was standing.  There was a good amount of people fishing North West of where I saw the object which would position the unknown object behind the other fishermen.  After the incident was over I looked around to see if any body else was pointing at the direction of the object but from the way it looked they! were all focused on fishing while I happened to gaze off at j! ust the right time. I told my family members of what I had witnessed but none of them saw it!! Just my luck!!<n>

I looked into the sky to see if it was cloudy, because I was expecting to see clear weather. It was a little cloudy.  I looked to the south from where I stood, and saw an interesting red, glowing, oval shaped light hovering in place. At first I didn’t know what to make of it, then, two other unidentified flying objects appeared from the distance hovering not far from one another. It was like a light bulb slowly lighting into clear view. I walked into the house to get my camera phone as quickly as possible. When I returned back outside they were still there. I took a couple shots of them, and tried to get some video of these objects. After about a minute or two, another pair of theses interesting lights slowly illuminated at a further distance from the others, and one started slowly moving in random directions, but always returned to its original position. I took a couple more photos after the last t! wo arrived. The first three objects that appeared,  begins to veer off out of my sight till they were gone. The other two started slowly moving further above the first three, then, they dimmed away like a dyeing bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures I took did not do any justice to what I saw. In the photos you can see one small red light along with two other lights that turned out white. In another one you can see the first three of them and they all are white. I am not sure why all but one turned out white, but what I saw was that they were all glowing red. The last ones I took with all five of them together didn’t turnout so great. The last two to show up did turn up in the pictures. I’m assuming it was because they were further away in the distance. As for the video, my hands were very shaky from the excitement of this event, and ended up with an 8 second video that was very shaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About myself, I am a caregiver for develop mentally disabled adults.  I have been a caregiver for the past ten plus years.  As far as believing in the supernatural, I want to believe, and this is the first encounter I have ever experienced. I don’t know if there is any explanation for this or not, but I saw this and it was very incredible.  I’ll probably never see this kind of event again, so I took some subpar pictures to prove it.<n>

I was standing out front of the Snoqualmie Eagles Club in Northbend Washington talking with three of my friends.  We are musicians and had just performed at a birthday party for a family from the area.  We were talking about the meteor shower that was to happen that evening.  Two of us were facing the West looking over a star lit night sky when we both noticed what we thought was a satellite.  It was a very small round speck of light, moving from the North to the South.  My friend took his eye off of the object for a split second and then back on it again. I had my eyes trained on it.  The object stopped and flashed a very large bluish white light, my friend saw the flash of light and then from the spot of the flash it seemed to move at a tremendous speed at about a thirty degree angle away from us and to the Southwest and disappeared.  My friend and I have never seen anything like that in our lives. It was! mind bending.<n>

His vision isn&#39;t as good as mine and he asked me to see if the light had any red lights or was blinking like an airplane. I moved to where he was and saw a moving light heading from NW to SE.  I then stepped away from the fire to get a clearer look.  As soon as I locked on the light, it seemed to slow up and get smaller.  It continued to slow nearly to a stop and the light diminished until it disappeared entirely in front of my eyes.  It was looked the way a star would look if it were receding.  We ruled out several options including a possibly supply launch to MIR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the International Space Station??  PD))<n>

The sky was clear and no moon.  I observed an object, (white light,) that was traveling in an almost due south direction. The object then changed course moving to the southwest and then made a complete circle.   At this point, the object would move straight, suddenly reverse direction, move left and right, and make 90 degree course changes without slowing down and then come to a complete stop.  This repeated itself for approximately 25 minutes, and the object then appeared to get dim and then disappear all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be very high in altitude and did not make any noise that we could hear.<n>

I was looking out towards the west, which would be toward the Seattle airport from where I live.  Because of this I am often aware of aircraft in the distance.  Normally I watch very carefully for any sign that would let me know that it is an airplane, flashing lights, in line for landing, etc.  I noticed that either the planet Venus or Jupiter was noticeable and very bright.  Looking down and to the left of the bright planet, there was another very bright light, which I initially took as a star.  Confused by this because it was so bright and I was unfamiliar with any other planet being that close to another one at this time, I looked at it for a few minutes.  In that time of watching it, it began to move slowly up from a three o’clock position up to what I would call the 12 o’clock position.  It moved very slow and precise across the sky.  I continued watching it because I was thinking that it had to! be an airplane.  Because it never flashed any red lights or changed from its original bright state, I started thinking it had to be a UFO.   As it stayed at the 12 o’clock position above my head for a few second it was if someone turned off a light switch and I know longer saw any light from it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was putting my child in for a bath when he called me on to the balcony.  I grabbed my daughter and ran out to see what was going on.  Approximately 15 miles away and approximately 2 miles up in the sky was a glowing orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was skeptical and thought it looked like a street light, but I am on balcony just about every night and I have never seen this light before. It was big, much bigger then the stars, and it had a strange white sun-like glow to it.  It started to fade away until it was completely gone.  A second later it faded back in, glowing brightly again. Instantly a second glowing orb appeared to the right of the first one.  Then the started to move a little side by side, and fade out again. This happened a few more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab my dad while my boyfriend filmed the orbs, then we watched the orbs move and fade in and out.  I ran back inside to grab the telephone to call a near by neighbor, but by the time I came back out the orbs had vanished.  We live right near the airport and have never seen these lights before.  A few camera flashes were seen around the neighborhood.  About 2 minutes later, an airplane from the airport started circling the area where the orbs were seen.  It circled about 5 times. Approximately 15 minutes later my boyfriends mother showed up.  After discussing the details and the incident we brought her on the balcony to show her where we saw the lights.  About two minutes of looking, the orb that appeared on the right the first time we witnessed them appeared again for about 40 seconds.  We got the orb fading out on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called the National UFO Reporting Hotline.<n>

All of a sudden I saw a spot of distorted space in the western sky. I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me and then a light appeared which was about the brightness of Venus. It then split into a flying v formation and started to head north.  While the 5-8 lights stayed mostly in the flying v formation, the individual lights did move in and out of formation.  It looked as though they were doing little tricks. Very fast maneuvers in and out of formation.  About halfway across the sky they kicked their speed up and bolted the remainder of my viewing range at a phenomenal speed. Never seen anything like this before and i&#39;m hopping that there was others in my area that saw it.  I was mesmerized and spent the brief experience trying to figure out what I was seeing.  I didn&#39;t have the time or nor the instantaneous response to capture a photo or video of the event! . It was most certainly not technology that we have been exposed to yet.  The only hypothesis I can come to is that it was extraterrestrial spacecraft.  I&#39;m not religious nor am I a conspiracy theorist. I do believe there is life out there but never thought it likely made it to our little blue planet. Unless the gov is coming out with some crazy new tech I&#39;m pretty sure they found us.<n>

My boyfriend was on the balcony when he called me out see see what he thought he was a UFO. At first I was skeptical, the object looked like a very bright glowing street light far away.  As I look closer I realized it was much too high up, and so big and bright it could have not been an airplane, nor a street light.  The glowing orb then moved a little and then it just vanished. 2 seconds later it appeared again, along with another glowing orb, they moved side by side and then eventually both orbs faded away and then immediately faded back glowing brightly.  I ran inside to get my dad while my boyfriend recorded the orbs. My dad witnessed these orbs as well.  They kept moving and vanishing.  Suddenly they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few more minutes but nothing happened. My step mom came home. I brought her to the balcony and explained the vents and showed her where we saw the orbs. Two minutes later, one orb appeared again for about 30 seconds and then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, a civilian plane started circling the area. The orbs kept appearing, brighter each time, and moving between 22:00PM and 1:00AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A helicopter was issued to patrol the area between these times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am most definitely positive what I saw was a UFO.  I got about 10 or 11 videos of the orbs and i&#39;m hoping to catch more tonight.<n>

SHe was driving and noticed three peculiar lights in the sky that individually resembled small balls of fire.  They were gliding in a triangle shape at a constant speed.  Our car was going at around 70 mph.  At first I thought they may have been low flying helicopters or remote control airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent some time in the U.S. Air Force and am familiar with many different kinds of aircraft but after watching the lights for a little bit decided that I have never seen lights like those on any kind of aircraft previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that off to the east there was one more solitary &#34;fireball&#34; flying low over the horizon.  It appeared to be moving at the same rate as the three lights above us.  It was partly cloudy that evening so judging the height at which the objects appeared is difficult but I would approximate it at a thousand feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my passenger window to see if I could hear any type of engine noise but heard nothing.  Granted, I was in a moving car on the highway.  The lights eventually passed overhead heading north.  The light at the tip of the triangle eventually faded out but the two at the base just kept flickering off into the distance until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t recall seeing any other commercial aircraft in the area which seems odd because there is a municipal airport in the vicinity.  After the sighting I called the Joliet Police Department to see if there had been any reports of strange lights in the sky.  The night commander informed me that no such reports had been made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background info on observers: 32 y.o. male, unemployed photographer 28 y.o. female, secretary<n>

They seemed to fly completely in tandem, or like they were connected, but I&#39;m sure the distance between them was at least 40 yards.  They continued south and then suddenly the ball of light slowly faded out and the helicopter flew right through where it had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She had her iPad so that we could identify the planets; the brightest of which we figured was Venus. It was Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then, at approximately 21:40 PDT, I suddenly noticed a large, dimly-visible, ethereal object to the right of Venus, at about 45-degrees above the Northwest horizon moving toward the Southeast at about the rate of speed of a high-flying jet aircraft (or the ISS space station). I next noted that it might be under tow, as a dim dot way ahead of it seemed to be moving at the same speed and direction. (That could have been an unrelated satellite.)  The object would take about four minutes to cross overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on a steady course and I was able to predict where it would appear after I walked through the house to the front yard.  There we watched it continue on the same path and disappear to the Southeast.  My wife then called a Reno TV Station, and the Fleischman Planetarium at the University of Nevada, Reno but there had been no other reports of phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe it as being asymmetrical and slightly ovoid in shape, with variable shades of pinkish-gray (or pinkish-tan) and was larger than a blimp would appear at 1,000-feet of altitude a half-mile away.   Neither of us heard any sound during its transit of the night sky, and it was a very calm, quiet evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We searched the internet for clues. I found nothing that would correspond with what I saw.  She went to a NASA website and found the IOTD (Image of the Day) which consisted of three red-and-white parachutes being tested over Arizona by the Orion Test Team.   Could our sighting be a related test? Or was it totally unrelated and will forever remain a mystery to us.<n>

We have sightings of these crafts for about the last year, in the beginning it was only one craft in the distance,  now its multiple crafts at least 5 exteremely close.  they are getting closer and closer and that is what is scaring us and making us very nervious and concerned.<n>

This light was moving up and down left and right, and every five minutes or so it would dim out almost completely before starting to shine vibrantly again. after watching it for about an hour just south of NORAD another one flew across the sky, it flew smoothly but was very large and a helicopter was following behind it about four hundred yards.  It flew directly over my house, coming from fort Carson and heading north.  Twenty minutes later an aircraft which looked like a very very large jet (at least the size of five F-16&#39;s) flew over my house from the south west area, it was nearly silent until it was directly over my head and it sounded like a jet but very muffled, the aircraft was very low, I could see its wings and it had two blue non-flashing lights on its wingtips and an orange glow near the fuselage section.  The bright white light that was hovering stayed lit for! about another half an hour then slowly dimmed away. now there are three helicopters circling the area and a friend of mine nearly ten miles away was seeing the same thing.  I saw the same light last night and it was moving but not flashing its lights and going dim.   I worked on f-16&#39;s in the Air Force, whatever jet flew over my house was like the holy grail, nearly silent and large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a really bright white sphere moving smoothly across the sky.  It seemed to get brighter and brighter like it was approaching or getting closer and I started to get scared, because I did not know what I was seeing.  Then another one not as bright was going in the opposite direction heading right to it and the brighter sphere moved down at a 90 degree angle! And then just kept on going.  The fainter sphere kept going in the other direction and quickly faded away. And then I watched the brighter sphere move across the sky.  It only took about 2 minutes for it to fade completely out of view.  As it faded away it looked just like a star in the sky.  There were no colored or blinking red lights on it. Just a beautiful bright orb looking thing.  I tried to get video of it, but my camera didn&#39;t register it.  About 3 minutes later, a plane went over head and I knew the sphere! was definitely not a plane.  The plane made noise and had two bright white lights on each wing and a blinking red light.  I don&#39;t know what it was. But I&#39;m going there again with friends to see if it comes back.  It was amazing.  There&#39;s a lot going on at Dugway recently....it could be a military experiment.<n>

I had just got back to my camping spot right after the concert had ended, around 1:00am, which means I was away from the festival lights.  A friend pointed out an unidentified object flying overhead.  It was flying fairly high at a fast pace, from West to East.  The object was a dark gray, triangular shaped, with a white light in each of it’s corners, and about as large as a jet. It did not seem to be like a jet, nor did it make any sound. I watched as it disappeared into the night sky.  There were several planes flying that night, including advertising planes for the concert.  I do recall seeing the object after a plane flying by. In addition, I saw a fast moving white light that resembled a moving star, which I concluded as a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read on a Coachella message board that other had seen unidentified objects as well, however not similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was on the phone with my father at the time and being that he grew up in the area, he&#39;s used to military aircraft passing through on a daily basis.  What I saw this evening was an additional light of red.  One linear object with green, blue, and red light.  It appears to be fairly close to the ground and not within normal airspace.  It moves in a similar fashion to that of a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For awhile we discussed as to whether or not some college kids had figured out how to add neon onto a kite, but there was little to no wind to support our kite theory.  The way it hovers and moves slowly and then can swoop around in an erratic fashion, it looks just like a kite on a good day at the beach.  This is the second time I&#39;ve seen these lights.  Each time we feel we have been close to it yet there&#39;s no sound whatsoever.  The previous sighting was 2-4 weeks ago  in the south east por! tion of the sky on our drive home.  The road was tree lined and I noticed a neon green and neon blue light through the trees to the east.  I didn&#39;t say anything because I thought I was tired but the other cars in front of me started slowing down and it appeared that they had seen it as well.  When I finally said something to my fiance a neon green light came over the road ahead of us and went down below our line of sight on the opposite side.  The lights did not appear to be orbital in shape but linear.  They did not appear to leave a light trail and were moving in a downward swooping motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date not indicated by the source of the report.

Object appeared to be very long and thin.  Black.  It was chasing a bright round light.  Smaller red light also seen.  There were no blinking lights on object that normal aircraft have.  It was hard to see shape as it was black in night sky but I described it as a long stick.  Made propeller noises, but no propellers seen.  Flew lower than helicopter as well.

Tracked it for only about 6 seconds before it went beyond the roof of my house, I jumped up and went to end of house but could no longer locate it. It was like a black piece of paper moving across the sky with the shape revealed only by the stars.  This is a major metropolitan area,about 9 miles north of syracuse airport. It was traveling from east to west, no lights at all, seemed to be down where small planes are flying,very dangerous if this was some stealthy thing from our air force!  OR, it was much much higher and a lot bigger,witch could explain the no sound at all.  Star watching for 30 years,first time I don&#39;t know what it was.<n>

We did`nt think much of it.  A few minutes later we seen a really bright flash of light come from the woods about where the &#34;shooting star&#34; we got really scared i called my step-dad to come pick us up and after i hung up i immediatly heard choppers and airplanes we looked in the sky and seen a bunch of blinking lights (blue and red) in formations like a triangle type thing and it sounded like the chopper was coming straight to us maybe 2 minutes later it flashed again we were really freaking out about a minute later my step dad came we got in went home and when we got home we shared what we saw and it turns out that me and my friend seen the flash at the same time the crazy thing is, he said it was a blue flash an! d i seen an orange and yellow flash.

Disappears and reappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok I filed a previous report a week or 2 ago, maybe 3 about this same experience.  When I first saw this bright light a few weeks ago I was amazed which compelled me to file a report. I also showed my mom as soon as I got home.  This time I was dropping a couple of my buddies off when something just randomly compelled me to look up at the sky (which isn’t unusual I often look up at the sky trying to find something out of the ordinary).  The very first thing I looked at was what I thought to be a star…but then it disappeared out of sight as soon as I acknowledged it was there. I freaked out and my buddies thought I was going to run off the road but when I told them what I saw they thought I only saw an airplane or helicopter.  I pointed to where I saw it and there it was bright as day, far away though, they both watched it for about 30 seconds and it disappeared again.  The expressions and faces they made…priceless.  They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.  For me it was still exciting to say the least but it was the second time I’ve seen this so I was just relieved they had finally seen it too. Anyway this light stays in the same spot and doesn’t move.  It was actually not far at all from the spot I saw it last time, might have been the same place.  All I know is that it couldn’t have been a hovering helicopter, it was beyond the clouds. It couldn’t have been an airplane, it was stationary. It couldn’t have been a star, it disappeared and reappeared from sight. It couldn’t have been a satellite, or anything else I can logically think of except either a space craft of some sort or some type of energy in the sky….who knows? Someone or should I say some people know exactly what it is. Who knows maybe it could have been a space craft outside or inside our atmosphere and either was or was trying to communicate with someone or some people. Someone professional needs to investigate this and make it public because there is someone or some! thing out there, right here in quiet Concord, North Carolina.<n>

It was in alone and appeared to be a meteor.  As we continued on our way about 5 minutes later we noticed high in the sky a light which was extremely bright to the North of us and was pulsing in intensity and stationary. Venus was clearly visible to the W/NW of us.  There were several antenna towers visible to us which were MUCH lower in altitude.  This “Pulsing  light” was kind of like a heartbeat.  It never went dark but would get brighter and then dimmer in about 2 second intervals.  It seemed to remain stationary for as long as we could see it as we travelled West in was further and further behind us until we were out of view.  We saw several lower flying commercial planes with visible flashing lights of white and red at a lower altitude. We discussed what it was. I mentioned maybe the Space station but I have seen this before at it always seemed to move across the sky, did not flash and was much dimmer. Hope this helps and other have seen this or it was the space station<n>

I am a high school teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 of us were sitting in my friend&#39;s (a middle school teacher) back yard around a small gas, fire pit from 9:00PM pacific time until about 11:00PM.  I looked up at the sky (clear, star filled- the moon had just gone down) and noticed what looked like a dark, winged object floating by low in the horizon, but just above the backyard trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was large bird, like an owl (we have white owls that I&#39;ve seen at night many times) but quickly realized it was much too big (and too dark) to be an owl or even a large hawk. It took about a second to realize what the scale of it was and to notice dim but numerous lights all along the wings.  The wings appeared to be curling, or slightly flapping but seemed obvious that it was mechanical now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed and said &#34;Look at the UFO.&#34;  Everyone turned to look and were all amazed at what we saw. I got up to see it a few more seconds before it disapeared.  3 of the others saw it and the one who had his back to it and was a little more behind the tree didn&#39;t. I probably saw it for 7 or 8 seconds. The others for 3 or 4 seconds. It didn&#39;t seem to be traveling extremely fast (unless it was high), but the angle of view and the trees eventually obscured it.  But it actually seemed to just disapear to me. It was traveling close to due north, maybe slightly west as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to get a scale on it. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it was about the size of a B-2 bomber or up to a B-52 bomber with swept back wings.  I only saw wings, nothing sticking out the front or back. The wife of the other teacher (she works for a car dealership) said it looked like a dragon from Harry Potter with no head or tail. Most of us thought we saw the wings moving.  But the soft, diffused lighting on it (small spots of diffused lights, mostly on the edges of the wings) definitely showed it to be mechanical. It was completely silent.  That was an eerie part to all of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either large airplane size, and about one or two thousand feet up, or gigantic, and far away.  All four of us agreed that we had never seen anything like it.<n>

I noticed what at first looked like a plane moving VERY fast.It was a small white light like a star.  It had no red or green running lights,nor did it have strobes.It no sound.  I see all types of aircraft fly over the house;private, commercial, and military.  A passenger jet cruising at 35,000 feet will take about five minutes to cross the horizon.  military fighters at low altitude will cross in about 45 seconds.  (and make a lot of noise).   High altitude passenger jets and military cargo jets are both audible when they fly overhead.  What we saw crossed the sky in about 30 seconds and made absolutely no noise.It was moving much too slow to be a meteor or a sattelite.  The most extraordinary part was the extreme turns this object made.  What I saw was at a very high altitude and shifted VERY sharply to the left,then back to the right in a split second.  I am very familliar with all types of aircraft.  (I watch the Military Channel all the time) THIS WAS NOT A PLANE.  This happened at the top of Waukeena Lake Rd. in Danbury, NH<n>

One was brighter.  As soon as I could I pulled over to take a picture with my iPhone but by the time I could get out of the truck only one was still visible and it slowly drifted away and dimmed to nothing.  I didn&#39;t get any picture.  The sky was clear with stars visible.  It was dark.  No other aircraft around.  This wasn&#39;t a satellite.  It was moving too slow for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An object appeared that looked at first to be similar to a star or satellite and started to move slowly (as I recollect in a southwesterly direction) about as slow as a satellite or airplane normally would. It did not have any blinking lights as airplanes do and was only a white light about the brightness of a small star.  There was also not any audible sound either.  As it moved along, another light appeared not too far away from the first at the same approximate height (possibly the stratosphere) and adjacent to where the first had begun.  As it followed parallel to the first in the same direction, the first light disappeared and the second light followed to the location where the first had vanished and did so as well.

I know what a plane and a helicopter are... even at night. this was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were booming metallic sounds off and on prior to flashes, but not in sync with the flashes of light.  There were no clouds and a completely clear night.  These flashes enveloped the sky with light and were brighter than any lightning I have ever witnessed, and were completely silent.  (The booming noises were minutes before and in between the flashes but never in sync).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to call my fiance&#39; who was travelling in a rural area of southern Kentucky that morning and she saw the flashes at the same time that I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw them simultaneously three times, spanning about a 5-10 minute period.<n>

We noticed them right away because they were extremely bright and looked to be about 200 to 300 feet above us and off to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to tell how big it was, but my best guess is about 30 feet and it was shaped like a triangle.  It sat in the same spot for about 40 minutes and then disappeared quickly.<n>

It appears to be stationary.  Over the past hour it may have moved slightly West.  It is larger and brighter than seeing Venus or Jupiter with the naked eye.  It is not a planet or a star.  I have an astrology system to show me the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came online to do a search to see if I could find out what it is and I found another report on this site that was reported from Logan, UT on 4/2/2012.  The report is exactly what I see except I have not observed it with an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw it at 22:30 and when I started typing this at 23:37 is was still there.

I was looking up when I noticed a white/gray object, either crescent or chevron shaped, directly over my head.  At first it seemed like someone was flying a kite or something but then I realized that was definitely not the case.  It was coming from the south headed about 30 degrees north east.  This is in the south austin area, it was sort of making its way north up w gate blvd.  It made no sound whatsoever and was moving about the speed of a single prop plane or glider; slow enough for observation.  I can&#39;t tell how high up it was but it was much, much lower than any commercial airplane; about the same altitude that a police helicopter would fly if they were trying to spotlight a subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my late 20&#39;s, and work in IT. I have always been skeptical of people who report UFO sightings.  I am not even sure this was a UFO but it was the type of thing where the second I saw it, I immediately realized it wasn&#39;t natural and chills ran down my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were orange in color moving east to west in a straight line.their were approx. 8-10 in the line.  As the lights moved they dissapered from east to west.  They appeared to be sphears.  I could not tell distance from my viewpoint.<n>

I stepped to the left and looked up to see a string of 6-8 bright orange circles go across the sky. They dissappered for a split second only to appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, whom I was on the phone with said he could see the same set of lights from his house several blocks away from where I was standing.  This event happen in Ironwood MI at 9:33pm cst.<n>

At first i thought it was lights maybe from a car or a house but it was too high up in the sky also there are no towers are anything that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a solid light bar rectangular in shape it flashed on for about 5 seconds then went dark.  I asked my friend did you see that?  He said no so i pointed towards the sky where i saw the light then all of a sudden we both saw two sets of lights but they were a few hundred feet to the left of the first sighting and a few hundred feet higher.  These lights were like two huge four bulb vanity lights side by side with a dark space between them.  Eight lights total in this pattern.  These lit up for about 10 seconds and then they where gone.  There were no aircraft in the area that i know of and we did not hear any noises at the time of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a hoax.This event really happened!<n>
4/19/12 20:42|Scarborough|ME|Circle|9 minutes|5 bright orange lights moving through sky from due East to due North; disappeared in sequence|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88517.html|191|ndxe201204| 5 bright orange lights moving through sky from due East to due North; disappeared in sequence<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:42, I took my dog out to use the bathroom and noticed three orange lights coming from the East, heading North, in perfect sequence, in a parade.  I observed that they were silent, non-blinking, fast paced, spaced evenly between each light.  They were orange, approximately three times larger than a star, moving at approximately 300-400 miles per hour.  After seeing the third one coming through the trees, I ran in the house and alerted my family to see.  We ran onto the back deck, observing the two lights left since I had entered the house.  The lights disappeared in sequence at the same time.  We were looking at the sky for five more minutes and observed two more lights appearing in the same direction, same heading.  I had my daughter use her phone to take pictures of the lights as they moved through the sky.  The second light, following the first, disappeared, and we followed the other going due North out of sight behind the trees.  They were also silent and! looked like bright pumpkins going through the sky.  They also appeared to be the same distance apart.<n>
4/19/12 20:42|Scarborough|ME|Light|9 minutes|4 orange lights fly across tree line|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88520.html|192|ndxe201204| 4 orange lights fly across tree line<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finishing my chores around 8:42 this night, my dad rushed inside from taking the dog out the front door and yelled at us to turn off the lights and come out on the back porch because there was something &#34;weird in the sky.&#34;  I was the first one out besides my dad and I saw a pair of orange lights flying in a straight line emerging from the tree line.  By this time all of the lights in the house were off and I could see them very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 to 20 seconds I was watching the first light and I couldn’t notice the second anymore, so I turned my eyes back to look for it but it had vanished.  This is when someone cried out that the first had vanished as well which indeed it had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed outside for a couple more minutes thinking about it when my dad said suddenly that he sees them again through the trees.  We could see another light but couldn’t tell if it was a plane or another light until it too emerged following the same straight path through the trees as the first had.  This light was also part of a pair and the second quickly followed suit with a large gap in-between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My entire family aside from my oldest brother was out at this point and we were all staring at them.  Just as the first pair had, the second light suddenly halted and blanked out at the same point as last time.  The first light however, kept moving forward until it reached the next tree line where it too blanked out from my vision.<n>

I rushed outside with my two brothers, mother, and father and gaped at the sight of 3-4 bright orange lights moving in a formation from the East straight North. They were bright orange, almost the color of pumpkins, and moving in a straight line, with no sound. The lights did not blink at all and were obviously not any kind of aircraft, satellite, meteor, or naturally occurring in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky and the last light slowly faded out, almost like someone turning out a kerosene lamp.  We waited outside, discussing it, when two more lights appeared from the East and headed due North once more. One vanished faster than the other, which continued due North until it, too, disappeared.  These two seemed lower in the sky than the others, and the one that vanished last almost seemed li! ke it was constantly adjusting its height, dipping up and down.  None of the lights seemed naturally occurring in any way and we have not seen any since.  I managed to get pictures of the last two, although with my phone they only showed up as bright specks against the black sky.<n>

It seemed like it was floating across the sky and it was silent.  It went across the sky fairly fast. It didn&#39;t look like it was a plane since I saw planes moving with their usual blinking lights.  This object was triangular in shapt with three lights.  I could not see an outline of the craft.  Could it be the space station?  It looked like three stars moving in unison.  I did not take any pictures.  I live in Katy Texas about 25 miles west of Houston.<n>

I was traveling north on I-530 near Whitehall, Arkansas.  This was near the Pine Bluff Arsenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A grayish black 4x6 object was traveling in the median headed south at a high rate of speed exceeding 100 mph.  The object appeared metallic and had no visible lights.  It was flying just above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe others on the Interstate saw it also because they applied their brake lights.<n>

We all got out of the car and after a few minute we all locked on to the &#39;object&#39;.  Excuse my descriptive nature but the craft appeared to resemble a sperm cell.  It glided softly overhead (about 500 feet up) and then had huge bursts of speed in random directions.  Judging by its visual size compaired to its hight, i assume the main body was about the size of a boeing 747 and the tail was about the length of 3 or 4 school buses. The body appeared to be black.<n>

I noticed three lights above the mountains north of Las Vegas. At first I thought they were fighter jets in formation doing maneuvers but suddenly all the lights disappeared but came back on a few seconds later.  These lights didn’t seem to be moving upon further observation but just lighting up and dimming back down.  With my eyes peeled in this direction of the sky there was sudden streak from west to east lasting only a few seconds and “exceedingly” faster than any plane or shooting star I’ve ever witnessed.  I was on the phone with a friend and describing what I was seeing to him.  I see airplanes in the sky all the time in Vegas but these lights and streak didn’t seem to match anything I see on a normal basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the streak I didn’t anymore lights but still curious I drove west a bit into the desert to get a better vantage point.  That&#39;s when I looked up National UFO Reporting Center and called.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was calling there was too more stationary brilliant red lights (about 3 times the size of a normal star) that lit up in the same area, one immediately after the other.  Both stayed lit for approximately two to three seconds and then disappeared.  I hung around for another fifteen minutes but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college instructor, and teacher.  This is the first time I’ve ever reported a sighting. I feel what I saw was significantly unique enough to follow through with filing a report.<n>

No particular formation but they were different than the “weird lights” that have been spotted recently.  They were a dim orange color looking to be at varying altitudes.  They appeared to not be moving or moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I looked up and all they were the “typical” weird lights we’ve had on and off for a while now.  Usually they are stationary; they look very low, and very bright.  Sometimes they are flashing, sometimes not.  But they typically show up around nightfall and I’ve done my best for quite a while to ignore them and chalk it up to a planet or something.  There have been off times that one would shoot across the sky then stop suddenly and remain still.  I have never stayed out to watch them for longer than a few minutes here and there because I find the whole thing very uncomfortable.  I don&#39;t believe in &#34;aliens&#34; but I do find this occurance very strange and I just want to contribute if I can because the strange formation I saw while driving was very unsettling.<n>

As I looked up I saw 6 to 9 triangle lights kind of in formation right between the tree and the garage.  As I watched them they moved forward and the back a little and then forward and back again.  I raised my glasses because they can foul me up and when I did I saw just white dots.  But they were still there.  I put my glasses back on and there were three white dots for each one as the move up and back.  This went on for about 35-45 seconds and then the just disappeared.  The sky was blue or as blue as it gets in downtown Sacramento.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen pictures of ufo’s that look like what I saw.  Three large round white lights on the bottom in a triangle shape.  There were more than six and maybe as many as nine sets of three lights in a triangle formation but not fixed to each other.  Never seen anything like it, ever.  The way they just faded out was interesting too.<n>

The object moved from west to eat at a speed which I have never seen any object in the sky move.  It covered the entire span of the viewable sky over my backyard in a matter of 3 seconds before it seemed to dissapear into the night sky. It made absolutely no sound for the speed at which appeared to be moving(supersonic at the very least).  There were absolutely no lights on the object that could be seen.  The underside of the object seemed to be lit up from the ground due to light pollution caused by a nearby auto dealer mall, indicating the object was fairly close to the ground. perhaps only a few thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you&#39;ve ever seen an owl or other night bird flying over a lit-up area at night, thats what it reminded me of.<n>

The shape of it, or the formation was 2 lights in front, and one on either side and behind the two in front. It took the object, or 4, to enter my sight and leave (west to east) about 2, maybe 3 seconds.  I never saw a body, just 4 lights, and if it was 4 objects, they were traveling in a drop dead PERFECT formation.  Each light was the size of a normal sized star, no blinking or multi-color,... just the color of a normal star.  It, or they, made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI: If you sit outside here for approximately 1 hour on any given night, you&#39;ll see at least 1 &#34;shooting star&#34;, meteror, or whatever,...traveling at about 60,000MPH (if you blink your eyes,...you&#39;ll miss them).  Sure is a lot of stuff flying around out there.  What&#39;s amazing is that i can only see the maybe 1/10th of the sky i&#39;m focusing on at any given time,...when you see one,...it&#39;s like WOW!!!<n>

Directly across the water, I saw a pinkish-orange ball of light in the night sky.  It was stationary/hovering and its light was reflected in the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a planet, but it seemed too low in the sky for that.  I was a little nervous, as I had never quite seen anything like this in the night sky before.  Through my binoculars I noticed that its color was changing from orange to red and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I noticed that it had receded and its light trail in the water had faded, as if it was moving away from me in the exact opposite direction.  I observed this ball of light for about an hour on and off as I moved through the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it was gone, but it appeared to have faded into the distance rather than suddenly speeding away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a few phone calls to family members regarding the experience before I filed this report.<n>

I went out last night a little before 11 pm and saw one flashing light across the river, near the tree line.  It was hovering and moving slowly, staying basically in the same general area but would move slightly up or down. I went outside again around midnight and a second light was out there, across the river, just above the tree line. I watched it for a few minutes and suddenly it disappeared.  I was looking and wondering where it went, then suddenly it reappeared but was blinking, and it moved to my side of the river.  Then it disappeared again. I went inside and told my mom.  We looked out her bedroom window and it was there again.  We watched it for a few minutes and saw that it was moving slowly, like the other one. I went upstairs to my bedroom, where I could still see it out my window, and checked periodically.  At one point,! the ufo moved again. When it moves, the light blinks. It flew up to the sky and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore for a few minutes.  But then it came back again!  Another flashy light appeared above M-50 that I hadn&#39;t noticed before.  At one point I saw an airplane come up and fly right by the ufo above the river.<n>

He notices four red orange lights directly above the tree line. He calls for me to look and I saw three red orange lights in the sky. He tells me this is the second set of lights. They appear to fall or fade toward the ground. We believe at first they were flares.  As we discussed if this could be flares the lights reappear but only two this time and further west. They fade even quicker than the first sighting and these do not move just fade away. We waited another few minutes but did not see any more lights. We cannot explain what we saw and decided to search if anything was occurring in our area. We discovered similar descriptions on this sight in areas very close to our location. Strange and unexplained; first time we have seen anything like this or visited the website!<n>

Noticed very bright light through trees directly behind me. My first reaction was that it was a planet (though it did not have the characteristic &#34;twinkle&#34;) Observed object remaining static for around 2 minutes through trees, then repositioned myself in back yard to see object unobstructed. Object remained still for several more minutes, then began to track East, very slowly at constant altitude. Object again appeared to stop, then track the opposite direction (West). This occurred within the span of roughly 5 minutes. Intensity, shape, and color of object appeared to remain constant throughout. At this point, I got in my car to reposition myself once again, following it toward the Auburn Auction park from Leo area. At this point, I could see the object clearly, and it appeared to be moving away from me in a West heading (possibly just north of highway 3?). I continued to follow th! e object through LaOtto on highway 205, at this point, it appeared to be north and west of my position on the highway. I maintained intermittent view of the object when trees did not obstruct. I lost sight of the object about 5 miles before reaching Churubusco. Last sighting was at approximately 12:30am, somewhere on 205 between Laotto and Churubusco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is in graphic design, and have lived near airports all of my life (managed to foolishly rent 2 apartments directly under airport landing patterns).  The intensity of this yellow/white orb is unlike anything I have seen, and the maintaining of the low altitude was alarming.  I observed other aircraft in the sky at the time (aircraft tend to circle nearby for the local Int Airport), and this was strikingly different in both shape, size, color, and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very, very curious if anyone in the Auburn, Churubusco, Leo, Laotto, Garrett, or Kendalville area witnessed this object as well.  I travelled well over 20 miles and still maintained sight of it.  I can&#39;t stress enough how bright it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light alternated from blue, white and the a very brilliant red.  The pattern of the flashes was not like that of aircraft. It hovered over the mountains for about 15 minutes, then moved to the left and the right very slowly. Later it moved straight up and in like a very fast zigzag pattern.  We also noticed to the northwest a red light that was matching the larger, brighter objects movements.  What really caught our attention was when my wife noticed &#34;beams&#34; coming from the bottom with blue and red flashes emitting from behind the mountain.  The larger appeared to move due west at great speed and disappeared.  We never saw the red light again either.  During all this there was no noise. We also noticed commercial airliners pass in the vicinity of the brighter object with no response.  My son had brought out his rifle which had a scope on it and this is when we noticed it was flat, or disk shaped.  The brilliant red lights were in the center and the blue was on the outsides.  The disk was a very white, bright color.  The flashes appeared to be random with no pattern to them at all.<n>

I was at Club Chateau at Paris hotel on the terrace (outside) when I looked up and observed this red and green circular object almost directly above the strip.  I had no reference point in the crystal clear desert sky, just the Eiffel tower of the Paris hotel.  I estimate the object to be from any where from 2000 ft. to 4000ft. in the air.  Object hovered for a minute or so, then slowly move away, observation lasted 4-5 minutes.<n>

It was a clear evening, and I noticed a pulsating donut shaped red and green object to the north.  The only reference points were the large buildings on the other side of the strip, as I estimate this object could have been 2-3 miles away and above 2000+ feet up in the night sky.  The &#34;Christmas Donut&#34; as I called it was proceeding in a slow pace to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my small digital camera which also takes video with me.  I proceeded taking 8 photos and 2 videos of this object, my girlfriend also saw this object, as did numerous patrons and associates of the club.  What was kind of strange is that other people that I excitedly exclaimed about the object, could care less, also they closed the patio and made everyone go inside the building.  They could have closed the patio at 11pm, I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object intensely as I photographed and videoed the object, what was unique is how the object changed shape as it progressed across the sky and there was some type of strobe light on the second video I recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My photos are somewhat blurred due to no tripod, but as I stated this object was a donut, where you could see through the middle, and was quite large due to the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted the first video on U-Tube as April 17, 2012 Las Vegas UFO. The illuminated sphere of the Eifel Tower is the picture with my video.<n>

I looked up and noticed an airplane going by and then two really bright stars.  I thought to myself what really bright stars.  Then before I knew it, the two stars starting moving closer and closer to me at such a smooth, high speed velocity. T hen one moved further to the right, while the other kept going to the left and kept coming closer until it stopped.  I grabbed my camera phone and I watched the two aircrafts, they were shaped like diamonds and full of bright light. They just stopped in one place about  what seemed to be 150 kilometers from each other.  Then a black, what looked like a military helicopter came swopping around my building.  It flew around the two UFO&#39;s and then it flew far to the right about 300-400 feet from the UFO&#39;s.  I then noticed my friend&#39;s car pulling up.  As if I knew the UFO&#39;s were looking and listening and waiting for me, I told them not to go anywhere. I turned around to leave my bal! cony, but then I quickly turned back and the UFO&#39;s both started to leave at the same time.  The one to left flew by so smoothly and at a speed I&#39;ve never seen before.  The UFO to the right left in the opposite direction at the same speed.  The helicopter waited for another 10-15 mins and it flew around my building before finally leaving the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Only observed for 3-4 minutes but long enought to see that nothing in sky matched its brightness and that it was no known star.  Bright enough to have aura around light.  Observed long enough that it was not normal but did not stick around and see if it moved.  Object was not seen at all the next night after returning to same location after hearing numerous lights were seen that following night as reported by Coast to Coast.

An extremely bright light moved northwest from the sky directly above Cheyenne Mountain to about 25 miles up the range near where Manitou Springs would be from my vantage over the period of about a half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light itself was extremely bright, brighter than anything else in the sky. Aircraft were present in the sky to compare against, and they too were much dimmer. No blinking transponder lights present. The nature of the light seemed closer to starlight, with green rays present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the light for a while and it seemed to have three points in the center. The craft moved extremely slowly, the movement almost undetectable. I went to get recording equipment and watched it fade away before my eyes. I&#39;m not sure if it went behind a mountain or if it simply faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear. I had been looking for aircraft in that area. I saw what at first appeared to be a reddish star or Mars, but then realized the stars were not in the right place for that to be the case.  The reddish star faded out and I was somewhat shocked to see that happen since the star was stationary while I was looking at it. I don’t know what it was.  The light did not come back or reappear as a star might reappear if occluded.<n>

It was a clear night and no moon light, when an object flew into my vision.  It was very dark with three red lights on the bottom.  It was rectangle in shape and I could see very dim white lights at the top of the rectangle.  I could tell that I was not seeing the whole object.  There were no beacon lights and the object did not make a sound.  If I hadn’t been looking up, it would have flown of my head without me knowing.  The three red lights on the bottom of this object were circular with a red dot in the center. (Like a target).  It was traveling at 40 to 45 mph and was no higher than 150 to 200 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought were military planes as they were in formation (diamond), but there was absolutely no sound from them and they seemed to be round and about the size of a SUV.  They widened there formation and then went back into formation heading east.  They were about 500 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First couple of stars in the sky were barely visible.  Planes and boats were still plainly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden relatively large golden/orange ball appeared and glowed brightly for approx. 1-2 seconds then faded quickly.  A 2nd appeared and faded in the exact same fashion right beside the first.  A third and then 4 appeared/faded in the exact same fashion.  All appeared in an exactly straight line.  5 appeared, glowed and faded directly below the line of the other 4.  All appeared and faded sequentially.  When the first faded, the second appeared 1-2 seconds later. when 2nd faded the 3rd appeared and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entire incindent lasted approx. 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I explained planes and other objects were still plainly visible as it was dusk.  There were not other objects associated with these lights.  Although it was fairly clear with no cloud reference, they appeared to be a few miles away and quite large.  The lights were significantly larger and significantly brighter than the planes arriving and departing the airport a few miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow was similar to a firey color/fashion - what I imagine a fighter jet engine flare would look like if you were looking directly into its tail.  As if a jet went full throttle and then quickly throttled back.  Only much larger.  It almost appeared to burn and disappear like a flare only each light was perfectly stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was over I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it and there was only an asian couple - like any ignorant American, I naturally assumed wouldn&#39;t speak english and didn&#39;t talk to them :) I asked several couples that walked by if they&#39;d seen it but no one else seemed to have been looking.  I kept watching the sky for 15 min but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way feel very lucky to have witnessed something so spectacular.  From a cursory search of Google, I&#39;m one of several dozen folks who have seen such a thing a Myrtle Beach over the last 5 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the sun had just come up, it was reflecting off the white surface of the cylinder very brightly, which caught my attention.  I mean, if any of the hundreds of people in traffic DIDN&#39;T see it, it would be a miracle.  I would estimate it&#39;s speed at approximately 40mph, as I had it in view the entire time I was stopped.  I&#39;d estimate it&#39;s size as 50-70 feet in length.  Imagine a dry-erase board marker with caps on each end, that&#39;s what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a picture of it on my cellphone just before traffic started, but it&#39;s a bit distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m familiar with all types of aircraft, military and civilian, it was not that.  It was not a lighter than air vehicle that I&#39;ve ever seen.  Let me know and I can forward the photo I took.<n>

It is very dark with no street lights visible .  I noticed what I thought was an aeroplane coming towards our area (we are on the flight path for both Leeds Bradfrod and Manchester airport) so thought nothing of it .  It had a mixture of green and red lights but there was no immediate noise .  As I came our of the gargage after getting the milk the &#34;aircraft &#34; had got closer but when I looked it was flipping over so my immediate thought was that it was in trouble especially as there still wasnt any noise. as it flipped over a row of really bright white lights became visible and the whole think changed direction very quickly and at this point I realised this was no ordinary passenger plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it turned there was a very loud wooshing sound and beams of white light were now coming from it with a bit of a lazer like affect .  it moved away at quite a speed but seemed to be flipping over all the time . !<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole think happned very quickly and I am writing this straight away as I have not seen anything like this before . There may be some military planes in the area but that is not common here and there may be some other explanation but the noise was like nothing I have heard before ...and the lights were extremely bright<n>

It had a triangular shape, no lights, completely silent, and almost translucent.  I could see the shape, and track the movement but it was would seem to almost disappear for short moments.  I estimate it was no more than 3000 – 5000 feet  above us and about the size of a jet observed from that distance.  We both followed it until it went out of view behind a house.  It was  a combination of the complete silence and translucent appearance that we both observed that makes this something we have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was uncertain of direction (initially claiming they were north of him, but finally determining they were west), but I located them approx SSW of my location.  From his perspective, they appeared stationary, but from mine they crossed approx. 30 degrees of horizontal arc in less than 10 minutes (a better estimation of time will be determinable once we examine his cell phone records - we were in constant contact throughout the initial portion of the event).  To me, they appeared white, but I am a known deuteranope deficient with particular problems identifying colors of faint lights.  From my perspective, they were very low on the horizon (less than 10 degrees) and for the most part they were clearly visible just above the silhouette of a treeline.  We continued joint observation until I could no longer detect a flash for more than 30 seconds.  Towards ! the end of our communication, he claimed the initial 3 were joined by from 3 to 5 more lights, but I could not see them.  I then went inside to check Google maps to estimate trajectory, went back outside to confirm compass direction relative to visible landmarks, and witnessed one additional flashing object apparently following the same approx flight path, although this time the flashing had more of a pattern than previously observed (accounting for atmospheric disturbance - the &#34;twinkle&#34; effect).  This second viewing was not made in conjunction with my friend, so position wouldbe much more difficult to determine, and may in fact have been a chase aircraft or even totally unrelated.  There is an airport in the opposite direction from me (Pease), so I am very familiar with landing lights, marker lights, etc.  I have no reason to believe the initial shared sighting was any kind of normal aircraft, but the same can not be said for the later single light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other person is a bartender with an interest in paranormalia (approx 40 yo), and I am a 49 yo male college student/small business owner who actively investigates &#34;paranormal phenomena&#34; as they are made available to me.  I currently hold a BA in English/Journalism, am 2 semesters away from a BS in Psychology, and volunteer as a research assistant in a vision lab at University of New Hampshire (studying stereopsis).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was floating about two miles away and was relatively close to the earth in comparison to an airplane that was also flying near by.  At first, I was convinced that it was a kite or something, but as it came nearer it became obvious that it wasn&#39;t a kite or balloon or anything that could float for so long on its own.   We stood watching it in the parking lot of a Home Depot for about 5 minutes as it came directly above us.  It was clearly a very, very flat surface and was actually moving quite slowly, as if being carried by the wind.  Yet, the air was still and there was no strong wind whatsoever to propel it.  It tettered back and forth from side to side, but for the most part, we could only see the bottom of the aircraft. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was still very light outside, yet no one else seemed to see it.<n>

After observing several vehicles pulled over and people out of their cars staring up to the sky we decided to see what they were all looking at.  We asked a nearby driver what they were looking at and he pointed up to a dark speck up in the sky.  Traveling westbound on 152 the object was on the south of highway.  It just hovered in the same spot and did not appear to move.  I pulled out my camera which has a 30 X zoom and snapped several pictures of it, which I have emailed in already. We stood there about 10 minutes total and then drove on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the distance we all witnessed an object fade in and out of the sky.  As it traveled in a southern direction at a slow pase it would fade in and out of sight not because of the clouds but possibly due to the reflection of the sun hitting the outer part of the object.  Reports where made to local law inforcement offices but no one knew what the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was to high to be a blimp and moving to slow to be a plane.  I also submitted a picture to the Merced Sun Star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled over a few minutes later, at 7:48 am and got out of the car.  It looked like a giant white triangle hovering high up in the sky not moving at all.  It definitely wasn&#39;t a weather balloon as it didn&#39;t budge with the wind at all.  There was also a shiny object that moved vertical from the area of the object towards the opposite direction.  I watched for a few minutes and couldn&#39;t get a clear picture with my phone so got back into my car.  When I looked back about 5 miles later, I couldn&#39;t see it any longer from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I traveled from 101 Southbound and got onto 152 Eastbound.  I was on 152 E. for approximately 20 minutes (15 miles) before I observed numerous vehicles pulling to the side of the highway and exiting their vehicles.  I saw this going on for several minutes and just figured there was a military plane or helicopter and continued driving.  After another minute I saw some Semi-Trucks pulling over and determined that it must be something of importance, as they have a very heavy load and it’s difficult to stop the Semi-Trucks on the side of the freeway.  This was at 7:34 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I exited my vehicle there were multiple people on the other side of the freeway looking in a particular spot.  I immediately grabbed my video camera that is equipped with a 40x Optical zoom and located the object.  I was in complete disbelief because I personally have never believed in UFO’s and though it was a bunch of fairy tail stories.  Once I continued to zoom in and out on the object, I realized it was staying stationary and at a VERY high elevation.  I’m not good at explaining the looks of an object, therefore; I’ll let the video speak my words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes I re-entered my vehicle and continued on 152 Eastbound.  After a several minutes of driving and approximately 5 miles, I decided to get a different view/angle on the object if it was still in the sky.   I pulled over next to a large lake off the freeway and went up a side dirt road.  I positioned my vehicle and located the object again.  This time I was further East and mostly got a large glare of the sun off the object.  It almost appeared the object was glowing, but I think it was likely the sun.  As I was video taping the object, a State Ranger drove bye my vehicle at a high rate of speed and though he saw me in a restricted area, he didn’t bother questioning me and appeared he was heading to a certain area of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to indicate that the object appears to be moving in the video, but I did not have my camera on a tripod and due to the high power zoom, the camera was moving slightly in my hand and the object WAS NOT moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88440.html|260|ndxe201204| Object sighted above Pacheco Pass Highway 152 morning of 4/16/12<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving West on Highway 152 Pacheco Pass in Merced County on my way to work at approximately 7:00-7:15 AM. I was traveling approximately 80 mph in moderate traffic when I begun to crest the top of the Pass.  I quickly noticed an object in the sky. My immediate thought was it was a Highway Patrol Aircraft patrolling, so I immediately slowed to 70 mph. I then noticed this object clearly did not have wings.  I then thought it must be a helicopter of some type because it didn’t appear to be moving.  The shape stood out to me as almost a pentagon shaped vessel and didn’t seem to have any distinct rotor or tail section.  I would estimate its size to be slightly larger than a big SUV but it’s hard to estimate given the distance of I would guess 150-200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be white or a light grey.  I did not see any lights or additional markings on the object.  It struck me as strange because this object did not appear to be aero dynamic at all and it remained still.  I was able to see it for a period of about 45 seconds continuously.  At which point my position relative to the object was such that my roof prevented me from seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t sure what it was, but didn’t pay much more attention to it.  Then I noticed what was a moderate amount of traffic was now almost nonexistent.  There were close to 60 vehicles pulled to the side of the road.  I thought there may be an emergency so I began to slow even more and increase my awareness.  Everyone seemed to be pulling over or already stopped and photographing or looking toward the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was late so I continued to work.  I looked back several times to catch another glimpse of the object. I caught a short 3-4 second glimpse of the object which was now behind me.  I am not sure if it was moving or not.  The really strange thing is from this perspective (assuming it was the same object) has an elongated shape much narrower and taller than the original.  I’m not saying it changed shape and I cannot be certain that it was the same object, only that the position in the sky seemed correct and it was also suspended in a similar manor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hoping to hear from one of the motorists pulled over who captured a photo or video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many witnesses in Los Banos area.  Approximately 15 witnesses contacted a newspaper in Los Banos, CA, about the sighting.  We do not know yet what the object was.  PD))<n>

After I saw the eye color I went back in the house waiting for it to try to get in or peek in my windows so I laid on my couch looking and waiting and listening for and nothing happened  so I just tried to go to sleep and just get over it buy this time I was in denial and thought ok it was a deer. The next morning I thought about what I saw and walked out to the field where I saw it there was nothing but I remembered what it looked like and it was up right a light shade of blue witch could have been from the moon light it was really skinny and tall  with a tear drop shaped head that kind of  just formed in to the body no shoulders and long arms that looked like tentacles. But that’s all I remember and know I can say it was flat out the most scariest moment I have ever been through I have seen ghosts and ufo’s but nothing like that and it still scares me just thinking about it and its been almost a month another thing! just a week or two before my event there was reports of stra! nge ligh ts over one of my city’s neighbor hoods that was on the news the next day or day after but I didn’t think twice about this because I was in denial about what I saw until  like two weeks after it all happened than I started realizing that it could be possible that I actually saw an alien putting the two events together<n>

In that time I noticed it was moving and had changed directions.  I had a similar sighing last year before the fireworks in Newark also, and was interested enough this time to stop my car and shut off the engine.  I couldn&#39;t detect any sound or see any other lights just the red glow.  It was moving in my direction, and I lost sight of it when the street light I was under obstructed its view.  I waited for it to reappear out of the glare of the light, but it never did.  I assumed it had entered cloud cover,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got into my car pulled forward about 50 yards, to where I had a clear view of the sky, there was no cloud cover at all. In my estimation, it was either very large, or very close to the ground.<n>

You could see almost 1 light on top 2 on bottom but the craft looked round in shape. They emitted no sound. They moved slowly however the lights started to fade and all 3 disappeared. About 10 minutes later 2 more of the same thing that we just saw came from the same direction and path the first three were moving. A plane was in front almost like they were being guided by it. The 2 disappeared in around the same spot the first 3 did. They disappeared in the same fashion as the first three. My father was the one who alerted me to what he saw. I came outside and saw the same thing as he did. Then my sister came out and we watched as they disappeared. Then minutes later we all saw the second pair come and disappeared as the first ones did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew very quickly for about 20 seconds across the top of the campus (high in the sky).  It was a very brightly colored Blue in the front, with a bright turquoise tail.  It flew behind a group of trees, and that was the last I have seen of it.<n>

It was too high and moved too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  It started from one side of the sky and moved to the other side within 3 minutes I am guessing.  I even had my mother come outside to look at it also and she agrees that it couldn&#39;t possibly be and airplane or helicopter either.<n>

Clear skies.  The moon wasn&#39;t out yet. We looked up to see 2 air crafts that were flying pretty close to each other.  Then in a split of a second, one of them disappeared.  Could see no lights.  When that one disappeared ( maybe it shut it&#39;s lights off?)  3 more appeared. It&#39;s like they appeared out of thin air. The 3 new ones were traveling not far from one of the first 2 that I saw.  They didn&#39;t appear to be going fast and had no sound and no trail like jets do.  The last 3 were traveling in what looked like a triangle shape. The thing is, I have never seen the color of lights on any other aircraft.  Dark orange and red. The orange was much brighter than the red.  They were traveling a little higher than what a helicopter flies. and not as high as what a small plane flies.  Now, I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s but for a split second..I thought about it. haha! not really but maybe they were military.  It was so weird because as quickly as they appeared out of nowhere, they disappeared in the same manner. Now you see it now you don&#39;t kind of thing. What kind of air crafts fly 5 at a time. They seemed close, like what you see when there are air shows and they fly in formation. It was really strange.  We don&#39;t have any military base around here at all.<n>

It kind of looked like something far away.  Now Its very hard to explain this but it like, picked up speed rapidly, moving left, like id saying going like a mile or 2 per hour to 50 miles per hour and more.  It left our view.

When this craft came into the picture from the bottom of screen(from the west), I could tell that it did a &#34;death roll&#34; and twisted from left to right, then shot slightly further right then the &#34;cigar-shaped&#34; object.  Moving forward at the slowed speed of 1/8th normal speed, There appeared to the left of my screen( from the west); 2 objects which seemed to be higher in elevation, and possible &#34;saucer-shaped.&#34;!

It was flying really low so we stopped to see if we could hear anything but there was no sound coming from it. It hovered for a little while and started headed away from us towards Austin.

He is a total night-owl, and I was trying to him to calm down so he would go to sleep.  The sky was very (VERY) clear, with virtually zero visible fog or moisture in the air, and the moon wasn&#39;t directly visible, and there was not a whole lot of &#34;light pollution&#34; from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked around for a few minutes, when a flying object of some sort appeared from behind an oak tree.  It produced a relatively bright orange light, brighter than any star, but not by a whole lot. It was bright enough that it produced a clear halo.  The light was pulsing from orange to red at a steady rate, approx. 60-80 pulses per minute. (I am a musician so I am pretty good at determinating pulse/rate.)  It appeared to be at a fairly low altitude, I would say less than 2000 ft. possibly less than 1000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued pulsing as it travelled, maintaining a straight line. I watched the object closely as it approached our location, for 10-15 seconds, and when it was just about directly over our heads, it began to &#34;disappear&#34; into the darkness.  Again, I was watching it VERY closely, and it looked like it was passing behind clouds or fog, but there was clearly no fog or clouds in the sky.  It disappeared compeletely for about 2 seconds, but then I was able to make it out faintly for about 2-3 seconds. I swear it looked just like when you see a plane pass behind a remnant of a cloud or thick fog.  Then it desappeared completely and never re-appeared. I scanned the whole area for 3-4 more minutes, hoping it would re-emerge, but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my son and said &#34;Whoa dude, you just saw your first UFO!&#34;   The object did not necessarily look like a solid object that was producing light.  I couldn&#39;t make out a solid mass, just a bright pulsing light. I wonder if it could have been an earth produced, gaseous ball of fire, but it was such a slow and steady pulse, which seemed to be deliberate, or mechanized.  The object also did not necessarily appear to be under &#34;intelligent control.&#34;  It very well could have been a manmade aircraft, maybe some new technology perhaps?   NOTE: I live about 15 miles from a Lockheed-Martin Facility which is very remotely located at the end a winding two lane road road, in the densely wooded Redwood forest, which is also very close to the coastline.  I am pretty certain that they are doing research/development and testing of experimental aircraft and/or propulsion systems at this particular site.<n>

The three circles were also moving approximately 3 times faster than the speed of an aircraft and were only observed for 4-5 seconds before disappearing into the dark sky.  The middle circle moved independently of the others so I speculate that the three circles were three different objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then two dissolved. 30 secs later the bigger one disappeared.  Positive - it was an odd looking circular light and hovering.<n>
4/12/12 20:00|Lakewood|NJ|Fireball|2 seconds|Green-white round light with streak behind in south east sky over airport|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88385.html|307|ndxe201204| Green-white round light with streak behind in south east sky over airport<n> <n><n> <n><n> At Lakewood airport between 20:00 and 20:30 a bright streak of green white light streaked across the south east sky at high speed for about 2 seconds. The leading edge was round and the rest tapered back to a point with a length of about 4 diameters of the circular portion. The light disappeared into a cloud and was not seen again.  Typical aircraft in the vicinity of the area are slow moving 1-2 proppeller planes, helicopters or large military aircraft.  This did not match the profile of any of those. I would estimate the speed of the object at 3-7 times the speed of a small private plane. There was no sound associated with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up and right above our heads about maybe a mile up a bright glowing starlike white orb was moving slowly from west (canada) to east direction.... by the time i pulled out my camera phone it was now more so infront of us rather then above like it was when we first spoted it.. I first took a picture then i switched over to video and started filiming.. while filming i kept losing sight of it and then we couldnt see it anymore..  However when i went into the house i watched the video on my computer... while watching i see the orb of white light go out..  then two seconds later it appears to the left of the screen.. i watched it over and over and started to mess with the video settings.. anyway i figured out that when i turn the brightness up a little bit and the contrast you can actual see the orb switch direction and shot from south to north then sto! p on a dime.. It then moves a little back east and vanishes... I have the adjusted video and picture...<n>

One of them completely disappeared!  My daughter was also there but she is only 5. I called Bay news 9 to ask them about it and the woman said she would investigate.

Looking out the window while sitting in the bed about 11PM, I saw a little cloud about 1/2 - 1 mile away.  It appeared to be shaped like the state of Virginia.... With the Spring winds blowing from the Northeast, oddly it was completly still about 100 - 200 ft higher than I am on the 30th floor. It was located just South of Punchbowl crater, out over the city.  After I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving in the winds, I began to study its shape from the reflected light of the city streets below......then a light appeared in the cloud, like you see when an airplane is letting down thru clouds at night with the landing light on.  First the light was fuzzy inside the cloud then, the light became a bright peachy-orange color... like it broke out of the cloud... I was trying to adjust my eyes to make sure it really wasn&#39;t a plane…  The light became! clear and brighter, in a full circle/ball shape, about center of the cloud. It was a stable light, not flickering like a burning flare appears.  Then the round light went back into the cloud with about half the round shape visible/hanging out of bottom of the cloud, bright on the bottom and diffused in the cloud.  Suddenly the light just went out.  From the lights of the city, the little cloud was still visible with a black, perfectly round hole in it.  The little cloud didn&#39;t just drift off, it quickly faded away without moving.... odd, considering the strong, gusty wind that night. I wish I had taken a picture/video, but I was fixed on the activity!!!<n>

The entire viewing could not have lasted more than 2-3 seconds - but I have no doubt of what I saw.  At first, I could not even name it as a “chevron” without research.  Initially I described it to my husband as a V-shaped object, but wider at the top edges and narrower towards the ‘tail’.  I was thrilled to have seen it, but at the same time bewildered by its appearance.  There was no way I could judge size, however, in contrast to the dipper, lack of sound, brilliance and clarity…I would say large, but very distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a totally clear evening with no clouds or moon in sight.  We were looking towards the southeastern sky observing a distance jet aircraft that was moving eastbound.  Suddenly I observed coming from east to west a blur or smudge of lights.   For a brief instant I thought a group of meteors were striking the atmosphere simultaneously, at least until my eyes become focused better on the blur of greyish-white lights.  When my eyes were focused completely, I saw an equilateral triangle directly over me moving rapidly to the northwest, but more westerly.   The triangle had 3 dimly-lit lights near the points of the triangle. I did not notice the color of the craft; however, my daughter thought it was black.  She also asserted that the points on the triangle were rounded as opposed to sharp.  The experience was only 3-5 seconds in length before the craft was out of sight, so each of our brains could only process a limited amount of information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made no noise that we could hear.  Because I do not know the size of the craft, it is difficult for me to assess the height and velocity.

In front of the Percy priest dam. I happened to look up and saw a Very low bright circle light. My first thought was an airplane because we are right next to the air port. But that wasn&#39;t the case. It was just above the tree line. My next thought was a shooting star but it was Way too low and had no tail. Basically it was moving in a horizontal  line, moving at incredible speed.  I watched it from about half my windshield to my driver side window. Until it completely disappeared.  It didn&#39;t fade away, or get smaller. It was almost like it vanished or went into some kind of hyper speed. When it disappeared the light got slightly wider.It was so low and apparent, I had time to realize this was not any kind of helicopter or air plane even a military jet. Second thought was a torpedo and I&#39;m about to see a large blast.  This was non explainable.    Almost no words can explain what we saw.  I almos! t crashed the car because of what I watched transpire in front of me.  It was round, with a white glow. The hairs on my head stood up, and im still in shock.  It was so fluid of a motion that it looked like it was held up by a sting.<n>

I thought at first it was a boat with a flashing beacon but as I was explaining to the other two that on tv I noticed that sky watchers like to flash a bright flashlight at them to see if they resond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flashed a bright Mag flashlight beam at the light expecting nothing but when I flashed it off to the right of it , The light suddenly flew straight to where I flashed the light.  This went on for over five minutes . Where ever I flashed my beam it flew straight to it.  After a while I made a cure with my light beam like a half circle with it ending in the ocean and when it followed the movment it disapered into the ocean. We were on the beach at the time and the only noise we could hear was the ocean waves..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been to sky watchs before but I never had this kind of reaction.  The light was a very bright red , flashing a red light from its middle.  I held out my hand to guess its size and when I made a fist I could barly see the red light around my fist , IT WAS BIG. I wish I brought my phone to get pictures but because we were close to the water I left it in the house ( that was right behind us ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back out the next two nights watching to see if it returned but it did not.  When I first seen this light I thought it was on the ocean&#39;s surface but was able to tell it wasnt because I could see the ocean&#39;s surface below its glow.  It also moved at great speed to each spot my lights beam flashed at, much faster then anything I know of and the way it stopped , like on a dime.  Were talking a long distance between where each light beam was flashed at.  If I had to guess I would say most of the distances was atleast twelve inchs apart using my right hand being held out as a guide.  This was an experience all three of us will have as a memory forever.  I am hoping to go back out to this same beach house this summer and if I do I will be ready and be watching again.<n>

After that it slowed down and disappeared as if had exploded in tiny little particles or something.  Very VERY different from a meteor reaching atmosphere. I have never seen anything like it, apparently neither have the other drivers. 3 cars almost crashed and all I heard were people yelling inside their vehicle in amazement.  I called a friend to inform what I have seen.  He lives by the airport and in 5 minutes he said there were F15 airships taking up flight from the East side airport (at 8pm... weird).<n>

I thought it was a star or Jupiter.  Then it turned and started radiating blue and white light that looked like sunrays.  The light then sucked itself back in to the middle of the object..about 15 seconds later the lights reappeared. It looked like a prism..I called my neighbor and she came out and looked at it,telling me it was a galaxy. I watched it for nearly 35 minutes before going in.<n>

The object appeared to be moving very rapidly and without any apparent noise traveling  fully south.to the north over a period of not more than about 2-3 seconds. The altitude of the object is difficult to say.  The visual perspective is that of what a passenger jet would be near the time of landing but it moved in a fairly straight line and not falling.  Its size compares to the approximate size of pea held at about arms length (3ft); much larger than the diameter of a star yet much smaller than the apparent diameter of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape and Color:  Its shape was somewhat triangular. The triangular portion had a shiny, white metallic luster leading in the northerly direction. The end of the object had a glowing irridescent appearance.  It looked similar to a nearly molten triangular piece of metal.<n>

I saw the same &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; looking lights in the exact same spot in the sky over my neighborhood. I saw three of them, they were just giant bright white lights. I got binoculars and came back with my boyfriends mother. I looked at them through the binocular and they were either much farther away or much smaller then what i saw on 04/09 and there was hardly as much detail. There was three &#39;crafts&#39; all i could make out was a row of distinguishable &#39; windows&#39; looking lights on each one. that was all the detail i could see however there was no emergency lights or anything to convince me this might be something man made. They all hovered for about 20 minutes. There were no aircraft pursuing them and planes were taking off from BWI all around them. One by one they hovered and then descended straight down and they were gone ( they landed maybe?). I am not con! vince what i saw on 4/09 and 4/11 were the same the only similarity were the &#39;windows&#39; on the &#39;crafts&#39; there appeared to be maybe three or four in a row?? the other similarity is the way the light looked before i looked into the binoculars and the fact there was so many. they also had a weird aura of hazy white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 8:00 or 9:00 because I remember it being about 30 minutes after the sun had set. I was walking to the porch when I happened to look up at the sky.  Normally we get a lot of airplane traffic above our house as the airport is about 15 miles away at most so I always look in the sky to see if there is anything out of the ordinary. I was looking up at the sky and walking onto the porch when I noticed an orange star. I went over the the north side of the porch which faces toward downtown and went to go look at the star again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly noticed this orange/red orange star was moving. It was very high in the sky, and very very light. It was moving straight and made no sound. All of a sudden it ballooned into three orange objects like when a firework explodes and rains down. The objects then made a 360 and at that point I thought they would hit each other and that they could be military aircraft. But they didn&#39;t and they seemed to be racing. But the further away they moved the harder it was to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Lots of air planes with their normal blinking lights racing across the sky in a large left banking circle headed at the light.  It got too far behind the trees to be seen any longer, I have seen many B52s and this wasn&#39;t one of them, I headed inside to find my wife in the backyard and then I spotted a closer very large bright orange light to the north west, I thought that it was a plane flying in my direction, but I have never seen a plane with a orange light like this.  It reminded me of the same color and brightness of a street light but miles up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 15 minutes,  It moved so slowly moving in a up and right direction I lost it behind a tree,  There was two planes or small jets flying from the east towards it.  I went back inside for awhile and checked the front and back and no sign of! them or the air traffic, very cloudy and a light chill in the air, both of which were not the case at the time of the event.<n>

This was to the Northwest corner of my house and appeared to be over a small farm pond that is on my property about a quarter of a mile down the hill from my home.  The object just sat there, didn&#39;t move at all that I could tell and I was scared to death of this, I have looked into the night skies lots of times and my son has pointed out various things in the sky for me with his telescope and with the naked eye, but I have never seen anything like this before.  I didn&#39;t move and it didn&#39;t either, for about 15 minutes, then all at once it shot straight up and was gone from my view in a minute.  I sat there a few more minutes and then opened the garage door and drove in and quickly shut it behind me.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a nurse at our local hospital so consider myself sane most of the time, and always look for logic in any situation, but this has none...logic tells me that it was not a plane or a helicopter or a planet.  I then got on the internet and found this website and then ACTUALLY called the number and spoke with a gentleman who told me to file a report which I am doing, alert the media, which I just spoke with the local PD to see if anyone else had a similar experience, all the PD wanted to know was what I was doing out that time of morning to see lights in the sky...so media stops there..really wish someone could give me a logical answer as to what it was that was in the sky last night, and hopefully tonight when I go home I will be alone, don&#39;t care to see that again!<n>

As I continued to drive home the craft seemed to be moving in my direction at the same low altitude that I first noticed it and at pace with my car, which was only going 40 MPH. I was driving along the river so the craft was also following the contour of the waterway.  I lost sight of the craft for a moment when I switched direction but soon saw it again when I entered my neighborhood.  It was now to the south of me and seemed to be hovering again, this time over my neighborhood.  I made it to my house and got out of the car and looked at it.  It flew directly overhead of me, probably no more than 1000 ft off the ground. It made very little noise, a slight shhhh sound could be heard right after it passed over me but not as loud as any aircraft I know of.  It seemed to have two white lights close together on the nose or front w two red bl! inking lights toward the center of the craft but on the outside, as on wings.  It also had a blue light somewhere on the body.  I can&#39;t be sure where. When it passed I noticed two very faint bluish grey lights on the rear, almost reminding me of thrusters.  I was wondering if anything like this had been reported recently by anyone in the surrounding area. I feel like I couldn&#39;t have been the only one to see it. It didn&#39;t look big enough to be a plane.  If I had to guess I might say it was the size of a minivan or mid-size SUV.<n>

It&#39;s almost hard to describe because it was this blue-greenish color that I&#39;ve never seen before and it was almost like the ball was pulsating to different colors. The speed of it was just incredible. It was only in my field of vision of the sky for about 10 seconds before it had completely crossed the sky, but it looked as though it was arcing across the sky, but then in the middle of the sky it looked like it almost - I honestly can&#39;t even think of a word to describe how it moved but the closest I can come up with is it instantaneously moved moved about an inch higher. I had pulled off to the side of the road because I was in wonder about what I had just seen because in all the years I&#39;ve been looking at the night sky, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. I&#39;ve seen comets and meteors falling, as well as I&#39;m an amat! eur astronomer so I know what a tail to a comet or meteor would look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We have seen lights, which at first I thought were satellites, traveling along and then they just disappeared. We continued to watch that area and then a few minutes’ later two lights came out of that same area traveling in totally different directions. For the two nights I have seen this happen I have about a total of 10 of these lights that are on a straight line just disappear and then minutes later appear but traveling in whole new direction. The one time the light I seen and was watching disappeared and about 10 minutes late a bright flash came from the area were the light disappeared, and a new light came from the flash and headed in the exact opposite direction. I have no clue what this is but it would be nice to find out.  I am going to try to film this if it ever happens again.<n>

The area it came from was empty forest about 2 miles west of my house. The object looked like a firework at first, it was rising slowly and was at about 1000 ft above my friend and I when it passed over and started to move swiftly over us towards the east.  As it passed over we noticed it was much bigger than we first thought.  The object was a red diamond with a blurry aura and a yellow light in the center, it was covering vast ground at a fast pace without making any noise, it was amazing how silent the object was.  As the object passed east it was ascending to incredible heights at a fast pace, until the object went straight up .  Before it disappeared i saw it twinkle like that of star.<n>

It is a cloudy night, and there was a patch of sky without clouds.  I was looking at the stars I could see through that patch. From the northeastern part of that patch, I noticed what looked like a bright wisp of clouds moving at a steady rate southwest.  It was behind the clouds, however, and moving much quicker than any cloud, and it was not windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized it was in the shape of a perfect V, so I looked closer, and noticed it was nothing like I had ever seen.  I could tell that it was somewhere just above the cloud cover, and it looked as if it were a typical V-shaped UFO with its lights off.  As it moved away, I noticed the V-shape, from my perspective, now looked like a straight line.  That is when it disappeared behind thick clouds once more.  I hoped to see another opening in the clouds farther on, so as to see it again, but the clouds got thicker towards the mountains, the direction it was going.<n>

It was red with a yellow light in the middle of it, at first it looked like a ball of fire. It was blurry, but definitely a diamond shape.  It slowly ascended above the trees, then began to come our way.  This craft didn&#39;t make any noise what so ever.  When it was directly over us, it was only about 1000 ft in the air. Although it was close to us it was still blurry as if it had an aura around it.  After it passed over us going toward the east, it quickly ascended further into the sky.  As we watched it disappear, it twinkled like a star then it was gone.<n>

I turned on my camera to video mode, but as I had to zoom in all the way to make it appear on my end, I soon realized as it continued to move away that there was nothing special about the video I was taking – meaning there was no backdrop that would prove its movement, etc.  Through the lens it just looked like a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frustrated, I turned off my camera and watched as the “star” moved further away.  Then, just as quick as it had appeared, it was gone.  It was like some switch had been flicked – the “star” just blinked out.  It literally just turned off its bright light.  Now I wished I had filmed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There wasn&#39;t any noise at all coming from the object and no wing strobe lights (typical) with airplanes.  It was spherical and approximately 2 to 2 1/2 miles overhead.  The crafts speed was constant for the duration of the sighting and traveling Northeast towards Scottsdale / Carefree Arizona.  Holding a regular aspirin at arms length would match the size of the object.  A passenger airline was about 20 seconds behind the object,and of course the engine noise and strobe lights of the plane could easily be seen and heard.  The light of the object was the same brightness coming toward my direction, as well as leaving and moving away and past where i was standing.<n>

The sky was clear, not a cloud in the sky. The temperature was about 65 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up and I saw a silvery object flying slowly, west.  It looked to be about the same altitude of a jetliner, about 30,000 ft.  I could not tell if it was spinning or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no plume like a jetliner.  I ran into my house to grab my digital camera and when I came out, the object was gone. An airplane cannot disappear that fast.

The light was no longer visible by his home (Temecula CA) Hoping I&#39;d catch a glimpse of something I chatted on the phone with him for roughly 10-15 minutes. While chatting I immediately noticed a very pale white/orange circle skimming across the mountains that run west along Murrieta/Temecula/Wildomar . It was brief but the UFO was flying upwards of 400mph. I&#39;m not a pilot but I&#39;ve flown in Cessna&#39;s quite a few times. I&#39;ve been around aircraft and this was NOT a regular aircraft. It was much to large and VERY fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wished I had more information but thought it important to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My TV is right next to the door so both are within your view when you’re watching and I could clearly see the moon just above some trees out back through the curtains. The moon was low so part of it was blocked by the tops of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I saw a bright blue-green ball of light above the moon traveling in an arc. I got up and moved the curtains to get an even clearer look and watched it.  After about 20 seconds, it disappeared. It didn’t go below the trees because it was still above the moon and the moon was at the tree tops. It just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe how it looked was that it looked like the end of a firework when all the balls of light are flying toward the ground and eventually going out. The only differences were that there was only one instead of multiple like a firework and there was no audible explosion beforehand. Keep in mind, it was 2:15 in the morning so an explosion from a firework or even from a flare would have been clearly audible. Also, it was much bigger than a firework remnant or flare and wasn’t flying directly at the ground like either would. It was still flying in an arc, but more parallel to the ground then anything.<n>

(Foxnews.com)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This following was an article published 4/12/2012 on foxnews.com.....  A state trooper and a motorist reported a large object falling out of the sky in Litchfield, Conn. -- a green, glowing, whale-sized object that plunged into Litchfield Lake. State authorities said no go; they failed to locate anything mysterious. The Republican-American of Waterbury reports that a person driving in Litchfield at about 2 a.m. Tuesday reported that an object the size of a whale fell from the sky and crashed into Bantam Lake. Officials say that at about the same time, a state trooper 10 miles away in Warren called dispatchers to report that something fell out of the sky and landed near Bantam or Morris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Morris fighters made several passes up and down the lake in a boat looking for a possible plane crash, but didn&#39;t find any debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Authorities called off the search, leaving the mystery unsolved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But science may have the answer: According to the National Weather Service, there was a meteor shower that morning, WTNH.com reported. Perhaps the whale-sized object was simply a meteor?

The object was round and red in color and appeared to be at a fast rate of speed over the Gulf of Mexico heading north to south before disappearing behind cloud cover (cloud cover was observed, it did not vanish).  The object flew relatively straight and then veered upward slightly before entering the clouds and could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object appeared on what seemed to be the same course and looked the exact same as the first.  This object appeared approximately 3 minutes after the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third and fourth objects, which were the same as the first two, appeared prior to the second object fading into the cloud cover. These two were flying much lower, heading in a south eastern direction until nearing the coast line and then began heading north to south again.  The last two were observed for around 4 minutes or so as they made their climb into the clouds.  These two followed one after the other but not in an exact line, the last of the four followed approximately 1 mile behind the other and a tad bit lower.  It also started its climb further south then the one in front of it. Both of these crafts flew upward at an angle and entered the cloud cover much higher than the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not one of the four crafts made any noise that was heard by onlookers and there was no flashing lights, just solid red with an orange hue at the top of the first. Also, the first and fourth were moving faster than the second and third.  One onlooker described the object as round and red and another in the shape of a flame as it approached and, a red ball from the back side after passing.  There were a number of camera phone photos and video that onlookers tried to attain but the only picture that resembled anything was a small red line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 9 observers total. Four saw the first object in its full form.  8 observed the second. All 9 observed the third and fourth.  8 are restaurant associates and one works for a paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The orbs would slide from left to right, blink, and then appear again in a slightly different spot, never making any sort of sound.  This lasted for 10-15 seconds each time we saw them.  Over the course of the two hours we were stargazing, we saw this happen four times. We frequent Frisco Campground throughout the summer months and have never seen this happen before and have no explanation for what these lights could be.  We will definitely be looking for them from now on.<n>

They resembled the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; and we immediately stopped since we had never seen them before. We got out of the car and watched them for about 10 minutes. Then we left and got binoculars. It took my boyfriend and I about 30 minutes to get back since we were on foot. When we got back only three were left. One of the three &#34;disappeared&#34; When we looked through the binoculars we could see two &#34;disc&#34; shaped craft with four windows and them were emanating beautiful white yellow light ( which is how we could tell they were discs) We could see lots of very little planes with emergency lights circling these objects. The scale of the UFO versus the planes was ENORMOUS. We watched for probably another 20 minutes as the planes circled these &#39;crafts&#39; through our binoculars. Then the craft on the left descended, then flew directly upwards, and once ag! ain descended. The craft on the right descended maybe five minutes later. All the planes with the emergency lights that were circling them descended as well with them. We believe they may have landed. This was right next to BWI Airport, there were planes taking off while this was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was extremely bright and moved at a high rate of speed.  What got my attention was that there was no sound and there were absolutely no flashing lights of any kind. I called for my fiance to come and see, she also noted that there were no flashing lights and that it just did not move like a plane because of the high rate of steady speed. As it moved from the south east it increased its brightness by 50% then made a very sharp turn towards due east at about a 60&#39; to 70&#39; degree angle then as its brightness decreased we could see 2 smaller objects, 1 ejected from each side of the object, 1 going north and 1 going south at the exact same speed.  The objects that came out of the side of the light/object moved so fast they were gone as soon as they came ou! t. The object then gave off one last bright burst then I lost sight of it over my neighbors roof. Never seeing anything of this nature before, I posted a question to Facebook to see if anyone else in my area saw anything strange in the night sky. I got a reply to this site from a friend saying that this site(NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER)might be able to answer some questions for me, so I thought I would share my experience for those who are interested in strange aerial phenomenon. Im not saying that what I saw is of extra terrestrial origin but it was something I&#39;ve never seen before in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After that I get in the car and drive back home and call my fiance and tell her.  She then tells me she sees the same light over oceanside, ca about 15 to 20 miles north of where I saw the object.  I rush home and see the object again reappear and disappear several times.  One strange thing did happen and it was that after it disappeared one time it reappeared right after it disappeared for a few seconds then was gone again.

They were pretty far away but it seemed as though they hovering above the freeway.  I was standing on a hill when i noticed them but i quickly decided to get a better view of it.  When i got to a better vantage point one of the lights had already disappeared.  The remaining lights hover in a triangle like formation.  One of the lights began to drift away from the rest, and soon that one disappeared.  The remaining to stayed there together for about 30 seconds before coming together and combining then splitting apart and suddenly vanishing.  They were like orange or amber colored one light was significantly brighter than the rest.  The thing that stood out to me the most was the large number of airplanes in the area it was six of them all in the sky at once its like they saw them too<n>

The sky was still dark but starting to lighten up. I noticed a very bright star.  As I looked at this bright star the light from the star went out.  It then appeared half the size and a little to the left.  It also then went out. I sat there for several minute but never saw the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a female engineer in my mid-thirties. I have never witnessed an unidentified object in the sky before.<n>

It did pass behind the school top floor.  And repeared on the other side.  For a few seconds.  And was lost due to our building wall.<n>

Then about 3 minutes later I see a disk like object in the sky floating there. I thought that it was a star at first because it was a little bright. The object left an aura and had lights. I stared at the disk and was stunned. The disk floated in the same spot for about two minutes then it zipped away in almost a blink of an eye. I was very stunned to see what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/8/12 20:35|Marysville|CA|Light|45 seconds|4 hovering lights at very low altitude South of Marysville|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88284.html|390|ndxe201204| 4 hovering lights at very low altitude South of Marysville<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I, along with our 3 children, were traveling South on Hwy 70. It was approximately 8:35 P.M. and we were about 2 miles south of Marysville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly we saw 4 lights in the sky right in view of our windshield. They appeared to be between 150 and 200 feet above ground.  They were in a straight line formation laterally, 4 across. There were absolutely no blinking lights and there were no discernable shapes that we could see surrounding the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we moved South, the objects were moving North/East and they were passing us on our left side. My husband pulled over and I got out of the truck to better observe them. He remained in the truck and rolled down his window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got out and stood beside our truck I observed the 4 objects hovering on the other side of the highway. There was absolutely no noise coming from them. Even out of the truck I could not hear anything coming from the objects. They remained at the same altitude of about 150 to 200 feet above ground, although now they were a little further away (North East of where we were). At that point they broke formation, so that they were no longer in a straight lateral line. Some were higher and others were lower. Then 1 by 1 they blinked out of existence. They were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all happened rather quickly, but 45 seconds was long enough to make those observations. It was very fascinating and at no point felt threatened or scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In no way am I an expert in aircraft, but I have seen plenty of aircraft in my lifetime. My father was in the Airforce. I have been on military bases, I have been to numerous air shows. I am well aware of the appearance and behaviors of planes and helicopters. I also crew for a hot air balloon pilot. I often observe the skies. My husband was in the Navy and lived on an aircraft carrier. We can tell you that whatever we saw was not something that we could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/8/12 20:05|La Mirada|CA|Light|1 minute|Solid white light turned simi-transparent red and then faded-out.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88282.html|392|ndxe201204| Solid white light turned simi-transparent red and then faded-out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 hours ago I was in La Mirada, California.  I saw a solid white light traveling west to east; south of La Mirada.  I saw this light between 8:05 and 8:07pm on Easter Sunday, 8 April 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was not directly overhead; but if directly overhead is 180 degrees and the horizon is 90 degrees, then this light was traveling at about 150 degrees; again, west to east.  The light was about the same size as a normal jet or plane white light at a low altitude.  By the way, this area in the sky has frequent planes and jets and the vast majority of them are flying low, just like the light I saw.  It is very easy to see the flashing red and green lights on EVERY jet and plane flying by La Mirada; but this light that I saw tonight, did not have any flashing red or green wing lights and it was low enough so I should have seen at least one of the flashing lights if it had any.  (I was looking south, the heavily flown flight pattern to Los Angeles airport is in the north skies from La Mirada----and at any one moment, you can see 3 to 6 jets lined-up heading towards the Los Angeles airport.)  I watched this light travel for at least 1 minute.   I first saw it first in the southwest night sky and then it disappeared as I was looking it in the southeastern sky.  It was still close when it disappeared, and it did not disappear because it was too far away for me to see it.  The white light just faded off.  Again, never did I see a single flashing red or green wing light like every other jet or plane that close in the night sky.  This light seemed very unusual whole time I watched it; but if that is all I saw, I would not have filled out this form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the last 3 or 4 seconds the white light turned red.  The size of the light did not change.  The size was still the same size the white light had been; but now it was red.  And it was not a solid red.  It was like 50 percent transparent and not uniformly red.  Then, after the 3 or 4 seconds of being red; it completely disappeared or faded-out.  (I am sure I was not seeing a plane turning off the white light and now I was seeing the red wing light.)  The red light looked like the same size as the solid white light I had seen; but now it had turned a 50 percent transparent red light and then just faded-out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it faded out, I could see other planes and jets way past this light in the distance.  I could see their white light and their flashing red and green lights.  Again, I do not think the light went out because it was too far away to see.   The light just turned red, a 50 percent transparent red, and then just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for 15 minutes to see if the light re-appeared or anything else, but I did not see it re-appear.   I consciously watched and all the planes and jets north of south of me during that 15 minutes.  They all had flashing red and green wing lights along with their large white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think the light I saw tonight was a plane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Brighter than streetlamps on the street, had a bronze/gold reflective appearance.  Moved extremely fast, crossing an expanse of open sky faster than any airplane or military jet I&#39;ve seen.  No sound whatsoever though it appeared to be flying at a height of similar approaching aircraft, just moving at incredible speed.  Very near KCI so I&#39;ve been a plane observer for some time and I feel safe stating this was very different.  Also it was not following any of the 4 &#34;airlanes&#34; of aircraft approaching KCI in my area.  Not a shooting star unless it was one about to hit earth.  Not a satellite, nearer Earth than that.  Headed due North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was in the military service  and spend many hours standing watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never in my life saw anything move so fast in the sky.  I have seen rockets in the shy in my life time , but compared to the speed of this flashing star. 12:32 AM Mountain time.  it traveled West to East.  It was comparable to a star.I must say the mode of travel it was a craft.  I would like to know if a rocket was fired from VAF Base, Santa Maria, Calif at that time.  Many years ago , I worked there Construction. I must say this moved much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to report this.Description of the object one item the size of a star , but very bright flashing across the shy.<n>

I said to my girlfriend,  &#34;Those planes are flying in a weird formation&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer inspection, each &#34;dot&#34; forming the shape shined red, as if they were rows of red lights next to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time we realized it wasn&#39;t anything normal.  As the trees parted and the view cleared, a 4th and 5th &#34;dot was added to the triangle shapes in that leftmost and rightmost corners.  The the entire formation vanished completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole ordeal may have only been about 30 seconds long.  We don&#39;t know how long they had been there before we noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I have always been interested in UFOs (me more than her, as she thinks it&#39;s cool, but pokes fun at me).  I have never seen UFO in the past, but have researched and seen &#34;live&#34; video accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape reminded me of the lights that appeared over Arizona.  This was both! exciting and scary.  We haven&#39;t seen anything else in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone else can confirm seeing this as it was over a very populated area.

The one on the farthest right died out, and after the last two rose for a bit more the second on the right died. Then the last light kept on moving up, and then hovered for about a minute before slowly moving right and then dying out.<n>

Thought at first it was like a tower or something , but then i thought, no way....no towers here, just slightly north of mount pleasant, where no buildings are and the lights were spanned to long and far apart to be a tower of some sort.  This is when i pointed it out to my family of 5 in the car with me (even drove back the next day to make sure, and nothing was there)  Lights seemed relatively low, as about 2 -3 miles ahead, we could no longer see them.

I looked up and saw about 8 or 9 lights that were pinkish/orange in a formation just above the lowest clouds. They were high enough that I thought they might be airplanes, but airplanes would never fly that close together. There were about 4 or 5 on the left in a a long formation then on the right about 3 together and two more a lottle lower down. I listened to try ande hear engine noises but there were none.  I tried to get my camera out but seeing this disturbed me and I was kind of frozen and scared at the same time. They began moving as a group and went benind the low clouds and could not be see anymore. Mooresville is near the Indpls airport and I have seen and heard planes for many many years and this was not anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  In thinking about this, the lights could not have come from the ground up, because lights from the ground would not be able to disappear behin! d clouds from above like they did.  The lights were not large they were like pinpoints.<n>

One object left quickly after we noticed them.  The other zoomed back and forth for about an hour.It changed from white to red to blue. The blue color was like the color of an xenon headlamp. There was no sound and no specific pattern to its flight.  It would also disappear from time to time and reappear in a different spot.  There were no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They made no noise and I realized immediately that they were very strange. Misjudging their speed I attempted to run back in my house to get my camera. When I came back out about 15 seconds later the last of the two lights had entered the low ceiling clouds and disappeared before I could snap a picture. They were very bright and solid with an Orange light on top and a smaller Red light on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not aircraft of any kind!! Main reason I am reporting is that I know many more people must of witnessed this!!<n>

4/7/12 09:50|Peterborough (UK/England)||Rectangle|2-3 minutes|White rectangular object darting in and out of Cloud base|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88247.html|412|ndxe201204| White rectangular object darting in and out of Cloud base<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my wife to work and travelling towards Peterborough Business Park, Lynch Wood, when I noticed a bright white coloured rectangular shaped object at the cloud base.  Over the next few minutes that I was able to observe it, the object moved in and out of the cloud at some speed, this continued for about 2-3 minutes before it completely disappeared into the cloud.  Not sure if this is relevant but the clouds were building up into storm clouds just at the same time as the UFO was moving in and out of the clouds.<n>
4/7/12 07:40|Spokane|WA|Triangle|5 minutes|I saw four lights in perfect formation at about 60 thousand feet.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88248.html|413|ndxe201204| I saw four lights in perfect formation at about 60 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:40 am I was sitting in my hot tub facing south-west.  At first I saw one white light traveling way slower than an airplane and even slower than a satellite.  I thought maybe someone had let a balloon loose but it was so high I thought it was doubtful.  I am pretty sure the altitude was twice as high as an airplane flies, so maybe 60,000 feet?  I am a private pilot so I have a little bit of experience with judging altitude, but it is hard to say because of not really knowing what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds I noticed a second and then third light that formed a perfect triangle.  The front light was white and the side lights were red, not solid red, but reddish.  After a few more seconds I saw the fourth and final light.  It was white and trailed the front white light by 3 to 4 times the distance from the front light to either of the red lights.  So what I saw was a perfect triangle of white in front and red on both side and then the trailing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why I am intrigued with what I saw is because of the perfect geometry of the shape.  The lights were traveling from south west to north east.  As it turns out I had a perfect view from my hot tub.  The lights travelled directly above my head.  I think it took between 10 and 12 minutes from about 30 degrees from horizon to about 120 degrees of horizon.  I am not sure if that is how you describe it but I am thinking 180 degrees spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw, but I have never seen anything like it in the past.<n>
4/7/12 03:00|Sarasota|FL|Light|3 seconds|Bright neon green orb seen descending.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88430.html|414|ndxe201204| Bright neon green orb seen descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student in Sarasota, Florida. I saw a ufo, similar to some of the other ones witnessed in other parts of Florida reported on this site: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2011/westpalmbeachfl07272011/westpalmbeachfl07272011.htm  It was a greenish orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an art student, and I made an animation that closely resembles what I saw. I believe I replicated what I saw with about 85% accuracy. I saw it clearly, and remember it clearly, but it occurred no more than 3 seconds, so that&#39;s why I believe it to be about 85% accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, here&#39;s what happened: Last Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, around 3 am, I was driving from school to my apartment. I was wide awake. The road was dark-there are no road lamps. Up far ahead are plazas that have lighting but it was a mile ahead. As I drove, a bright light caught my attention; I could see it to the right through my windshield. It was circular and orb-like, and it was a bright light. Most of it was neon green, with a bright white center, but I could see cyan blue towards the bottom right of the light. The orb descended towards the ground in a smooth curved path. It descended rather fast, but not fast enough that it appeared to be falling. It had no tail like a falling meteorite, and it made no noise. It was consistently orb-like. Eventually, it was obscured by tall dark trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to figure out what it was. At first I thought that it might of been some sort of creature/bird/insect that was close to a light and reflected bright light. However, there are no lights or road lamps around the area. Wherever the orb descended to it was in wild pine forestry. Second, I thought that perhaps a light from a car or some nearby building reflected on my windshield; but after observing my windshield for days, I could see that my windshield does not reflect any light-only car door windows reflect light. The orb was way too bright and crystal clear to be a reflection either way. I also thought of it possibly being a meteor, but it has no tail-years before I had witnessed a rather large bright blue and loud meteor burn in the sky and they are not identical at all. It could not have been a helicopter because the light was extremely neon green and slightly blue at the bottom, and it was too large to be a helicopter; I would&#39;ve heard it if it was that close. It wa! s also moving too fast to be any man-made craft. In conclusion, it&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve seen and nothing I can explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an illustration student, I just HAD to replicate what I saw. I made an animation to show the speed and path of the orb, the colors and brightness as accurate as I remember, and how high it was and how far away it was. I hope my illustrations will help in whatever investigations or studies your organization does. If you have further questions, feel free to email me. I&#39;ll be sending the graphics as soon as I submit this form.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside to smoke.  When I finished my cigarette and turned around I notced a flash at the 12 o&#39;clock position in the sky in a slightly westward direction, once my eyes locked on it was bright white, and it came stright down vertical. I thought it was a meteor, and waited for a bang, but one never came. also I never remembered one coming stright down, or being that white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Front light was white, back two lights were green, not normal green though.  It was hovering above the middle freeway about 2 or 3 freeway lights high from the ground.   As I was about a quarter mile away I noticed them, it wasn’t moving any direction like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to almost a stop to look and getting closer the lights shot straight up instead of forward/backward, left/right.  I lost sight of it after it shot upward.<n>

Could have been science project from the City View High School.  However, I witnessed this 4 nights out of the last 10 or 12 days in the exact same location during clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At Midnight on April 7, 2012, I witnessed another object mimic a star in the night sky for 2 hours until it disappeared from site.  It was in the West North West luminating from white to red light, about 10 miles from my location at 3,000 to 4,000 feet in altitude, hovering, stationary, until it slowly moved off to the NorthWest after 2 hours of observation.   Anyhoot, these objects were not planets or stars.  However, it could have been a Roaming Candle in a bag, science project.<n>

The object looked familiar from an instance on a Sunday in January on either the first or the eighth. Once I spotted the object, I ran and grabbed my camera and recorded a 3min 10sec clip of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light floated gently in the sky varying in brightness and direction in a slow but consistent rate of speed. Stopping in one place for only a few times and a short period of time. The flight path appeared to waver slightly left and right from my view point. Not resembling what I have seen from planes or helicopters flying over the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In appearance, the light resembled closest what I would consider a fireball. Reddish to orange around a dark core; though at times the core appeared to flicker with a reddish to yellow hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a BS in Business and Technology and am currently earning my Masters of Architecture degree in San Francisco, Ca. I was the only witness present unfortunately but was able to grab a camera and record the sighting. I believe this sighting tonight is related to the sighting in January due to the similar flight patterns, color and scale of the objects in question. The full moon might also be a similarity as there was one around Sunday January 8th when the first sighting occurred and another on April 6th. Overall, it was quite impressive.<n>

At first thought it was lights on top of a mountain until we cleared the trees blocking my bottom view and this is when i noticed they were not hill top lights because the mountains were very low compared to altitude of lights they at first were almost straight in sky but then turned up from bottom right hand side then light #4 started to get smaller and dissapeared then 3 then 2 then 1 until all that was left was a &#34;BIG&#34; BLACK MASS that looked kind of Roundish but also like the form of an egg (like it was moving) with a small spe! ck of a Light in back then it just stayed there for a few seconds then vanished. I think this looked like what police officers witnessed years ago in Ohio. (At first looked someting like this)&gt;  -- --**-- --<n>

We watched for a moment and they did not appear to change  color or flash in any manner (As a helicopter light would), only seemed to head in the direction of North at an extremely slow pace. Three of the objects were in a large triangle shaped flying pattern the other 4 or so were trailing behind in an un-patterned cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got out my phone to take a picture, a few of the objects had already dissappeared.  The group of three seemed to not move for a moment of time then slowly began to move again and then dissipate. My picture turned up with many perfectly rounded &amp; spaced red auras with an odd shaped white disk-like light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened at the edge of North Las Vegas as you enter into the Mountainous desert region.<n>

On the right is an animal clinic in the field to the left of their building above a small field was a oval light bright blue with a red dome. Husband turned around I saw it above some trees bottom was bright white tipped slightly so I could see abit of red and blue lights. We stopped we got out looked south and the back end was a large white light.  When I first saw it it was beautiful full color, but there was a small white flash I wonder if it had trouble.  Hovering.It took us 20 seconds to turn around and it had just made it to the tree line of this small railroad ravine.20 mph? After stopping and watching the white light go south we feel it kicked it up to maybe 45mph still low just above tree height. Full moon, wind out of North East. Radio station in Springfield had no reports, Channel 20 Springfield had no reports and I think they were abit amused. Went and scouted area this morning and it amazed me just how close it really was.  After went to minimart and asked if any one had seen it but no luck. Learned a valuable lesson always have my phone with camera with me because you never know.  Plan on being near tonight just in case a return. and one more thing.  The UFO was so colorful and bright you could not see any structure non at all no sound absolutely amazing.  I&#39;ve always thought they live by 3 rules number 1 don&#39;t get caught 2 they are big showoffs and 3 let&#39;s mess with the humans and see if we can&#39;t get get them good and rattled..Going to make some phone calls to see if farther north anything was reported.<n>

In the sky to the south I saw a very brightly shining object moving across the sky.   At first I thought it could have been a plane, but it was moving across the sky much faster than commercial airplanes seem to, and it seemed like it was at a lower altitude.  Furthermore, it left behind no trail of any kind. I didn&#39;t think anything of it until it suddenly just totally vanished. I stopped my car and got out to look, I didn&#39;t hear anything and I couldn&#39;t see it or any trace of it again, although it should still have been well within my line of vision.  When it was in sight it was shining very brightly, but I could definitely make out its form, it had a shape to it, and it was very visible even if it hadn&#39;t been shining.<n>

Logansport, IN<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a copied article, posted as requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These articles cover rare information on SETI signal SHGb02+14a  [Article 1] Mysterious signals from light years away  19:00 01 September 2004 by Eugenie Samuel Reich  In February 2003, astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) pointed the massive radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at around 200 sections of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same telescope had previously detected unexplained radio signals at least twice from each of these regions, and the astronomers were trying to reconfirm the findings. The team has now finished analysing the data, and all the signals seem to have disappeared. Except one, which has got stronger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This radio signal, now seen on three separate occasions, is an enigma. It could be generated by a previously unknown astronomical phenomenon. Or it could be something much more mundane, maybe an artefact of the telescope itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it also happens to be the best candidate yet for a contact by intelligent aliens in the nearly six-year history of the SETI@home project, which uses programs running as screensavers on millions of personal computers worldwide to sift through signals picked up by the Arecibo telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absorb and emit  &#34;It&#39;s the most interesting signal from SETI@home,&#34; says Dan Werthimer, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and the chief scientist for SETI@home. &#34;We&#39;re not jumping up and down, but we are continuing to observe it.&#34;  Named SHGb02+14a, the signal has a frequency of about 1420 megahertz. This happens to be one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, readily absorbs and emits energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some astronomers have argued that extraterrestrials trying to advertise their presence would be likely to transmit at this frequency, and SETI researchers conventionally scan this part of the radio spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SHGb02+14a seems to be coming from a point between the constellations Pisces and Aries, where there is no obvious star or planetary system within 1000 light years. And the transmission is very weak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We are looking for something that screams out &amp;#145;artificial&#39;,&#34; says UCB researcher Eric Korpela, who completed the analysis of the signal in April. &#34;This just doesn&#39;t do that, but it could be because it is distant.&#34; Unknown signature  The telescope has only observed the signal for about a minute in total, which is not long enough for astronomers to analyse it thoroughly. But, Korpela thinks it unlikely SHGb02+14a is the result of any obvious radio interference or noise, and it does not bear the signature of any known astronomical object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That does not mean that only aliens could have produced it. &#34;It may be a natural phenomenon of a previously undreamed-of kind like I stumbled over,&#34; says Jocelyn Bell Burnell of the University of Bath, UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Bell Burnell who in 1967 noticed a pulsed radio signal which the research team at the time thought was from extraterrestrials but which turned out to be the first ever sighting of a pulsar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are other oddities. For instance, the signal&#39;s frequency is drifting by between eight to 37 hertz per second. &#34;The signal is moving rapidly in frequency and you would expect that to happen if you are looking at a transmitter on a planet that&#39;s rotating very rapidly and where the civilisation is not correcting the transmission for the motion of the planet,&#34; Korpela says.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This does not, however, convince Paul Horowitz, a Harvard University astronomer who looks for alien signals using optical telescopes. He points out that the SETI@home software corrects for any drift in frequency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fishy and puzzling  The fact that the signal continues to drift after this correction is &#34;fishy&#34;, he says. &#34;If [the aliens] are so smart, they&#39;ll adjust their signal for their planet&#39;s motion.&#34;  The relatively rapid drift of the signal is also puzzling for other reasons. A planet would have to be rotating nearly 40 times faster than Earth to have produced the observed drift; a transmitter on Earth would produce a signal with a drift of about 1.5 hertz per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is more, if telescopes are observing a signal that is drifting in frequency, then each time they look for it they should most likely encounter it at a slightly different frequency. But in the case of SHGb02+14a, every observation has first been made at 1420 megahertz, before it starts drifting. &#34;It just boggles my mind,&#34; Korpela says.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The signal could be an artefact that, for some reason, always appears to be coming from the same point in the sky. The Arecibo telescope has a fixed dish reflector and scans the skies by changing the position of its receiver relative to the dish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the receiver reaches a certain position, it might just be able to reflect waves from the ground onto the dish and then back to itself, making it seem as if the signal was coming from space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Perhaps there is an object on the ground near the telescope emitting at about this frequency,&#34; Korpela says. This could be confirmed by using a different telescope to listen for SHGb02+14a.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible fraud  There is also the possibility of fraud by someone hacking the SETI@home software to make it return evidence for an extraterrestrial transmission. However, SHGb02+14a was seen on two different occasions by different SETI@home users, and those calculations were confirmed by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the signal was seen a third time by the SETI@home researchers. The unusual characteristics of the signal also make it unlikely that someone is playing a prank, Korpela says. &#34;As I can&#39;t think of any way to make a signal like this, I can&#39;t think of any way to fake it.&#34;  David Anderson, director of SETI@home, remains sceptical but curious about the signal. &#34;It&#39;s unlikely to be real but we will definitely be re-observing it.&#34; Bell Burnell agrees that it is worth persisting with. &#34;If they can see it four, five or six times it really begins to get exciting,&#34; she says.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is already exciting for IT engineers Oliver Voelker of Logpoint in Nuremberg, Germany and Nate Collins of Farin and Associates in Madison, Wisconsin, who found the signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Collins wonders how his bosses will react to company computers finding aliens. &#34;I might have to explain a little further about just how much I was using [the computers],&#34; he says.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ref: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6341-mysterious-signals-from-light-years-away.html?full=true   [Article 2]  Radio source SHGb02+14a  Radio source SHGb02+14a is a source and a candidate in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discovered on March 2003 by SETI@home and announced in New Scientist on September 1, 2004.[1]  The source was observed three times at a frequency of about 1420 MHz,[2] which is expected to be a frequency used by extraterrestrials due to its proximity to one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen absorbs and radiates photons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are a number of puzzling features of this candidate, which have led to a large amount of skepticism. The source is located between the constellations Pisces and Aries, a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years. It is also a very weak signal. The frequency of the signal has a rapid drift, which would correspond to it being emitted from a planet orbiting nearly 40 times faster than the Earth around the sun. However, each time the signal was detected, it was again at about 1420 MHz, the original frequency before any drift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are also a number of potential explanations for this signal. SETI@home has denied media reports of likely extraterrestrial signal.[3][4] It could be an artifact of random chance, cosmic noise or possibly just a glitch in the technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ref: http://www.multilingualarchive.com/ma/enwiki/en/Radio_source_SHGb02%252B14a<n>

As I opened my door to let the dog out, I noticed what, at first, I thought was an airplane in the distance coming directly at me from the south.  As it came closer, I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane.  It had 7 or 8 lights that were shaped in a star formation.  The object stopped, then traveled from east to west rapidly across the sky until it faded from sight.  I had stepped onto my deck to get a better look and there was no sound from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:00  in the morning I could here trains that roll down the track one mile from my house.

My husband was in the house on the couch and he saw it through the tall window we have.  We live on top of a mountain so as it went through the tops of the trees it was at a slight downward angle.<n>

I noticed lightening out over Sarasota Bay to my south, so I was watching the sky and noticed some strange lights to the north, moving too slow to be a plane. So, I took my dogs down a street that had a clear view of the sky and saw at least 4 triangle shaped ships crossing the sky. They appeared to be maybe 3-5 miles away, over the north end of Anna Maria Island and they were moving west to east, as though they had just come in from over the Gulf of Mexico. They were moving in concert with one another, obviously following each other. They were very large, wider than the clouds and they appeared to be traveling “upright” because I could see the triangle shape clearly as through it were facing me, rather than having the flat side facing toward the ground. Each one had very bright red lights on each corner of the triangle that were steady and fainter white ones directly beside that flashed on a steady! rhythm, blinking on and off every couple seconds. They were moving in and out of cloud cover, but I was able to observe them until they crossed out of sight. I would estimate that I had a clear sky view spanning probably 8-10 miles wide. It took the 4 that I saw at least ten minutes to pass out of my line of sight completely. I took a video with my cell phone of the last one, which is very shaky and hard to decipher because I was also trying to hold my dog&#39;s leashes in the other hand and they were running and pulling on me. It is my opinion that these ships were far too large to be any airplane or helicopter that I know of, and moving too slow and smoothly with too much precision. They appeared to be gliding, and made no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was driving I looked up at the sky|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88211.html|443|ndxe201204| I was driving to my house from my friend’s house which is about 15 minutes away from my house.  As I was driving I looked up at the sky (just looking at stars) when I noticed a really bright light that looked like a really bright star.  I proceeded to watch it as I was driving and it slowly disappeared out of sight.  One second this light was the brightest light in the sky and then it was completely gone.  I thought it had left but I watched the spot it was in for a few more seconds and it reappeared as bright as it was before and stayed there for 30 seconds to a minute and then it went away again.  It disappeared then reappeared 10-15 different times as I was making sure I didn’t lose sight of it so when I got home I could show my relatives.  They sat and watched it with me and we all saw it disappear and reappear many more times until we finally went inside but we never saw it leave so it could have been there for the next hour or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light didn’t move and it had a kind of shape to it but I couldn’t make it out because it looked so far away but it was so bright.  I honestly think it was some sort of craft or energy. I was relieved when it disappeared in front of my relatives so I wasn’t the only one who saw it.  It was definitely high in the sky because clouds were passing in front of it and dimming the light very slightly.<n>

There wasn&#39;t a lot of rain, but there was a lot of lightening.  The clouds broke on and off.  We were sitting inside the car when we thought we saw what was a star in between some clouds in a clearing.  We both basically disregarded it for a while, unsure that it had any significance.   A few minutes later (10 or 15) my friend noted that there was something strange about it.  He thought he saw it move. We got out of the car to get a better look (it was no longer raining, just sprinkling) and the “star” was incredibly bright.  As a reference, if the moon were full, this spherical object would be half its size and very very bright. It was a yellowish light, and it did not blink.  The object was a good distance away (north west in the distance), and it was difficult to really tell what its size was.  We studied the object for a good time. It appeared to spin, and one side of the sphere was brighter and you could tell when that side faced the other way.  At this point it hadn&#39;t done any extreme movement, it was more of just hovering with some slight cradling side to side. It was cold, so we both got in the car to continue watching it. We sat for a while and both at the same time saw it dart to the left quite quickly and precisely.  We then got out of the car to watch more, very intrigued.  To our dismay it very quickly went away, making a few more side to side movements before being so far away that we could no longer see it.  We got in the car, determined to follow it.  We couldnt, and inevitably came back to the same exact spot about fifteen minutes later.  It was very far away now, and on a different part of the sky completely.  Once again, we watched it make a few small, quick movements, before darting away into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to add that neither of us were on any drugs or could be counted as an unreliable source. Whatever we saw, it was in fact there, and not a hallucination. We tried to rule out every possibility, and we were left with some sort of UFO.<n>

While watching it seemed to just float,slowly headed northeast,it changed shape an very couple seconds reflected a huge Sun Glare.  I got one shot at 200mm of a flare then it disappeared! The jet was closer by couple miles (shot with same 500mm an cropped same as the enlarged shots) so i est. the size the UFO to be at least the size of a passenger plane jet engine. Wasn&#39;t a Plane,not Venus,Not a Satellite, I&#39;m left with weather balloon or theme park balloon  or parachute tour wind checker (but it was in air traffic lanes) or UFO. this is the second one of this shape an type i caught, First was 1-8-12.

4/4/12 01:00|Danville|VT|Light|1-2 minutes|Woke up to bright light shining into house coming from the sky.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88709.html|449|ndxe201204| Woke up to bright light shining into house coming from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two months ago my husband was awaken in the night/early morning to a VERY bright light.  He jumped out of bed thinking someone was in our driveway and shining their headlights in our windows. He went out into our family room and was shocked to find the entire house was lit up with a whitish, bright light.  There was no noise associated with this light and it was like it was coming from the sky.  This light lasted long enough to wake him up and for him to go into another room and realize that it was not what he initially thought.  The next day when he told me, I was thinking that it had to be a car or something, but we didn&#39;t talk about it any further and shrugged it off.  Later that day I was talking to a neighbor friend and casually and half jokingly asked her if she saw a bright light last night. She gave a humorous response so I explained what my husband saw.  She than told me that 3 or 4 years ago she saw the same thing. it woke her up and she tried to look around her house and outside to see what it was and figured it was something in the sky.  When she went to work the next day she was talking to her co-workers about what she saw and a lady that lives 3 towns over, East Burke, saw the same thing. Well, sometime between April 1-April 5 (we honestly have not been keeping track so we cant remember what night it was) my mother, who was visiting from AZ, was lying awake in her bed and all the sudden there was a bright light that lit up the room. She thought something was wrong with the barn light, but then realized that a light would not have lit up the room like that, plus the light was coming from the sky.  She laid there waiting to hear a helicopter fly by, but there was no noise with the light.  That morning she came downstairs and asked my husband if he saw the bright light. He immediately got goosebumps and said no, but I know exactly what you are talking about. He explained what he had seen prior and also what our neighbor friend saw. We didnt go any further into discussing it besides making the obvious jokes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That brings us to the last &#34;sighting&#34; that is now making us question what the heck this is. Our neighbor friend came over yesterday and told us that her husband fell asleep on their couch watching tv the other night when he was awoke by a bright light. It lit up their room and he got up and looked outside thinking there was something going on outside. He mentioned it to his wife the next day, but didnt seem to interested in discussing it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Dad he replied it was so fast!!   It was round and a blackish silver,  I don&#39;t know it was weird he said!  It had a hole in the bottom with a pole in the center that looked like a firemans pole coming from beneath, and all the windows were alternating blue and red, next was the weirdest thing it had three symbols around the hole in the bottom!  The first was a triangle ,2nd was a triangle with a round dot on top of it, 3rd was like a quotation mark, then he said dad it flew so fast towards the sky on a 45&#39; angle, so he pointed up and said the sky opened up and like sucked it into the sky, so he pointed where and next was unbelievable, the sky was black and where he pointed the sky was a ocean blue hole like a vortex of some sort!  My son is an athlete he never was into telling stories or into ufo&#39;s, and he was scared to death for a week, at least!  He clung to me when we went outside like a monster was chasing him and he&#39;s not an affectionate kid at all, for him to hold onto me , was out of character....  So I&#39;m a definite believer now , you can&#39;t tell me different, and my son is scared to talk about it but once in awhile he will talk only to me about his sighting, he wants to be an astronaut now, only when he&#39;s older he says so he can findi ut what he saw!!!  Crazy, no! Real , yes!<n>

I thought it was a jet or helicopter but it kept getting louder.. so I look out the window (I was seriously thinking our house was about to get crashed into by a plane) and I seen something weird, really weird. It was a rectangle shape. It was really low. wasnt much above the tree tops.  It flew over the local hospital.  Had a white light at each corner a red light on both of the sides.  Before I could really even comprehend what I seen I noticed it was following two smaller white lights.<n>

My wife asked me to take a look the object was very bright and we have never noticed a planet or start in that position before.  The best position fix I can estimate is the object from my vantage point was at an angle of 55 to 60 degrees in altitude and about 100 degrees or 10 degrees to the west off a the  90 degrees as north.  There was intermittent heavy rain in the evening but, there was minimal or no clouds during the observations time form 21:50 to 22:40.  Object was intensely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this not a planet or star and you are interested in this event I will make a detailed report with accurate location an object position data.  If this is a UFO both Sea Tac and Portland PDX should have have numerous pilot reports as well as individuals on the ground.  If it is a star or a planet sorry for wasting your time.<n>

Usually when I walk outside at night, I take a minute to observe the night sky, so I noticed immediately something was out of place. This bright object was moving approximately northeast to a northwesterly heading, to the right of where the sun sets. It was moving at prop airplane speed about 35-40 degrees from the horizon (I’d guess 5000’ +/- AGL).  As the object moved in a slight downward arc, I noticed it forming an ever- brighter sapphire blue plume emitting from its central light which at the same time was fading slightly. As I saw a change happening, I knew this was absolutely no plane, and ran back in my apartment to grab my camera.  I got :25 seconds of footage with my point-and-shoot Canon in which you can only make out a blue fuzz ball.  It was dark and I couldn’t tell exactly where I was aiming, but I captured a little of the blu! e light.  As I watched/filmed, the object took the shape of a Hershey kiss turned on its side, (some would say teardrop) point facing its forward direction. The hazy halo/plume reminded me of the sort of vapor a rocket emits in its trail, but this plume did not fade or get any larger, and it stuck with the object as it traveled. As it “plumed out”, the light continued on its heading, not getting any larger or smaller, just a little dimmer until it disappeared behind the mountains. If you held your thumb out at arm’s length, it was just smaller than your thumbnail at its largest.  Usually when an object moves away, it gets smaller, but this object did not do that, so perhaps I witnessed it moving laterally.  I’m typing this less than an hour after the sighting so it’s fresh in mind, and I’ve also created a Photoshop rendering of the object on its path and the shape changes it made as I watched.<n>

I look up and an object that looked sort of like a half moon with something coming down off the front left side.  My kids said it looked like the moon, but the moon was behind us.  I parked the car ran out in the yard to get a picture and it was gone. The background was in a valley above a small damn that is a fishing club surrounded by hills.  No houses or businesses only a small clubhouse.  I did not get a picture and me and my two children are the only witnesses that I know of.<n>
4/3/12 19:15|Columbus|OH|Cylinder|10 min|Bright white cigar/cylinder above columbus OH  4/03/2012  daytime sighting|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88260.html|456|ndxe201204| bright white cigar/cylinder above columbus OH  4/03/2012  daytime sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday April 3rd 2012. I was outside on a break at work, it was about 7:15pm.  Weather was perfect, bright blue sky with hardly a cloud to be seen.  Upon exiting the building I looked to the sky, as I usually do (I’m fascinated with looking up, watching airplanes, looking at stars etc.) I noticed two planes very high heading west, one behind the other and a little offset.  I watched for a few seconds and turned my attention to my phone to do a bit of web surfing.  After a couple of minutes I again looked toward the sky, but this time I was in for a surprise! When I looked up, I saw something I can’t explain.  There was a bright white object. The shape was somewhere between a cigar and a cylinder.  Actually, it looked like a pill capsule.  Take the fuselage of a plane, remove the wings and tail and cap both ends with a dome.  That’s what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the east side of Columbus, OH and fairly close to the airport. Keep in mind, it was broad daylight when this occurred.  The “object” was traveling from south to north in much the same way a blimp might travel. (silently gliding across the sky)  The altitude was really not that high, I’m guessing around 5’000 ft. It was low enough to see that it did not have wings, and that it was not a blimp, but it was just a little too high to see any clear detail. (as in windows , doors etc.) A pair of cheap binoculars would have revealed something I’m sure.  That’s how close it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object pass over as it headed north.  I’m guessing it was about a half mile east of my position. Hard to tell though because I don’t know the true size of said object.  From my perspective I’d say the size was somewhere between a private jet, and a commercial airliner.  The moment was very surreal. I just watched in amazement. I did think about taking a picture with my phone, but I knew the picture would only reveal a small white blob in the sky, and wouldn’t prove anything… I would be made fun of by friends when trying to show it. In hindsight however, I wish I had taken that picture!  The object continued heading away from me to the north, and after I had my fill of watching it, I again returned to surfing the web. (I knew I had just witnessed something extraordinary, but there was nothing else to see)  After reading a couple articles in the news I decided it was time to go back inside. I took one more look to the sky, and low and behold, there it was again! It seemed to be on the same trajectory, only this time, it was headed back to where it came. (south) I couldn’t believe it. I watched for a few seconds and decided I needed a witness. I went back inside, and yelled for one of my co-workers. I told him to hurry, you’ve gotta see this. We were back outside in about 15 sec. I pointed to the sky and said “What the **** is that?!!”  He was without words. I had him confirm what I saw.  Me:  “do you see wings?”   Him: “no”   Me: “is it a blimp?” Him: “no”  Me: “what do you think it is?”  Him: “I don’t know” We watched it head further to the south for maybe 30-40 sec. and then it changed course a bit and headed roughly south east and then accelerated (gradually, but firmly) off into the distance. Im very glad I called for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I witnessed. I very much like looking to the sky, and I do every time I go outside. I live in the flight path of Port Columbus and I am accustomed to seeing different types of planes as they come in to land. I’ll admit I’m no aviation expert, but like I said I’ve always been fascinated by flight, and I watch planes every chance I get. I love to read about the mysteries of this earth, and in doing so, I have read enough to also be a very skeptical person. However, this is one thing I cannot explain.  To me this was truly an Unidentified Flying Object. From where it came, I do not know, but I am very glad to have witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched online every day since and have come up with nothing. Surely somebody saw it, and I would like to hear other accounts.<n>

OK so what do I care!!! This is where it gets strange,in the beginning my pics were all over the net, I use earthcam and wired New York web cams to capture my pictures. Well lately I’ve noticed that the page will never refresh every 30 seconds like it used to and sometimes they block me completely??? Why?, I have no clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone can use these cams to see these objects, I believe the cameras have infarred view and that’s why I get so many Strange pictures. I am sending my first report to you guys in a hope that you will show my evidence and investigate this matter further..??? If you don’t believe me just watch the cams for yourself and you’ll see…Trust me on that !!!!<n>

I could hear the entire town going crazy. Students were screaming and yelling. Sirens of every type was going off. I could smell a little smoke in the air, I knew they had started burning stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the crowd from where I was standing between two homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear no clouds. The moon was bright. I saw a helicopter circling downtown. Then two more joined the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching them when I saw a feint shape over downtown. As my eyes focused in I could see a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it I could see a large dark triangle. But you actually couldn’t see the dark part it matched the sky. The three points of the craft had a glow on the underside. May have been the city lights reflecting off it. Made it look like three smaller triangles. That had a slight really light gray shine on the bottom. All flying in a perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went almost directly over me I could not hear any sound. It was like it was gliding across the sky. It was a little lower than the moon when it passed over. I could see what looked like the side but it was dark to. I never saw any type of light coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over I could no longer see three small triangles. All I could see was two small triangles.

I took the camera (Sanyo digital) and took some pictures one after the other at short intervals. After few days I looked at the moon again and one of the stars of the forming triangle was in the opposite side of the moon and I took again just one picture.   After 2 weeks I downloaded the pictures on the computer and for my amazement one of the pictures reveled something incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one of the set of pictures on the very first picture there are beautiful stars and at least 3 strange objects flying between the stars in the same direction, from East to West.  The stars appear very luminous but these objects have different luminosity and at the time I did not observe those objects with naked eyes on the sky or they were flying at a high speed and it was a momentum.  They appear in my picture of a dull luminosity, not with lights on but their shape is well bodied defined and they appear to be of different size but it could be because of the different distance they are flying, I can’t estimate; and if they are at a big distance it means that those objects are enormous, it is really spine-chilling.  I have seen pictures on YouTube and allover the internet of all kind of objects but nothing similar to these once in my picture.  Please, I would like to be contacted by an investigator.<n>

At first, it seemed to be stationary, but 20 minutes later, it appeared to have moved slightly to the Northeast.  Also observed a small plane coming into Logan Airport.  The plane had blinking lights and moved under the bright object, causing the object to appear to be much father out in space than the plane.  The plane seemed to be making a routine landing at the airport.  It is now 22:15 and observation of the light continues.<n>

It&#39;s much much brighter and much larger than any stars. it was &#34;hoovering&#34; there for well over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just outside of the town of Okarche, OK when we noticed what we thought was an aircraft with a red pulsing light on one end and a blue pulsing light on the other gliding over a field just east of Okarche heading east.  We could only see the lights and not the object itself as it was very dark out.  It struck me as strange as it was moving slowly and had no other beacon or strobe lights normally found on aircraft.  We kept driving onto OK State Hwy 3 towards Oklahoma City, OK and watched the lights head east and go out of sight.  At approximately 2100hrs we were approximately 8 miles east of Okarche when I happened to look to my right (south) and see what appeared to be a tower base of some kind with the same lights on top of it the base right next to a farm house.  Out of curiosity I decided to pull on to a road in front of the farm house (exact addres! s unknown) to see if we could see it up close.  The lights were stationary there approximately tree top level maybe a little higher and approximately 50ft from our position.  It was really dark and we could not make out the shape of the object.  We could only see the lights.  As we pulled up I rolled down my window to get a better look and heard no sound at all except that of traffic on the nearby highway.  We sat there for about 10 seconds looking at the lights when all the sudden the object began moving west away from us which surprised us.  It started off moving slow, however, in the 10 seconds or so it took me to get back on the highway the lights were already approximately 5 miles away heading back towards Okarche.  We were amazed at how far it had travelled in just a 10 second period especially watching it travel so slowly earlier.  We watched it glide back west then north until it was out of sight.  On a side note I had observed the same lights over Okarche about a m! onth prior to this sighting but did not have time to turn arou! nd and c heck it out.  I just happened to be telling my wife about that sighting when we encountered it this time around.   Again at that time all I could see where the lights and not the object shape itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/2/12 20:42|Rockaway Park|NY|Cigar|1min 40sec|I recorded an unknown object while photographing the conjunction of Venus and the Pleiades the evening of April 2, 2012.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88222.html|474|ndxe201204| I recorded an unknown object while photographing the conjunction of Venus and the Pleiades the evening of April 2, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of April 2, 2012 at about 8:35 PM EDT, I set up my camera on a tripod to photograph the near conjunction of Venus and the Pleiades star cluster.  I was using a Nikon D7000 camera with a 18-105 mm lens set at 105mm. Commencing at 8:41:28PM, I took 6 photographs at approximately 15 second intervals over 73 seconds.  The exposure times ranged from 15 seconds down to 3 seconds.  I was shooting with an f-stop of f11 and an ISO of 6400. The camera remained in the same position for all 6 exposures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I noticed nothing out of the ordinary either with my eye or through the viewfinder.  When I later downloaded the pictures into Lightroom for processing, I received a tremendous surprise.  Below and to the left of Venus in the first exposure, there was a blue elongated oval of nebulosity about 20 arc seconds in diameter.  The object proceeded to move upwards and to the left in each subsequent frame until, after 6 frames it had covered a distance of about 1 degree of arc .<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the object was, I don’t know.  I do know, however, that it was not a lens artifact.  Lens artifacts don’t move.  Right after I took these pictures, I moved the camera to the south and photographed the constellation of Orion with no extraneous objects.  If the object was in the atmosphere, i.e. a high flying aircraft, it would have been long out of the frame in 100 seconds.   If it were in low earth orbit and moving at a similar velocity to the ISS, it would still have been out of the frame during the elapsed time of the shoot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I overlayed the photographs with a piece of tracing paper and registered the object in each frame to the background. Fig 7 shows the path of the object over the elapsed 100 seconds of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Peter,  Thank you for getting back to me.  I&#39;ve also posted the sighting to NASA&#39;s Space Weather website and MUFON but have received no reply from either one.  I photographed Venus and the Pleiades the following evening but there was nothing there that wasn&#39;t supposed to be.  Unfortunately, I was having problems with camera&#39;s auto focus, was tired and forgot to use manual focus, so those photos were trashed.  This camera is only a few weeks old and is quite different from the Nikon F that I have been using since 1965.  I do have some thoughts on both what it was not and what it may have been.<n> <n><n> What it was not: 1. Lens flare.<n> <n><n> 2. An atmospheric craft.<n> <n><n> It showed no running lights; It was too slow except for a helicopter and<n> <n><n> again, no running lights.<n> <n><n> 3. An object in earth orbit.<n> <n><n> Too slow. Too big? Under power?<n> <n><n> 4. Cloud.<n> <n><n> Weather was clear.<n> <n><n> 5. Weather balloon.<n> <n><n> Not unless it was illuminated by blue spotlights.<n> <n><n> 6. Japanese paper lantern.<n> <n><n> 7. Reflection.<n> <n><n> Of what off what?<n> <n><n> 8. Spotlight.<n> <n><n> Illuminating what? There were no clouds and judging by that evening&#39;s<n> <n><n> sunset, very little atmospheric dust.<n> <n><n> 9. Venus.<n> <n><n> Venus was right next to it.<n> <n><n> 10. Swamp gas.<n> <n><n> 11. Meteorite.<n> <n><n> 12. Bolide.<n> <n><n> 13. Comet.<n> <n><n> If it was, I want it named after me.<n> <n><n> 14. Another planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> What it possibly could have been.<n> <n><n> 1. Ball lightening.<n> <n><n> 2. Some other sort of electrical discharge.<n> <n><n> 3. Ion flux.<n> <n><n> 4. Some sort of plasma effect.<n> <n><n> 5. Something blue shifted.<n> <n><n> 6. Heated gas containing traces of copper, selenium, indium or arsenic.<n> <n><n> 7. Aurora?<n> <n><n> 8. Very small Noctilucent  Cloud.<n> <n><n> 9. ???????????????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, I am as mystified as you are.  As I said in my first email, I photographed this thing unintentionally at an ISO of 6400.  The camera was a lot more sensitive to light than the eye.<n> <n><n> I&#39;m including a blow up of the object, as far as Lightroom will allow me to enlarge it.  As you can see, the pixels at the center are hotter than those toward the edge and there is a faint but distinct halo around the blue glow.  This thing is anybody&#39;s guess.  Please feel free to publish the sighting on your website.  I am curious to see if anyone else has any ideas.  You can contact me at any time if you have any further questions.  I know I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It went out of my sight behind the apt.  Building I live in.  But they could still see it.  They used binoculars to spot it and it was a white colored disk, that glows.  It had a black line through it and dots on it like lights.  It was moving all over the sky slowly, for almost 4 hours until they decided to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It changed a few times, to almost resemble a spider with its legs, and then a weird ball of light or an &#34;orb&#34; flew beneath it and past it.

It sometimes looked like it was coming towards them and then it would switch directions and continue to fly south. (to our left)<n>

But as they stayed at that angle and continued north-west, I began to believe they were not airplanes.  They were traveling pretty fast.  I am 100% sure these were not airplanes.  I really hope someone else has witnessed these.<n>

Was watching the night sky since it was very clear, then an orange fireball/light came from the lower horizon area and shot up into the sky.  Looked alot like a shooting star but orange and flew at a completely different direction than your usual shooting star.  The sighting did not last long, maybe 2-4 seconds or less.  Object had a weird orange hue and looked like a fireball sort of. Not much activity here in Lodi, CA so this definitely stood out to us.  My neck got sore from looking up so much.

As I pulled into my driveway my wife was sitting outside smoking a cigarette, as she does every night about the same time waiting for me to come home.  As we began to walk towards the back yard, we both noticed a large low flying black triangle with only three bright red lights.  The object came from the west and flew right over us heading towards the east, with a slight turn towards the northeast then vanished. There was no sound, and this thing did not move in the air like a conventional aircraft.  I grew up near Camp Lejune Military base and have witnessed all types of aircraft, but I have never seen anything like that!  I asked my wife to describe what she saw. Her description of what she had just seen was the exact same thing I had witnessed myself.<n>

The next days or so I looked at the moon again and appeared that the Star on the base of the triangle moved on the right side of the moon.  I was amazed and took another picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In mean time I took some pictures of some piece of furniture in my home and happened that I need to download the pictures and I downloaded the pictures on the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the pictures of the moon taken and for my surprise I noticed in one of the moon’s picture that there are at least two objects which we did not see with naked eyes.

It was there for almost 10mins and then it was gone, not faded away, but gone. Now, the next night, it happened again, same way, same area.  It looks like it is over the farm&#39;s field, who has cattle and other farm animals. This has been happing every night at the same hour, and same duration.

An airplane was also in the vicinity approximately 1/2 mile from the location.  The airplane flew straight past the other craft as the latter was sitting stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believed the strange light to be a star and that the twinkling light was caused by interference of particles in the atmosphere.  Upon closer examination the object appeared to flash with 3 distinct colors and several combinations of the 3.  Red and blue followed by green then an assortment of purples and yellows then back to the red, blue, green pattern.  I opened a star map on my android phone and the particular point had no listing for stars, planets, satellites, or other space material that should be currently located in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes of stationary observation I noticed that the craft began to move and the longer I stared at it the farther west it traveled until it was lost over the horizon around 00:10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can give the exact latitude and longitude of the location where the observers stood.<n>

It seems to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope others in the Nevada City area also report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three airplanes have approached it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

However, I would find it difficult to explain what I saw this evening as an April fools joke.  I am a professional engineer &amp; must state that I have seen nothing like this in my 35+ years as a professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw tonite were two distinct &amp; separate formations very high in the atmosphere heading SSE from between Venus &amp; Jupiter @ ~19:50 PDT.  I watched them for about 8 minutes, after which they disappeared.  Though they were somewhat dim, and @ a high altitude, I was able to follow them.   Their brightness reminded me of the &#34;7 sisters&#34; though somewhat dimmer &amp; they continued forward.  That said, they were clear to my eye &amp; I was able to track them until they disappeared @ ~220 degrees (SSW).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 1st report I have ever made to anyone on such topic.  I am not into UFO&#39;s, but I know what I saw tonite.  Let me know if you require more info. &amp; please let me know, if you may, what you determine re: this report.<n>

One witness took a photograph with her camera/phone of the object which appears semi-transparent and very clearly circular with a circular center.  There were two visible circular rings, one inside the other in the form and shape of a craft.  The details of the craft are very clear otherwise.  The report was sent to me in an e-mail immediately and I have forwarded it, with the picture to George Noori on Coast to Coast and to George Filer, Filer&#39;s Files.  I would like to send you the picture as well and will try to do so. Thank you.<n>

It then quickly shot to the right side next an overpass we were about to pass up.  It got brighter and looked like it exploded, and then instantly disappeared after that.  My brother and I looked at each other puzzlingly and wondered what it was.  We both agreed later on that it must have been a UFO.  There were no other lights at either side of the road at the time.<n>

I couldn&#39;t tell how high it was nor how big.  I was amazed by what I had just seen.  It wasn&#39;t bright at all.  Almost like a darken out red.  The front had one dark red faint light followed by two in the back.  It was going extremely fast heading north east.  Amazing.<n>
