We lived on the 5th floor. That evening my sister and I were watching television when suddenly I felt drawn to the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went onto the balcony and there in the sky, probably approx. 100 yards above me, was a HUGE circular silver craft hovering.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever. It had green lights around the edges.  You couldn&#39;t see the entire craft just by looking up at it.  You had to turn your head from left to right, then back again, to be able to see its entirety.  It was as big as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my sister out and we stood looking at this thing realizing it was a UFO. Within a few seconds it literally shot up into the clouds and disappeared.  This happened in a split second.  It was there, then it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was hovering over Lockwood Drive.  I was 10 yrs old and my sister was 12. I couldnt believe that this happened where it did.  This area was and is a very busy and city like suburb of Washington, DC.  I will never forget that experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Police kicked us off of the highway and we wound up on back roads and in Tiffen Valley Ohio. In late evening, my friend and I had weird (not bad) feeling that there was a third person. We were walking along the farms and were very freaked out. We sat down to rest and watched 3 objects in the sky. They were like orange or yellow ( i am slightly color blind). We were not even talking to each other. We watched the show and the three objects zipped around. Then one or more &#34;flashed&#34; us. We both thought that the flash was in our minds and not real. Thats the best way I can explain it. We then continued walking for a few hours. We finally got off the road into some woods and slept. We both awoke quickly as if we were fighting. We both had severe pain behind our left ears. There was no blood or other evidence of a reason for the pain. When we ran out to the road, we already forgot why we awoke so fast and we were really freaked. We knew something happened but were afraid to ever question it again. I never had until now. Let me know what you think. It has bothered me for over 20 years. thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first description is pretty complete. I am checking that an investigator can contact me but please do it through e-mail as I prefer the utmost confidentiality.<n>
4/19/78 23:00|Westland|MI|Disk|2 minutes|Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white lights.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38637.html|3|ndxe197804| Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white beams of light, one pointing on the ground, the other straight ahead. Slowly flew over the middle of street in front of our house going from west to east during a blizzard. As it got to the end of the street, the &#34;down&#34; light came up to face straight ahead like a pair of headlights. My son was outside shoveling the driveway and saw it first. He cannot remember how long he stood outside watching the UFO before I came out. A series of musical notes that I heard drew me to the window and ultimately out to the porch. There was no radio or TV on in the house to produce the notes I heard. We then watched it for a couple of minutes in complete silence until it disappeared in the poor visibility of the falling snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/15/78 21:00|Olongapo||Sphere|20-30 min.|Gigantic sphere covered with triangula patterns of various and continously changing colored light, totally silent propulsion sys.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45700.html|4|ndxe197804| Gigantic sphere covered with triangula patterns of various and continously changing colored light, totally silent propulsion sys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all the date of this incident has been so long ago that I am not sure of the particular month or day, though I know it was between March and may.  Also, the witness count of seventy plus represents toses imediatly around me, but does not reflect the thousands of host nationals who witnessed the spheres as it flew form Clark Air Base to Cubi point Naval Air station.  Or the Two F-4 Phanthom aircrews or the two A-4 Skyhawk pilots that were circling the object.  It took the aircraft between six to eight second to traverse from one side of the sphere to its other before dissappearing behind it. It was covered in continually shifting triangular patterns of colored light.  It was talk about on the local philipine radio broadcast for nearly a week, though not on the U.S. Arm Forces radio. Totally silent. Gigantic in size.  I serve aboard the USS Independence; CV-62,  I estimate that cut up, ten carriers her size could have fitted into this craft.  I and my finance at the time, who later became my wife witnessed the phenonenom after getting off of the base shuttle bus in front of the Cubi Point Chow Hall.  The base taxi stand was there also.  Between the bus load of people getting off and those waiting to board and the people waiting for cabs as well as the people coming out of the chow hall across the street, I estimate that there were atleast seventy plus people around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in the air force and my rate in the Navy was that of an airdale.  I flew mainly aboard SH-46 Sea Knight choppers. I am very verse in both military, commercial and general aviation aircraft.  I am sure that this vehicle was not of any technologies that I am aware of in either construction or aerodynamic properties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also assigned several years later to the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River, in Maryland.  There I came into contact with some of the advance airframes or technology could produced in the eighties.  I&#39;ve discussed what I saw that night in the Philippines with some of the best minds in the disciplines of aeronautic design and theory.  None of them have ever been able to tell me what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of note, that I have always found interresting, is that the day after the sighting, my former wife, whom as I said was my finance at the time of the sighting, was a live in maid who worked in base housing. That evening when I met her at the bus stop in front of the chow hall, she was very hesitant to talk about what we had seen the night before.  She said that the enlisted service man whose family she worked for.  Upon returing home after work that day, asked her if she had seen anything unusual the night before.  She told him of the sighting.  He told her that he had been in a meeting with other servicemen who had famlies on the base that day.  They had been told to inform their domestics that it could cost them their jobs if they discussed with anyone what they had seen the night before.  Also as in her case, my permismion to request to mary her could be denide, even though it had been approved.  Or she may find it impossible to pass the American bried course which was mandatory befor we could get married.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cubi Point Nas was located atop the hill range abouve Subic Bay Naval Operations Base.  From the vantage point which we were at,  We could see the object approacing from the north.  The only sound associated with it were the turbines of the fighters that Clark air base and Cubi Point NAS had launched.  It turned and proceed to slowly fly over Cubi and off towards the Marine Ordance Magazine depot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated from the the two different types of interceptors, of which I was toatll;y familiar with, that they and this object were approximately eight to nine hundred feet in the air.  The triangular patterns of light were continually changing by the second in a rainbow of colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the craft after it crossed behind a ridge.  I later heard that the object dissappeared over the South China Sea ... how I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Our neighborhood at the time was at the western edge of town.  This house was one of the homes on the edge of the subdivision.  Right behind the house are power lines with those tall towers.  We were in the backyard, clear blue sky, bright sun...my eye caught something in the western sky.  It was red, and as it made its way towards us, I could tell that it was maybe no larger than the house.  It was red, very red, like it was pulsating, as it had the bright blue sky as a background.  It had no reflection, I remember because I thought that it should since the sunlight was hitting it, any metallic object might reflect.  When it stopped above the power lines, about fifty feet above us, it was then when my half-sister saw it as well.  I remember that it just hovered, and seemed to make a dull low-throbbing sound.  As it hovered, my half-sister began to yell and ran inside to get our parents.  While I stood there, the object just hung out, perhaps moving ever so slightly.  It seemed to be looking at me.  Then just as my half-sister came out, the object zipped a bit to the sides, and then shot straight up and disappeared. No trails, no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

4/15/78 13:00|Pleasant Hill|OR|Unknown|1 min|Grandfather and grandson levitated in dump truck. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70181.html|6|ndxe197804| Grandfather and grandson levitated in dump truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened somewhat early in my childhood. My Grandfather was doing the groundwork for the Pleasant Hill Dairy Queen.  Earlier that morning my Grandmother had mentioned she had to go to the bank that is also located in Pleasant Hill. He had finished his CAT work and unhitched the trailer from the dump truck and we proceeded to move out east on hwy 58 to go home. We had gotten to the intersection of hwy 58 and Tillicum, as that street is called now, and I felt something weird in my tummy, like on a roller coaster ride. I remember saying &#34;what happened?&#34; My Grandpa then said, &#34;look down there, there&#39;s your grandma.&#34; There was no seat belt laws back then so I stood up in the cab of the truck and crawled over to my grandpa&#39;s lap and looked down. I could see the top of the bank and could see my grandma&#39;s Buick going into the drive-thru at the bank. I could also see east down the hwy, we were at what I believe to be now at 200-250 ft up above the hwy. I remember seeing the top of a tractor trailer rig and the tops of a few cars. I also remember looking down on the telephone poles. This lasted maybe 10-15 seconds and then we were back on the hwy traveling at speed moving eastbound. I immediately asked my grandpa &#34;How did we do that, what did I touch?&#34; He responded with, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; You see it was pretty loud in those old dump trucks. I said, &#34;How&#39;d we go way up in the air!!?&#34; I stood up and started trying to mess with some buttons. He then said,&#34;Quit messing with that stuff , get up on your seat and just hold still!&#34; It seems he had no recollection of the event. We got home a few minutes ahead of my grandma and when she arrived I excitedly told her what happened. She said,&#34;(grandpa&#39;s name), whats he talking about?&#34; Grandpa responded &#34;I don&#39;t know he&#39;s been going on about being up in the air or something rather since we got back.&#34; I told her grandpa didn&#39;t believe me and I was pretty upset. When my parent&#39;s came to get me I immediately told them what had happened but I still wasn&#39;t believe! d. I can remember that day vividly. Sadly my grandpa passed away in 1998. I used to ask him about that day when stuff like that came up. He never recalled that experience. I don&#39;t know what happened that day but it was the first of several unexplained event&#39;s in my life. Just thought I would share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/15/78 13:00|Richardson|TX|Other|1 to 2 minutes|Elongated wedge shaped UFO, smooth silver in color, in the daytime.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51642.html|7|ndxe197804| Elongated wedge shaped UFO, smooth silver in color, in the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in elementary school, around the 1978-1979 time frame, I was out at recess at school, on the swingset swinging away when I had just stopped swinging and was looking at the sky and the clouds. Almost all of a sudden, this smooth, almost polished silvery object passed silently across the sky. I never pointed towards the sky or called out to anyone (since it was very short, and I felt I would probably be ridiculed to no end) when it happened. It didn&#39;t last very long, possibly a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no portholes or windows on the object, it was completely featureless, with no lights of any sort, and was seemingly completely level during the entire sighting. Never did any acrobatic maneuvers or &#34;showed off&#34; or anything like that. Seemingly just darted across the sky just fast enough so I could see and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of it, an elongated wedge, is best described as taking a three-sided pyramid and taking one point and stretching it. There&#39;s a picture in one of the special issues of UFO Universe (can&#39;t recall which one) of a drawing made by a young girl in Israel of her UFO sighting, that had a shape (possibly of the craft itself) that looked just like mine, except hers had lights. The text of the drawing was all done in the Israeli writing, so I am not sure if that&#39;s the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object never left a trail, there was no haze about it, no emittance of beams, or anything of the sort. And no noise ever came from the object during the entire sighting. It also remained absolutely level, and performed no acrobatic maneuvers or rose upwards at a very high rate of speed. It also never slowed down, as the speed seemed to be very steady the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else talked about it, so I don&#39;t know if the other kids saw it or not. I never pointed it out or called anyone&#39;s attention to it, preferring to keep it to myself in case I was ridiculed for seeing it. The &#34;several&#34; on the witnesses box is only technical, since the other kids were out playing around, but none ever saw the object or said anything about it at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also the same one who had the landed UFO sighting with occupant in Gainesville, FL some years later (1990-91 time frame).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was living in the dormitory during the week.  The reason my mother picked me up on Thursday that evening was because we had a flight to go to Daytona, Florida for a family vacation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As usual when she can pick me up, she drive on back roads instead of the NY State Thruway (1-90), I recalled very clearly we were on Route 5. I was 13 and half years old.  On the way home to Fayetteville, NY where we lived, we were approaching Town of Sullivan, NY, I saw what appeared to be a UFO.  I looked up and saw two fireballs still in the sky over this hill and it was not blinking at all.  Aircrafts usually do and high communication towers do blink as well.  I saw was one fireball appeared higher than the other fireball as my mother was driving by.  She could not see that UFO long enough to know since she was focus on driving on the road.  I was sitting up front as my brother was sitting in the back.  He saw it but ignored it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Often we drove by this area many times and at the time there were no towers.  The next time we went by, I saw no towers at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred around 20:00 hours since it was already dark out and I know I had my dinner at the Deaf school.  At first, I thought people would doubt me when I tell them about the UFOs I saw.  I was wrong since my family and friends told me the next day that in the local newspapers that they reported a UFO.  That UFO in the newspapers was NOT the same UFO I saw.  Their UFO that was in the newspapers was a halo.  It appeared above the other side of the City of Syracuse in the vicinity of Near West Side area.  Town of Sullivan is way out pass Eastern part of Onondaga County.  Town of Sullivan is in Madison County.  That would be about 30 minutes drive apart or so.<n>

I was BLOWN away to read your experience, and when I read your experience of seeing the same sphere craft as my Mother (who is in her 70&#39;s now), my brother, and myself saw on that night of early 1978 (I lived in Wayland at the time).  I recently drove back to that road that the giant house-sized UFO was hovering over our 1970 or 1971 Olds Vista Cruiser......you know, the road that is behind that car wash....sort of behind it, a horse-shoe shaped road....We nicknamed that road &#34;MacArthur&#34;.  Any way..... I am SO glad to see someone else come forward like yourself, and I am SO glad that I posted my UFO experience in this weird forum.  I simply went to Google and typed in UFO NATICK CAR WASH to see if there were any follow-ups...and SURE enough, there was your experience.  I know EXACTLY what you were referring to when you said about the &#34;Water Tower&#34;....  I had been up there on an ATC (all terrain cycle) 3 wheeler plenty of times back in the mid 1980&#39;s with some local friends my age that lived there in Natick...so I know the location you witnessed the same UFO that we saw.........and that water tower...I was at the water tower in 1984-1985 and I knew it was a stone&#39;s throw from where me, my Mom, and my brother saw that UFO in 1978.   OK.......Because of the mandatory anonymous with NO contact information allowed on this site....the only way I can think of what to do is to take my digital camera and record the EXACT place where our UFO experience happened in Natick.....and post if on YouTube.  I talked to my mother, and we plan to do a quick documentary with my digital video camera of driving the EXACT road in Natick where we had our 1987 UFO encounter.  My digital camera has sound too, so we will both be recalling and talking of what we saw that night of early 1978.  I think a lot will be explained a lot better once my mother and myself re-track our exact steps! that we took, describing everything on video that I&#39;ll post on YouTube this month in late October of 2007.    I can&#39;t tell you how excited I was when I found the (reply-followup/more info) to my NATICK MASSACHUSETTS UFO BEHIND CAR WAS 1977 or 1978 that I typed out here in this forum...a UFO report I guess they all call them.   My mother must have read your story 50 times..... Please, keep your eye on youtube around late Oct of 2007 for a more detailed experience, re-tracing our steps that night with my digital video cam w/ sound.   IDE like to perhaps chat some day....and does NOT have to be in person.  Maybe will bring some sort of closure to that flying freak show that we both saw that night.  Frustrating not being able to leave my contact info on this site.  Would be nice if I could have left a hint in my above entry that spells out my last name (&#34;ehem&#34;).....  I have nothing to hide.   Keep checking YouTube for the video I will record in late October of this year, 2007.  It is now Oct 5, 2007 as I am typing.  And Mr. or Ms. &#34;M&#34;.....Thank you again for sharing your 1978 Natick, Mass UFO experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  - D.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Regardless of the date though I know the time being around 9-9:30pm is accurate.  I know exactly where the Car Wash is that was referred to. As I write this I have goosebumps just reliving that night. I want to confirm that I had also witnessed the same thing from a different vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1978 I was a Sophomore going to Natick High School, I was 16 years old.  I lived in East Natick, MA. and I would occasionally go in to Natick Town Forest at night and sit on the ridge that overlooked the big field and compose my thoughts and just sort of wonder about life in general. It was usually quiet, peaceful and it was right down the street from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the night that this huge object came flying over head. The object appeared to come from the North East at about the one o&#39;clock position which now makes sense if this person saw it up near the Car Wash (Scrub a Dub) I think was the name. I was sitting on the ridge above and in the middle of the the field facing due West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look at this map on google:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Macarthur+Rd.+Natick,+MA+01760&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=42.296151,-71.331589&amp;spn=0.01111,0.027122&amp;t=h&amp;om=1<n> <n><n> <n><n> you will see a large almost rectangular space, that was the field, the round tower was/is a water tower. The Car Wash was at the corner of Oak St. and Worcester Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this was it hovered above the field for what felt like approximately five minutes, during that time I felt like I was being communicated to but I had no idea how, why or just what exactly was going on.  I did not feel scared and actually quite the opposite I remember feeling a sense of amazement at whatever this was. After five minutes (it really seemed and felt much, much longer)whatever this was took off straight up. I remember hearing two sonic booms and it was gone. It was a crystal clear night when this happened and although it felt warm at times there were still some very cool breezes and I was wearing a jacket and hat. I also remember there were no clouds in the sky that night I remember that I could see the stars very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like the person that wrote and posted the other initial observance I also have not been able to erase the memory from my mind and I still continually think about it. It is actually one of the reasons for me finding that persons post in the first place, I googled &#34;Natick UFO&#34; because I hoped that by now some other people might have put something out on the web about seeing something so I could confirm that I wasn&#39;t just freaking out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I agree, it was spherical (round) in shape and it was as big as a LARGE HOUSE! It had a lot of different colors but I didn&#39;t really think of them as &#34;lights&#34; the way we think about light bulbs, the colors were more flashing in a circular pattern just underneath the bottom of it. I also agree that it made absolutely NO NOISE except for the two sonic booms that I heard when it finally took off. I also confirm all of the dogs barking in the neighborhood. I also agree with how the previous poster &#34;sensed&#34; rather than really saw that it was solid, you could just feel the presence of something solid there and what I was looking at was also very, very smooth, everything got very quiet and then all of a sudden when it was over the field it seemed like every sound &#34;underneath&#34; it was being amplified. There was a very strong &#34;electrical&#34; almost it seemed vibrational presence (that is really the only way I know how to describe it).  I remember looking at the trees around the field when the object did take off and they had a very eerie almost phosphorescent glow to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess the thing that really bothered me back then was when I wanted to talk about it then no one else seemed to want to talk about it. I would mention it and get a look like &#34;yes, i know, but I am not able to say anything about it&#34; almost like they were scared to talk about or just plain unable to talk about it for some unknown reason. When the previous person mentioned the woman&#39;s reaction of &#34;hmmmm...oh yes&#34; that is almost exactly how it was, people acknowledged this thing to some degree but were unable to or just did not want to verbalize or be excited about it for any reason, just like being in a trance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like the previous poster for the past 25 years I have often wondered just what the heck happened to that night and WHY!  I would also love to be able to talk about this with the person that posted the original just to compare notes, we might be able to answer some questions but more than likely I have this strange feeling that we would be looking for answers that just are not going to be made apparent to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also swear that everything that I have typed is true. I have no reason to hype this. All I know was that I was very glad to see that someone else saw the same thing I did that night in the early spring of &#34;78&#34; and I am gratefully to that person for posting their experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -M<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

4/4/78 21:00|Natick|MA|Sphere|8 minutes|GIANT UFO - Natick, MA on Route 9 behind CAR WASH - either 1977 or 1978.|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47196.html|12|ndxe197804| GIANT UFO - Natick, MA on Route 9 behind CAR WASH - either 1977 or 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I SWEAR on my life and in the name of God that what I have typed below is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured it must have been in the fall of 1977 or the spring of 1978, as I was in 3rd grade, and there were no leaves on the trees, and was warm out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was driving down Route 9 in Natick, 9pm-ish at night, and we saw what looked like a round shaped stationary flashing of Christmas lights hovering about 1000 feet above a Car Wash about a mile down the highway.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother who is 3 years older than me was also with us in the car (my mom was driving the 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser Station Wagon).  I was in the back seat, my brother and mother were in the front seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WELL, me being 8 to 9 years old at the time, I knew that this was no hot air balloon, nor a blimp, nor a giant kits with lights.  There is not a night that goes by without me thinking of that night.  IT was the SIZE OF A LARGE HOUSE !!!!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my mom continued down Rt. 9 near the car wash, It dropped out of the sky unlike any aircraft could ever do.......and there were the most colorful lights/beams rotating everywhere flashing from this round house sized thing......... lights all over it (I don&#39;t recall seeing any beams).............it made NO noise.......it hovered over our car, then it was following us........also, every dog could be heard howling and barking in the neighborhood.........it&#39;s almost impossible to describe.............and it was hovering right over the car with us in it.....it was at the tree tops, following us...<n> <n><n> <n><n> as mom was driving, she lost sight of it, and so did my brother......and I was in the back seat, terrified...looking all over the place for it as it couldn&#39;t just dissapear like that.......and then I looked up through the tinted moon-roof window of the car (the 1970 Oldsmobile Station Wagon) and I yelled &#34;it is right on top of us!!!  and it&#39;s getting lower!!  It&#39;s following us!!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right over the car, and then the lights on this thing started going even more crazy....once again, it was the size of a LARGE house, and round with all colors of lights - mostly on the outside what I can only make sense was the rime of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Underneath the UFO it was solid, as even though it made no noise, I could hear it hovering over us, as sounds were bouncing off of it.....   The only way I can explain that I knew it was solid, is to close your eyes, then have someone walk by you.... you can hear a solid mass blocking sound.  Does that make any sense??<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every dog in hearing distance could be heard braking like crazy in the neighborhood my mom was driving (behind the car wash in Natick, Massachusetts).  I never knew so many people owned dogs.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> People were coming out of their houses, and I remember so clearly a woman coming out of her house, looking up above our car, and her screaming for her kids to get back in the house at the top of her lungs.....door slammed, and her outside lights turned off.  THis lady was obviously terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my mom drove around the neighborhood, and this giant silent lit up christmas tree appeared to get even lower below the trees.  My mom knew a lady who she did typing work for in the neighborhood, and my mom pulled the car into her tiny driveway....  we got out of the car (I don&#39;t remember seeing my brother get out of the car or not, but I do remember my mom with me against the car.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> .........and when Mom stopped the car in someone&#39;s drive way (whom she knew and did typing work for), the house sized sphere with rotating lights on the outside rim of it, and some lights flashing underneath it was something I could not make sense of..... being ony 8 or 9 years old, the only thing I could associate it with was flashing christmas lights in ALL colors...BUT, the lights were not apearing to flash/blink on and off......it was as if the lights were all joined together, making it look like the giant house sized silent object that was hovering or spinning over our car......but the lights I believe is what made it look like it was spinning as that is the only rational explanation I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear on my grave, and on my life, that the house sized object looked like it lowered below the trees, almost in an arms reach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom then told me to climb up on top of the car and see if I could touch it.  I climbed up onto the hood, then with one foot on the windshield of the car, I reached up my arm (I don&#39;t remember which arm), but I reached my arm up to see if I could touch it.  For that moment we had no fear of it, and the terror was gone.  I was unable to touch it, and it was higher above the car than we thought it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom, still to the day feels so guilty as she will sometimes say to me these days &#34;Why on earth did I ever tell you to see if you could touch it....Gahlleee&#34;   &#34;We didn&#39;t know if it was good or bad&#34;  she still says today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, now that we are in this lady&#39;s driveway, parked.......My mom ran up to the lady&#39;s front door knocking like crazy....and when she came to the door my mom said to her &#34;You have to come out here !!   You have a UFO in your front yard !!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the lady walked out to her front steps and looked right at it, and calmy said &#34;hmmmm....  oh yes&#34;..........    Then she calmly proceeded to ask my mother how she was.  I was stunned with this lady&#39;s reaction.  My mom (still to the day) says that the woman was in a trance when she came out of her house, making very light of the GIANT ROUND house sized light show that was drifting off into her back yard, and into the woods of Natick where it faded behind the trees in the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I realized what I just did.  I was on my mom&#39;s car trying to touch this huge thing !!   I got off the car, my mom made some light conversation with the lady, and we got the heck out of there, back home to Wayland.  That was when the real terror started to set in of what happened.  We got home, my mom reached for the phone and said &#34;Who do I call!!!  I can&#39;t call the police!!!&#34;..... so my mom called my sister who was newly married in Marlboro, MASS.     I was terrified for months when it got dark.  There is NOT one night that goes by that I don&#39;t look to the sky, waiting for it to show itself to me again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole UFO incident from start to finish lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  I have recently discussed our experience with my mom, and she said that she will drive the same exact route with me in the day time, and I&#39;m going to film it with my digital camera as Mom tells the story - remember that my Mom was the driver, and her being the only adult in the car, she noticed other things that my brother &amp; I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, you can understand why I think of this thing every night...always looking into the sky at night, almost waiting as if the giant lit-up round freek show thing is going to come back some day or night.   My brother still doesn&#39;t like talking about it to anyone else besides me or Mom...<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ever it was, it sure it wasn&#39;t there to greet us as friends, or to let us know that it would not harm us......or to bring peace.....but there was only that brief moment of fascination when I climbed up onto the car to see if I could touch it.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutely terrified when I went to bed that night, and was for many nights after that waiting for it to appear in the back yard and come back for us in Wayland - the next town over.  Remember that I was 8 or 9 years old.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just ticks me off as I will always wonder what the whole point of this giant airship hovering over us in the car was for....   ya know?   Ok, so we saw this huge floating round UFO with colorful lights.  What did it want?  What, did it want to put on a show for us??  What was the point it wanted to make??  These a questions that have bugged me for the last 30 years, and I am finally coming out with my experience..   No, we weren&#39;t abducted, none of that stuff...... no physical contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe if it were evil, I shouldn&#39;t want to know what it wanted, and why it was there that night, floating down to our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember being so mad at school when telling my friends the next day of what happened.......then they would tell me that it was probably a hot air balloon..or a blimp.....that I shouldn&#39;t lie................that was when I stopped talking about it...  Well, I have seen a blimp, I have seen hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes, and this was NO BLIMP or HOT AIR BALLOON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand I am not allowed to reveal my identity or contact info in this forum, and if I were allowed to, I would take my chance and give out my name and email to see if there are others out there that experienced what we did back in the late 1970&#39;s in Natick, MA.......as we have NEVER reported this UFO before, and this forum is the very first time this UFO that we experienced is being shared to the world.  I just want to talk to someone else that saw what we did that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nailing down the exact date is difficult, but I do remember I was in 3rd grade, born in 1969, so it had to be 1978 or so......  I do remember that there were little or no leaves on the trees, and it was warm outside....and very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Agian, I swear on my life in the name of God that what I have typed above is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.  Follow-ups, PLEASE....   Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - D.<n>
4/4/78 02:00|Los Angeles|CA|Unknown|45 seconds|strange blue light enhances IQ|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71965.html|13|ndxe197804| strange blue light enhances IQ<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a first lt investigator and armed supervisor for Globe investigations and was sent to the WESLOCK key and lock factory in south L.A. to protect an unarmed IN HOUSE security officer as he made his rounds.  The night before an in house officer was shot and killed by intruders.  We were stting in a prefab guard house about 15 ft by 15ft and I turned off the lights so we could see if anyone would come over the outside walls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unarmed officer sat diagonaly from me in the shack and neither of us could see each other&#39;s faces. (we were both caucasions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the guard shack filled up with a translucent blue light and at that point I could see the other man&#39;s face.   We were both amazed.  I looked up at the florescent lights and they were off for sure.  I looked outside thru the windows and could see no source of the blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light was gone I called the LAPD, asking if anyone hit a power pole in the area that could cause such a light to happen.  They stated no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I added this incident to the nightly report and we continued the shift.  I have no idea how this light came to be.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did however find that my ability to play the electronic keyboard was greatly enhanced and later i was tested for IQ due to an accident in an armored truck when my attorney filed a law tort.  My IQ had increased from 117 (measured in the USMC in 1959) to 160.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this date I can not figure out what that light was.  I did not see anything in the sky due to being inside the shack.  My hand was definitely on my .38 revolver from the time of the light to minutes afterward!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I am retired now I dont care what anyone thinks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

4/1/78 21:30|Green Springs|OH|Cylinder|72 hours intermitten|The begining of the lights in the night|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51890.html|14|ndxe197804| The begining of the lights in the night<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange thing is, this is a family story. I do recall the events, which started this extraordinary set of events in motion.  Those images are not something you forget.  I know it was tax season because we were returning from my uncles (he did taxes pretty well) and my father got his taxes done that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on our way home, which takes us down county line road, then turn right, then half mile and turn right on to CR173.  We lived about a mile from the turn onto 173.  Well as we were turning, my mother who was also a witness, noticed a bright white oval/almost cylindrical shaped object above what we called (for sake of this report we will call them the X woods) &#34;X Woods&#34; (the X&#39;s owned the entire chunk of real estate).  Within a matter of seconds, of us all looking to see what my mother had seen, I was thrown backwards with the great acceleration of the car.  When I got back to see what the speed was I remember clearly it was bouncing off the little bar at the end of the speedometer. The speedometer registered 120mph max.  It took us mere seconds, even with a 90 degree left turn into our driveway (driveway is about .5miles in length) this with 3 young kids, and an infant in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were rushed into the house, rushed into our bed cloths, and carted off to bed.  I remember hearing the shotgun being prepped and loaded, and remember for 3 days we didn&#39;t go to school, nor were we permitted to play outdoors, and my father set with a loaded double barrel shotgun on the front porch for<n> <n><n> 3 nights. Beings I was a kid I had no worries, I just did was I was told, and complained about not being able to go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared 9 other times in my life.  I have seen this object up close; I bare scars, burns, illnesses, and other strange marking from events which to this day still occur with frightening regularity. I have been witness to other events outside my purview (happening as I just came in on it or happened to have been present during it).  The object I saw was brilliant, but not so that you couldn&#39;t look at it.  It shined what looked like today&#39;s laser pens at several locations, however the beam was much larger, and more intense. The beams did not shine directly at us however, but there were several noticeable points of contact.  A tree near our home had been singed, a barn roof had its roofing tar burned to a crisp, and our neighbors lost 2 of their horses due to breaking of a fence, which was also burned (horses later recovered 2 miles from their origin location), the X&#39;s recall nothing of the event whatsoever. However their trees were also singed or burned and their driveway showed evidence of burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all quickly forgotten by the X&#39;s and the like in the area as this was real rural farm country. From my bedroom window we could see the object thru the tree in the front yard for an additional 15-20 minutes.  This object appeared twice more over the next days.  Each time progressively shorter in stay, the final night was its shortest stay, this time however it was in the field to the south of the woods, and appeared much lower to the ground, 20-30 feet above the empty field.  Later descriptions by my father confirmed this.  He said it just sat there silent.  This time no lights came from the object like it had done the previous 2 nights.  He said it seemingly sat there, which was confirmed by my brother and I who were up way past our bedtime sneaking peaks out the front window.  The last night after hovering for only a few moments it shot straight up, it changed colors from white to orange, then to blue, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father went to the site in the early morning of the 4th day, and found absolutely nothing.  No burn marks, singing, or anything out of the ordinary.  However he did notice the air seemed electrically charged and had the smell of ozone. This incident wouldn&#39;t be so memorable had it not happened right in front of me.  To this date no other member of my family will discuss this matter.  My father and mother have now passed on, and the remaining witnesses to the event refuse to speak of it. If there were other witnesses to the event none to date have come forward.  I stand alone in this matter.  Basically because it&#39;s not something you talk about except around campfires and the like. I have asked my brother and sister who were in the backseat with me if they would care to comment.  Their answers were outright NO COMMENT, so I will leave it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My postulations on what this object might have been go from a helicopter, military aircraft, to swamp gas, to UFO, to god knows what. I wouldn&#39;t even bring it to your attention had these events not continued in my life.  I have contacted other UFO organizations, and author Bud Hopkins in regards to the many events in my life.  To date only one, ARC (Alternate Realities Conference) in Johnson City Tennessee has any interest in this information.   I wrote to them of my happenings over the entirety of my life. No one else has shown interest other then those I tell around the proverbial campfire,<n> <n><n> and even then those stories are soon forgotten.   I can only postulate that the reason my father hit the gas was that he had seen this object sometime before, and was afraid of it.  The shotgun and the porch sitting was another indicator that he was afraid of it.  My mother&#39;s response was extremely similar.  They were afraid of whatever it was. I myself at that time had no opinion of it, not till it affected me later in life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time today.<n>
4/1/78 04:00|Farmington|NM|Circle|7-10 min.|Daytime ufos that appeared above Farmington New Mexico in 1978.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23703.html|15|ndxe197804| Daytime ufos that appeared above Farmington New Mexico in 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all sitting on our back porch relaxing when my sister noticed three circular objects above the foothills behind our house. The foothills were about three miles from our back porch. My sister told us all to look at these crazy things above the hills. As we all watched them, it appeared as if they were performing some kind of odd ballet in the sky. They kept darting back and forth horizontal to the horizon at great speeds, but we were wondering how the kept from hitting each other as they seemed to dart in and out of each other. the opjects seemed to look like the moon when you can see it in the daytime. (wierd description I know but they seemed illuminated like that.) they darted along for several minuets after we spotted them, and at one point they all started moving to our right along the horizon and gained speed and then moved rapidly up at about a 45 degree angle and dissapeared in less then a second. We did not think of it at the time but the radio we were listening to became heavy with static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in April 1978 is approximate.  PD))<n>
