I have been searching all over the internet for information on &#34;cross-shaped&#34; UFOs. Sadly, my search has come up empty. I seriously hope you can help. I don&#39;t know where to report this or what resources to use. It was December 31, 1997, the time was between 9:05pm and 9:10pm. We were heading westward on  Rt22 Express De Diego and at the end of Avenida de Diego we witnessed a cross-shaped UFO (called an OVNI in PR). I noticed it initially and at first thought it a large jet at extremely low altitude. Unlike a jumbo jet, there was no engine noise and its position in the sky didn&#39;t change. It was hovering over what I could see in the dark was a large parking lot full of what appeared to be delivery vans. It was roughly cross-shaped with white lights at all 4 ends of the cross shape. These white lights were steady and did not blink. There appeared to be something in the center of the underside, however I cannot remember too much detail. My Fiancee said it was concave shaped in the middle, curving inwards. Also, off-center of the underside was a flashing red light, which at first led me to believe that it was a plane. If it was a plane, it was motionless. I considered it a helicopter, but it was twice as large as the building it was over. I&#39;ve seen Sikorsky Skycrane helos before, and this wasn&#39;t one of them. Besides, the make a terrible racket in low hover. We had stopped our van, and all five of us watched in awe...not quite believing what it could be. I am the type who is open minded but still requires proof. We returned to the salida (exit) where we saw the OVNI (UFO) the following day. We then observed that there were powerlines where we saw the OVNI hovering. The industrial park where we witnessed the OVNI, there are many high-tension wires. Not being a UFO-ologist, I have a few questions: are UFOs commonly seen near powerlines? Why? I would like very much to ask an expert if this type of UFO (cross-shaped) is common. When I usually think of UFOs, I think a saucer-shaped type craft. This was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen, and the 4 other people present in the vehicle. All of the witnesses were college-educated and despite the date, New Year&#39;s eve, no one had been drinking. I would appreciate some resources to come forward and let me know where I may find (preferably on the web, otherwise in book-form) further information on this cross-shaped UFO, and if its type has ever been spotted before, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere. Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a database analyst for a ISP in Connecticut. While I&#39;ve no objections to the release of my story, I do NOT want my name appended to the story. I have never seen anything like this and I&#39;d rather not risk any harassment. I drew and scanned what we saw, that is everyone present in the vehicle agreed that the object I drew was what we saw. Unfortunately, this was left in a wor document in Puerto Rico with a relative. As soon as I receive the Word document I had scanned the image into, I will forward that onto you if you wish. Thank you<n>

Shortly after my family moved to Poland, OH.  We lived there until my father got a promotion in 1985.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then moved to Warren, OH, where I lived until the beginning of 2000.  I was an above average student in High School (class of 1995), but never aspired to go to college.  I started work at a local pizza shop in the beginning of 1996.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 31 1997,  I got off of work shortly after 8 pm.  I already had several guests waiting at my apartment on the other side of town to celebrate the New Year.  It was an over-cast night with no precipitation at that time.   I always took the outer-belt Route 82 East to get home, that night was no different.  I was just past the Elm Rd exit on the part of the highway that goes north-south when I looked up and saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 8:30 pm.  I saw what at first I thought was a row of floodlights slowly heading west across the sky in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked closer because the lights were a different color and quantity than the floodlights I usually saw in the sky on cloudy nights.  What I was looking at was a giant boomerang shaped aircraft with a dozen large blue lights across the rear.  More interesting was the fact that it was just above the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and I could see the clouds rolling under it and around the front out-lining the shape of this &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue lights were round in shape and a hazed blue color.  The lights alone were the size of the Hercules C-130 airplanes that fly out of the Vienna Air Force base on daily flight patterns over the area (at least at that time).  One of my best friends at the time, his father was a mechanic in the Air Force at that base.  I went to many air shows with them and saw the largest military plane at that time and it was nowhere near as large as what I saw that night.  It covered the sky from the top of my windshield to just above the horizon.  It had to be at least 2000 feet across but probably larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience lasted about 15 seconds, so it had to be moving slower than current physics would allow to keep something that massive aloft. The highway is hemmed on both sides by tall trees and hills making it difficult to see the sky beyond.<n>

All were identical and were a light brown or tan in color. The formation did not break as it traversed across the night sky.  I called Andrews AFB and the SDO gave me the # to the FAA which turned out to be a fax #.  I called Wash-DC info and got the # for the FAA which gave me the # for MUFON.  Very interesting...that the govt. does not want anything to do with UFO&#39;s and would rather pass any reports onto a privatley run civilian organization. My fight has only just begun. I will make my sighting known.  I have nothing to lose since I am not a public figure...yet.<n>

The underside of the object was covered in bluish-white lights.  She began to run toward the trees, intending to get a better look on the far side, but the lights on the object immediately extinguished.  She was then unable to see the object in the night sky.  Distance from the witness and altitude were undetermined.  Duration of the event was about 45 seconds.<n>

I sent her a letter asking if she would like to file an offfical report with MUFON.  Here is details from her account. I am a forty-five year old female who has had a life-long interest in UFO&#39;s since the age of five.  On December 31, 1997 around 5:45 p.m. I was walking my dog.  On one side of the street there were lots of pine trees, but I could see through their tops. I live near the airport so I know there is constant air traffic, so I glanced up twice at an aircraft before finally taking a longer look.  The craft was like a triangle shape but each of the three sides were a different length, and the bottom of the craft was covered with blue-white lights, so it must be a UFO. I was looking at it through the trees but couldn&#39;t tell how big it was.  I started running towards a clearing to get a better look and it was like it read my mind.  As I started running all the lights on the craft went out and it was no longer in view.  Everything around was still and quiet.<n>

We stopped the car at the end of the drive way and turned engine off to listen. Heard low humming noise, Craft appeared to be on flight coming from the direction of Eglin AFB headed toward Pensacola NAS.  Moon was small sliver no clouds seen. the lights were: one on the front tip, one in the middle of each side and oone on each wing tip or the points of the triangle on the sides, the back was straight across without lights, one red flashing light in the middle of the underneath side.<n>

Spokane. I did not realize exactly what I was seeing untill about 2002. I believe what I observed was the plasma ball caused by the electro magnetic field around the craft.  I could not see craft itself. Looked like a very large black light (ultra violet) at least 80ft. diameter as I had trees and ridge line to judge size and distance. Closest I got to the thing was about 200 yd.s I first observed it from the maintence shop about 8:pm took sno-cat up MT. was able to still see it most of time as I had to manauver around the MT.. Was able to get above it and observe from top of MT. Where it hovered at, was about 100 ft. above what is the mountaineers lodge, well below the ridge lines of the Mt. and adjoining ridge (curves around). This thing hovered in the same spot two yr.s in a row on the same date between the same time 8: to 10:pm (could have been there same time every yr. as it could have been storming snow or real foggy? The strangest thing about this is that both yr.s the other groomer (different guys each yr.) could not see the thing even standing next to me pointing straight at it. This was something you could not miss. Like looking at a red barn at 100 yd.s away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved rapidly a short distance and then stopped in the sky.  It did this approx. 3-4 times.  Movement too rapid for any known aircraft (to my knowledge).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving northbound on I-95 through Prince William Co. and almost in Fairfax Co., VA, at approx 2230 (no later than 2245).  Three blue lights in the sky ahead of me caught my attention.  I first thought it was a helicopter.  However, the blue was medium in shade (the most beautiful I&#39;ve ever seen).  The color was captivating.  They were too large for any aircraft of which I am familiar.  They were grapefruit-sized.  The three lights formed a perfect triangle.  This formation moved rapidly, a short distance and then came to an abrupt and complete stop.  It repeated this action 3 - 4 times within my field of vision.  During movement, the  lights never changed size (as if the line of sight distance made no effect) nor did the distance of the lights from each other vary.  It maintained the perfect triangular formation during all movement.  I could see no lights or craft between the blue lights; only an intense blackness filled the triangle.  It left my field of vision rapidly...it flew rapidly to the right, and was gone.  During the time I saw this I was driving, northbound, on interstate 95.  So I began at 75 mph and then when I saw it I slowed to approx. 60mph.  It was visable to me for approx. 45 secs.  I dismissed it as nothing.  It is highly unusual for me however, that i cannot forget it or dismiss it.  I remember it more clearly than anything I have ever seen.  I find it unusual that I frequently think of it and look now in the night skies as if I might see something.  I am not a UFO seeker/searcher.  Whatever it was, it had an effect on me that nothing else ever has.<n>

Every one of my neighbors – approximately 200 people –  stood out on the street looking skyward as the disk shaped craft hovered vertically south of my house.  The disk had a intense mirrorlike reflective top half and dense black appearance on the bottom half.  The unidentified craft hovered motionless here for two hours in broad daylight.  I got a excellent look at the disk with 9x binoculars.  Every now and then, a brilliant ruby red light would shoot down to the earth from the craft as if it was aimed a few blocks from me.  During the two hour period, not one car drove past my location, either on Eagle Rock Blvd. or any side street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I could see a small window open in the side of the craft.  The image was distant, but I could see something move inside the disk before the window seamlessly closed.  The craft hovered here until 11am and then began to slowly drift south.  After a few minutes the unidentified disk tilted on its axis, at a forty-five degree angle, and then disappeared into a point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was seen at least ten blocks in every direction which means over 2000 people saw this strange unidentified object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual on December 27, 1997, and again on September 11, 2006.  He sounds to us to be a good witness, and we have requested that he have some of the other witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

Interestingly, we saw another UFO exactly a year later under very similar circumstances, though we believe the second sighting was simply white with no red.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Below cloud deck but still high. Silent, and travelling at great speed (at least 9 times faster than a commercial jet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object at the above time and location, from my back garden whilst having a cigarette. It appeared from the NE above the roof of my home, and headed towards the SW. It was travelling at great speed. I estimated it to be about 9 times faster than a comercial jet. My home was under a flight path from Heathrow, so I constantly saw jets high in the sky travelling over from the west to the east. The object was a dim, slightly glowing orange disk. The center was brighter than the outside edge. It was high, but still below the cloud deck, which was at its usual hight that evening. There were clouds dotted around the sky, and no other objects/jets etc visible at the time. As an amateur astronmer I instantly knew that this was not any kind of natural phenomena. Nor was it was like any kind of aircraft I had ever seen before. This was all the more obvious because of its great speed and silence. When the object had traversed about two thirds of the way across the sky it suddenly changed direction by about 10 degrees. The change of direction was &#39;instant&#39;, showing no curvature or arc during the maneuver. The object was silent for the entire time I saw it which, due to its speed was only about 4 or 5 seconds. The object left no vapour trail of any kind. It disapeared into the SW over houses and out of my sight. The direction was roughly towards the town&#39;s main park...Cassiobury. As it was Christmas eve I had family and friends staying with me. I went into the house and told them all. They advised me to contact the local newspaper, but I didn&#39;t. The reason for me remembering the time and date so well were of course due to the fact that it was December the 24th. Although I have always found this kind of thing interesting I have never seen anything before or since, and I am not the kind of person to &#39;fake&#39; something like this. As an amateur astronmer I a interested in the night sky for many reasons, but that night is one I will never forget, even though I didn&#39;t have my telescope out that time!<n>

Itar-Tass 26-DEC-97 MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Itar-Tass) - The Costa Rican mass media reported on Thursday that unidentified flying objects were spotted the day before in the country&#39;s air space over Golfito district, which is 330 kilometres to the south of San Jose. However, TV cameramen were unable to film them as they did on Monday. On December 22 cameramen from two local television channels filmed at least a dozen &#34;flying saucers&#34; in the sky south of the Costa Rican capital. Before the eyes of hundreds of people, they made zigzag maneuvers for several minutes. Flight controllers of the International Juan Santamaria Airport counted &#34;approximately fifty thousand traces&#34; of their movements. Some car drivers stopped to watch the phenomenon. According to Ufologist Carlos Vilchez, most remarkable is the fact that these UFOs appeared in daytime, that they were seen by hundreds of people and were filmed by TV cameramen. He also expressed the view that an influx of UFOs into the air space of this Central American country could be expected within the next two months. About ten &#34;saucers&#34; were watched by hundreds of people over San Jose exactly one month ago. They flew over the city for several minutes. They were also filmed by TV cameramen. Scientists have not found any explanations for this phenomenon.<n>

We had decided drive pass Flagstaff and take a road that passed through Prescott. The road was filled with curves that we thought would never end. As we approached the bottom of the mountain road I had noticed a white ball or sphere objects that had a trail following behind it. The object was not high enough to be an airplane plus it was bright white with a trail following behind. I knew that the oject was not a falling star because we have seen many of thoughs after living on the plains for 3 years. I had brought this object to my wifes attention so that I could prove to myself that I was not seeing things. My wife did see it and then I proceeded to pull the car over so that we could focus a little bit better on the object. I took my eyes off of the object and focused on pulling the car over, after I had stopped and looked up to locate the object it was gone. I had posted this short story on my web page and I did not come across your page until today and I thought that I would share this with you.<n>

One moonless night, completely cloudless, I saw a huge cigar shaped craft slowly following our power lines in a westerly direction.  It continued without making a sound over my head and out to the sea where I lost it. Being a dark night I could not distinguish a color, but it was definitely metallic.  There are plenty of airports nearby and even a Naval Weapons testing facility, Point Mugu N.S., so we see a lot of airborne objects here, but I tell you that I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. When I was in the Navy the ship that I was stationed on was 561 feet long.  This object easily surpassed this.  It was eery at the lack of sound that it made, none whatsoever.<n>

My younger son, 19 and in college was remarking to other kids to look at what was coming.  He thinks it was strange because it was changing speed and jumping all over the place.  We had two Japanese students with us and they also say it was strange.  We had radio and car running and both acted up for about ten seconds:  radio went dead and car stalled.<n>

The craft was too bright to distinguish any type of surface nor any sound to indicate an engine.  It went south, then turned rapidly to the West and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my aviation experience, it was going 400 knots and 300 feet above the ground.   The turn radius was most likely 20 feet as it changed direction.  And the way it was moving, it appeared to actually been following the lit roads as if a going by Pilotage.<n>

Definitely not fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an engineer.  See myself as a careful, objective observer.  Know planes, seen lots of meteors, fireworks, and the like. This brief phenomenon defied my logic. It was a light green &#34;fireball&#34; lasting about a second.  It showed a short-persistance trail (1/4-1/2 sec). I&#39;m 5-10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  It was south of my observation point, maybe 30 deg. above horizon.  It faded out at about 15-20 deg.  It may have been visible higher in the sky, but my view was restricted. The object seemed to be falling, moving towards the southwest.  It showed a straight, fast trajectory - like a meteor.  Quite bright but not extremely so. It left me with the distinct impression that it was generated within the atmosphere, that it was not a celestial event.  However, because of its motion and the characteristics of its luminance, it was definitely not fireworks.  It seemed like it could have been only a few thousand feet away.  Seeing a meteor is much different than was seeing this. Interesting too, it occurred right where I was looking, but not expecting anything. Would be interested to know if anybody else saw a similar thing it this time. Email me if you could use or provide further information.  Please keep my last name, address, phone, and email address confidential. Thanks.<n>

It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&#39;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&#39;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away. If you would like a more in-depth description or drawing of what I saw let me know by e-mail and I can call or fax your office. I don&#39;t know if that makes any sense or not, or if you have had any other reports from the part of the country. I don&#39;t know what it was I saw but I can say for almost certain that it was not a airplane and not a blimp.<n>

It ha|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02988.html|33|ndxe199712| Summary : A large solid noiseless object, possibly round, with four lights, passed slowly over a residential neighborhood in Marlette, MI.  It had two large steady lights, a yellowish white light trailed by a large red light.  Two small lights strobed simultaneously, one on each side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large golden light was observed in the eastern sky at 23:35 pm EST in Marlette, Michigan.  The witness, a 52 year old professional, was frightened as she knew instantly that this light, coming towards her home, was not an aircraft.  Her son is an ET experiencer that has worked with Michigan MUFON representatives and has had several close-proximity UFO sightings himself.  He was out of state at the time of this sighting.  The woman, opened her doorwall to go onto her patio to look up at the approaching object but became scared and retreated back indoors.  She again opened her door to go out but again retreated indoors.  As this object slowly appoached she could distinguish other lights on it.  She heard absolutely no sound from it through the sighting.  As the object came nearer she could make out two very large steady lights that seemed to be structures lit from inside.  A large yellowish white light trailed closely by a large steady red light.  There were two small blinking lights, one on each edge at the 3 o&#39;clock and 9 o&#39;clock positions (she believes this was a solid round object although she could not actually see the structure).  As it silently drifted over the house at the speed of a small single engine aircraft, which is common in Marlette, she remembered her son&#39;s insistance that she should measure any object with her two fingers at arm&#39;s length.  The object was approximately 2 1/2 to 3 inches at arm&#39;s length.  She ran back in doors frightened as it passed over.  The sighting duration was approximately 2-3 minutes.  It should also be noted that her husband had reported a UFO to Michigan MUFON at the beginning of December.  His sighting was of a bank of approximately seven bright lights that hovered stationary at 35 degrees from his parked car and then vanished.  This occurred in Peck, MI. I am the witness&#39;s son..<n>

I looked at it for about a minute.  It was hovering then it started to move up and down.  I called everyone over and they all looked out the window and agreed with me that they saw it.  We all watched it and it started to move up and down in kind of a oval orbit.  Then it stopped, hovered for a bit, then it started sinking down below the trees.  Later that night I was walking down the hall and saw it again and me and my Mother wathed it for about 2 minutes then it disapeared.<n>

In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as &#34;road tripping&#34; where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL. I was parked facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its’ intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn’t roll a J then you had to break it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out “what ((deleted)) was that” I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said “you didn’t see that?” see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;’ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said “no way man not this time a big f’;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy ((deleted) I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or “eyeball” flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn’t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn’t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless “now do you f*(%ing believe me”  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  “No f*#ing shit” he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn’t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth.

It was a couple weeks before Christmas.  I told her that I would take it to the mailbox for her.  It was night and already dark.  The sky was cloudy and as I was walking out of my doorway I looked up.  These clouds were very high in the sky and in them, or near them, I saw two lights.  The two lights were round and sort of yellowish, they were not very bright, about as bright as a flashlight.  I saw these two objects following each other.  One seemed to be leading the other.  They were moving in small circles around each other, also making figure eights and very semi-circle movements.  They continued this for about 10 seconds before they both shot off into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The room was dark and the window was slightly open. As I turned my head to the left as I was preparing to lay down, I saw a red circle in the shape of a circle and pulsating, about the shape of a dime, located right above the edge of the woodwork on the window on the right.  I just stared and watched it pulsate.  And then the red circle disappeared and re-appeared on the opposite side, on the bottom of the window itself, and I thought to myself, &#34;something is moving from right to left and is probing this room from the outside.&#34;  I heard nothing from the open window, and then realized I had to look behind the window shade to see what/if something was out there.  I looked behind the window shade to the to the right and saw nothing.  The sky was hazy and had thin, long whittish clouds, like the kind you see in the winter and the area was partially lit by street lights.  I then looked to the left behind the window shade and saw a saucer shaped ufo moving up very slowly in a circular, loopy motion, at a 90 degree angle to the left.  I saw only the bottom of the saucer because the top was behind the thin, white cloud. The entire bottom of the ship was pulsating a white light, dim and then bright, dim and bright.   It kept moving in a circular, very slow,  loopy motion and then it cleared the cloud and I saw the whole ship.  It was a silvery color and saucer-shaped and continung to ascend in a circular, loopy manner, at an extreme left angle.  I got nervous and couldn&#39;t look at it any longer.  I ran downstairs to take a look from the first floor of the house, but could&#39;t see that area that I had seen upstairs.  I<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

THIS WAS ONLY FOR A BRIEF TEN SECONDS OR SO, SO INSTANTLY IN MY MIND, I KNEW I HAD TO ABSORB AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE.  I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.  MY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THESE &#34;OBJECTS&#34; ANIMATED SCURRYING AROUND BY THESE CREATURES?...HAD SOMETHING TO ACCOMPLISH.  THEY LOOKED MORE ANIMATED THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN, AND FRANKLY, ANYTHING I WOULD CARE TO SEE AGAIN.  MY KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS AFTERWARD.  IT WAS EXTREMELY SHOCKING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, IN ABSOLTE AWE OF WHAT I WAS SEEING.  WE COULD NOT HOLD THE TELESCOPIC LENS STILL, SO IT WAS ONLY A BRIEF INTERLUDE, ALSO, IT WAS BITTER COLD.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW, AND I SAW IT.  I AM A MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTIONIST, OF SOUND MIND, MY DAUGHTER IS A SURGICAL NURSE AND OF COURSE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT.  MY SON-IN-LAW BEING AN AIR  CONTROLLER, ALSO HAS ASTROLOGY AS HIS HOBBY, AS HE, ALSO, HAS REPORTED SIGHTING AT THE TOWER AND RADIOED TO CANADA IF THEY HAVE ANY UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT COMING INTO AIRPORT FOR A LAND, ONLY TO HAVE THEM! SAY, NO ....WE HAVE NONE.  THE TELESCOPE THE THREE OF US WERE STRUGGLING WITH THAT BELOW ZERO BITTER COLD NIGHT, WAS OF THE BEST SOPHISTICATION.  I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TELL SOMEONE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT THIS, OTHER THAN US THREE.  WE TALK OF IT OFTEN, AND JUST BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER, AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A GO.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTSIDE OF THIS.  A RICH, HIGHLY POLISHED-LOOKING BRASS.  AMAZING.  I THINK EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON IN THIS WORLD, AND I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE BY GOD ABOVE, THAT I SEE THIS.  LIKE I SAID, WHEN WE WENT INSIDE, MY KNEES SHOOK AND MY HANDS TREMBLED FOR A GOOD COUPLE OF HOURS.  IT WAS AMAZING, AND MAGNIFICENT.  I SAID TO MYSELF, HOW GLAD I WAS THAT IT WAS STAYING UP THERE WE WATCHED THIS OBJECT FOR A DOOD HOUR AFTER THAT, COULD NOT GET TELESCOPE TO FOCUS AGAIN, NATURALLY.....THEN, WHEN IT DEPARTED, IT SEEMED THAT THE LIGHTS JUST, SIMPLY, FADED, THEN DIMMEND, THEN NONOTHING.  VERY AWESOME, I HAVE TO ADMIT.  THE LITTLE &#34;BEINGS&#34; I.E., CREATURES, WHAT EVER THEY WERE/ARE, WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE AND MY INSTANT IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY ARENT&#39;T VERY BIG.  THE WINDOWS WERE MORE OF AN OBLONG SHAPE, AS OPPOSSED TO A PERFECT, CHUNKY-LOOKING SQUARE.  I HOPE I HAVE BEEN OF HELP.  THANK YOU FOR THIS WEB SITE.  I FEEL NOW, I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE, BUT IT REALLY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SUDDENLY SAY TO SOMEONE, OH, BY THE WAY, I SAW THIS OBJECT UP IN THE SKY, ETC..........THEY WOULD BE GOING...HO-HUM....YEAH, RIGHT.  T THANK YOU.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect witness has in mind astronomy, not astrology.  PD))<n>

Over approximately a 30 minute time period we always had the object in sight but kept relocating in order to video tape it more clearly.

We saw them from our car, and they hovered over the building in a tight triangular formation.  We tried to explain it away as an airplane, but airplanes don&#39;t hover in midair.  Thus, this 3-lighted-orb triangular formation still defies explanation.  The sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  We saw the same lights a couple of hours later (when we were leaving the church after a concert); these things were still hovering over it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object consisted of a tight triangular formation of 3 white orbs of light. The lights hovered in their formation over a church building as we were approaching it in our car. There were three of us in the car heading to that church for a Christmas concert (12/14/97). Two of the observers (sister and mother) are skeptics who do not believe in the existence of UFOs. I (the third) had seen a UFO many years earlier (July 1984 at camp); I have been open to the possibility of their existence, and can not explain these objects in any earthly sense.<n>

S.O.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend are 14 years old.  We had stayed up late studying for finals.  We went to bed at about 12 and stayed up till about 1 afeter talking about school.  At about 2 we were both awakened suddenly to a strange silence and bright flashing lights out side the window.  We both remember a sence of absolute shock and severe fright, when our covers were suddenly and yet gently drawn from our beds.  At the foot of my bed I saw a   the silouette of a tall thin figure with  large black eyes that had a shiney luster to them, it was as if I could see myself in them,(after this moment I regret to say that the rest is the account of my friend because I cannot remember anything else)......I looked over at Patty and I remember thinking that she was dead because she lie so still.  her body began to rise above the bed into the arms of the figure described above. I also was &#34;carried&#34; into the figures arms, but i did not pass out. Before I knew it, we were in a different place that is defficult to describe because i was surrounded by these figures.  I was laying on a strange surface that was both hot and cold at the same time. It felt as if there was a sheet over my body put there so that i could not move.  The only part of my body that i could move was my eyes.  I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen.<n>

We stopped our vehicle and got out to investigate.  The object was completely silent and had numerous illiuminated windows.  The best way I can describe it is that is looked like a giant flying cruise ship with all of its lights on.  It was completely dark that night and the shape of the object other than the lights was difficult to distinguish.  It was difficult to get a distance on the object as it was so big.  If it was close to us (within say half a mile) I would estimate it was 300 to 400 yards or more in length and maybe 80 to 120 yards or more high.  If it was further away, it was bigger than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying in a northerly direction at a fairly slow speed and not at high elevation.

Suddenly appeared a large, dark object in the sky.  It was impossible to tell what shape it was, It seemed to be flat, and possibly triangular, but that is only a guess.  The two lights were parallel to each other.  They each emitted a white light.  The lights were fixed on a point in front of the object, and as I was looking at it from an angle, it was hard to see on what it was focused. There was no sound at all, and it moved behind the house, where it disappeared.  I live about 20 miles from an airport but this could not have been an areoplane.  Firstly there was no sound at all, and we can hear the sound of planes clearly even when indoors.  Secondly, for the lights to have been the size they were, the areoplane would have to be landing in our backgarden.  No one else saw the object, and as it lasted only a short while I could do nothing but watch.<n>

At first I thought it was a little strange and almost as soon as I finished the thought I noticed a black shape (Triangular) moving through the sky. The sky was clear of clouds that night so that is why I didn&#39;t see this object at first, plus the fact that the object seemed to make no noise. At first I wasn&#39;t really comprehending what I was seeing. As soon as I realized what it was I froze. I wanted to go get one of my other family members but for some reason I was unable to do anything more then to stare at it as it fly slowly overhead at about 700 to 1,000 ft. The  strangest thing about the object was that it was moving so slowly. If I had to guess the object&#39;s speed, I&#39;d say it was moving at about 50 to 75 mph(North to South). It was so black that if I hadn&#39;t noticed the stars dissapearing and reappearing then I probably would of never of noticed it. One more thing. This might sound stupid but the object appeared to have a circular window on the bottom side of it with light coming out of it.I didn&#39;t observe any type of activity in the window(if that was in fact a window and that was the bottom side of the object).Maybe it was a light on the bottom but it didn&#39;t seem to be.Until that night I never really believed if unexplained flying objects and while my knowledge may be limited in the area of terrestial flying objects I am sure that what I witnessed that night was an object that I can&#39;t explained and my thoughts sometimes go back to that night. I also believe that I witnessed see the same object one more time in march of 1998 after I returned to my home in Long Beach, Ca that event was so fast that it lasted less then 10 seconds. I caught a glimpse of it between some buildings when an object passed between the moon and me casting a shadow on me.I looked up because I didn&#39;t hear the helicopter that the police use flying over hear and there it was again.I have never seen the object again. I also cannot explain why I froze in place the first time I saw the object.All my senses were screaming at me to go get someone but I just stood there in utter amazment and shock. Go figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I first noticed this small, circular, metallic object (highly reflective) high in the sky approximately 11:00 position, 45 degrees from my vantage point.  It appeared to be probably over the city of Auburn.   I had just gotten on I-5 from the 405, Southcenter interchange, so I saw the object for about 5 minutes off and on.  It appeared to dissapear and then reappear in the same spot at least three times.  If this was a trick of my eye I cannot say.  The sun would hit it at times and the whole thing would appear to light up brighter than you would expect from a conventional plane.  (I am sending a .jpg image I created as an example..File 12997.jpg) By the time I neared Fife, I lost sight of it.

I called a local radio station after the event and they said that nobody else had reported anything. Below is the other persons version of the incident. We were standing facing East and the objects were a little to the South East of us.My recollection of details may not be 100% accurate at this point. We were watching two amber lights, the top one was stationary and the bottom one was slowly dropping down from the top light. The lights would get very bright and then dim, flicker out and then reappear. The top light finally went out completly. The second light started pulsating and then all of the sudden split into 2. The light that broke away shot straight out to the right and a very high rate of speed meeting up with about 4 or 5 other lights that were barely visable and eventually dimmed from sight. On the end of the video we see a large ball of white light that again gets very bright and dims. We can be heard discussing weather or not it is a plane but eventually decide that we do not know what it was either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 12/8/1997 19:40 (Entered as : 12/08/97 19:40) Reported : 4/1/1998 07:51 Posted : 1/28/1999 Location : E.

I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw.<n>

NO SOUND.  Thought it was a shooting star, went really fast then slowed down.  Weirdest thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband wanted to see the planets lined up and it was the last night for looking, or the second to last night. He thought he saw a shooting star,but then the star slowed down and started coming our way.  Then we thought it was an airplane but it was&#39;nt making any noise.  It flew over our heads, it was bigger then the house when it went over.  no sound what so ever. He got scared because the next minute I&#39;m out there all by myself watching this thing leave.  I ran in and asked how come he left me. He said it was to cold and besides, it must have been an owl. I laugh, because he has finally witnessed something strange that he can&#39;t explain.  I always see stuff.  Finally a witness!Helicopter flew around the next couple of days after the sighting.  Never saw so many helicopters in the area before.  I swear some of them looked like they were looking right in my window.  My husband thinks I&#39;m nuts because I&#39;m always having something like this happening to me.  I was so happy to have him with me that night. I checked the first characteristics down below, but my husband saw the light, then it winked out and from then on it was just a dark object.  No sound, that is the weirdest thing to me,  no sound.<n>

In 1997, I was watching a meteor shower on Clearwater Beach. When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights out over the ocean. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. UNTIL...they started to get closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing. It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, &#34;this is definately a ufo&#34;. After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier. The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me. I was not the least bit worried for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it&#39;s surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the water and the sky&#39;s reflection on the craft. It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can&#39;t say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me. This introduction must have taken some time. My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. There were Clearwater Police Officers at the pier who had also seen the object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog. So we ended the chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though I wanted to try to find it still. I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts. Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City we have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs? Buzzing back and forth. I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are. This type of thing, people do not want to talk about. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don&#39;t believe you. So I hope to know more as to what they are and why they are here, and what they want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw red and green lights coming across Birch Run Rd toward my house through the trees. I watched as the lights got closer to me from the front door.  I stepped outside and as the craft went over my house I heard a quiet throttle of a engine.  The craft was low and just sort of gliding.  It came form the Northeast sky and continued moving North toward Saginaw MI.  I talked to a neighbor and was told that during a party in late October several witnesses saw the very same thing.   It hovered over the party moving in circles and then hovering.  The craft was V-shaped in front with 2 red lights and 1 green light in front of it.  The lights were very mezmerizing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was v-shaped in front.  Dark in color.  Round in back.   It had 3 lights on it.  2 red and 1 green in front.   The back had no visible lights.  It just went over my house.  It was not very high.  It appeared to be gliding.   I could hear a faint throttle of an engine.  I could not hear any sound until it was over me.  I live in a rural area and I have alot of weeping willow trees in my yard outside my door.  I had been sleeping.  I woke up at 8:25 PM and went to the door to put my dog out.  When I saw the lights coming toward my house I just stood in the doorway to watch and see what it was.   I have never seen anything like that in my life.   I am 49 years old.   It was so weird.  I have been watching the skies ever since and I have seen a very bright light in the sky for months.   It looks like a very bright star.  It goes high and the light gets faint and then it comes low and the light gets very brilght again.    I have seen it just zoom off.   Sometime I don&#39;t see it for a couple of weeks and then it comes back again.   I went to Flint, MI one night and watched it all the way there (about 30 Min from my home).   As I sat in the Sams Parking Lot on Corunna Rd.  I could see activity coming from the light.   I saw a red lights come from it.  The light split into 2 red light and zoomed across the sky toward the other side of Flint.<n>

In short, I was driving southbound on the Garden State Parkway just south of Paramus one night near midnight in December.  I don&#39;t recall the year, but it had to be 1997, 1998 or 1999, as I was living in the area during that time.  In the eastern sky, directly over Manhattan, I saw a HUGE (like the size of the moon in the night sky), ghostly, smokey white fireball, that looked much like a comet (tail and all), crashing down from above.  It looked as if it was going to crash in the ocean just east of New York City.  It took a few minutes for it to make its way down from the skies above NYC and fall behind it.  I thought I was seeing things, but I noticed drivers and riders in cars around me on the parkway were pointing at it and watching it with the same amazement (and concern) I had.  As it dipped behind NYC, I thought surely this was the end of the world and there would be  blinding flash followed soon by an explosion, concussion wave or tidal wave, etc., but nothing happened.  I scanned the radio, but there was no mention of it.  I checked the TV news shows the next day, and again - nada.  Still, it was a wonderful thing to see, and thankfully with no negative consequences.  Perhaps it was a large metor skimming the upper atmosphere.

The temperature outside was 25 below 0, the wind was coming out of the west at 17 m.p.h. Suddenly the light just went out, and I saw nothing more of the object.

At a distance I assumed it was an airplane on the flight path to the international airport in the north-west. When it got close, only five lights were visible in an enormous triangular configuration.  Three lights were large, bright white, unblinking, and made a smaller triangle at the forward point of the object, the other two lights were dim, white, unblinking, and at the other two corners of the larger triangle.  It was 3 or 4 times the size of a passenger jet, and under 2000 feet, but no engine noise could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday, December 1, 1997 	At about 9:45PM tonight I was driving southward on the Monterey Highway when I noticed what was either an experimental air craft or else I’ve had a sighting of one of the new triangular ufos.  I initially thought I was observing the bright landing lights of a couple of incoming commercial jet liners, since they were in the usual flight path for San Jose International Airport from the southeast toward the northwest. 	However, when I was stopped at the signal near the Edenvale shopping center on the approach to the Blossom Hill underpass, I was able to clearly see something which was not a plane with which I am familiar.  I wondered if it might have been some kind of stealth plane, because I could not make out the body of the plane against the night sky.  All I could see was five lights. 	Three lights were very bright, they were larger than normal running lights, and they were arranged in a tight equilateral triangle on the bottom of what I thought may be a plane’s fuselage (the triangle was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length).  But, if it is a conventional or experimental airplane, the fuselage is two or three times as wide as most commercial jets.  There were also two small white lights placed where I imagined the wingtips were located aft of the triangle, (from the triangle to a “wingtip” was about the span of a 5 inch ruler held at arms length, or it was between 11 and 12 inches from tip to tip) but once again, they indicated a much wider wing span than is typical. 	Looking for a place to park and observe the craft, I rolled down the window and turned off the radio to see if I could hear the engine, but I could not.  It may have been too high, although its unusually large size indicated it was low enough to hear (perhaps a couple thousand feet above the highway).  If it was too high to hear, then its dimensions had to be too enormous to contemplate. 	I proceeded onto the cloverleaf and emerged slowly onto the eastbound side of Blossom Hill so I could look toward the craft’s flight path, but it was long gone.  Never-the-less, off in the distance, on the same path were some large red lights which I assumed were probably the tail lights of the same air craft, primarily because they also were much larger than the running lights of most planes. 	 	I also watched other planes to make a comparison.  As expected, I was able to clearly see the bodies of the other planes.  I also found that their lights were not configured like those of this large craft, nor were the lights as bright, or as large.  Furthermore, there were the usual flashing lights on the airplanes, but all the lights of the other craft were steady and unblinking.<n>

I was standing outside in my driveway when I saw them coming from the Monterey Bay/ocean area and heading in a northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was the same craft reported on your site seen in San Jose that night.  It came from the southeast (Monterey Bay) and was heading northwest.  I also thought it was a plane going to the San Jose or SFO Airport until it flew over me. At that point I noticed it was going too slow to be an airplane, although my friend said &#34;wow a stealth bomber!&#34;. There was no sound, it was very low, very large and moved slowly over us, over my house toward the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once over the mountains it would be in the San Jose area. There were very large unblinking lights on each tip that showed the shape of the craft as it flew overhead as a triangle. I wish I spent more time observing it but since my friend said &#34;stealth bomber&#34; that&#39;s what I thought it was.  It was only later I realized a stealth bomber would probably be going much faster, be flying much higher, and make noise.  As I noticed, the lights were so bright that they clearly revealed the shape as triangular. Time on this report is approximate.<n>

Now that was similar to what I saw on this day except they appeared to be reentering. In San Francisco driving south on Highway 101 before Silver Street, I saw in the upper atmosphere at about 11 o&#39;clock and to the southeast two objects. One was circular, probably a sphere, and the other was an elongated rectangle, probably a cylinder, like a rocket body.  I got several glimpses between watching the traffic. I was surprised it was not on the news because it was so obvious. The objects were descending, not much at first but it was easy to tell that the descent was like a parabolic curve because the last I saw them the attitude was almost directly down and they had moved from 11 o&#39;clock in the sky to about 9:30. The objects had cone-like vapor trails. The cylinder was at an oblique angle to the direction of travel and to the cone trail.  Their final direction was SE sort of towards Mt. Hamilton but much further away I think. The entire incident was less than 30 seconds probably about 10 to 15 seconds. By the time I got to the next offramp they were gone. The size of the cylinder and cone-trail was about a little bigger than a full moon, maybe larger as it descended. The sphere&#39;s cone trail was roughly about ¼ as big as the cylinder&#39;s cone trail. It was hard to see the sphere and cylinder, sort of like a very distant, high altitude jet. Together they occupied a section of sky about 4 to 8 moons across. They traveled pretty much together even though their relation to each may have changed some.  They were not attached, but probably were attached at one time. It looked like a reentering rocket and satellite that would crash somewhere. If needed I may be able to give a good date and line up from the freeway to some hills and the objects.<n>

I just stared at this circle and then all of a sudden it disappeared and then reappeared on the lower left corner of the shade of the window below.  The red circle then disappeared and I got up and looked behind the shade of this window and looked starting from the right to the left.  I saw nothing until I looked all the way to the left and what I saw was a circular object pulsating a white light and then a dimmer white light on the complete lower botton part of the object. It was traveling upward on an angle in a slow, loopy motion towards the north.  I couldn&#39;t at first see the top of this object because it was cold outside and the sky contained white, filmy, low clouds.  It rose above the clouds very slowly in the same loopy, circular motion on an angle and it was then that the top of the object appeared which was oval and silver in color and it contined to pulsate white and then a dimmer shade of white across the complete bottom of the object.  It was passing in the vicinity of Ogden Avenue which is well lighted and so it was easy to see the object.  My bedroom was on the second floor and it gave me a clear view.  I kept staring and then got so scared I couldn&#39;t look any longer and ran downstairs to tell me husband, who had headphones on and was reading.  By the time I told him, the object could not been seen from the first floor or the second floor of our home.  I know it was not aircraft from this planet because of the extreme slow, circular, at an extreme angle ascent it made, not to mention the saucer shape and that pulsating light.  I cannot explain the two red laser like lights on my bedroom wall and window shade which did come through the wall and window..it was no reflection of any kind and! definit ely pulsating in the center.  That is my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
