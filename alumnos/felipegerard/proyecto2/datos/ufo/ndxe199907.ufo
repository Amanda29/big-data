It became larger and flared,then back to former size. Disappeared behind clouds. then reduced to former size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are clinical psychologists.  We were sitting on our second-floor deck watching the lightening from distant storms in the east.  We noticed that the sky was clear for the first time in a couple of weeks to the west and were looking at the stars. As we were looking at the big dipper, we noticed a star-like light which moved very fast across the night sky. We realized there were no flashing lights as a plane or helicopter would have. It was traveling northwest to southeast. As it approached our location just before it went directly overhead, it flared and appeared larger with almost a luminescent light purple or blue aura around it. It almost looked like a starburst (light eminating from it in beams) when it brightened,and within the light I could see a darker shape. It then diminished to former size as it continued toward the southeast. We grabbed our binoculars and watched it as it streaked across the sky. It was not reflecting light, it had its own bright, white light. It didn&#39;t have a tail. It was definitely brighter than the stars it passed and seemed to be quite high. We followed it until it went behind clouds and disappeared.  After it disappeared from view, we noticed a plane flying from the northeast to the southwest.  It provided a nice comparison, in that it was much smaller and had flashing lights.<n>
7/31/99 07:05|Miami Beach|FL|Oval|15 minutes|3 grey object, ovale shape, pulsating|12/20/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15449.html|3|ndxe199907| 3 grey object, ovale shape, pulsating<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)), I am a 27 years old ((deleted)) salesman from France and I was in Miami for business. I would like to add that i&#39;ve got valuable knowledge when it comes to aircrafts and i am involved in astronomy as an amateur for asteroids detection. I remember that clear morning on the beach around 20th street, my friends and I  were swimming in the warm water of the Atlantic ocean. It must have been 7:00 (sun was already up) when I noticed 2 objets south of us and parallel to the beach. They were flying in  military formation so I told my friend that this could be 2 helicopters flying towards us from south to north. About 5 minutes later I looked again and told my friend that they wey flying super slow at a low altitude( less than 3.000 feet compared to the hotels) And that&#39;s when I noticed that they weren&#39;t helicopters but grey and ovale objects. That&#39;s when I started to get excited and looked at my watch, it was 7:05 am. A few moments later I told my other friends who were in the Ocean but they said it was some birds and kept on playing in the water. My friend and I kept on sterring at the objets as they were getting closer. Let&#39;s say it took them almost 10 minutes to go from the southern tip of South Beach to approximatively 10th street. At the closest point we saw them they were still at the same altitude and we could almost see a pulse or a vibration from left to right and back and up. (Please excuse my English) We saw no strobe lights or id number. At that point my eyes started to be tired from sterring and I had to look somewhere else for a few seconds. Then 7:10, both objets caught up altitude  heading east toward the horizon and stopped in mid-air (I couldn&#39;t say how high) I was pretty hard to see them but I used a boat that was right below to find them when my eyes would loose them. That&#39;s when one of my friends said that he could see a third one at a higher altitude coming from the south. This third object stopped as well but at a higher altitude. They kept steady for 5 minutes. Then at 7:15, they disappeared in one snap, leaving no sound, no trail. Since that day, I think about it everyday (almost) and I know i wasn&#39;t the only one to see it. I believe in God and I am looking for the truth. ((name deleted))<n>

IT CAME DOWN THE ROAD EAST TO WEST VERY SLOWLY NEAR TO THE GROUND.  IT HAD 7 LARGE LIGHTS 4 BELOW, AND 3 ABOVE.  THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE WITH THIN RAYS RADIATING ALL AROUND.  THEY WERE VERY BRIGHT BUT ONLY CASTE A BLUE REFLECTION ON THE TREES AND ROAD.  I STOOD IN THE ROAD AS IT CAME TOWARDS ME.  IT STOPPED SOME 200 FEET DISTANT AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS.  THERE WAS NO SOUND.  I STUDIED THE OBJECT FOR SOME 10 OR 15 MINUTES AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE TOWARDS IT SLOWLY.  AS I APPROACHED TO WITHIN 50 FEET IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY BACKWARDS UNTIL IT WAS IN LINE WITH MY NEIGHBORS DRIVEWAY THAT CUT A SWATH IN THE PINETREES.  AS I WAS APPROACHING CLOSER IT SUDDENLY SHOT SIDEWAYS UP THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE SKY AT INCREDIBLE SPEED.  THE ONLY SOUND WAS A PPPPHHHTTTT!!!!  AS IT SHOT AWAY.  I FELT NO BACKDRAFT OR MOVEMENT IN THE AIR.    IT HAD JUST QUIT RAINING THAT EVENING AND I TOOK A FLASHLIGHT AND CHECKED THE ROAD FOR TRACKS--THERE WERE NONE.  ONLY ROCKS HAD SLID FROM THE CENTER OF THE ROAD TO THE SIDES IN THE WET GRAVEL.  I WENT HOME.  THE NEXT MORINING I FOUND A DEAD SKUNK BY THE ROAD WITH THE HAIR STRANDS CORRECTLY IN PLACE BUT NO BODY, SKIN, OR BONES.  THERE WAS A WET SPOT SURROUNDING THE REMAINS.   I TOOK A PHOTO OF THIS PHENOMENON.  A FEW NIGHTS LATER AT 3:00 I AWOKE TO A BEATIFUL LIGHT WITH PINK AND BLUE SWIRLS IN IT.  I FOUND I HAD A TRIANGULAR BURN ON MY LEFT WRIST THAT LASTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AS A BURN AND IS STILL ON MY ARM TODAY.  SOMETIMES IT GROWS FROM ONE CENTIMETER TO OVER AN INCH AS A PINK RASH.  THERE ARE 3 POINTS AT THE CORNERS.  THERE WERE SEVERAL RELATED EXPERIENCES THAT SUMMER WITH WITNESSES INCLUDING MY OWN SON.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  I WISH TO ADD MY; PUZZLEMENT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE OR NO INTEREST IN MY STORY WHICH I FEEL WAS QUITE SINGULAR--PLUS THE FACT THAT I AM AN INTERNATIONAL ARTIST WHO HAD A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME TO VISUALLY RECORD THE SIGHTING.  I HAVE PAINTED A PHOTOGRAPHIC LIKENESS OF THE CRAFT WHICH NO ONE SEEMS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT.  FURTHERMORE, I SEEK NO PERSONAL RECOGNITION IN THIS CASE AND AM QUITE CONTENT TO REMAIN INCOGNITO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Off to my left, in the distance I saw what appeared at first to be a flock of birds.  Soon it was obvious they were air vehicles; about six to eight in total.  They appeared to somewhat chevron shaped, black, fixed wing aircraft about four feet wing tip to wing tip and about one to two hundred feet off the ground.  They were traveling horizontal to the ground in a north north easterly direction.  A few things were very extraordinary.  There was no sign of any propulsion system nor bulges in the thin depth of the vehicle to accommodate a propulsion system.  But, by far the most amazing thing was that two of the vehicles were unstable.  One was wobbling, but the other was tumbling completely head over heels yet neither was falling behind the other vehicles which were very stable flying straight as an arrow.  I estimate their speed at about 200 MPH.  They passed almost directly over my car so I lost s! ight of them, but a notable thing happened.  The car rocked very noticeably in the direction of the aircraft travel, although not so violently that losing control of the car was an issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I watched it for 30 minutes before going to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to smoke a ciggarette at about 2:15 am and saw a bright light through the trees in my yard.  It was at about 35 to 40 degrees in the sky, and was twinkling brightly.  Soon it moved so that I could not see it, so I changed positions and there it was.  It moved again and again, but only slightly, and with no orderly direction.  It was emitting very bright white lights and flashing colors now and then, with no order or pattern.  The main colors were red, and yellow, with some aqua, and twice a purple blue color.  I moved to my neighbor&#39;s yard to watch it without the trees in the way, and it hovered for the whole 30 minutes I watched, with some movement.  A Plane approached once but then turned off, and the object stayed where it was.  I showed my husband the place where I had seen it, and he guessed it must have been about 2 miles high.  It was MUCH brighter than the stars, but not close enough that I could make out a shape, but the lights it gave off suggested a sphere shape.  I don&#39;t know for sure what it was, but I have no better guess than a space craft.  Although I could hear the plane that approached, I heard no sound from this object, however it could have been too far away for me to hear.  It appeared to be hovering over the Redmond Valley.<n>

I was driving over a brigde and then we saw it.  It was a brilliant shiny ball of light. I&#39;d say it was half mile to a mile away from us, and was probably a coupple hundred feet in the air above the trees. It moved super fast down, then up, then zig zaged, and then went down again and then it completely vanished.  It was like nothing i&#39;ve seen before.<n>

It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn’t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that’s about it.  It was just recently that I saw a show on flying triangle ufos and was shocked that the footage that was shown on that show was the same thing I had seen over the lake years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When I noticed a round object off the 5:30 mark of the moon about 6 to 8 inches off of the moon at arms length, The moon was full and about 25&#39; off the horizon It was about 9:33 pm .The object had two lights one on bottom one on top that stayed the same color three lights between the two lights that did not change color,were changing color from a yellowish-orange to redish-yellow to a oqua marine blue ,all three lights in the middle were changing color in unison.the duration of the sighting was about 3.5 to 4 min durring this time we could see airplanes comming and going from pane field and sea-tac,and we could tell the difference between the air trafic and this object THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE ,the object at arms length was about the size of my thumb nail.durring the sighting another object that was a small white light was approching the large round object slowly (I assumend it to be a military jet).we went to my house about a 1.5 minute journey and grab a pair of Binocculars when we got back to the same location the object was no where to be seen and that made us realize that it was not a plane as we could still see the same planes that were around at the time of the sighting lower or higher in the sky.

7/28/99 21:30|Dayton|OH|Other|2 hours +|Summer of '99 Nostrodamus prophecy sighting near WPAFB|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49700.html|15|ndxe199907| Summer of &#39;99 Nostrodamus prophecy sighting near WPAFB<n> <n><n> <n><n> To all concerned citizens, if you could help me with this problem it would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just came home from work, fixed a meal and ate, when I decided to sit outside and enjoy the night air in my backyard. I was out there for about 30-45 minutes after sunset when the clouds started coming in, the weather called for rain, so as I was watching some of the forcasted clouds come in, I peered up and to my amazement I caught what I beleived to be a ship hiding in concealment. So, I was transfixed on it as it passed slowly by there was no sound coming from this ship at all. Then it occured to me that Nostrodamuses claim was wrong it wasn&#39;t meteors he saw but alien spacecraft.To my greatest suprise I would get to see two of the worlds greatest theories come to pass. As I watched as it passed overhead, another came by then another, then another, as I was calculating where they were going. I figured it was WPAFB. Then they stopped. The ship overhead was a triangle in shape with three large viewing windows from my observation,ther was also two figures in the windows which seemed to be looking directly towards me, so I just politely waved greeting them to Dayton. Then all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a bluish type of light, like that on Star Trek&#39;s transporter system. Well to my suprise it seemed like there were little children running around my yard playing. I couldn&#39;t see them physically because they had on something that made them seem to be invisible. Like that suit the predator wore when he was fighting Arnold S. then as i am looking around I feel a little one lean on my leg and seem to be looking right into my face, and another start playing in my hair, like they have never seen a black guy before. It was just amazing that there kids was just as curious as mine are. So I peer back up and smile &amp; laugh that the two are still there in the window are still looking down on us. It must have been at least 20 or more minutes they stayed in my yard playing. The ships started moving out, I would guess that WPAFB had difficulty greeting our new friends and unloading there belongings. I would guess this ship that stopped over my head was a passenger vehicle, because there was more vehicles to come. The next was box shaped,like a transporter. The one after that had my magneto pulse drive system underneath. I counted at least ten ships, but the last two gave me goose bumps you could tell these were not peace loving ships these were built for fighting. they were larger than the rest with deep grooves and edges, and just looked terrorfying. WPAFB was busy that night,lol. I thank the lord for letting me be a part of this. But I would like to see the proof that I am not Haluccinating. If you could get the weather pictures it might be able to prove it. Nostradamus, and I werent seeing things, please help us prove this. Sigthing July 27th,1999 time around 9:30pm-11:45 or so coming from the west, heading towards WPAFB. Let the truth be told. thank-you very much for listening to my sighting of some ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My husband was outside at 04:15 taking pictures of the partial lunar eclipse when he excitedly called for me stating that he was seeing a UFO.  I rushed out to the open window and looked south toward the moon to where he indicated he saw the object. My husband handed me the binoculars. To the right of the moon I could detect a faint, illuminated light grey object in the shape of a dog bone, about half the diameter of the moon. The two ends were easier to see, but I could see a connecting center. I observed it traveling very slowly and by this time it was about &#34;2:00&#34; by the moon.  There were no &#34;indicator&#34; lights on it (such as on a plane, and there was no sound).  As it continued heading right, and away from the moon, it was less visible, until it competely disappeared from my sight.<n>

7/27/99 22:00|The Colony/Lewisville Lake (North of Dallas)|TX|Oval|30 seconds|Extraordinary Event! Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft!|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08468.html|21|ndxe199907| Extraordinary Event! Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9pm myself and a friend went outside on the lawn to watch the beautiful full moon and stars. At about 9:20 pm, I spotted in my binoculars a fast moving oval shaped gold tinged light moving from northwest to the southeast. Simultaneously, my friend saw another light passing directly overhead heading north. We then saw another one at 9:35 pm passing overhead from south to north. This one drifted slowly overhead in a wavy snake-like pattern at about 20,000 feet. As an airliner approached its path -- as it moved toward the southwest, the light suddenly darted over to it and remained over it for a few seconds then hovered a couple of seconds and returned to its original path. It began zigzagging widely until it disappeared. I saw another light a little before 10:00 pm moving to the southeast. All appeared to be travelling at the same altitude. Then at about 10 pm, my friend said, &#34;Look at that!&#34; and pointed to the south of the house which overlooks the lake. Coming across the sky at about 150 feet up and 400 yards away was an oval shaped brightly lit object with a gold tinge spewing out a luminous contrail (which became approximately 50 feet in width). This object was seen by multiple witnesses -- neighbors were shouting out -- &#34;Would you look at that!&#34; and &#34;That&#39;s not ours!&#34; to the northeast and southwest of us. The object and its illuminated contrail (which looked exactly like the persistent contrails laid in the skies during the day) were distinctly horizontal moving from west to east at about 180 mph for 1.5 miles. The object looked about 20 feet across and flew steadily over the rooftops until it disappeared -- &#34;went out&#34; 30 seconds later over the city. The craft seemed to be fully lit from the inside -- or glowing smooth in appearance-- and the contrail reflected the moon on top but was self-illuminated with a slight gold and orange tinge. It stayed luminous and dissipated 30 seconds after the craft disappeared.We were in total wonderment...So close and not a sound! Was it ours? Why over a town? Why so many? What was in the contrail?  Incredible but real!!  I reported to your center on 1/10/98 a light zigzagging horizontally across the western sky with a large contrail -- perhaps this is a similar occurrence close up! I have had multiple sightings of black helicopters flying a similar path near the house since that report...<n>

My wife was driving the car, I was sitting in the front seat.  The moon was full and I glanced up to look at it.  I saw two lights, one approaching approximately from the north, one from straight up, moving on a path towards each other.  There were no flashing lights as might be seen on a commercial aircraft. They seemed to be a good distance away.  However, they were moving about as fast as you might see a commercial jet moving overhead.  They looked like white lights, small, punctate.  I thought at first that they might be commercial airliners, but again, there were no flashing lights visible.  Given the apparent distance, they were moving too fast for commercial airliners.  The two dots crossed paths at about the same time that we turned the corner.  I told my wife but she couldn&#39;t look up to see until it was too late.  We went around the block to see if they were still visible.  They were not, but I did see a commercial airliner moving in a northerly direction.  It had flashing lights.<n>

Palm Springs, Grenfell Avenue. Flying South. Got back to our appartment looking at a meteorite shower in the southern sky. A Triangular shaped object moved slowly from North to South. At first we presumed it was flying high because of the silence, but that would have made the size of the object huge. We agreed that it was flying a few thousand feet up MAX. The underside lighting was very, very subtle not at all what I would imagine. They were rectangular, very dim ,orange, arranged in pairs in a triangular formation, if we had not been looking for meteorites we would not have noticed it. We watched it for about 10 seconds before it turned very slowly in an Eastern direction and dissapeared. It must have passed over Palm Springs Airport...did anybody else witness this?<n>

Neighbors whom saw are nonbelievers in UFOs or extraterrestial life because of relegious beliefs, but both now believe they saw object with shape and manuevers of nothing of known technology.

I was looking out of the drivers side window as my friend kept talking.  I was looking out west.  Midway airport was just south east of us, so planes come in to land.  There was a tree a couple of blocks down and I thought it was just a black plastic garbage back attached to the tree blowing in the wind or something.  It was a black shiny object.  It started to drift away from the tree (to the left) very slowly.  That&#39;s when I noticed it was really far away, not part of the tree or a plastic bag.  It was drifting in a perfect straight line to the left looking like this shape:  \  My friend saw me staring out there, and just as he looked at it, it lit up.  The lights seems to be in a spinning motion.  The object moved down a little bit, then all of a sudden is &#34;zig-zagged&#34; VERY quickly and zoomed behind the tree out of sight.  It had to have been many miles away because it was no where near the actual tree, just out of view.  My friend and I got out of the car and were trying to come up with an explaination.  Minutes later, 5-6 aircraft went in towards the area where the object had &#34;disappeared&#34; behind the tree out of our view (I see aircraft and helicopters both FAR away and upclose since I live next to the airport!).  I had never seen anything like it and I am very skeptical of UFO sightings.  This was my first.  I was thinking that maybe it was a military test or something.  I could hardly sleep last night thinking about it.  The way the lights pulsed together making a rotation effect....and the way it was just drifting so slow and then moved VERY fast from such a great distance.  I thought I was crazy, but my friend explained it to the me same way I saw it....rotating lights....zig-zag and GONE at a high rate of speed.<n>

Also, the object turned very sharply southeast after a minute and disappeared.<n>

Not like a saucer, which is a flat circle. It was like a ball you would bounce, perfectly round. It was about the size of a big tractor. It didn&#39;t go fast at all. It looked to me, like it went a bit faster than a blimp. Then, out of no where, it broke apart, in formation. Like those jets at airshows do. Like it was showing off or something. The things that broke off looked the exact same as it did when it was whole. Except smaller, and there was a lot more. They went a little faster though. Then about a minute later, it molded back together, so it was big again. After that it started going higher and higher, and it eventually disappeared. And the exact same thing happened a year before around the same time of day, in the same month of summer. Except only one was here the first time. And both times it was over my house. We called the local weather center to see if they had scheduled any weather balloons to be set off, and they hadn&#39;t. Both times. Also, both times there were absolutely no lights on it that we could see.<n>

I was facing East repairing the roof from the top of a ladder. It passed south west to south east in a perfectly staight line. It was unusual because it seamed to appear out of thin air. I remember that got my attention. I decided to study it and not take my eyes off. As it passed over I noticed the sun was reflecting off the surface of the object, without that sun being at that angle at that time of day it would have reflected its surroundings and dissapeared as it did a few minues later when my viewing angle changed from the proximity of the sun and the craft. I could almost be certian that there would be very few different angles that you would see the object. The reflective qualities alloud me to observe what was imediately on the other side of the craft. I determined that this quality of stealth reflection could only be achieved if the craft was a perfect sphere. The extra light from the sun gave shape to the object. The farther it moved from my position the more faded the suns reflection became, until it was gone, but I still new it had to be there. That was really frustrating. I new it was close enough that I should still be able to see it. It wasn&#39;t like a plane that you see how far you can watch it for. It wasn&#39;t even close to being that far away. I also remember being extemely exited a few months later when I saw some clear close up footage on TV from mexico (A Sphere) thats all I needed to see to know I&#39;m not nuts.

It turned out to be nothing. As I was heading back inside to go to bed, I heard a plane overhead, and as usual for me, I looked up.  I watched the plane for a few seconds, then noticed something moving within my view.  I watched what I thought was a shooting star.  It was moving perpendicular to the direction the plane was moving (the plane was moving S/SW toward the Northern Kentucky / Greater Cincinnati Airport; the &#34;shooting star was moving East).  Then when the plane was just about out of my line of sight, the object burst into a huge flash of light, then dimmed about 10 seconds later.  by this time I knew it wasn&#39;t a shooting star because it was moving incredibly slow.  When the flash died down, instead of fading out completely, it made a 90 degree turn, to the same direction the plane was headed.  For the next 8 or so minutes it remained the size of a regular (stationary) star in the sky, then it slowly faded away. I know this sounds very strange, and I still have a hard time believing it myself.  I got less than 2 hours of sleep that night because I was up thinking about what I saw.   The next day at work, I called two local radio stations to find out if anything unusual in the sky had been reported the night before.  Both said that there hadn&#39;t. Then I called a local tv news station and asked the same question.  they said no too.  (i have witnesses to these calls). I hope that this story is believed by who ever reads it, because it is true. Thank You<n>

I applied the brakes and came to a stop afraid of the sonic boom from the craft. I have worked in the aircraft, airport industry for 17 years. I have hours of experance watching aircraft at night. This was like no siloett I have ever seen and it was not a current stelth ac.It had a diamond shaped body with a sharp long nose. As it passed it occured to be that it had no standard ac running lights Just several red glowing ports on the sides. It was about a quarter to half mile in front of us and never at any point made any noise. This is very flat land and a still dark night it is impossible to not hear engine noise(jet or piston). Now this is where it got very strange. As it passed to the left at about a 45 degree angle it turned right about 45 deg so it was almost going away from us, as it turned it had to very large yellow light side by side on its rear.They were much to large for standard size jet engines. To put in in perspective if you were looking at the rear of an f14 tomcat the light would be about 16 feet across each about 5 feet apart. After about 5 seconds it just dissipeared I mean poof it was gone. After much dicussion we both decided we had just see a UFO. Also going back a week later there are no valleys or mountins for it to get behind except due south of our location. We could also see the lights of the city of Pecos behind the craft. There is just no place it could go. Anyway thats it and I would be glad to speak with someone on this subject.<n>

We saw 4 huge, (I mean Enormous) round lights above the city that we had never seen before.  Ruled out them being lights from the Power Plant or any building.  They were orangish and formed a curved line.  They seemed to have some sort of exhaust or smoke discharge below them.  They seemed to hover over the central part of the city.  Some of the lights seemed to disappear at times, but it was hard to tell because they would go behind objects.  (meaning while we were driving, they would be out of sight for brief periods of time)  They also seemed to be raising up and down.  They then disappeared as fast as we notced them.  The duration of all of this was about 15 minutes.  Don&#39;t know what it was, but can&#39;t explain it either.  Observers are young  professionals.<n>

Size=3X larger than the evening star I have observed the last few weeks. Location (relative to the evening star)=8 o&amp;#8217;clock. I was driving west and the evening star was almost directly in front of me at 1 o&amp;#8217;clock. The object also appeared to be between my location (Moses Lake) and the Cascade Mountains. Appearance=Clearly spherical, not self-illuminated though much brighter than the evening star. Actions=Stationary, though the color/shadow changes indicated it was possibly rotating. Setting=Evening, the sun was going down but not yet behind the mountains.  It was still clearly daylight.  In the west was the evening star I have become accustomed to at about 1 o&amp;#8217;clock.  A mountain range was in the background to the west.  The sun was to my right about 20-40 degrees. Description=I had noticed a bright evening star in early July and concluded it was probably Mars so I was in the habit of observing the stars when I was out each evening. On July 25, as I was driving home through the state of WA I noticed what I thought was a second bright star in the West while I approached the Moses Lake area. I noticed that this new &#34;star&#34; was larger (3X) than the star I had concluded was Mars and instead of being of uniform luminescence it changed appearance as though I were seeing shadows and other visual effects as objects shift in position and the sun reflects from them differently. I did not think much of this since I have basically considered the odds of my seeing a UFO as approaching 7 sigma however I noticed that as my car came up out of the Moses lake area (the highway is somewhat lower as you pass through the city) the object was completely gone. So, in a matter of 30 - 60 seconds the object disappeared.  Clearly, if this were a star (especially considering how bright it was) this would not be the case. It was also clearly spherical which would largely eliminate conventional craft. I was able to observe the object for only a couple minutes before I dropped down into Moses Lake. Observer=33 year old male software test engineer for Microsoft Corp.  No previous experiences of this nature. You may call, email, etc if you desire more info.<n>

Here it goes: It was the summer of 99. We were on a remote rural area in eastern Venezuela. It was about one month after we arrived in the area and on a very clear and moonless night. While my friends stayed inside the house having dinner I came out to get something out of the truck, it was very dark and I had to use a flashlight to go outside. While I walked to the truck I noticed that there was a light coming from above, I immediately looked up and saw a round shape object about 200ft wide hovering right on top of the house. It made no sound. I could tell that is was circular because it was covering the stars that were very visible that night. It had a reddish light in the meddle. I immediately called my friends out and we all watched amazed at the craft. One of the girls in the group turned a flash light on and started to make signals to toward the UFO while some others panicked and ran inside, about 10 minutes later the light in the middle became a beam of light that landed right on top of the house, and then a human shaped being floated up and down the beam and seemed to be looking at us, it was impossible to see any details like mouth, nose, etc. because the light was engulfing it, it was also impossible to tell what color it was (it looked dark gray).  After a few minutes it slowly left. The next day we drove in the direction where we thought it had gone and we took a few people from the nearby town so they could guide us trough the very rough terrain. We finally found a large round area where all the grass had died, it wasn&#39;t burned, and it was just flat on the ground and dead.<n>

The light grey color was matte, with no gloss, glow, shine or flashing.  The object was flying straight and true with no wiggling, wavering, shaking, etc. at about 65 mph when first seen.  It appeared to have heat waves coming off the front and sides of it.  It did not appear to be spinning.  Because of my viewing angle at different times I could easily see the back, bottom, left and right sides of the object.  If it had a noise I did not hear it.  On Sunday, July 25, 1999 at 11:35 a.m. I was driving west on Highway D about 1 mile west of Honey Creek, Walworth County, SE Wisconsin, and I saw the object to the NW and it was about 35 yd from the highway, it was about 50 ft above the ground, about 50 to 60 yds distance from me.  Its flight path followed the road I was driving.  When I drove faster to get closer to it, it flew faster.  I accelerated to 75 mph, then 80 mph to keep it in sight and it was outpacing me.  After about 50 seconds of following it, it made a left turn (heading south) to cross the road in front of me.  At that point I was a little closer and I saw its profile and it looked the same in appearance.  When it reached the south side of the road it made a right turn and headed west along the road again, about the same height off the ground and distance from the road.  Again, it had the same appearance.  I saw trees ahead that were going to block my vision and I sped up to 85 mph.  It was still outpacing me.  I did not see it for about 2 seconds when it was behind those trees.  When I drove beyond the trees, it was gone.  I searched everywhere and could not see it again.  I parked on the shoulder of the road and again searched everywhere and could not see it.  I saw it for approximately 1 minute and for 1.3 miles and I figure the object was flying atleast 90 mph when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, July 25, 1999 at 11:35 a.m. I was driving west on Highway D about 1 mile west of Honey Creek, Walworth County, SE Wisconsin, and I saw the object to the NW and it was about 35 yd from the highway, it was about 50 ft above the ground, about 50 to 60 yds distance from me.

I observed what at first appeared to be a falling star.  However, it was about twice as large as a star appeared to be at that time.  The object had a light green tint to it against the dark blue sky.  It fell as a falling star or meteor would, then suddenly went back up, then fell again, then went back up leaving a brighter trail then flashed as it disappeared. The object was only visible for approxemately 7 to 10 seconds.<n>

This was no running light from a plane, to give an example of how large the light was, hold a quarter out at arms length and that is the size of the red light.  The light was stationary for about one minute and then the size of the light reduced to the size of a typical running light then slowly traveled along the coast going North.  It then stopped and turned into a white light of the same size and remained stationary for about for about 30 seconds, while stationary the white light grew in size to about the size of a fify cent piece.  There was a flash of lightning from a storm out over the ocean and then the light simply went out.<n>

It was so brilliantly bright that I called to my mother to come and see it too before it disappeared. It looked like a moving flash of light. The object itself was not flashing; it was a constant, extremely bright, white light, which I&#39;ve never seen anything like. If I had to describe it further, I would say that it reminded me of a clear Christmas tree light, laying on its side (that is, horizontally) - only a thousand times more bright. The shape of the object - other than its eliptical bias (it was NOT round) - we couldn&#39;t determine because the &#34;rays&#34; shone out from the center of the light, extending away from it, obscuring its actual shape. I can&#39;t emphasize enough what a BRIGHT, large light it was. It&#39;s difficult to estimate its distance, but it seemed to be moving at the approximate height of a helicopter a fair distance away. It remained at a constant altitude from the time I first saw it to when it crossed behind the trees out of our field of vision. It made no discernible sound. The window faces to the north and the object passed from the west to the east. For maybe 10 - 15 seconds or so it disappeared behind some trees, but it emerged again (where one would have expected it to) and continued moving to the right. The whole thing lasted approximately 45 seconds. If one would have been directly underneath it, I suspect it would have lit up the ground below, it was so bright; it was like a huge, moving star against the dark clouds - we had had a thunderstorm earlier and the sky was still very dark. I am a recent law graduate. My mother works at the University of Western Ontario (which lies just a mile to the north of us).<n>

I was facing north, toward Grizzly Peak. There was no sound, no flashing lights as on aircraft wings, the path was not exactly straight, but somewhat wobbly; it was slow, not fast like a meteor; and at the east end of the valley it disappeared as if it had gone behind a cloud, however, it didn&#39;t reappear. At some points in its trajectory it looked blurry. It was too low to be a satellite; it was a constant white light as it drifted from the left of my visual field to my right, as a planet&#39;s light is constant because it is reflected light. I am an acupuncturist with a masters of science in oriental medicine. My vision is 20/10, I do not have night blindness or light sensitivity, and I have been living in this location since 4/97. I have never seen a UFO before, however, I have seen satellites, meteorites, and of course aircraft at night.<n>

A light bigger and brighter as a star, travelling from east to west, very fast. It stood still twice, and at the end it danced. Then dissapeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s till the 24 of july in 1999. There were many strange things going on. A Fire-ball, a strange vehicle in the water, a sighting by a fisherman, strange activity of the navy and a weird light travelling through the Dutch sky. I know, my English language isn&#39;t very good, but I wanto to share this with all of you. The Beginning I was working on the isle Texel nearby the Dutch city Den Helder, a city with a marine-base. (The Dutch Navy) When we arrived on the isle there were strange things happening in Den Helder. A paper wrote about a Russian ice-breaker witch had a collision with a strange waterthing. The marineship was badly damaged, but the thing dissapeared from the rader. It wasn&#39;t a fish. The Dutch authorities wrote an official warning about a thing in the Dutch Waddenzee (Waddensea) Ball of fire We were looking on the dike of the isle of Texel in Holland. A girl had seen there a ball of fire above the water. The thing was hanging above the water and dissapeared very fast into heaven. We laughed, but she said it was true. Then whe went with eight persons tot the dike. Three marine-ships When we arrived there were suddenly tree Marine-ships lying in the water. A kilometer away from the dike. That was very strange because there hadn&#39;t a marine-ship for years. Strange light A ten minutes later one of my friends said: &#34;Look at that&#34; he pointed at the sky. There was a light little bit bigger en brighter as a star travelling at high speed from east to west through the sky. (two friends of mine with good eyes said the light excisted out of three little lights ) Two times the thing stood suddenly still and on his flight it shaked/danced through the sky, &#34;It just like the driver is drunk&#34; one of us said. The thing dissapeared with a little flash. After the light dissapeared the marine-ships also dissapeared. The day after our seeing the marine was flying with helicopters the whole day. A man from the island denied it was a military action because they have to announce that in the paper. Dutch papers Also in the Dutch papers there were people who had seen strang lights. A Dutch fisherman had seen also a strange light above the water. The Dutch-paper kwalified this light as a sea-ufo. Strange photographs Two friends of mine made some photographs the other day. On the pictures there were strange lights. When my friends took the photo&#39;s there was nothing to see.<n>

I could see it through my binoculars, as well as with the naked eye.  The camera was in the trunk, so I told my friend as soon as we get down to the valley..stop so I can get the camera out.  It took us about 25 minutes to get to where we could pull over.  When we did I got some video of it.  And then we were chasing it, but it was overcast and we lost it in some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sat. July, 1999, me and a friend went from Colorado Springs to a barbecue in Cuchara, CO.  And from there we were going to Alamosa to stay the night, because I had seen an episode of &#34;Sightings&#34;, and they talked about that area having had alot of sightings and weird things in the sky.  So we went to the barbecue, and left for Alamosa around 7 PM. We were in the mountains on highway 160 east, just heading down to go into the valley.  I was looking with my binoculars off and on seeing planes, high flying birds, when something caught my eye about 7:50 PM. It looked like a plane with no wings or tail, just the body. And it was just sitting there!  Clouds were going by, but it just stayed.  It was white, but reflecting the suns rays.  When a cloud would block the sun from it, it would get darker in color.  The camera I had brought was in the trunk and there was no place to stop.  So I told my friend, as soon as we get into the valley lets stop and see if we can get it on video. So, about 25 minutes later we got to flat land.  By now it had gotten ahead of us by about 50 miles or so.  When we had first saw it, it was almost right above us in the car. We stopped and I took some video of it.  There were no stars in the sky, and it was now 8:20 PM.  It was going, it seemed, east to west.  Because that is the way we were traveling.  Unfortunately, after I first filmed it, and by the time we got to Alamosa it had gone behind some dark clouds.  But that is not all.  The next day, we drove up highway 17 north to Salida, to a place called &#34;E.T.&#39;s Landing&#34;. My brother had told me about it, and he said that the owner, back in 95, had video taped two seperate encouters.  So I thought it would be fun to go have lunch at the resteraunt.  When we got there they were just opening up, and I asked the waitress kiddingly, &#34;have you had any sightings lately?&#34;, and she surprisingly said,&#34;well by the way, the owner said he had got some calls last night and that the &#34;saucer&#34; is flying again, around Alamosa.&#34; What a weekend! I listen to Art Bell alot, and I have heard Peter on the show many times.  I never thought I would be giving an experience in a report.  But I am glad to have a forum such as this to do so.  Thankyou<n>

The object was big and roundish and it looked black but was covered by, what looked like, flames as it was quite bright and filled the sky with an orange tint and was leaving an orange trail. Some people around were looking but most people did not see this as their were busy driving or what not, but there was many looking. But I thought it was quite strange how some people did not even see this huge fireball object. We followed the object as far as we could then it kind of went behind a builing and dissapeared. That&#39;s when I thought it was a meteor as I believed it had hit into the river,but there was no reports of anything in the sky or crashing down.

The moon was somewhere between 3/4 and NEW.  This is not unusual because we have quite allot of air traffic in our area.  I watched as this object approached my home from a south western area to the north east.  It flew directly over my home.  I am not allowed to smoke in the house so all of this ocurred while I was out back smoking.  I always try to listen to the engine of the aircraft that fly over at night, because I try to determine if it was comercial, military, private,  etc...  All I can see in the night sky is lights anyway.  What was strange about this object at first was the way it seemed so smooth as it flew accross the sky.  I then noticed that it was a group or cluster of smaller lights that seemed to be attached somewhere together (almost by a string) in the center.  The lights seemed to move away from the center and back towards the center in no specific order or fashion.  Almost as if they were blowing around in the wind.  The second thing I noticed that I wasn&#39;t hearing any noise or sound comming from the object.  Since trying to hear for the sound, of the engines, of the aircraft that fly over or around our home is kinda of a &#34;thing to do while smoking&#34;, I tried as hard as I could to hear some kind of noise from this aircraft.  When I realized that what I was seeing and NOT hearing was not something normal, I kinda went into a fixation on this craft as it dissapeared over the roof of my home.  It really FREAKED ME OUT!!  The entire event lasted about 15 to maybe 20 seconds.  After I realized how strange this thing was I just stood there and tried to take all of it in.  The lights were red and white.  Not bright white but more of an off white.  These were not the lights o any airplane either.  These lights changed the entire shape of the object as they moved all around.  Not a hurky jerky motion but a very fluid like random order.  I don&#39;t know what this was, but ! IT WAS NOT ANY AIRCRAFT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED and I was in the Navy for several years as an Ordnance specialist loading ordnance onto F-14&#39;s.<n>
7/24/99 00:12|Lancaster County|PA|Rectangle|20 mins approx.|Large rectangular craft on the ground with windows and antenna. approx 50 yards long by 25 yards wide.|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08449.html|61|ndxe199907| Large rectangular craft on the ground with windows and antenna. approx 50 yards long by 25 yards wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx midnight I decided to begin driving back to Philadelphia from my aunt&#39;s house in rural Lancaster County, PA. As soon as I went out side my aunts house i saw a huge object sitting in a field directly across from her front door. It was large, as big as a foot ball field judging by the nearby trees it lit up like daylight. it had windows with a bright bluish/white light inside and had lights all around the bottom. At first I thought someone put up a large &#34;double wide&#34; mobile home there in the couple hours I was inside. Then I realized it was larger than any mobile home and actually would be as large as four of these put end to end. I also noticed a number of antennas and other &#34;garbage&#34; sticking and jutting out from the top and sides. after running back inside my aunt came out and was a bit shaken by this. I was pretty scared too but I was intrigued. It was just that weird. After about watching this for around 10 minutes it began making a very low sound. like a buzzing wire that isnt plugged into the stereo correctly but with more variation in pitch and alot deeper. you could feel this in the pit of your stomach and my aunt felt sick. the craft then began to lift off the ground and turn. it was then that i could see it clearly was a rectangle as it slowly turned it&#39;s narrower side towards us. it turned off some of its lights and began moving steadily upward in an awkward wobbling motion almost like it was too heavy to support it&#39;s own weight. at this point the sound became more intense and my aunt went back inside for fear that it might crash and we weren&#39;t that far away. it managed to lift off vertically and turn itself 90 degrees after reaching about three times the height of the tops of the trees.  then for about a 25-45 seconds it began shaking wildly and began to accelerate like the space shuttle but only with that low humming sound not a rockets roar. after it started shooting upwards it was nearly out of sight within 10 minutes becoming nothing more than a slowly moving star. I called the ! local TV station and they knew nothing about it and suggested I call the sherrif&#39;s department. I did and they said they had a couple reports of odd lights in the sky and they passed them to MUFON. Afterwards I was firmly shocked. I&#39;ve never believed in this stuff until now and I feel we are about to be taken over. I got a very &#34;sinister&#34; feeling from that object. Like it was scouting for a place to set up operations in the future or something. I felt like it was giant processing center. I was told to contact you from someone on IRC.<n>

Observed object traveling NW to SE, at approx. altitude of 1500 &#39; Speed estimation possibly 200 to 300 MPH. Three red lights in straight line with small center light on constantly with two outside lights flashing in wig-wag configuration. When first noticed the lights, they were beleived to be close enough to radar, with dopler unit in cruiser. No reading from radar, not even normal noise of acquisition of signal. about time lights appeared to be 1-2 miles SE of Woodbine, An aditional set of lights appeared an extimated distance of 500 feet behind the fisrt set. The second set of lights were exactly mirroring the flashins sequence of the leading set of lights. The trailing set of lights appeared from nowhere on completely cloudless Iowa night. 10X binoculars did not reveal any shape to the object even though a half moon was in the clear sky.

We saw what looked like a firework shoot up into the air, we watched as it continued to climb at great speed.  It then stopped and seemed to be hovering in one place for appx 10 sec. then it shot completly horizontal to the left.  It then stopped and began moving upward again, it hesitated again,then started what looked to be a &#39;nose dive.&#39;  It got so close to the ground we thought it was a plane crashing, then suddenly it shot straight up.(similar to the motion of a yo-yo) Then the tail of light disapeared.  When the tail went out, we could see one flashing blue light, and one flashing red light, and what looked to be 4 flashing yellow lights. It seemed to be airplane lights, but the thing that made us wonder was the speed at which it traveled, verticaly and horizontaly, and the way it would hover or hesitate, there didn&#39;t seem to be a possible way that a personal prop plane or jet could manuver this way, and there was no sound. This happened for about 5 minutes.  There were several people pulled off to the side of the road looking and taking pictures.  We did take 3-4 pictures, but they have not been developed yet. What we saw was an object which seemed to be the size of a small prop plane, with a appx 30 meter tail of what seemed to be sparks.  There was no sound.  It was able to move unlike any flying object that we know of.<n>

The white lights were like the color of a stobe light very white and bright. he estimates it was between 1000 &amp; 1500 ft off the ground. It was very clear out and you could make out the shape from all the lights blinking I would say there were at least 8 to 10 lights.  Everyone noticed and noone could figure out what it was it was still ther when i left.<n>

This cigar shaped object had a red and blue light in its front and rear. This object had a small object following behind. This small object had three lights on it, two red one blue and made some strange noise. I ran into my house and got binoculars and went back outside. The binoculars didnt work to well in the dark but I noticed that the small object was now touching the cigar shaped object. I then ran back inside to get my camcorder. When I returned back outside the large object was gone. I now saw three to four objects flying high overhead. I began to film them with great success. These objects are seen on my video flying, stopping, moving up and down and dropping what appears to be balls of flame. Todays date is 11/22/2002. I remember this night like it was yesterday. I attempted once before to report this and was told &#34; we dont want any videos unless it is! a real UFO&#34;. I thought this was funny and felt pretty stupid. I am retired from law enforcement and father of three, I didnt feel like being rideculed so I have had this  video in my safe since this date.<n>

We have a video of the objects. We were driving on the freeway when we saw them, so we stopped, and got a short shot, then continued driving, and got some more video of it. Totally not counting the video we watched the objects for probably over 10-15 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 23,1999 we were on our way to my Aunt dorothy&#39;s house on our way back from disneyland, and when I was driving I had noticed a strange bright orange light off to the west that was shaped like a cyl. or a cigar, so I told everyone to look at that strange light, so the rest of the family looked and saw it also. We had noticed that there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky, and the sun had just sat down over the horizon a short time ago. So the sky was very clear, and blue with a beautiful sunset red shadow on the horizon. So we stopped by the side of the freeway, and took a short video of it, and then began driving again, and then my Fiance saw it again, and started videoing the object again, then out of nowhere appeared a brite lite round in shape I would guess just bouncing all around the skyline, and at one point it came pretty close to the other object. It was really wild to see, then they were gone, and we didn&#39;t see them again.<n>

The object was sighted very close to the setting sun, initially it was thought to be an aircraft off in the distance, as it wqas thought that it was reflecting the sunlight off the surface of the craft.  On later discussion we decided that this could not be the case because the sun was behind it and therefore could not be reflecting off it. The object which was oval in shape was seen to decend to below ground level, we were on top of a hill overlooking China Lake, and we later determined that it must have been many miles in the distance as the object was so small.  It didn&#39;t move at speed or stop and start it&#39;s descent, it just gradually descended to below the hight we were observing from. There were potentially 100+ obserevers, however many of these were in medatation at the time.  And I myself who is normally engaged in the persuit of scanning the skies for things which are out of place, had my head burried in a book.  I do remember however, that there was very little cloud cover over the sky and the day had been very hot (over 100 degrees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting may be approximate.

What struck me as unusual was that there was no headlights or stoplights that a gravel combination would have had, and the pattern of lights shifted relative to my position. Owing to the fact that I had neither binoculars nor time, I did not stop my combination to more closely observe the phenmenon. On the return trip, the conditions were similar, but there were no lights, so any idea of a mining installation was out of the question.<n>

On Friday July 23 at 2.am, 6 of us walked outside to see a bright light in the eastern sky.  It was moving in a sporadic manner, as a fire fly would,although its light never died out.  At first its distance appeared to be up at the level of the trees, hence, the metaphor with the fire fly.  As we walked closer to it, we realized it was way up in the sky, at the distance an airplane might fly.  Its light was brighter than any star or planet and it emitted 3 major points of light. That is to say that it had an overall glow but it appeared to the squinted eye as three rays. The size of its light was at least 10 times bigger than any star.  The light continued to move in different directions although the movement was subtle, in that it did not cover large portions of the sky.  If you were to hold a ruler straight out it was moving within an area of two square inches.  However, we watched it for a good 45 minutes and it had changed its position in the sky by at least a foot.  Its movement was jagged in that it kind of oscillated back and forth but gained overall movement in one direction.  At certain times it moved steadily and there was one period of time where it moved in circular or elliptical fashion in a somewhat more energetic and less regular manner. Thank you for your attention.

The first time I saw the object I believed it was a star or a plane then I looked closer and noticed it was neither. The more I watched it the more I noticed it changed colors and moved very rapidly in a small area. About 45 minutes later another craft appeared in the same area as the other one. It circled around the other one and then flew off very fast in a southernly direction. Two days later I noticed it again and I woke up my mom to come and look at it. When we were looking at it a type of strobe light flashed across our yard only. The next day it appeared again and this time I showed my sister also. This time we noticed the colors that were present on the craft. The colors were red, green, and white. Two days later it appeared again and this time my mom, dad, sister and I all witnessed multiple crafts, up to eight of them all looking like the first but, a lot further away. This time we watched them through binoculers to try to get a better look. Unfortunatley we couldn&#39;t see any better. As the days went by we would see the craft on and off. Then on august 8th about 12:30 am I showed it to my brother and his fiance. As we wathced it 2 other craft appeared 1 craft looked like the original one but, the second one was triangular in shape and flashed in a kind of strobe like fashion. After my brother and his fiance left my sister and I looked at it again through binoculars and finally noticed it&#39;s shape. It&#39;s a flatter sphere shaped object with white lights on top and bottom, it has a green light in the middle and a red light rotates around the whole object. Up till this day the object appears regularly and I think no one else has noticed it because, it can be mistaken for a star, but stars don&#39;t move. I&#39;m trying to get pictures of it as soon as possible and I will try to send some if I can.<n>

I remember someone saying &#34; Hey look, a shooting star ! &#34; So everyone looked  directly upwards and identified what we thought was a shooting star. It moved and looked like a shooting star. I mean, it was as far , far up in the sky and seemed like it was a star itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So everyone just went about there business afterwards. But about 3 minutes later someone noticed that the star was still shooting. I told everyone that it might just be a satalite or something. But boy was I wrong. It moved at the same speed as when we noticed earlier. But all of a sudden the &#34;star&#39; had moved from right above us to directly in front of us and it still looked like it was  far away, like a star. I mean It looked and blended in like a star that we actually thaught it was one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is were it gets really weired. The&#34;star&#39; all of a sudden stops. I mean like a dead stop. It did not slow done at all. And then it grew in size and changed in color. It went from a small star to a big round light. Then, the color changed from white,orange and finally bright red. I mean that thing turned into a blinking stop light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not believe what we were watching. Some how, this tiny shooting star had turned into a big,bright blinkin light. We watched this for about 10 minutes, then it started moving real fast. Within a blink of an eye it would shift directions. Up, down,left,right. A friend and I eventually followed it out to the street. Then all of a suddned, it vanished. Just like that. Poof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, i have not been able to find more witnesses,besides those who were there that night,toconfirm what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I was looking out the window, a very bright light appeared, even with our Northwest airline, and about 1/4 mile away, to the north. At first, I did not know what to think. It was circular, and bright white, and if I had to guess, it looked to be about 50 feet diameter. I began to wonder more about it when it kept pace with the jet, and then it suddenly slowed or stopped, as we kept going. It then came imediately back even with us, and closer, and I then could see the most brilliant, flourescent, pink light around the bright white light, and then a very brilliant, flourescent purple l! ight around the most outer area. the only round part was the white center. The pink and purple were surrounding the sides, and this made it appear to be football shaped, but with deffinate edges, and that is why I call it diamond shape. This whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. The craft made a few sudden direction changes, and then left very fast and was gone. I told friends about this at the time, but did not know where to report it.<n>

I am not sure of the date, but it was the next to or the last week July and I was working overnights.  I took a late coffee break and went to the roof to see the sky for a few minutes.  I was facing south when I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right and in the NW part of the sky, I saw a meteor heading almost straight down (maybe at a 5o&#39;clock angle).  It was VERY bright and seemed to slow down as it went out. It then quickly brightened again for just a moment only this time, throwing gold/copper sparks from its backside, before burning out. This is my second report in a short time as you may already know.  I sent a report of my &#34;light&#34; sighting from Jenks, OK.  You may contact me if you feel the need.<n>

My friend Matt wasn&#39;t though. We were watching a movie and he was messing with me about the alien stuff. So I did to. I pointed to a plane and said there&#39;s a ufo. We laughed and kept watching the movie. Five minutes litter it was like they hard my thoughs that I wish he believed me about this stuff because I looked out the window and said, &#34;Now there&#39;s a UFO.&#34; We both ran outside and looked into the distence. There was a ball of light huvering in the sky. We were watching it and from out perseption it was not to far over the trees in the distence. It was moving very slow in a curved diagnal way. It moved around over the trees like it was making sure we could see it. It suddenly started changing color. It first turned bright red then blue then green, and orange then all the colors of the rainbow. Then it doubled in size and turned bright red again. Then shrunk down and turned white and just disipeared into the air. We saw it reappear in flashes for only a few seconds over our heads for several minutes. I was so happy the my friend saw it with me. He still can&#39;t believe what he saw to this day even though I conferm everything that he saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About two minutes later there was another flash of bright light, it was like a light bulb that gets a surge of energy and blows a fuse; bright and quick. The light was about four times the size of an airplane&#39;s lights at night. Each time I saw the flash of light it had not moved. In the duration of ten miutes I saw the light flash five times, each time about two minutes apart. I do not know if it continued to flash because I went to bed, but soon after  I began to hear a two tone humming noise that was very quiet and soft. It lasted about two minutes and then faded. When I talked with my neighbor the morning of 7/20/99 she told me that she also had seen a flash of light, but only once, a glimps while in front of a window.  She did not go out side to see if it was continuing.  But she did hear the humming, saying it lasted about two minutes.<n>

It is the appearance of wide, transluscent line coming out of the western horizon and extending overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not reporting a vehicle, but rather an &#34;event&#34; in the sky.  This event occured while driving on I-35 between Kansas City and Emporia Kansas at approximately 11AM.  I had earlier in the morning called attention to chemtrail activity over Kansas City Missouri to my 18 year old daughter who was a passenger in the car with me. The incident I am reporting however is a gray line that appeared to emerge from the distant horizon.  This gray, translucent line appeared to be about two inches wide when measured against my outstretched fist. I had a sense this may have been electrical in nature. The line extended from the horizon to directly overhead.  I opened the sunroof of the car so my daughter could determine how far the line ran above and behind the car. Overhead, however, we saw a high altitude plane leaving a contrail behind it and the plane was precisely following the gray line.  The gray line gradually faded and disappeared completely approximately seven minutes after we first noticed it. The plane continued ahead of us leaving its contrail. I have just recently become aware of chemtrails but in my reading about them thus far I&#39;ve not heard anyone mention the gray line coming up out of the horizon.  Has this previously been reported?  Is there a known significance? Frankly this was one of the strangest things I&#39;ve seen and it left both my daughter and me with a real, unsettling feeling.<n>

I was alone on the fuel island at the time. I was startled by a loud-sudden sound slightly behind and above me (approx 25-30 degrees from straight overhead). I instinctively looked over my right shoulder and realized that I was under the awning of the fuel island and the lights had ruined my night vision. I followed the sound with my eyes hoping to see something as it passed into view on the other side of the awning but I saw nothing.  The only sound from the object was the aural &#34;whoosh&#34; of something cutting through the air, there were no other sounds such as turbine or prop that would be associated with a conventional aircraft.  The total duration of sound from the object was 3-4 seconds and produced a very clear doppler effect as it CPA&#39;d my position, indicating &#34;a very high rate of speed&#34;!!! I grabbed my compass from the truck and estimate the object was travelling a base course of 105 degrees.

I was an acoustic analyst and used acoustic sounds to track underwater submarines.<n>

The larger object then flew away at an incredible speed, taking only a couple seconds leave the atmosphere.  Meanwhile the smaller sphere began to descend.  I quickly got out of the tub, ran inside and got some binoculars.  I found it again and got a better view.  It also was a sphere, it had a slight blue glow and it flew in a slow, unsteady fasion.

We could not see a craft or hear engine noise of a craft.also there were no red or blue lights observable on the wirngs.  We were traveling north on Pierce Rd.by the airport at this time.  The light fluctuated from dim to bright a number of times then made a 180 degree turn while decending toward the south end of the runway.  We pulled into the parking lot to watch it land....there was nothing on the runway, no noise of an engine and no activity anywhere.  I called the Union County airport today to inquire of any flights that might have landed at this hour.  The reply was that the airport closes at 7:00 pm and that there was no activity there that they would have known of.<n>

It was broad daylight so I got a good look at what it was made of. It is hard to decribe it looked liek a mix i guess of a dull aluminum but it had a veyr shiney look ot it reflective but not crome like it was on the darker side. It came to a stand stiff for about 25 seconds then it almost bounced it droped approx 50 ft then shot off inot the sky straight up untill it disspeared into the blueness of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/18/99 04:10|Escondido|CA|Fireball|5 minutes|A large circular orange light which moved to the north, then south, north again the up until it dissapeared.|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08398.html|112|ndxe199907| A large circular orange light which moved to the north, then south, north again the up until it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)). On the early morning of  07/18/99 at about 4:10am I was on a dark rural road very near my home when I noticed a lighted object from my drivers side window (See house.jpg).  My first thought was that someone was launching a hot air balloon from the back of a house. The object I saw was clearly very near to the ground because I could easily see the outline or black silhouette of the roof of the house in front of the object. The weather was warm and visibility was good. There was overcast and you could not see any stars nor the moon. I was heading North East on a street called North Iris Lane when I noticed this well lit orange circle of light from behind a house which was no more than 300 yards away from my vantage point. Again, my first thought was a hot air balloon and the glow from someone filling it with hot air. I kept looking out my drivers side window but as I drove I lost sight of the object as my sight was now obscured by homes and trees to my left. When I reached the stop sign about 150 yards from where I first noticed the object, I made a left turn and saw that the object was no longer at ground level but now was clearly in the sky and heading in a North West direction. I never leave the house without my digital camera and when I turned the corner I stopped my car and grabbed it. The camera I used was an Olympus D-400 Digital Zoom camera. It took a few seconds to open the lens cover, when I looked through the viewfinder I feared that the light from the street lamp in front of me would not allow for a good shot. I therefore waited till the object was just above the lamp post and took a picture (see pic1.jpg). I waited all of an additional 3 seconds and took another picture pointing in the same direction (see pic2.jpg). The object I saw was not bright, the best way to describe it was if you&#39;ve seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the blue light that followed the space ships except that this light was a dull orange in color instead of blue. After I took two pictures I s! aw the object stop moving up and to the North and changed directions to up and South. It stopped about 3 seconds later then started to head back North and to the West. About 3 seconds later the object just starting heading straight up at a consistent rate of speed. Rather than just stand there I got back in truck made a right turn into our town home complex and stopped my car in front of my house. When I got out I could still see the object still heading up and getting farther away. I went inside grabbed my wife out of bed and insisted she come outside NOW! When we got outside I pointed to the sky and said &#34;look do you see that?&#34; she said yes and asked what it was. At this point it looked like a very bright star and was very far away. We both stood there for the next 5 to 10 seconds and watched as it passed through the overcast. It got smaller and smaller when finally we could no longer see it. We both looked around and you could not see any stars in the sky. I pulled my car into my driveway and immediately called the Escondido Police Department. The woman who answered the phone listened , chuckled and told me to call an 800 number. When I did, I got a recording for the TV show &#34;Unsolved Mystery&#39;s&#34;. I called her back, gave her a sarcastic thanks and asked her to take my name and number in the event anyone else reported anything. I went out this morning during daylight and took a couple of pictures from the road where I first saw the object behind a house (house.jpg). Using PhotoShop I made a orange circle which represents the size and color of what I first thought was a hot air balloon (house-ufo.jpg). I also took a couple of pictures of where the object was just above the lamp post on the street adjacent to my home (see pic1-day.jpg).  Again using PhotoShop I made a circle to show you the size and color of the object prior to it moving South, then NW and up (pic1-day-ufo.jpg). On a side note my wife had mentioned that our neighbor had approached her only 2 or 3 days before and asked her if she had seen anything strange in the skies. I have given our neighbor your number and she said she would call you as apparently she claims to have seen a UFO as well. My apologies for such a long winded description but I get excited every time I think about what I saw. I am very open minded and would be stupid to think that we are alone in the universe. However I have never really believed in us being visited by something outside of our planet. In other words I was a true skeptic until last night. I have gone over the encounter many times in my head and cannot find any reasonable explanation for what I saw. Now man made object that I&#39;m aware of could do what I saw this thing do. In the event you are wondering let me answer a few questions that others have asked me. There was no sound at all. This orange circle was consistent in color and did not change. There were no other colors present and there was no blinking. It was not a blinding bright but rather a dull fiery orange. I saw no background objects (no spaceships or anything like that) I do not do drugs. Thanks for allowing me to share this incident. I do not care what others think since I know what I saw and that is all that matters to me. You have my full permission to use what I have just written and make available my email address should anyone want to contact me.<n>

It was significantly brighter than a star and was observed through binoculars, but not clearly. It was definitely seen to change color. Witnesses all Jacksonville Police Officers. JIA tower was contacted and stated that they observed object to the West of their position but had no radar contact. They were also perplexed. Definitely not a helicopter or other aircraft. No towers of balloons in area. I was distracted and did not see what happened to the object, but it disappeared after approximately 20-30 mins.<n>
7/18/99 01:00|Malta|NY|Light|2 seconds|fast moving white light|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08386.html|114|ndxe199907| fast moving white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1:00 am EST I was watching a movie at the Malta Drive-IN located on RT 9 3 miles north of RT 67 on the right hand side of the road. The screen tower is situated so that you have to face west to see the screen.  While watching the second feature, American Pie, I saw a light about as bright a venus had been a few days ago (brighter than any star and brighter than other passing aircraft - Albany Airport and Schenectady Airport are both nearby)  I had seen several aircraft earlier that night on approach to both airports. This object moved faster than any plane I have ever seen.  I first thought I was seeing a shooting star, but then noticed something very odd.  The object came from my left (south) and headed to my right (north).  It was at about the same altitude as the other aircraft had been (1000 ft aprx). The object appeared to be going in a straight line with a slight arc as it crossed from the south to the north. I thought for sure that it was a shooting star because it was moving at incredible speed, but then as it reached the half way point it looked like a slinky would look if you stretched it out.  The light became elongated, the compressed to a sigle dot, stopping for a split second, then speeding off again elongating itself once more. I don&#39;t know how else to describe what I saw.  I have seen UFO story&#39;s on TV and in some of the footage I have seen exactly what this object did.  I have seen shooting stars and red glowing meteroites and I am sure this was not a meteor or shooting star. The fact that this object went from a single dot to an elongatted shape back to a single dot to an elongated shape again was incredible to see. I had been hearing that Saratoga County had an increase in UFO sightings, but until now I did not take any of it seriously. After what I saw tonight it has become very real for me.<n>

Then I changed my run to N.C. for about a year, now that I&#39;m back on my run to columbus and back to richfeild oh. I have seen the same vehicles starting last week again. only on one night did I spot two of them running  together at a much slower rate but faster than any airplane that i have ever seen fly. The lights on the two together was a constant light moving across the sky. The lights on the much faster flying objects either was the exhaust or the friction of the air because I would see them only when they were about to cross in front, I would catch the glow then you could see them until they disappeared only to be a second or two after they cross infront. I even stopped one night at the location to see if they would cross and they did with no noise, not even after they were gone. no sonic boom or anything( the crickets still chriped as it flew over)approx heading was about a 230-240 degree northwest. no shape could be seen, the lights was a constant white light. I have seen some exotic planes before and their performance but none could compare to the speed that these vehicles were travleling at(NONE).BACKGROUND- Cpl,USMC 1987-1991 specops communications. if you need more info just email me<n>

I was looking at stars, in which i normally do every now and then, he area surrounding me is very dark, and the stars are highly visible and bright. I was admiring the constellation Scorpio, which is a dominant constellation for our Australian winter skies, and as i was looking around the constellation I saw a light moving slowly west around the scorpio starsign, it was glowing a bit brighter than Antares(A Star in Scorpio)and the light was a greenish blue haze.It slowed down for a few seconds and dimmed, then went very bright green/yellow, then moved very fast in the same direction and as it moved,a piece veered off it, which was a blue/yellow glow and fell fast and brightened and vanished then the 1st light vanished.Both lights were only the size of a star but bright &amp; hazy.estimated 2000-3000 ft high, and directly overhead. I told my girlfrendat the time and she believed me, as i am not the type of person to make stories up.My neighbor up the road also saw the light i saw that night, as he explanedto me a few days later, and i told him i saw it, but he said, proove it, and i explained to him the time and date, and the events that occured and he was white as a ghost..he thought he was just seeing things, cause he had a few beers that night, and shrugged it off as a &#39;Alchohol&#34; thing..<n>

I at the time was a prodution superviser,when a production worker, who live in a local high rise building in Sandusky, close to the lake, came to work very startled, and up set. I asked him whats up, becuse he wasn&#39;t acting his usual self? He said &#34; I just seen something crazy&#34;. I ask what? He said while looking out his window before coming to work &#34; I seen a green orb or strange light, over the lake, by Cedar Point&#34;. I asked him what was it doing? He replied &#34; it just seemed like it was hovering over the water, and then going into the water, real fast and darting around the area of the by Damon&#39;s ( a local resturant ). I was kind of freaked out by what he told me, but I had prodution to run that night, but I did talk more to him at the end of the news paper run. I asked him if anyone eles had seen this object? He then told me &#34; look I was froze with fear, it was big, someone eles must have seen it. I was under the impression the man was in some sort of shock, but I knew this guy , and I beleive he was creditable. I thought to myself, maybe he seen something that was explainable. I went home that morning ( Sunday ), and told my wife. She just thought I was crazy, and it was some sort of made up story by this certain person. On Monday, the next day. I seen this production worker again, he was at his second job, being a resturant cook, across from the news paper where we both worked. I said to him seen anything strange last night? He then got this look on his face, and said &#34; look I know it sounds weird, but I am not lying, I seen something crazy, and I can&#39;t get it out of my head&#34;. Me, being his boss, and trying to get my own grip on his story, I told him to deal with it, your a big boy. I myself have never seen anything that I couldn&#39;t explain, but this person had me wondering? That evening I was at my home, also in Sandusky, my wife came home after work, with this look of dispare on her face. I asked what&#39;s wrong, are you sick? She then kept! saying to me &#34; It&#39;s real, your right something is out there&#34;. I said to her what are you talking about? She then went on to tell me about, this woman she works with at her office, who&#39;s husband is a police officer in Sandusky, receive a call Saturday night about something on the shore of the lake, by Battery Park. I said to my wife, what happened? She said, her friends husband, and two other police officer&#39;s went to the shore to investigate something on the shore. Two officers went down on the shoreline with flash light to see what was the matter, the other officer stayed up top of the shoreline. At this time, my wife&#39;s friends husband, radio the station to say that there was nothing on shore an that the three officers where going back to their car&#39;s. As the two officers climbed up the shoeline, the officer up top,said look what is that! As the other two officers looked around, and said to the officer up top of the shoreline, what? The three Sandusky police officers seen a green/blueish object off shore, and it seemed to be hovering or sitting on top on the lake. To say the least, these three officers were shaken, and radio to the station franticly about what they were seeing off shore, right now. I said to my wife, who was still in some sort of ( I can&#39;t beleive it&#39;s true ) type of demeanor,what happened next. She said the officers got the hell out of there quick! She said it shook up the three officers so much, when they told there watch commander, they were up set with what they had seen, their watch commander, or the chief of police made all take 3 day&#39;s off from work. I couldn&#39;t beleive what I was hearing. My wife a church going ( non-beleiver, of the paranormal and ufo stuff ) was acting like the world was going to end. I said I wanted to talk with her freiends husband, I had known him for years, and ask him about what he and the other officers had seen that night. My wife with no hesitation said no, he was scared and told his wife &#34; I just want to forget it&#34;. I ask my wife, what does your friend at the office say about her husbands incident? She said her friend was scared, and had never seen her husband act like that, and that what those officers had seen was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With an incident like that, and credible wittness like these 4 people, I must admit, something must of had happen that night…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was probably about 20 feet across but I couldnt be sure it was going from east to west and it had a long blue\orange streak behind it. and it went behind the hills to the northwest of my position that would be about 26 miles south of I-90 on U S 395.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A huge Orangish Ball, Drifting across the sky from east to west Landing behind some hills.<n>

Saturday, July 17th, 1999 I think I may have seen one. It was about 10:00 at night, and was a clear night. I was throwing something into the trashcan out at the curb, and when I turned around and walked towards the house I looked up at the sky. That is when I saw something that looked like an airplane, but the lights were formatted backwards. Flying west to east, there were three white lights, two in the front, leading it, and one in the back. There was also a steady red light in the center, which was not blinking, but glowing faintly. There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed; I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here. I think I saw the common triangle UFO.<n>

Saturday, July 17th, 1999 I think I may have seen one. It was about 10:00 at night, and was a clear night. I was throwing something into the trashcan out at the curb, and when I turned around and walked towards the house I looked up at the sky. That is when I saw something that looked like an airplane, but the lights were formatted backwards. Flying west to east, there were three white lights, two in the front, leading it, and one in the back. There was also a steady red light in the center, which was not blinking, but glowing faintly. There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed; I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here. I think I saw the common triangle UFO. It was passing over my house, at a distance of about 300 feet up, and 100 away. it was moving west to east. I have always been watching the skies, and I know what one is supposed to do if something is spotted. I made sure I remembered where I saw it, day, time, weather conditions, anyone else around, anything else strange, etc. all I noticed which was strange was there were no other sounds at all. It was a fairly nice night, and usually people have their dogs out side. There are usually bugs out making noise as well. I heard nothing, absolutely nothing. It was strange, the only thing I heard was the low humming. When it left, I can not remember anything like normal sounds starting up again, but I would not be surprised if they did. This is almost exactly what I saw.<n>

We pulled off into the parking lot of the marina looked up and it vanished. We looked in all directions for several minutes and saw nothing. It was silver and from my eye fairly large and disk shaped, wobbley in movement, very reflective.<n>

The object left a cloud in a stright line.  After the object dissipeared the cloud that was stright started to form a figure in the sky.  The figure looked like one of the aliens out of the movie &#34;Mars Attack&#34; with the big head small eyes and the only execption was this figure had a big nose.  Then after that started to dissipear the object came back down far away (about 20-30 miles) in a stright line.  The cloud it left behind was stright and looked like a dotted line.  As the object got closer to the ground it started to get brighter and brighter, as it was getting brighter the cloud that looked like a dotted line started to form the exact figure as when it went up into the sky.  After the object got so bright it stoped moving and started to form a mushroom cloud like when the atomic bomb went off.  That stayed bright and in the figure of a mushroom cloud for about 5-10 min then it was over.  This was not the first time its happened about 3 weeks ago the exact same thing happened and it was in the general direction as this time.  I was the only one not there for the first one.  Another thing was there was no moon in the sky at eather occasion.<n>

I am also an ex-MUFON investigator in Minn. (resigned when i moved out of state). I was watching the night sky which was crystal clear, moon was a sliver, and low on the horizon. Stars were very clear and bright. I noticed that there was a extremely bright red non-flashing point-source of light that had 6 fast flashing (~6 flashes/sec.) red strobe-like lights on it&#39;s front and two slower flashing red lights on it&#39;s back end coming over the southern horizon and moving directly north at a modest rate of speed ( it took perhaps 2 minutes to traverse horizon to horizon). The flashing red lights were strobe like point-sources (not diffused at all)..similar to the light from a red LED wtih a clear cap. It was at approximately 10,000 ft. AS it cleared into the northern horizon, a second object, similar to the first but different, appeared on the southern horizon in the same place as the first one did. This one had two red non-flashing point sources of light, directly opposed from each other ( like a barbell with lights on it&#39;s ends), and 3 flashing red lights on it&#39;s front. It followed the same path as the first light, and as it passed by, the front lights disappeared behind the body of the craft..it was easy to see the shape when this happened. It looked to be a wing shape. AS this light cleared the northern horizon, another red non-flashing light similar to the first appeared at the southern horizon and followed the other two in the same path and altitude. THis one was the same as the first object in it&#39;s light configuration and speed of flashing. AS the third object cleared into the northern horizon, another red non-flashing point-source of light came into view on the NE horizon, traveling SW. THis one had a red non-flashing center and 3 or 4 rapidly flashing red lights all over it&#39;s body. It seemed round in shape. I watched these with a 50 power binocular. THere was no mistaking these lights from commercial or private aircraft. There was no similarity at all. The feeling I had was of a series of vessels surveying the area. Keep up the good work!!

I told my wife I would be back shortly,  I drove down my road which only has a french school on it and is about a mile long. A car that was driving very slowly when I met up to it was my neighbor from several houses down the street,  he had his wife and child with him and he was pointing while his wife and child were lookingout the window, it was dark by this time, I looked up.  About apx.  1000 ft away, and about 500 ft in the air, a very bright white light in the middle, a flashing red light on both sides of the white light and a blue light flashing {slower then the red ones}on both sides of them. My first thought is that this is a helicopter,  it was close to the hospital and helicopters come and go from there frequently. My neighbor then pulled over to the side of the road and so did I,  we shut are cars off after watching it for a minute, this thing was not that far away,  it wasn&#39;t moving at all,  it was a lot larger then any helicopter that I&#39;ve ever seen,  and their wasn&#39;t one bit of noise coming from it....... we watched it idle and talked about it for a few more minutes, my neighbors left and I watched on, I drove my car a bit more up the road to be closer to it, after again turning off my car I watched it for maybe 5 more minutes before it started moving,  ....it moved very slowly toward my direction and just before reaching me made a turn again keeping its same slow speed.....no noise, it headed toward the east untill it went out of site.  ......sum it all up....I never seen anything like it, I phoned the RCMP and they told me to phone the airport and they put me through to the control tower at Ch&#39;town airport, minutes after speaking with them and reporting it,  their werea few small aircraft sent up to scout the area I mentioned to them.....but it was gone by then, I would also like to mention the fact that my road is very close to the airport....maybe 3 miles d! irect line...they told me at the control tower that their were no flights in or out of there in the last 2 hours, and that airplanes had a red light and a green light.......not blue........but then again...this was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We were standing in the yard just talking when we saw what looked like a plane coming through the pine trees. It looked like it was kind of low, so we continued to watch it. After a few seconds or so, all the lights in the front went out, like they didn&#39;t want to be seen. We kept waiting to hear the sounds of a plane but none came. It passed a few yards above our heads, still without making any noise at all. It was so strange: it looked like a plane until it passed over us and then it looked like a wedge of cheese cut from a wheel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were five flashing lights under it: red, blue, amber, green and white. We couldn&#39;t see through it. After it passed over us, it headed across the access road that lead to the water treatment plant. Lifting up a little, it passed over the trees on the other side and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.<n>

Silver in the middle with white ends. No observable thickness. Moving very slowly and wobbling from end to end. Total observation time of ten seconds.  Object abruptly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was inside my house when my attention was attracted by a loud sound of a group of 3 (military)helicopters passing overhead and proceeding in a northwesterly direction.  Went outside and looked up at helicopters when a strange object was observed at a higher altitude and almost directly overhead.  The object was a modified rectangle with rounded ends, approximately 3 to 4 times longer than wide.  The center third was a silvery metallic color and the two end thirds were white with a sharp edge between the areas.  There were no projections visible and no markings.  A rough estimate of observed length is based on a length of 4 inches at a distance of one arm length.  It appeared to be nearly stationary but wobbled or occilated from end to end.  My impression was that it was very large.  I could not observe any thickness to the object but it was directly overhead. Any sounds would have been obscured by the helicopter engine noise.  It appeared that it was moving slowly and was about to become obscured by a large tree next to our house so I moved to a better viewing position about 10 feet away looking away during this brief period.  When I looked up again the object had disappeared.  A commercial jet was also passing overhead going south at this time.  This object was lower than the jet and in a different part of the sky.  This sighting was very short probably not greater than 10 seconds or so.<n>

For some reason I looked up into the sky on our back porch. Looking up with the side of the gutters on our house as a frame in my vision, I saw a silver grayish round object suspended in the sky not moving at all. I pointed it out to my mother and aunt they both said they had no idea what it was. Then i went in the house to get some binoculars. I came back out to the porch and when I looked up to where the the object was before but it had vanished. I was mad. Because this was my first ufo and it didn&#39;t last very long.

(You see a lot of meteor showers in the desert.) However, what set this one apart was the slow way in which it moved and when the white/silver glow of the &#34;meteor&#34; was above us in the sky it lit up with a bright green &#34;flare&#34; that streaked across the sky above our heads and lit up the sky like it was daylight or neon fireworks.  The entire episode lasted a little less than a minute and left us with chills trying to consider what it was or could have been.

I had always been a huge UFO fan before I witnessed the object, and after I had to report it. (I may have reported this to your site before) We (my brother, myself, and the driver: my dad) were all driving down a road to get home after we had been out at my family&#39;s. This is a particularly &#39;country&#39; type road and I always see lights in the sky that I &#34;hope are real&#34; UFO&#39;s on road&#39;s like these but quickly dismiss them as airplanes or other aircraft. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was about 11:30 p.m. when we first spotted the object. Only my brother and I were witnesses to the triangular shaped craft, my father had no interest in our &#34;whoa look at this!&#34; and other mentions of the unusual thing. He had to keep his eye&#39;s on the road, and I was bending my neck backwards just to get a look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s original about my sighting was that the object seemed particularly interested in us and the car we were in. I felt it could sense our fascination of the object and the feeling seemed that it was &#34;curious&#34; of our reaction, when most might be horrified. It hovered around thirty feet OR LESS directly above our car and wavered slightly from side to side to give me a few good looks at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely triangular without a doubt, with a red, white, and possibly blue lights on the tips (oddly). I thought I saw a light on the top which would make it a pyramid, but my brother saw no such thing. There were no odd car reactions (i.e. car suddenly stopping) and the object simply left when we got to a more populated area. I think a saw a car far behind us in the incident so we may not of been the only witnesses. Threw the whole ordeal the object emitted no sound. Which makes it extremely unlikely that it was some kind of experimental government craft, note that there were (laughs) NO GOVERNMENT BASES OR TEST SITES IN THE AREA. After a careful analysis of what I saw I concluded it was a UFO which could not be identified by any terrestrial craft or natural events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would like to know the precise date of the event, if possible, and we would very much like to receive reports from the other witnesses.  However, we have no way of contacting the witness.  PD))<n>

This was such a vivid experience that felt compelled to report it in the hopes that someone else had a similar experience.  I noticed the object when I turned to walk back to our home (I was with our 2 cats; the object was too distant and noiseless, therefore they were not disturbed).  The object may have been in place longer than my observation.  The entire object was about the size of a dime, in total, in the night sky.  Center was large (about 5x the magnitude of Venus as it sets), bright, roundish to oblong object.  This central object was surrounded by a sharply defined spherical &#34;glow&#34;.  This &#34;glow&#34; was extremely clear and distinctive against the dark sky.  It was as if there was a very fine line of bright light around the spherical glow, but it was more evident above the central object than below it.  The entire thing was a round shape like a ball with about 2/3 of it the &#34;glow&#34; (translucent) and 1/3 the extremely bright central object.  I got a really good look at the object for several seconds because it was not moving.  Then, it was as if it rotated in place and vanished (more like it &#34;folded&#34; into the sky).  I felt that I could see sort of an afterglow but it was more like the atmosphere was moving (perfectly cloudless night, so this motion seemd to be in the atmosphere itself; I am less clear about this portion of the siting).  Honestly, in all of my life I have never, ever seen anything like this.  I regret I had no witness (at least with me) since my husband, who usually accompanies me on our evening walks, was not present.  The entire experience was absolutely vivid (I can recall it as if on video-tape).  In other useful information: I am well educated in the natural sciences (biology/geology); final degree is Ph.D., social science; I was an airplane pilot for many years so am familiar with atmospheric phenomena.  I ! was perfectly alert, on no medication.  On April 11, I witnessed in roughly the same quadrant of the sky at about the same time in the evening an object that I would explain as a meteor, only at a much lower altitude and much larger in magnification than a typical meteor, so that it was unusual in that expect.  The &#34;meteor&#34; was low enough and large enough for me to clearly see an orange-red hot core and the cinder trail.  I noticed it from just about overhead in our driveway and watched as it moved steadily across the entire remainder of the sky down toward the northeastern horizon.  While this was also a vivid observation, and it has been on my mind, it is &#34;explainable&#34; and I do not believe that it biased my observation last evening in any way.  I do hope that if anyone else reports a similar experience to the one I had last evening in Texas that I will hear about it (checked box for return contact by investigator).  I would like to know how to obtain any information on events that may have been in my area (weather balloons, high altitude explosions, satellites, etc.).<n>

I turned and looked up and was shocked at what I had seen. It was a very bright ball. The best way to describe the size was to extend my arm from my body and open my finger and thumb the size of a ½ Dollar. I have seen several meteors and shooting stars. This was NNOT one. This ball of light was a very bright blue. It looked like a spark of electricity from a wall outlet. It also illuminated the sky about 1/4 mile around the object as it was traveling. It was also flickering. It happened so quickly, and went out of view across the street behind the neighbors tree. I observerd the sky for about 20 minutes but didnt see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright Blue, flickering, rather large, 1 witness, round blue ball, I am 29 years old.

(Seals)  and what I am about to tell you DID happen. I was sitting on my back porch last July just enjoying a &#39;beverage&#39; when suddenly there was a bright light in the woods. I thought it was some kids building a camp fire, but camp fires do not move. It slowly drifted above the ground, and into the trees. I watched in terror and wonderment as the object silently moved around. But I have a hearing impariment, so I am not sure if it was making a sound!  I did not know what to do. I had heard of this kinda stuff happening to people but I figured it was all Bull****. Well now, I am not sure what it was but it was not like anything I have ever seen. I watched this thing for about 3 to 4 minutes.  I was concerned that it would come near my house, and I was gonna bust a cap in it if that happened. But it just floated on up into the sky and disappeared. I am not sure if any of my neighbors saw this, and I am not asking! But geez, what a night.. I could not sleep without a gun for weeks. I mean, if those little bastards try to take me ! they will be in for a fight! This really messed up ,my head, I need some help. I had to tell somebody, and you all seemed like the best place to start. PLease help me. Thank you,((name deleted))<n>

I enjoy reading www.sightings.com and decided to try Jon-Bro&#39;s Techinques, Which; are also on the film.. This year, approx: July 15th I walked outside on the front steps to have a cigarette and noticed a strange looking object in the sky. It was positioned approx: South-southwest at about position 09:00 o&#39;clock in the sky, just in the back-drop of the Flatirons mtns. I yelled to my Girl-friend to look at what I was seeing. She came out-side and I told her to look.. At this time the object was Due South and about at position of: 11:00 o&#39;clock. It hovered there for approx: 10-15 mins., as if it was looking at us. During this time I ran in to get the Video-Recorder.. The Batteries where nearly dead which accounts for the lack-of-ability to Zoom.. However; I managed to get approx: 10-15 mins. of Video on the object that just hovered before it dissapeared..  The Object at first appeared Square, then appeared Oval with dim lights on the sides of the Oval. I tried to get a picture of the house below the object to get an approx: size of the object.. I fumbled several times with the Video camera due to checking the power which I plugged in later. I and my Girl-Friend were witnesses..  I have the Video of this if anyone is intersted..<n>

As I approached this glow it suddenly extinguished, but this occurred with the top and rightside and then the leftside being turned off one after the other. I now knew this was some type of craft and I could still see the black shape in the clear/bright night sky. I slowed my cycle and pulled almost directly under the object, which was still hovering but making no sound that I could hear over my cycle&#39;s noise.  As I stopped beneath I would est. it to be the size of a hockey puck at arms length.  Now the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps and a chill all over my body.  I then decided descretion is the better part of valor and took off.  I went about a half mile and stopped but could no longer find the object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: About the size of a hockey puck at arms length, disk shaped with a flat bottom and some type of dome in the center top which tapered towards the outer edge.

This craft hovered the entire time and I observed no movement and could hear no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke over the telephone with this witness, and found him to be extremely credible.

Then my dad says &#34;Whats that,&#34; so I turn and I see this very bright light shining on us. It shined on us for maybe 7-8 seconds and the light went out. It then just looked like a satelite. It then moved slowly NW but stopped after a few seconds but did not make any turns or anything like a plane. It just stopped and started moveing back the direction that we first spotted it at. It then headed SE stopped and another beam of light came down when it was over the town of Aurtherdale, which we can see from are house. It was the most perfect beam of light I have ever saw in my life. Whatever it was it was very high up but had no problem for that light reaching the ground. I know it lit up the ground when it shined it on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was still a bit groggy and not fully awake. The bathroom had a window just above the water closet and I could see out to the back yard of the house as I was urinating. I noticed a very bright blueish/white light on, shining down from above the house, and in seeing it, said to myself, someone must have left the floodlight on out back. Then it occured to me, wait a minute, we don&#39;t have a floodlight in the back yard. As soon as this thought came to me, I was fully awake and in a flash I was, I guess I would call it, consumed or flushed by this very very calm and peaceful feeling and the blue/white light (LEDish in color) then slowly moved down from over the top of the house to the backyard. I watched it without any fear whatsoever. It came between a 200 year oak and the house. It did not pass behind the tree which was about 30 feet from the house. The win! dow had a type of vision glass (not frosted) that made it impossible for me to see the exact shape of this light. It slowly moved to the left and was about to go out of view when I ran into the bedroom to get a better view of what the heck it was, but it was gone.  It only took me, maybe 2 seconds, to go from the bathroom to the bedroom. There was no noise at all.

Looked up through redwoods, and saw 50 or more craft flying west. The craft looked like three disks connected with a thin bar, creating a triangle shape. The underside of the craft emminated a beautiful blue glow, and no sound was heard from where I stood, about 2 miles from the hill they were all flying over. They were moving very slowly. For some reason, instead of continuing to watch them, I went back to bed before they had moved out of my vision. I attempted to wake my husband to show him, but I curiously could not! Nothing would wake him. It seems as if someone else would have seen this, as it was such a large amount of craft that I saw.<n>

We were driving back down into the Valley where our family lives (Navajo Reservation).  As we were passingThe Mittens (rock formations), to the left of us (North-East) a bright flash of neon green light seemed to open up, with no sound at all.  We IMMEDIATELY stopped to watch, and it remained opened.  Streakes of green white light were coming out of it.  Like lightening.  It closed without a sound, which made all three of us so very uncomfortable.  We then heard a military jet streaking across the sky at very low altitude.  It appeared out of no where.  We were all so stunned, we couldnt move for 10 minutes.  We were afraid to move.  If someone was to ask me what it reminded me of, it reminded me of the worm hole on Deep Space Nine.  It mimicked that &#34;opening up&#34; and &#34;closing&#34;.  When we finally got home, we told our father about it.  He is a Navajo medicine man.  He said he has seen that event a couple of times.  He was not surprised.<n>

We were at least 70 miles away from Otter Lake the nearest town, phones and electicity. We had met a few fishermen on our way about 30 miles before we arived at our destination, as far as we know there was no one else near us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We loved being away from the civialization We were having a great time, we we really roughing it, and enjoyed being away from it all. No bright lights or noise for miles away, a break from it all. The weather was beautiful it was warm and clear, not a cloud in the sky. We swam and fished in the deep water of the John Bull Creek, and gathered firewood for our second night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After putting the kids to sleep in the tent around 11:30 my girlfriend, Gail and I returned to the campfire and sat together talking, and watching the fire. After a few hours we noticed just how clear a night it was and decided to move away from the fire in order to look at the stars. We walked to a nearby shoddy bridge about 30 ft. from our tent and looked towards the heavens. The sky full of stars, galaxies, and planets and the occational jet or satelite streaked across the sky. We knew morning was comming because in the east you could see the sky starting to brighten. The loons started to sing, a sure sign of daybreak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the eatly morning hours just before day break things started getting weird. I noticed a strange looking light far off in the distance unlike anything eles I ever had seen it seemed to be zig-zaging, so I pointed it out to Gail. It seemed very far away but as we focused on it, we noticed it was comming towards us. It seemed unbelivable it was heading straight for us. I even made a half-hearted joke to Gail about it being a U.F.O but soon we realized it was no joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never belived it posible but as we watched suddenly it was 200-300 ft. away it was large and super reflective with lights all around its outer edge that change colors from a deep red to a light yellow in a circular patern and a bright glowing ball on the center of its bottom. It made no noise. It lit the sky around it. I put my hand to my face and could not belive my eyes. Myself and Gail were terified, We were afraid to run and by the size of it, running seemed pointless. Then we noticed futher off on the right and left of the first ship further of there were two more. the sky was yellowish red and you could see the outline of the trees they were behind. We just sat there and looked at it not really knowing what to do. So we did nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing we know they are gone, it is no longer daybreak. The sky is dark the loons are no longer singing it is 1:00 A.M. again. We return to the tent and sit by the fire and try and figure out what had happened but for some unknown reason we are not frighted and want to leave we decided to wait until morning. We start to drift of to sleep near the fire and are suddenly awakend by a loud growl/hiss and the ground trembled under us. I awake and grab my shot-gun and take a shot in the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was was gone, it made no noise leaving. It may of been bear but a bear makes noise when running in deep wood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say we left, the Osburn Depot and the John Bull Creek never to return again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we may never know what we say or heard that night but one thing i know there are more thing out there than I will ever know,,,or want to.<n>

Almost immediately I saw that there were 2 other lights travelling in formation with the first - 2 in front, slightly offset, and one in the rear, about 3 times the distance between the first two.  Longest distance between them, about 1 inch at arm&#39;s length.  They were first seen a bit SSW, quickly moved to almost directly overhead, then faded out in the NNE.  They followed the plane of the Milky Way, which was clearly. Length of time I had them in view, approximately 5 minutes - I gave thought to getting my wife up but soon realized there was probably not enough time.  It was 4am when I went in the house immediately after losing sight of them.   In size and speed they appeared to be sattelites - if there had been only one that is what I would have assumed.  Even so, my thought when I saw the first light was that the color of it was a bit  red/orange-ish for what I had been used to seeing as a sattelite.  I thought it was interesting but then when I saw the 2 others, the color difference became quite noticable against the background of stars in the sky. I have a wood products business and have a private pilots license, although I have not flown in some time.  Feel free to contact me if you wish.  Could these have been sattelites?  Are sattelites deployed in this manner?<n>

I was walking back to my process building from the shower when I saw two very bright white strobes in the sky. I stopped to watch them, and noticed that instead of being next to each other (as in wingtip strobes) they were trailing. The appearance of the strobes was such that they appeared to be at a fairly low altitude. There were no other lights (as in tail or belly beacons, nav lights, or anti-collision). I was looking north, and the lights moved in a slightly curving path from roughly NW to NE. They moved at a fairly slow pace. Because the lights appeared to be at low altitude, I tried to listen for some kind of noise. It was absolutely silent. I have been involved in avaition my entire life, and I have NEVER seen anything like this before. The sighting lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.<n>

We had driven about 3/4 of a mile from the valleys edge and pulled off onto an approach into a field and  we all got out to observe the sky. We were all just standing there when all of a sudden , one of my nephews yelled out &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; We looked off into the northwesr sky &amp; at about a 10:00 position were two &#34;Starlike &#34; objects , rotating around each other at a high rate of speed.  They did this for a few rotations and then one object took off in a westerly direction and the second object  sped off at a high rate of speed in an Easterly direction. These objects were a very long way off and seemed to be mixed in with the stars.  The second object was heading east at a high rate of speed and then seemed to slow down and  drop into an arch, or half circle pattern,   until it rseemed to reach it&#39;s original path and then it accelerated rapidly again in an Easterly direction. It proceeded like this for a short distance and then dropped into that pattern again and then back up into it&#39;s original path. It carried on doing this until it eventually went out of sight in the Eastern sky. I had  binoculars with me and even with them it appeared to be nothing more than a star gone crazy. The object travelled right across the sky  in this pattern until it disappeared. In the excitement of watching this , all four of us forgot all about the first object that had sped off  to the west .We don&#39;t know what type of flight pattern it took. My nephews, brother &amp; myself had never observed anything like this before or since. When we returned to our campsite my nephews, both teenagers, were so excited about this that they still talk about it to this day. I had no idea as to who we should report this to, or if we should, but after listening to Art Bell&#39;s show on Feb 5/01 I thought i! should report it for what it&#39;s worth. We know it was something out of the ordinary and were amazed at the way it manouvered.   My brother who was with us , and who has been employed by the Provincial government for nearly 30 years , was equally amazed at this and is convinced that it is nothing that was made on earth.<n>

It was slide slipping like a blimb with NO noise as you would expect a blimp to do in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 18:00 (6 P.M.), on 7/13/99 at Owens Beach in the Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, WA. The sky was clear blue with NO clouds whatsoever. It was late afternoon and my 2 year old son and I were looking at aircraft leaving and approaching Sea-Tac airport. From Owens Beach, airplanes appear to be approximately 5,000 feet in altitude and about 1 to 5 miles away depending on which aircraft we were looking at on a particular moment. All the commercial craft had that late afternoon reflectivity that makes them really stand out against the blue sky. ALL the airplanes we saw had visible control surfaces on them and made the usual jet &#39;noise&#39;. All, that is, EXCEPT this one. I was looking over my right shoulder. From the South East, coming about the direction of Ruston Way, here in Tacoma, was what I thought to be a Boeing 777. But, it had no discernable wings that I could see. It appeared to be then approximately 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude and about 3 miles away, (about the width of my thumb at arms length). I then listened for any jet &#39;noise&#39;, there were none. Then I looked at the tail. The only tail visible was a shorter than usually vertical stabilizer. A little background is due here; I am always looking at aircraft in the sky (I have had a love for them and have been doing so for many years now). The reason I bring this up is to relay to you that I know how they should look, sound, and behave, dependant on the conditions and time of day. Back to what happened; The craft is heading almost overhead now and I can still see NO wings or horizontal stabilizers. There is still NO noise either! It is now about the size of a half-dollar at arm&#39;s length. The aircraft is now heading from over head, due north, to the southern tip of Vashon Island. Now I am really concentrating on the physical behavior of the craft as it heads due north from my position. Let&#39;s see; 1) Still NO noise 2) NO Wings 3) NO horizontal stabilizer 4) Shorter than normal vertical stabilizer 5) The fuselage shape is correct for a Boeing 777. Blunt nose and a tail that comes to a point, (NOT fat like a blimp, or even the shape of a 747 would be) 6) Speed looks right (much too fast for a blimp) approximately 300-400 mph 7) Consistent forward momentum 8) Pitch is flat, (a little too flat, NOT climbing OR descending) 9) Wait a minute, it&#39;s the yaw... That isn&#39;t right... What I noticed about the yaw is this; What ANY aircraft does in a turn is bank. This didn&#39;t. It would yaw (turn) 30-40 degrees to the left in a smooth motion taking about 5 to 10 seconds to do so WITHOUT banking! The vertical stabilizer is still completely vertical. Then it would turn forward (due north, FOLLOWING it&#39;s forward momentum direction) in the same 5-10 second period. Then it would turn right, the same 30-40 degrees at the same 5-10 second period. All turning id done WITHOUT modifying its forward momentum&#39;s direction. I have observed a lot of aircraft in my lifetime and NEVER seen anything like this. It was behaving like whoever was controlling this craft was being as inconspicuous as possible and controlling it so it would &#39;blend-in&#39; with the other commercial aircraft in the area. One final thing about the commercial flight path for this date was that this was the only commercial &#39;looking&#39; craft that was NOT in the same flight corridor. All the commercial aircraft I saw this day from Owens Beach were traversing from the N.E. to the S. W. (or visa versa). This craft game from the S.E., headed almost overhead, and then headed due North from me.<n>

Upon looking directly at it, I saw an object which had a definate triangular shape, but transparent, with a watery, wavy appearance, like heat waves seen on the highway from a distance. The outer &#34;frame&#34; of the object appeared more prodominate that its&#39; interior.  The weather here has been rainy for the last 24 hours, the atmosphere, although not foggy, was heavy with humidity and misting rain.  I observed the object fly in a silent sweeping motion across the sky, in an easterly direction from a sugar cane field across the River Road, across the levee and out of sight.  It&#39;s altitude was approximately 100 feet, its speed was approximately 80-90 mph.  It&#39;s size was approximately that of a midsized passenger airplane.  I&#39;m guessing about it&#39;s size, altitude and speed, however, it was plainly visable, although transparent, &#34;a clear mercury look&#34; . I even blinked my eyes thinking that I was seeing &#34;spots&#34;, the object was still there.<n>

It appeared to have 8 to 10 smaller white objects flitting around it.  The main object was spherical in shape with the smaller objects also being round.

In that time we saw  approx 10 objects. the strange thing was some were different. One of them started out as a bright light hovering to going up just above the tree line and it turned off the light and there was a red light blinking, one was a sphere and it had lights around the middle of it . I have lived in a mile radius of this sighting all my life and have always seen weird things and other people I know have seen the same. I think it might have something to do with Rickenbacker Airport that is located about 5 miles away and I have heard that they moght be keeping something there. And there was no planes going or taking off during the hours of 11:30 to 12:30 pm .<n>

When I tried to leave, it lifted my truck up about 5 or 6 feet, then let it drop. I was able to get away, and drove to Carlin and spent the night there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After working on my truck, I decided to test her out on a long drive. I started the drive from Elko, NV, at about 19:30. I had been driving for about an hour and a half (I know this because the CD I was listening to takes about that long to play, and it was just about ending) when I saw this huge black mass blotting out the sky! It had know real shape, except for what looked like a point at the front (at least I think it was the front!) It had little lights on the underside of it that kind of made it look like part of the starry sky, but you could still see the craft, because lights coming from the Mts. and other surroundings vaguely showed its sillouette. The object made no sound. I stopped and shut down the truck, hoping this craft(?) wouldn&#39;t see me, but it did. It flew then stopped right over me. I got in the truck and turned the key, hoping it wouldn&#39;t turn into some bad horror movie, where the car NEVER starts! But it did! However, the truck wasn&#39;t moving. I realized that the truck was in the air about 5 or 6 feet. I was going to jump, but then the truck came crashing down. I rolled off  to the side, realizing that if I had jumped when I did, I would have been crushed. I sped away. I was amazed and really happy that my truck survived the fall. I drove to Carlin, NV, and spent the night there. The next day I checked out my truck, and I only broke some bushings, a front brake caliper, and the 2 back brake drums. If it&#39;s possible, I would like to be contacted via e-mail at: ((personal data deleted))<n>

Neither of us have sighted a UFO before. We were returning from our walk, about 5 minutes from our home, when my boyfriend pointed to the south sky and said &#34;look, twins&#34;, jokingly. As I turned to look, I at first assumed they were planes, but as my boyfriend and I continued to look, the two lights stayed in exactly the same spot, parallel to each other and about two inches apart if you were to measure the distance with your fingers.  The objects were about twice the size an brightness of Venus, which at the time was off in the west sky. We were dumbfounded, and even though I kept repeating &#34;They must be planes&#34;, we both clearly saw and stated that they were not acting like planes.  They stayed in exactly the same place, pulsating but not flashing. Then, to our amazement, a third appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, to form a triangle to the other two. The third was not as bright at first, but then grew in brightness to look just like the other two.  They remained in this inverted triangle formation for some time, a few minutes or so.  At this point, a car with 4 young men in it, all aged between about 18 and 22, drove up beside us, also having seen the sight. They said they&#39;d seen it down on the road, and were looking for a clearer view of it.  At the time, we were up on a hill. We all agreed that these did not appear to be planes, and my boyfriend and myself expressed that we were glad not to be the only ones to see it.  The men drove off, and said goodbye pleasantly. Then, the light in the upper left corner of the triangle began to leave.  It moved slowly to the east, decreasing in brightness rather quickly.  Still the other two remained in the same spot. Then the bottom sphere began to follow the first one, heading in the same path.  The last one remained in the same spot for about 5 more minutes, an we watched, not moving.  Then, it too began to head east.  We &#34;followed&#34; it, as our apartment is in that direction.  We thought we might be able to run in the house, grab the binocs, come back out and catch it...but by the time we came out it was gone. My boyfriend and I stayed out there, watching the sky for about another 15 minutes, but saw nothing.  We both agreed that neither of us had ever seen any objects in the sky behave that way in our lives. We&#39;re both familiar with planes, because we see them in the sky all the time, and saw many tonight.  Portland airport is not far from here. But I know in my gut these were not planes.  They felt different.<n>

I am 42 years old. On the night of this sighting, I was out closing up my workshop for the night. It was very clear out with no moon or clouds.  I was facing south while walking into the house.  I always like to look at the stars and happened to notice a bright one straight up to the south. It was gold in color with the same brightness as Venus after sunset. It was then that I notice that it was moving to the east-northeast at a rapid speed. The light was constant and bright, no flicker.  As it traversed across my fied of vision it went behind the top floor of my home.  I ran around to the front yard and continued to follow its path across the sky.  By now it was to the east of me and it suddenly gave off a bright flash of reflected light as from a mirror. It then started to decrease in brightness as it disappeared over the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  I note that the light remained steady as I viewed it from its aft end. No afterburners, or other lights were seen.  I have seen the same kind of light twice before only traveling from due west to due east in the predawn hours.<n>

Looked like silver balls from the distance I was at.  What caught my attention was the flying they did.  The first one was going west then stopped, changed directions by about 90 degrees.  Then the second one came from the South and they circled each other for a few minutes.  Then one flew off back to the South and the other stayed in place for a few minutes then flew slowly to the west.  There were several aircraft from DFW airport in this same general area and if it was not my imagination then some of the pilots should have seen this.  They may not want to report it.  But if they do this should serve as an additional witness to the events.  I had to go back to work while the object was still visible.<n>

It seemed to change from shiny chrome to dull matte grey, as if it was revolving.  It disappeared for a few seconds then reappeared a bit further away doing the same movements as before.  It disappeared again for the last time.  Any ideas?<n>

Of the four vehicles only 2 appeared as almost 200% larger than the other two.  The smaller vehicles seems to tags the 2 larger vehicles in a almost regular formation or line of the larger vehicles.  The night was cool and crystal clear with what was unlimited visability, so clear and dark that I could see the gas in the milky way very distictivly, planet colors, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the front steps at my home looking at the sky, no moon out, 3200 ft. elev. in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  As I looked over the topsof the trees at some distance maybe 5 to 10 miles out I noticed 4 circular vehicles.  As I watched for the 5+ minutes they appeared to move in quick trangular steps, almost as in a pattern.  I believe the position they moved was in the South Southwestern skies as my view was a southern exposure, always just hugging the tree tops so they would have must have been at an altitude that varied from maybe as low as -2k ft. to maybe +10K ft.  At a noticable lowere left corner these vehicles, not necessarily together, the larger circles (more of a whiteish/blue with occasions of amber in color) would go from this position to a position through my center vision (assuming tht is 3200 ft.) to almost twice that height moving up and right at say 40 to 50 degrees to their top altitude so this is where I beleive they had moved to maybe 10K ft.  Each of the larger disc&#39;s would have a trailing smaller disk.  Comparativly looking around -2x smaller than the large disk (they had a more reddish color but at time appeared to stobe and the color became more of a flashy silver or shiney electric blue arcing color) and the smaller vehicles alway followed the larger disc without exchanging from one larger to the other, always staying in an almost direct pattern following the larger disc.  I as watched I thought of what this may be, certainly not aircraft as the speed of the position changes, ratio and excess of position movement was way to complex.  Testing my thoughts on this I watched the larger disc move from )using the lower triangular position above left slightly below the trees but visable throught the tree tops, it would (using the old one-thosand &amp; one, etc. method of counting seconds) move from this position to the top position of the triangle before I could get to to one-thousand...  Accounting for the estimated distance of 5 to maybe 15 miles the fact it would have travelle! d from maybe 2000 or less feet to easily 10000 feet in that time, coverning my visual horizion of say 1/10th these objects were booking some MPH. I heard no noise, no booms, nothing except wind in the trees.  As each disc continued to do this I sat and watch the larger discs move at different points no mirroring no pattern copy but very simular triangular moves, each being followed by the smaller dot as compared to the larger disc the smaller vehicles actually looked like dots, but circular with diamaters.  The smaller dots would at time mirror the larger disc but as a rule they would appear to stray a minor fraction of the larger disc course change and as a rule they appeared to keep varied distances from the larger disc.  No real rules that I could see where the smaller disc would stay exactly in position like a trailer may in the wind, but more like if a rubber band was attached slinging behind.  The smaller dots stayed the larger disc with mainly the same move but at a varied speed, sometime as if to pass it (but never did) and other times as if it was being bungeed in reverse to leave it (but never did) only to follow at diffrent rates back to the larger disc.  As I watched for almost 5 minutes this dance between the 2 larger discs and 2 smaller dots for each larger disc the rate of my counting off the timing was almost always consistant until the very end of the sighting.  As I watched the patterns (triangles) near the end the motions by both started to flatten out this pattern until one large disc trailed off to the right at about 10 to 15 degrees from my horizon, from a dead stop and as I thought of these seconds counting in my head, the departure off and up into the horizon was so fast my count was like one...and it was gone with the dot.  The second large disc and dot stayed around for about another 30 to 45 secs. and it appeared to dash off straight in my direction, it was not quite as fast of a departure more like the pattern timing but I expected to see it get maybe a bit larger as it came str! aight towards me but it didn&#39;t and if it did I am certain because of the speed my eyes and mind probably couldn&#39;t determine a size change.  In closing the only other comment is that the larger disc kept the almost bluish/white with an occasional amber coloring, but the dots were always in flux and only seems to go electric blue in color as they reached the apex of that bundged thrust either in reverse or in a forward return motion (like on a bunge cord down the up) as you reach the thrusting end motion.  I sat for may 20 more minutes looking to see if there was any further action and I saw nothing unusual, a few obvious planes, a satellite a shooting star or two, but nothing else that evening.  That&#39;s pretty much my report.<n>

(i am a mechanic for a major airline and work at dulles. i live 17 miles from the airport and am located at the southern approach to dulles).i then noticed that the light had dissapeared. then about 30 seconds later the reapeared again in the same spot. i then ran in to get my video camera and started taping the event.the craft just hovered very low and in the same spot for a time. i zoomed in on the object and i could see that it was not totally spherical. i could see that the top had a &#34;w&#34; shape to and the bottom had a triangle shape to it. i continued to tape the craft and noticed small jet aircraft circling the object. they were not commercial airliners on approach for sure. the object seemed to be moving awat from me but it never lost altitude from my position. during all the taping the craft dissapeared and reapeared about 3 times and never moved.the jet aircraft kept circling this for the whole time. the craft finally dissapeared and i never saw it again for the rest of the night.<n>

Sorry for the delay in filing a report. I live in central NJ in Middlesex County. As I am an avid skywatcher, and we are on the flight path of Newark Airport, I see many airplanes at various levels of the sky. (Not to mention the chemtrails.) On Sunday July 11, 1999, in Sayreville, NJ, travelling south on a local road in my car I glanced at the wide open sky and saw slightly to my right, a light, obviously a plane. Scanning left, almost in front of me, I saw another light, again, obviously a plane. (Both were high in the sky.) I continued to look and slightly to my left (almost due south) when I saw the &#39;object&#39;. It was like, plane, plane, &#34;Oh, my god, what is that??&#34; The &#39;object&#39; was a large roundish oval. It was about the length of a bic lighter held at arm&#39;s length, maybe a little longer. It glowed with an orange glow. The glow sort of looked like the glow of a light bulb when there isn&#39;t enough power going to it. On the top of the oval was some sort of cabin-like structure that sat close to the top of the object and closely matched the curve of the oval. It could have been easily missed as it was the same glowing orange color. There were possibly windows or something on this &#39;cabin&#39; but it was hard to see as it was so close to the main body of the object. There were three lights on the bottom, one at the &#39;front&#39; one in the &#39;middle&#39;, and one at the &#39;end&#39; that lit quickly in sequence, the first one on/off, the second one on/off, then the third one on/off. I remember red and green but I don&#39;t recall the middle light&#39;s color. I have seen many blimps fly over and it was not a blimp or any other type of flying vehicle I had ever seen before. Also there were no &#39;tail fins&#39; and it had a smooth bottom with no cabin. I didn&#39;t notice any noise, but if it made any I was probably to far away to hear it anyway. It didn&#39;t have a distinct outline like a blimp, but you could see the roundish-oval shape clearly. It hovered and didn&#39;t seem to be moving. Unfortunately, I was moving. I glanced in my mirror and saw I couldn&#39;t pull over and the driver behind me didn&#39;t seem to be looking at it. I was alone at the time. It was about 6:30 or 7 pm and the sun was just starting to set. It would have been easy to miss the object, despite it&#39;s size I guess because of the dull glow and the color of the sky. I lost sight of it in a cluster of trees and couldn&#39;t see it again because of them. This is my first sighting despite many hours of skywatching and I hope you can use this.If you need to contact me e-mail me a number and I can call back during the day as I work nights. If possible I will try to send a drawing via snail mail.<n>

I can see the pentagon from my friend&#39;s balacony.  At approximately 1730 hrs I opened my eyes and looked into the sky.  It was sunny and the sky was clear blue with scattered levels noctilucent clouds.  I could easily see jets passing at 30K feet, and birds flying through the lower scattered clouds.  Visibility was good - excellent. While gazing into the sky, I saw what appeared to be 4 light/shiny colored objects that were enlongated oval in shape...they appeared to be way up there.  They were traveling in north to south direction, as a group, moving slow and smoothly, at speeds that varied with each one. The prevaling wind was pushing clouds in a east-west direction. These objects did not appear to be high altitude or retail. Throughout my life, from time to time, I have observed helium balloons in flight until they disappeared.  These objects did not look like balloons.  One would slowly catch up with the other and another would seem to slow down. My friend also watched the objects and thought they were balloons. Then again, I&#39;m not sure if he believes in UFO like myself.  Over the course of 15 mins, we watched the objects continue to move and finally, disappear. End of report...<n>

Clear night, no clouds, no moon of what I can remember, dusk. My friend ((name deleted)) who is from Austria and I were watching the annual summer Meteor Showers, and I noticed that Venus was not out. I turned my head to the south to look for metors for about 30seconds and saw none, and then went back to the North West Postion  and saw that there was a sliver/white dimond up in the sky. I thought it was Venus at first, but then it was dimond shape and not round like Venus is. It was located over a part of a camp ground called Tent Town. It just sat there, kind of shiny like Venus, and made no noise. I asked ((name deleted)) about it, and he said that he didn&#39;t see if came, We both watched it for about 7 minutes, and then it blinked out. I&#39;m not sure if Adolf watched if for the whole time, but I watched it for the whole time, I didn&#39;t take my eyes away for a minute. It was just there and then it was gone again. Adolf saw it too. We were kind of creeped out so we went to our own camps and went to bed. That&#39;s it.<n>

Still watching the object, a search-light went out from the object to the ground! Then I thought maybe it was a plane, perhaps turning for the airport, but it stayed on course. Then I thought it might be a helicopter....THEN the long bright white light turned right over on me!!!...then the search-light turned off and the light orange object was still on its course, heading south. ! came into the house and told my husband to hurry up and see this and i was already gone. The sky was still perfectly clear with very bright stars. I got enough courage to go out about a half hour later, but saw nothing.<n>

I am 48 yrs. old, and my friend is 51. We were in the yard working in the garden. My friend saw the object first and called my attention to it. The day had been warm and sunny, with no clouds. There had been some air traffic earlier, just a couple of small planes. The air space above our home is not in the flight path of the local airport. We were not able to determine distance of the craft.  It was moving slower than a passenger jet, but faster than a small plane. We were both struck by the fact that the crat was completely silent, had no wings, no tail fin, no contrail. Atmospheric displacement noted extending around craft, rather sphere like in shape. The sky was clear, no clouds.<n>

It then sank below the tree line. About 10 minutes later it rose out of the trees and traveled straight at me at a constant speed. It then hovered about 30 feet in the air less then 50 feet from the house. The object then traveled north gaining altitude at a steady rate, its color changed black and could be seen for a long time before disapearing. It made no noise and created no air disturbance.<n>

Rotating disc appeared, approached slowly then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 10th at the baseball stadium in San Diego, I saw a UFO during the game. I am a telepath and a clairvoyant, so when I heard the message to &#34;look up; you I might see a UFO&#34;, the only reason I hesitated was because I didn&#39;t want to look silly staring up at the sky while everybody else was looking at the game. I heard an airplane overhead, so that gave me a good excuse to look up. I looked above the plane and saw what appeared to be a white sphere. At this point I removed my sunglasses and put on my prescription sunglasses so that I could see clearly and they are not as dark. At first, I thought it must be a balloon except it remained stationary. Fortunately, three balloons were then released, so I then had the opportunity to compare the shape and movement of the balloons with the perfectly stationary, perfectly round sphere. My boyfriend was sitting directly in front of me. I discreetly asked him to look at the object and tell me what he thought it was. He said it was probably a balloon. I said I didn&#39;t think so and asked him to observe it for a while. About two minutes later he said, adamantly, &#34;That is NOT a balloon! It flashed!&#34; There was a girl sitting next to us. She asked what we were looking at. I told her it was a UFO, so then she began to observe its behavior, also. The UFO then disappeared for about a minute. It then reappeared, but it was now a little closer. About a minute later, it disappear again. It then reappeared, again. I decided to communicate with. I told them that I loved them and would they please come closer and prove to me that it was actually an extraterrestrial spacecraft. What followed next was truly incredible for me. It made a series of 90 degree angles and zigzags in rapid succession, ending with an exit to the left at an incredibly high rate of speed. It took my breath away. About a minute later, I observed another craft appear in the area from which the first one exited. This one had a flatter or disc-like shape as it moved toward me. It was extremely bright and sparkly, and rotated like a mirrored disco ball. It was absolutely gorgeous. After about two minutes, it just blinked out and did not reappear any more. I quickly called a UFO investigator on my cel phone so that I could have a record of the time.<n>

It had a vertical &#34;smokestack&#34; coming out of the top of it that was white. The body alternated dark on the top which sloped to a point like a roof, the middle was white with vertical sides and the bottom was dark and rounded like a bowl.  I estimate it&#39;s size at 100 feet tall and 60 feet wide.  It hovered, rising and settling verticaly and drifting to the southwest.  I was watching when it disappeared the first time. It darkened like a shadow fell across it and then their was a blur of sideways motion and it was gone.  I continued to search the sky for it as I continued west on I-80 and as I topped a hill there it was hanging in the sky again where before there was nothing.  I continued watching it rise and settle as it drifted to the west.  It seemed to be parrelleling the Interstate.  The rolling hills blocked my view once more and as I came back to the top of the next hill the object was gone.<n>

After moving to the north, the light started to fade, moving away from us to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I saw a light moving through the sky really slow. It was moving slightly to the north, very slowly. Every couple of minutes, the light would start to fade, and when it did, the object moved to the north a little faster than what it did before. As soon as the light came to a stop, it would become a little brighter. After the light moved for an estimated 5 miles (we were far away from the light), the light switched from a northward route to a south-west one. Eventually the object got so far away, we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. This whole sighting lasted about 25 to 30 minutes. The light changed colors from red to white. If someone wasn&#39;t watching the light close enough, they wouldn&#39;t be able to tell it was moving. Two of us witnessed this light, and we both checked to see if we were seeing the same things as the object moved. My friend and I have seen odd things before, but this one topped it off. Neither of us have seen anything like it.<n>

No pictures or video, Sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is not much to add to our breif description.  There were trees in the way for part of the time so we lost sight for a few minutes.  The orange ball that dropped was the same size when it left the other ball but then looked sort of tear shaped as it dropped and left a trail of orange looking like hanging by a string for just a second or two.  I saw the object coming from the north and by the time the others saw it we were looking at it going south.  There were no marker lights of any kind from our view point.  We live near PDX flight path and the Evergreen Airport in Vanc. WA.  The object was too high to be landing at Evergreen and heading in the wrong direction to be going to PDX.  We just thought someone else may have seen the object also or that you folks know what it might be??  No drugs or alcohol involved!!<n>

We saw some very unusual flashes of light and in one case, a object leaving the area of the Flash.  The first one was inside the Big Dipper - it looked like a bright explosion!!  The second flash occured in the SW night sky, it was very high above the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and &#34;flashed&#34; 4 times. The third flash was in the SE sky and consisted of 5 flashes. A object (like a satellite) was observed leaving the area of these flashes.  We also observed many objects moving in irregular patterns, changing directions &amp; dis-appearing. Anyone else in our area see anything?<n>

Noticed an airplane traveling west over lake. Turned to talk to someone in house and as I looked back I saw a new  very bright &#34;star&#34; in portion of sky I&#39;d been looking at. It was brighter, whiter &amp; larger than the brightest planet you&#39;d expect to see in the sky.  As I began to tell the others inside to come look, it grew brighter for second, then over a period of about five seconds grew dimmer and smaller as if it was going out.  Or as if it was going directly away a a high rate of speed.  I do not know.  It went &#34;out&#34; and in that part of the sky I could see other stars that were behind or beside  (?) it, but had trouble seeing in it&#39;s direct area (very small circle of the sky).  All this time the airplane I had seen earlier was traveling across the same aprox line of sight. I do not know what it was.  My first thought was a SuperNova which I&#39;m told is a extreme brightening of a star followed by it&#39;s dimming and going out.  (I&#39;m telling this only to aid in my description, not teach you what a SuperNova is!!) I am college educated, professional, sane , sober, drug free, 43 YO male and believe Im rational.<n>

I walked around his car to get a straight on view, but it had vanished. To give you an idea of the size, objects appearing on this horizon (the treetops I see are about one mile away) could be described this way: stars: a small bead planes: a marble local farm outdoor lights: a ping pong ball the glowing object: a soccer ball My brother, who is very opposed to ufo discussion and would have handily given any other explanation he could think of, had no idea what to make of it.<n>

It first appeared coming up behind Stone Mountain, (GA) on the southwest side. At first I thought it was a balloon, at some distance because balloons land / take off at a nearby airport. Then the object went up quickly and then changed elevation quickly. When it moved north, it did not move like an airplane or helicopter. It had a smooth but varied motion. Almost a looping type motion. Then it went west, coming directly overhead, with tremendous velocity and gaining altitude until out of site. My wife also saw the object. We were at the Stone Mountain laser show. Everybody was watching the show. I would be interested if you had any other reports. I&#39;d like to emphasize this was not an airplane, a helicopter, balloon, or a stray light from the show. Thanks for taking this report. ((name and contact information deleted))<n>

All of a sudden a large light appeared to have been switched on high the sky in the ENE direction.  It was so bright that it caught our attention out of the corner of our eye. It was yellowish to white, and appeared to be just about the size of a dime.  After watching it stationary in the sky for about 5 seconds, the light immediately diminished to about the size of a pea and appeared white.  There was no movement.  About 5 seconds later the light dropped to about the size of a bright star, still with no movement.  A second after this change in size, the light started moving right to left about the speed of a satellite.  Movement lasted for about another 5 seconds, and then immediately disappeared. The sky was beautiful.  No clouds at all. The object or light was about 65-70 degrees from the horizon.  About the same level as the N. star.  Because of size the initial light appeared relatively close.  After it had dropped to the size of a bright star, it appeared to be at least satellite altitude.<n>

My wife and I love to sit in our hot tub and watch the aircraft, shooting stars and satellites go by.  One night in early July we were watching some aircraft along the airway (providence to NY which runs northeast to southwest, slightly south of us)with all their lights on and strobes flashing.  We both noticed a light of normal brightness and size east of us (somewhere over Rhode Island)traveling across this path to the southeast.  This white light didn&#39;t have any nav or strobe lights around it.  It was traveling horizontally just above the horizon to our right and away from us in a slight climb when it became very bright for a couple of seconds and disappeared.  It was traveling about the same speed as the other aircraft 250mph+/- and way too slow to be a shooting star.  Definitely not fireworks either.  I know aircraft and this was not conventional behavior.  The brightness was like that of a typical white taillight and then a landing light being turned on and pointed exactly at you - very bright.  I&#39;m sure that is not what it was - no aircraft could turn around that fast point at us and still travel along its path backwards.  And when I say it disappeared, I mean nothing left of it.  Also, no sound.  We could hear the other aircraft that night.<n>

He said that he heard it coming and it had an additional sound like the whirring of a helicopter along with the jet sound so he waited outside for it to go overhead. I was amazed at what I saw, my first thought was that it had to be experimental. The entire craft could best be described as arrow-shaped and a silver-goldish color. Not a chrome silver but not iron gray either. It was flying fairly low like a plane in a holding pattern would do at a small airport. How high that is in feet I dont know. The jet was flying straight north, the direction helicopters fly over our house all the time and only just a little higher than that. It was the size of a medium sized commercial passenger plane. We watched it fly over for almost a minute before it was lost behind the trees, so it was not going fast. I did not hear the whirring sound my son heard, and we could hear each other talking so it could not have been very loud; no high-whining sound like a jet makes, and it was low enough to be deafening. I pointed things out to my son as it was going over and said, &#34;now quickly go draw a picure of it before you forget what it looks like.&#34;  The front of it was very much shaped like a wide arrow-head, rather than more pointed with what looked like antennas pointing towards the back from the two points. Then there was a very long middle section, disproportionate from the rest. Too thin and too long, and round like a pencil. It didn&#39;t seem to make sense. (We had time to talk about what it could be for while we watched it go overhead.) We didn&#39;t notice any markings or outside antennas on this section. It seemed to be completely sleek. The tail section was much larger than the front section by at least 3:1 and reminded me more of the stealth design in its shape only the edges were far less rounded. On the back I saw 2 round, large, black shapes (my husband said they sounded like thrusters, I though they were landing wheels but bigger) and I saw a little of what looked like cages on top of each side. (My husband said these sounded like intakes.) I remember seeing an antenna sticking up somewhere and fins sticking up on each side. The back section was more familiar and less remarkable than the rest of it. (The rest of it was very remarkable.) In fact the front of it looked so flat that it looked more like it had rudders on each side of a long pencil than anything else. The back was flattened also but not to that degree.  Nothing like a cockpit was seen. I very much think it was some kind of (fighter?) jet and wonder if it was coming from a military base my son says is south of here.  But why would it fly so low straight into the Gary, IN airport traffic and why at such a conspicuous time of day?  We have been looking for something on line for a few days to see if anyone else has seen anything like it.  We even looked at Boeing and Lockheed&#39;s homepages to see if we could get a clue as to it&#39;s design and origin and found nothing. We thought you might have heard something about it and it might explain some other sightings in the area that were less visible.  I am a 38 year old mother of 5 children and my son is 17, working at a bible conference grounds and an avid computer enthusiast. I don&#39;t know if you can let me know anything about this, but we are very curious and would appreciate it it you could fill us in.  Thanks for your time.<n>

Upon lookin up at the jet, a 747 I think, I saw two black circles on both sides of the plane, looked like they were flying along side it. The jet was white. Then I saw them move around the plane in very fluid motion. I called for my other son who&#39;s 13 to come outside and witness this. The black circles were then back at the sides of the aircraft. Then one went around the nose of the plane, then the other around the black, then back to the sides again. When these circles or spheres were on the side, they were below the wings, looking almost like they were attached to the tip of the wings on the undersides. They continued moving around the plane, then going back to the sides untill the plane was out of view. My son saw a blue marking on the tail of the plane. I didn&#39;t notice much about the plane because I was looking at the black balls. Less than a minute later a very fast small jet followed the flight path of the plane. I could hear it but couldn&#39;t see it, my son saw it and said that it was the same color as the sky, gray. This jet was considerably louder than the plane with the black circles. I&#39;ve mailed you a diagram of the circles in relation to the plane.<n>

I was glancing about the tree tops at my home and noticed this shinny metallic object, I live near a Reserve Air base so seeing aircraft is typical we have a stelth here and many tankers. This object was just not right, it was silent, and travelled at a altitude that was upper mid levels, to low to be commercial and to high to be leaving the base. It&#39;s speed was not extremely fast. ( if you held a quarter up to the sky, it would travel the span in 3 or 4 seconds at upper mid levels about 15 to 20 thousand ft.) It had no contrails and with a passing of a cold front it should be cold enough at that elevation to produce them. It had no propellers as in Heicopter, nor did I view it to have wings. It also made a no banking turn to the south east. Than out of my sight range. I had a son run to get my camera but was to late. At these levels I could see that the ( craft) was a egg shaped more short than long. My observation skills are good, I am a meteorology student, working on METAR. I am open minded, I believe I have had a several spanning year contact beginning at the age of 7, and have never told anyone till this moment.<n>

The sky was mostly clear with the temperature in the mid 70&#39;s.  I was looking to the west and observed a passenger jet making a low level approach towards the south to the Des Moines International Airport.  Shortly after the plane passed I observed what looked like a white star higher in the sky.  It was at this time that I also noticed that the star was moving to the north.  I pointed out the object to my co-worker and he stated that it was probably a satellite.  I continued to watch the object until it was blocked out by some high light clouds.  As the clouds passed by I was unable to pick up the moving object again. Having observed stars and a planet that night I noted that the object did not twinkle like the other stars and it did not have flashing lights on it like aircraft would have.  I was unaware that we would have satellites going from south to north and not in a geocentric orbit. The Big Dipper constellation was visable and the object passed just under this constellation as it passed to the north. I work as a security officer for ((facility deleted)) in Des Moines, Iowa.

I saw exactly what he described about six miles northeast flowing over Bald Eagle Lake in the summer of 1999.  I was at a bonfire at the lake and taking a piss behind a fish shack and I looked over at the lake and I saw this glowing green orb cruising about thirty feet above the water at aproximately 40 - 60 MPH. We were not drinking, we were all about sixteen.  It was the same color as the green light at a stop light. It was round, and seemed to opporate under its own power.  I watched it for about five seconds as it flew in a horizontal direction about thirty feet above the water.  It slightly dipped in its trajectory, then it imediately leveled out and disapeared behind the cat tails that blocked my view at my left. It made absolutely no noise.  There were a group of about twenty of us and in spite of my screaming and pointing only one person managed to see it ou! t of the corner of his eye.  I considered that it could have been a flare, however, it flew in a horizontal direction, then dipped, then leveled out.  After I explained what I saw over and over to the group there wasn&#39;t a single person that was not convinced that I had witnessed something incredible, which could not be dismissed as a firework or flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then I felt like I was being watched, so I turned my wheelchair around and there it was. A glowing blue green object just above the tree line at he end of my yard. My first instinct was to get out of there, but the power had failed on the wheel chair. All I could do was sit there in terror for the next 3 minutes as this thing hovered silently back and forth across the back of my yard. I am not sure what to make of this. I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life. It kept changing colors, and never made sound. I was scared to death! It eventually shot straight up and dissappeard into the sky. Then my chair came on and I got the heck back in the house. I was afraid to tell anyone about this until now. I hope you believe me. I was very skeptical, but no longer! Thanks for your time.

I was sitting in a patio chair w/my head leaned back against the house facing east. It was no more then 5 minuets when I noticed a silent object moving across the sky. My first thought was that it was a large bird, only because of its size &amp; the fact that it was silent. I immediately realized this was no bird, it had a translucent appearance. I say it appeared translucent not because it was see through but because the object was so faint that it was not that easy to see. After watching it for about 4 seconds it started to go out of sight over the house. So I jumped out of my chair, took a few steps away from the house &amp; faced south, never taking my eyes off the object. It was then that I got a real good look at the object. It was a silent moving, triangular shaped object with a faint reddish light in each of its 3 corners. It was moving in a straight line north to south, just west of do south to be exact. The speed of the object was about twice the speed that the average satellite moves across the sky. The size of the object was about the size of my thumb nail at arms lenght or a little smaller then the triangle in the constellation Lyra to be exact. The height of the object I can only guess at. I would say that it was at about the height that an average airplane would fly at, not a jet but a smaller prop airplane. I discribed it as being 1 object w/3 faint lights but for all I know it may have been 3 or more seperate objects grouped together. I discribed it as 1 object because it never changed its shape, size, speed or direction. The object seemed to be on a precise course, was in no hurry to get where it was going &amp; was definitely trying to go undeteced. I feel very lucky to have seen this object, it was not bright enough to see out of the corner of your eye like you can do with a shooting star or a satellite, most of the stars in the sky where ! brighter then the object. You had to be in the right place at the right time &amp; looking in the right direction to see this object. I am &amp; for over 30 years have been a backyard astronomer. I have always had a fascination for the night sky. As a boy I spent many weekends &amp; summers in the remote north woods of Wisconsin learning the night sky. I know more about the stars &amp; planets then the average person so there is no mistaking what I saw, the only question I have is, what did I see?<n>

It was traveling fast enough to cover a quarter of the sky in about 6 seconds. It was the fastest satelite I have ever seen, so it caught my interest and I immediately thought it may have been a missle.  It&#39;s path was nearly directly overhead about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon to the west.  About 1 min after I lost visual contact with the object to the north, there was a bright star that appeared in the sky about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon and about 5 degrees north from direct east. It appeared in the constelation south east of Cassiopea.  This Bright Star was 2-3 time brighter than anything in the sky, about the intesity of aircraft landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so briliant that I immediately thought that a new supernova had just been seen, but the brightness faded and the star dissapeared after about 1 min.  Because of the coincedence of the events I surrmise that they were connected. My gut feeling is that the bright Flash may have been in response to the very quick satelite Moving from the south to the north.  A Star Wars defence mechanism or simmilar devise. It was the strangest thing I have seen in the sky for a long time, hopefully someone else can verify the existance of this bright flash object.<n>

I don&#39;t smoke in the house so I sit on the steps out front and look at the stars. Approx. 3 weeks ago I was watching a very bright star when it started to MOVE! I opened the door and excitedly asked my roommate to get my binoculars. We observed the object for approx. 5 minutes until it dipped down below the tree line. Last night the same thing happened and we were laughing about our UFO, wondering what was so interesting in that same area to bring it back. We both called it a UFO simply because we could not identify it. That observation was only for a little over a minute.  BUT, tonight as we were both having the pre-sleep cigarette, I noticed movement to my right, not in the same location as before but close, it was huge and moving very quickly off to the side of the house. We both could see the shape very clearly, but retrieved the binoculars again for a better look. V shaped with 2 white lights on each end and one white light in the middle.  The sound was an odd low hum. Surprising to me because on the other two occasions I had not been aware of any sound. (Possibly because it was not as close previously as it was tonight? I don&#39;t know.) There was a reddish glow coming from somewhere on the craft but I could not pinpoint it due to the intensity of the whites. We watched it pass by the side of the house and back beyond the trees.  Duration? I&#39;m not sure, possibly a minute, I was too overwhelmed to have any real feeling for how long I watched it. Definately time to buy a camera.<n>

Observers were waiting for a small private fireworks show when it was spotted.  Initially it appeared as if three slightly red stars were moving in unison, then the observer realized that light in the background was disappearing and reappearing on the other side as the craft moved, signifying that it was a solid object.  The sides were about 2.5cm or an inch at arms length.  The object was a black, right isosceles triangle with a slightly red light at each corner.  There was also a very faint red ring at the center that was not immediately noticeable being about a quarter to a third of its overall size.  I can&#39;t give a directional orientation, but it moved across the sky totally silent with a constant speed.  The sighting lasted around 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We spotted this hugh light in the southwest sky.  Being curious as to what it was, we watched it for 10 to 15 seconds and it just hung in the sky.  There was an airplane up in the sky well above this light and we could see a very short con trail.  As we continued to watch the light our view was blocked by trees in the area.  When we walked farther we could again spot the object.  It just seemed to hoover in the same place.  I don&#39;t believe it moved up or down or side to side.  We again came to an area where we couldn&#39;t see the object, and when our view was again clear to see it, it was gone.  my best opinion of the time was that we had it in view approximately 1 minute.  I tuned in to Art Bell that evening after we had seen it, and it was either that night or the next that he told of a pilot comming from Minnesota that had seen a large light while he was flying his airplane.  I often wondered if we had seen the same light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sticking my head out the window and yelling at the hubby to do the same. We saw a long ship hovering about 500 yds and I could also see people looking our way. They too seemed to be in a bit of a shock, then in a instant it vanished. (the sky was clear, not a cloud insight. We will never forget this once in a life time &#34;great experience&#34;  Additional information provided by the witness below:  Hello and your welcome,  St.Catharine&#39;s Ontario, that&#39;s correct. Yes my husband and myself were the witness in the vehicle. We had no pets with us at the time of the sighting. There were a few people on the street but I&#39;m not sure if they noticed what we saw. We were pretty shocked and a bit dumb-founded. The shape was like a silver-bullet trailer but alot longer and larger, quite frankly it was huge. There looked to be an observation deck and I could see the people inside. Underneath this platform were many small shaped windows like seen on a ship. It was white/silver in color. No blue, red or orange lights that we could see, no haze was seen either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I will tell you is that the people on that craft did notice us looking back at them and for a brief moment I made eye contact with one of them. This being looked just like me, female. She nor the others appeared to have large heads and big eyes. Then it vanished in a instant, I blinked and it was gone. There was no sound that we could here. I said to my hubby how could something that big just hover? He has always been interested in planes etc. and he said I don&#39;t &#34;explanatory&#34; know! What the heck was that?! No aircraft did we see or hear afterwards. An older lady once told me: if your always looking up towards the sky this means your a good person, I think my hubby and I are fortunate soul&#39;s for having the opportunity to see what we did that day!  In addition my hubby would like me to tell you that this ship was,what he could figure,about 3-4 hundred feet long and about 1000 feet up from us.He also said to make sure I tell you that it was a clear summer day not a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enjoy your day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the wonderful report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was hard to see with the naked eye so I got out my binoculars which helped , but it was still rather small . We watched it stay in one spot for about five minutes and then it moved 20 degrees to the NW and hoovered there for 2-3 more minutes when it was joined by #2 craft.It stationed itself 20 degrees to the east . When observed with the binocs we precieved movement or rotation . At that time I was focused on #2 for thirty seconds with the binocs when it started to move to the south and I lost it when it got over the roofline of my house . At that time my neighbor was wathing #1 which moved while he was tring to look for #2. We beleive this all took place over a 10 to 15 minute period when my neighbor first sighted and then notified me. They seemed to be at a very high altitude as we noted commuter air traffic but teree was no way to judge this. Please note that the next day I got a glimpse of a simular object for 2 seconds or less , it was at a lower altitude.<n>

I looked south toward McChord AFB and noticed a cigar shaped craft moving slowly east.  I alerted the others to it.  My sister saw it,  but my fiance could not make it out.(She wasn&#39;t wearing her glasses.)  It was about 6-10 miles away at about 20 ft. above the treeline.(From my perspective.)  We turned right on Wapato St. and I continued watching it.  Then we turned right on 70th St. and pulled into our driveway.  I continued watching it and it suddenly appeared to fall straight down.  The entire time the sun would occasionaly glint very brightly off it.  I have never seen something moving,  stop on a dime and fall straight down.  It fell for about 5 seconds,  and then flew away downward at a 45 degree angle,  headed due east and was lost from sight behind a hill.  Whoa...<n>

I am very skeptical of any Ufo sighting, and I can usally tell what something is right after I see it, but this had me stumped.  It wasn&#39;t any aircraft I know of, and I know of a good amount of aircraft.  It was too small to carry humans( about 5 ft. in diameter and 7ft long), and I don&#39;t see how it could fly as straight as it did, or how it could fly at all. There was a haze around it, but this might have been shock waves( like those visible when the F/A-18 hornet is approaching and reaching the sound barrier.  There was no aircraft following it(I beive the closest Fighter base to the sighting is Ottis ANG base, which deploys F-16 fighting falcons) and it was too small to appear on radar, so obviously there was no way for fighters to be scrambled to trail it.  It was silver-gray, and egg-shaped as I said.  It had no markings visible to me, although I only saw the underside of the craft and there may have been markings elsewhere.  I don&#39;t think it was an alien space craft, but it could have been an experimental military drone, possibly based at Quonset ANG, which would be the perfect place to keep the vehicle,seeing as Quonset has not had at test or fighter sqaudron based there since the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, so noone would look there. this is not the only explanation and I&#39;m open to suggestions and I would enjoy them very much. All of this is true.  I won&#39; send any pictures for I am not a good artist, but I think the above descriprtions are sufficient.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a rare,very clear night,and we were admireing the stars. Suddenly directly in front of us a small light (like a dim star)became very bright. The way it looked,to me and my girlfriend, was as though it had been shot to that spot in the sky . The light became brighter and than stopped and hovered for about 1 min making no sound and than it shot upwards out of the atmosphere. We watched as it rapidly grew dimmer and disappeared. About 3 minutes later we made it to our tent still watching the sky when the exact same thing happened again, almost at the same spot in the sky.<n>

Its trail also turned to smoke and slowly formed a &#34;s&#34; shape. The smoke dissipated in 15 20 Min. There was no sound, no object visible, no navlights. The moon came up 1/2 hour later.<n>

In the NUFORC Note you said that these were almost certainly the rockets launched from Wallops Island. If that is so, I question why the object we observed was in a northwest to southeast trajectory?? Eight very reliable witnesses will verify this. This object appeared to be on entry into our atmosphere and it definetly decelerated to a complete stop before forming a huge cicrle of light in the sky.<n>

The launch was reported to NUFORC from as far north as Pine Bush, NY, (!!), and from as far south, we believe, as Alabama.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a thick glowing trail of an airplane.  It took hard right angle turns.  It was enormous and miles high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed by 5 professional people, none of whom are into UFO&#39;s or New Age things.  We tried to figure every rational and logical explaination for what we saw.  It was very extraordinary. It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky.  We were outside on a deck talking.  One person said, &#34;What the *&amp;%# is that?&#34;  When we looked there was a large glowing almost picture in the sky. It was miles and miles and miles up. It looked almost like thin clouds covering the moon, which would explain the glow.  From the thin clouds there was a very thick glowing trail coming straight out.  The trail made sharp right angle turns.  It litterally looked like it was &#34;connecting the stars&#34; of the latle part of the big dipper. The whole thing was massive.  As we watched and tried to figure out what we were looking at, we noticed it was adding on. There was a small light creating the glowing trail.  The new thinner glowing trail was circling around back towards the glowing cloud like cluster we thought had to be covering the moon. It continued to make a large circle, then the light that was creating it vanished.  When it vanished, the entire picture stopped glowing.  It now looked the color of a normal airplane trail when a plane is gone.  We watched as the sharp immage discipated. After about 10-15 minutes it broke up to an enormous circle that resembled a smoke ring.  THE MOON WAS NOT IN THE SPOT OF THE GLOWING CLOUD!!  It was just empty sky.  The moon was a half moon that was hidden by the house of the deck which we were on. (We saw the moon when we left the home.) We all know we saw something incredibly unique and would love for someone to give rational explaination of what it could have been. An acquaintance of ours 20 miles away saw the same thing.  On the same date and approximately the same time in Pennsylvania someone saw what seems to be, from their description, very similar.<n>

We believe that the brilliant display of the chemical released (trimethylaluminum) in the ionisphere almost certainly is what these observers witnessed.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6 of us were in a boat in the dark and looking at the stars, we noticed what appeared to be like a vapor trail that was way up in the sky.  The moon had not come up yet and the sky was dark except for the stars. The original trail ended with double swirl and then within several mins another trail started and made a wide circle that seemed to be like a coil spring looking down from the end.  When you see a shooting star it usually is going across the sky, this seemed to be coming down but at great distance away, which gave it a real different prespective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6 of us were on 2 boats, one was broken down and we were towing it home, we were in the back bay off of Knotts Island, below Norfolk, near Virginia Beach, on the inside of the outerbanks. We noticed what at first appeared to be a similar trail that a jet plane would leave except that it was totally dark, the moon hadn&#39;t come up yet and the sky was clear and dark.  We all watched and assumed that it was some type of large meteor making an entry to the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  About 5 mins after the first trail appeared a second one started which lasted longer than the first, they both covered a large section of the sky for as high up as they were.  It was almost as if they were high enough up in the sky for the moon light to shine on the trails but the moon wasn&#39;t visable to us yet.  The trails had a funny spiral to them, covered a large area of the sky and didn&#39;t look normal.  The second trail acutally was in the same area as the first and they intersected, once the end of the trail happened the object that was making the trail got brighter and then it seemed to end.  We watched the trails disapate for the next 40mins.  Similar to jet trails.<n>

No color, but it did change formation somewhat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Southern Sky: Looked like exhaust, leaving a trail, from jet moving &#34;up&#34; but it was a curved line (and nighttime - with no clouds).  The &#34;light&#34; stopped and the &#34;trail&#34; started to fade.  Approx. 5-10 mins later, I looked up and the &#34;base&#34; of the tail (where it began) began to enlarge, brighten and take on a spherical shape as the entire length of trail became brighter (no color-just white).  It looked like there was a rip in the sky that had opened up. Sphere changed into oval/&#34;eye&#34; shape; just the outline was white, the middle looked just like the rest of the sky. The trail (or &#34;tail&#34; as it now appears to have been) stayed attached and remained stationary as the &#34;base&#34; grew in size, in an easterly direction, as it faded.  I hope I don&#39;t offend, but it looked like a giant sperm in the sky.  By 00:35 it had dissappeared completely though I did not watch it the whole time b/c I came inside to get on-line. 1) Did not see an object that left the trail, just the trail itself 2) It did not have any color at all except maybe pale yellow 3) during the first stage of this sighting, when we just saw a trail moving in an upwards direction, there was an aircraft flying in a West-to-East direction (probably landing in Philadelphia)<n>

Disappeared and then came returned about five minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were visiting my boyfriends&#39; parents house.  His mother and I were parking the car.  She looked through the windshield and saw a large bright orange cigar shaped object travelling from northwest to southeast, about five hundred feet in the sky.  It silently accellerated straight up into the sky then disappeared within a minute.  My boyfriend came home five minutes later and was told this story.  In disbelief (but curious) he went outside.My boyfriend observed a white cloud like formation of a sideways &#34;s&#34; shape above our house. He then yelled back to us to come outside.  We witnessed the object travelling southeast at tremendous speed. At approx. 100 feet the object appeared to be cigar shaped.  The craft appeared silvery gray leaving a trail of orange light.  As the craft accelerated the orange light extended to four times the length of the craft, maintaining the crafts width throughout the sighting. The ship appeared leaving the orange light behind it travelling about 30 miles upward.  It came to a sudden halt. A split second later a small white light appeared growing to the size of the moon.  The light expanded growing about fifty times its original size.  It then disappeared, leaving a backward &#34;C&#34; shape formation with the white light in the middle of the &#34;C&#34; fading. Knowing this is the 4th of July, there was NO FIREWORK ACTIVITY going on in this small town.<n>

Then about 5 minutes later the object seem to come straight down leaving another vapor trail. Before the horizion the object stop leaving the vapor trail. There was no fire ball or glowing with this object going up or coming down. The object seem to be launch from the air because there was no vapor trail going up before the spiral. This is east toward Richmond, Williamsburg, Norfolk, VA There was no glow of anything hitting the ground. Unsure about the distance Richmond is 100 miles from my house. The down vapor trail had reflective light for along time. More so then going up.<n>

I turned to look at the Big Dipper when I saw an incredibly bright pure white light - when I told our buddies to look, it faded away, then suddenly it flashed on again, it did this a couple times, while traveling slowly by the dipper&#39;s edge.  Then we saw another object off to the right of the orignial, completely still, that gave off an blinding bright flash, three times.  It was so unbelievably bright, we just stood there completely dumbfounded! The original object, now faded, then gave one last flash, which appeared to be triangular in shape. They both then just seemed to fade away.  After about 10 minutes later, we saw one of the objects moving from North to South, giving two flashes then dissapeaing again.  In comparison to several satelites we watched that night, these were bigger and much brighter.  They moved slowly, and seemed to have stopped.  The flashes  were uncomparable to anything I have ever seen.<n>

We were facing the back yard, seated in lawn chairs, talking, and all of a sudden the entire back yard (about an acre of ground) lit up in blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked over our left shoulders (both of us, there was no sound and yet oddly we both looked over our left shoulders at the same exact time) and there was a bright blue light hovering there.  It was just that... a light and it stayed there pulsating for about 5 seconds I&#39;d say... then it started to move and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I don&#39;t tell anyone about this because we know people will think we are nuts.  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever put something like this out there.  We have no reason to try to make people believe that we saw what we saw.  I just thought I&#39;d post this so that others out there that also have witnessed something as strange as this don&#39;t feel like they are alone.  I&#39;m sure that some day what we all saw will come to &#34;light&#34; - pardon the pun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, from California to the east coast people saw this blue light at precisely the same exact time of day.  It was noted in the papers and news but was dismissed by scientists as possible meteors... though my mom and I, and everyone else who witnessed it, knows it could not have been - for it never hit the earth and it was hovering.  A meteor would not stop in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not scared of this light... though looking back on it I&#39;m surprised that I wasn&#39;t ... because it was so incredibly &#34;odd&#34; (that&#39;s the best word I can use right now to describe it)...nothing I&#39;d every seen before and I don&#39;t necessarily believe in aliens or things of the like.  I did feel afterward that night that we had been &#34;observed&#34;. It&#39;s a strange thing to say...and it was a strange thing to feel at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I joked that it was taking our picture...then over a year later we were talking about it again and discussed the possibility of it being some government testing type o! f object...but that too sounds too strange to believe.  Anyway, don&#39;t feel like you are alone...all of you who have seen something like this...but then again don&#39;t try to convince anyone who didn&#39;t see it for themselves because they will only think you are nuts.  My own dad and sister don&#39;t believe my mom and me....we just don&#39;t talk about it to them because we too would likely not believe someone had we not seen it for ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The show had just ended, and the stadium lights were still off, so the stars were very visible. I observed 3 points of light directly straight up above me (NOT fireworks), which were very similar to what satellites look like (at the same altitude), moving slowly in opposite directions of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost as if at some point they had formed a tight triangle formation and were now spreading apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don&#39;t know anything about the orbit patterns of satellites, so I assumed at the time that it must be possible for 3 satellites to cross patterns with each other like that.

This went on for at least an hour while I watched them instead of the fireworks, I began to feel as if someone or something was watching me wether it was up in the sky or in the park on the ground, it gave me the creeps and I got me and my kids out of there just as soon as I could. I dont know if anyone has seen lights, stars, ufos like these but it was real and surreal.<n>

I have also studied classified pics of enemy aircraft not generaly known. in short i know my aircraft!! and this has me stumped.

For about the last year he has been talking about the &#39;people up there&#39; (while pointing upwards). At one time he was crying and saying he wanted his own body back that the people up there had taken. This continued for several days untill he said he got his body back. He has told my wife and I about the people sticking him in the back with needles and of rides in space ships. Of course this could be just a very good imagination except for something odd that has been happening lately. One morning about 4:00am he comes into our bedroom, climbs on the bed, opens the blinds at the head of our bed and starts waving and saying bye. I work night shift but this woke my wife up. He has also woke my wife up a couple times lately to talk about space ships or to ask her if the space ship is coming to get him. Always at 4:00am. One day while playing with my son my wife asked him! what he wanted to be when he grows up. He is very intelligent and knows what different people in different professions do, to an extent. He said he wasn&#39;t sure. She asked if he would like to be an astronaught and he informed her that he didn&#39;t need to do that because he already has a ship and that the &#39;people&#39; are showing him how to fly it. We found this incredibly nerve wrecking because not long before we found out my wife was pregnant with him I had a very strange experience. Basically, I had a dream I was part of a 2 man crew piloting a &#39;UFO&#39;. There were several things that were extremely wierd about this dream that made me wonder if it was really a dream. I told several people about it and of course they laughed about it. It was quite a good laugh for them until about 2 weeks later when the local news reported that there where a number of UFO sighting and abduction reports in the area I was living in during the past 3 weeks. I don&#39;t get laughed at much anymore about it! . The experience/dream I had was not of being abducted but of being a functioning member of a &#39;alien&#39; crew like my son has been reporting to us. He doesn&#39;t give specific details of the ship or landing &#39;base/planet&#39;like I remember. I just find this strange. If you know of a professional researcher who would like to know more about this please forward my e-mail address to him/her/them. Oh, the night he was born or the night after he was born, the local news showed a video by a local person of 5 UFO&#39;s appearing to land in the mountains close to us.<n>

(See full description.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were the only folks camping at the remote French Creek campground (a U.S. National Forest Service campground) the night of July 3, 1999. Around 9:45 p.m. I was sitting in a camping chair stargazing (my wife was sitting near me but was staring into the firepit at the remnants of our campfire) when I caught site of what I believed to be a satellite. It was a pinpoint of light,(about the brightness of a medium star), that in my estimation was travelling across the sky at a &#34;normal&#34; satellite rate. Just as the object approached in my 12 o&#39;clock position it exploded in a burst of purple light. This &#34;explosion&#34; lasted for 3-5 seconds. There was thin, whispy cirrus cloud apparently between the object and the ground. However, I find it highly unlikely that high altitude ice crystals could magnify a somewhat dim object manifold times. After the quick duration of the flash the object instantly resumed its previous light intensity and continued its traverse across the night sky (heading NNW, app. 320-340 degrees). I lost site of the object in a minute or so later owing to the mountainous landscape. My wife did not see the flash. I yelped just as the flash occured but she did not look up in time to see any of it. Further, she was not able to spot the object as it continued on its course.<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size comparison, both at arms length, when first spotted would be that of an led light on a piece of electronic gear.  When it appeared to transform into an orb, the diameter would be that of looking into a standard flashlight.  A dramatic size increase in an instant.  My wife compared it to the color of a flame on a propane stove.  In retrospect, I think the object may have descended at an incredible rate of speed which would account for part of the size expansion.  My wife feels whatever it was may have been attracted by our small campfire.<n>

We noticed airplanes the whole time we were walking and ironically were talking about UFOs. We were heading back towards the car when I spotted a bright white (almost fuzzy) light flying horizontally quickly just above the tree line about a 1/2 mile away from us.  I watched it for a few seconds without saying anything to my friend, but then I realized I couldn&#39;t make out that it was a plane, plus it was flying so low I told him to take a look.  Just about then, the white started to sort of fuse into red and as it turned completely red, it suddenly split into two separate red lights.  The &#34;newer&#34; light sort of did a sharp u-turn up and backwards as the other remained steady on it&#39;s course horizontally.  Then the one further behind headed back in the direction of the other only further back and higher up.  We watched until they were out of sight. We assumed because it was July 3rd, that probably Hanscom Airforce Base in Bedford was putting on an air show.  It wasn&#39;t until a year later I found out Hanscom didn&#39;t have their annual air show that year, plus the objects must were so much closer than we realized and Hanscom is too far away to witness their aircraft.<n>

This is the email that I sent to him.... Hey Jeff, ((name deleted)) from Hot Springs, Arkansas here.... This may be a ridiculous question, but I immediately thought I could ask you. We were driving back from CA 2 days ago.  Friday night (actually around 1am Saturday a.m.)  we were on I-40 E. between Albuquerque   and Clines Corners, New Mexico.   We got in a standstill traffic jam for about an hour before we turned around in the median and got on access road and went around.  A trucker had told us that two trucks ran out of gas.  Sure enough as we passed from the access road....sitting side by side completely stopped  were sitting those two trucks.  It looked like they just stopped next to each other, completely lined up.  I find that so unbelievable that two trucks just ran out of gas.   It just seems too fishy. Also, while we were waiting we saw a huge shooting star!   Not like a small streak the size of the stars like we usually see; but a large golden shooting light across the sky.  ((name deleted)), my husband, said to keep in mind it is 4th of July weekend, and most people will probably use that to justify the light; but I was wondering if you heard anything about something being up with those trucks?<n>

My son who was visiting with his family for the holiday has a degree in marketing and works in that field.  I first observed the light moving across and downward.  It was the magnitude of a large star.  The light was constant and consistent as it moved.  I brought it to the attention of my son.  At that moment the object appeared to turn downward and grew very bright .  I could only describe it as a super flood light. It hovered there for a few seconds and the light dimmed down and almost out as if it were turned down by a rheostat switch.  The object pulled back out and upward at a sharp angle.  Ot had a dim light and went out. We disussed the possibilities and concluded that what we saw was intelligently maneuvered and the light was artificial.<n>

The object was a bright aluminum color with a domed shaped top and a flat bottom. It was about twice as high as the diameter and was in the shape of a cylinder. The sides were not smooth, there were vertical lines running from bottom to top that seemed to be there to give the structure strength.Size, about 40-50 feet high and 20-25 feet in diameter.<n>

I sat up, thinking I was wrong. We live in Jutland (vest part of Denmark) approx. 20KM from a military area (I think it is the biggest in Denmark) and it looked like it was just hoovering above it. It looked like a star, but it was mutch too close. Suddenly it moved VERY fast to one side, and got out of my site, but a minute later it was back. The shape and collor of the light changed slightly all the time, also when it was not moving. Most of the time the light was just wite but sometimes with a tuch of red and yellow. We never told anyone but our closest family and friends, it seems a bit cracy. But the movements of &#34;the thing&#34; was to fast to be a helicopter, and it was hanging still some times too. We saw it 2 more times, same place moving the same odd way and diapearing after an hour or so. Us: I&#39;m 34 years my wife is 30. I work in sales and my wife is a secretary.

Rather, it was someyhing out of norm.  If you&#39;ll look at a Wyo map, you&#39;ll see there is nothing civilized north of our town.  There is however a visual landmark mesa called Pilot Butte.  During the Oregon/Mormon Trail movement it was used for navigation.  A stretch of the imagination compares it to Devil&#39;s Tower as in Dreyfus&#39; mashed potatoes (dah- dah- dah- duh- da). I grew up in California and frequently observed the giant search lights used for grand openings and movie premiers.  There aren&#39;t any of these lights in Wyoming and someone who hasn&#39;t lived elsewhere wouldn&#39;t be familiar other than the 20th Century Fox Movie intro.  I witnessed these type of lights reflecting off of some thunderheads north of town.  The closest town to us is Rock Springs which is 15 miles to the east (check the maps it really is intrigueing).  Are they up to something in our remote area?  Just thought it was interesting so I wrote.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Small, clear, blinking object seen in northern Wyoming<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to college in Sheridan, WY and going to my parents house in Buffalo on the weekends to do laundry, get mail, get food, visit, etc.  I arrived at their house at about 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  My parents were gone camping and their neighbors to the right were on vacation, across the street were on vacation and the house to the left was empty, so the neighborbood was unusually dark and quiet.  I brought my clothes in the house and some other luggage through the back door, which is seldom used, because I wanted to a have a cigarrette on the back deck.  I brought everything through the back door and sat on the couch and turned the televsion on.  I sat their for a couple of minutes flipping through the channels when I realized that I was going to have a smoke.  I jumped up and quickly walked to back door which has a window beside it that faces the living room I was sitting in.  I opened the door, stepped out onto the deck, turned to my left, and saw something hovering about three feet away from me, apparently looking in the window.  It was a small, clear, long and thin object.  It kind of looked like a beaker with a yellow light in the center that had a steady, rythmic yellow flash and didn&#39;t make a sound.  When I saw it and it had seen me, it floated away from the window and a little closer to me.  I wanted to reach out and grab it, but I was a little scared.  Plus it kind of looked like it may be hot or even sharp or anything that could cause sever pain.  I hovered there and kind of checked me out for about 15 to 20 seconds, then slowly flew toward a large pine tree in our neighbors yard.  It looked like it was trying to hide from me behind the tree, but I could still see it&#39;s steadily blinking yellowish light through the branches.  Every once in a while it would come out from behind the tree a little ways, see me, then hide back behind the branches.  After a minute or so, it slowly rose into the sky.  It went higher and higher until I lost sight of it what seemed like about a mile up in ! the sky. After I stood and looked closer, I could see a yellow light flashing way the hell up in the sky and I thought it might be an airplane.  After a few seconds, however, it flew across the sky very, very fast, hovered up there for a while, then slowly lowered itself until it was on the other side of the neighbors house, exactly where they had window facing South.  After about 10 seconds, I saw it again hovering just over the neighbors house, then it slowly floated back off into the neighborhood and disappeared.  I went inside shut the windows, locked the doors and didn&#39;t leave until the next morning when I went up the mountain to tell my parents what I had seen.<n>

If it was 200 feet off of the ground, it must have been a quarter mile wide, as it took up most of the sky, and if it was higher it was even bigger. As far as speed goes, it went from one horizon to the other in approx. 2 seconds, which is staggering considering it was a clear night, and the craft made absolutely no sound.  Again, if it was higher, it was even faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later, an identical craft flew the same route, which means there ware two identical crafts or the first craft made a circle. Everyone in my group saw the exact same things. About 15 minutes later we noticed spotlights in the sky, and military aircraft circling the skies. This continued for a few hours and then stopped. we reported the incident to the state police who told us we were not the first to call regarding the incident. They gave us no explaination, and there was nothing reported in the local papers in the following days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please post this on your site if you get a chance, as my hope is i can get in contact with others who have seen similar crafts, or others that witnessed what i did in 1999.

Then at around 9:30pm from the same direction, I then saw what I described to my husband as &#39;a white light that looked like it exploded&#39;.  It was a quick burst of light and then it was gone...like a pinpoint of light that burst out and got bigger.  It did not light up the whole sky, just a small diameter about the size of my pinky. I thought it was strange, but it could have just been a meteorite that entered in at about a 45 degree angle and exploded--untill I tuned into Art Bell&#39;s show and heard about all these people calling in about the lights they were seeing at about 9:30 coming in from the west. I couldn&#39;t believe it! I wondered if this was just a coincidence, because no one was reporting anything happening on the east coast...Not yet. Since Art Bell goes off the air at 5am in my area, I decided to tune in via the internet and picked call letters WGMD which is in Delaware. Art was supposed to be on that station till 6, but for some reason he wasn&#39;t. But when the host returned after commercials it was someone else&#39;s voice saying that people are calling in to ask if anyone else was seeing strange lights in the sky. I continued to listen for about a half hour as they were airing phone calls from the ones who observed them in the Delaware area. Obviously something country-wide or even bi-coastal was happening that night into the morning...not just on the west coast.<n>

This report is of a craft I have not heard described very much. My son was losing a baseball game very badly, so I walked away from the field and was looking at the top of the trees. The craft came from my left, roughly south and headed north.  The best way I can describe it was a &#34;sky train&#34;.  This craft was perhaps 200 yards long but only, perhaps 30 feet wide.  It was at an elevation of perhaps 200 feet and was rather noisy.  The noise was a rhythmic humming.  There were multiple sections (very like a train) and they were all illuninated, greenish and yellow lights. It eas moving rather slowly, perhaps 50 mph, but once it cleared the tree lines it accellarated dramatically.  I have never seen anything else like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/99 19:00|Dannemora|NY|Unknown|an hour (?)|Bright orange ball moves slowly over Chazy Lake, then vanishes over trees. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70140.html|297|ndxe199907| Bright orange ball moves slowly over Chazy Lake, then vanishes over trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In July of 1999, my ex-husband (at the time my fiancé), his father, and myself decided to take a fishing trip to a nearby lake. We packed up and left at about five in the afternoon and went to get bait and snacks, then proceeded to our favorite fishing spot. When we got there we unpacked and walked over to a culvert and sat down. My ex was on my left, his father on my right, leaving me in the middle. The fish were biting good until around dusk. Then suddenly it got real weird. The birds stopped chirping, the crickets and frogs were quiet, and the fish stopped biting.  My ex’s father looked at his watch and it was a little past 7 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly from the left side of the lake from behind the trees we ALL saw a bright huge ball of orange light. There was only the one ball of light.  It was about 200 feet off the water moving really REALLY slow. It kept at a steady pace though. It was not quite in the middle of the lake but at times seemed more towards us and at other times more towards the other bank.  I could see the reflection of it off the lake also. It light up the area around it but nothing more. It was like it got a little brighter in the area. The other thing that I noticed was it didn’t make one single sound. Nothing, not even a low rumble. I remember thinking why isn’t this thing making any noise also. The air got really thick as well. It was like it was slightly harder to breathe but there wasn’t any smell in the air either. The other bank I would guess is only about a football field length away at the point we were at. On the other side of the lake are mountains that go straight up.  It kept going until it was a little past my ex’s father and then made a sharp hook and came back the way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and watched it slowly go back the way it came until it disappeared behind the tree line on my left side. When I looked back at my ex’s father, we all noticed at the same time that it was very VERY dark out. My ex’s father looked at his watch and noticed that it was well past 9 pm. It seemed to only take a few minutes for the thing to move across the lake and back. I freaked out and was really scared and couldn’t figure out where all the time went to. We packed up quickly and ran to the car. We threw our things in the trunk and I sped back to our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember both on the ride home and when we got in the house talking about what we saw. We all agreed that we saw the same thing but we couldn’t agree on the color. I KNOW I say orange but my ex’s father is insistent that he saw a big white ball. Needless to say even though I am remarried, to this day, I REFUSE to go back to that spot. I have never told anyone but very FEW personal friends what I saw that night and I know to this day it did NOT take two hours for that thing to move across the lake like that!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Five minuets later they moved in perfect syncronicity and seemed to vanish ever so serene behind nothingness. I do not understand what I saw. Or Why I saw it. I guess That is what disturbes me the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

THIS AREA IS NEAR THE NORMAL FLIGHT PATH FOR INCOMING COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COMING IN TO VANC.INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SO WE SEE A LOT OF AIRCRAFT. THE AIRLINER I SAW ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HAD A COMPANION HOVERING ABOVE IT. I NOTICED IT BECAUSE THE SUN WAS REFLECTING OFF IT LIKE A MIRROR. IT WAS A SMALL (COMPARED TO THE JET)SHINY SILVER BALL THAT STARTED OUT RIGHT BEHIND THE JET AND THEN MOVED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE JET. I WAS IN SUCH SHOCK I PUT DOWN MY BINOCULARS BECAUSE I COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE MY EYES.SECONDS LATER I PUT MY BINOCS BACK UP AND UNFORTUNATELY LOST SIGHT OF THE OBJECT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this whole incident only lasted a minute or two, but it was very clear to me that i witnessed something very odd. we see many incoming jets of various size and shapes but never have i seen a free floating silver ball like the one i saw buzzing that jet. it appeared to me that anyone on that jet would not have seen anything because of the way the ball was following close behind and then accelerated to zip up and over the top. it was very small (perhaps 3-4 ft across) and i&#39;m sure i would not have even noticed it if the sun had not reflected off it. when i went in to work and told my co-workers i saw a ufo, they all scoffed at me, so i haven&#39;t told too many people. it definetly was an unidentified flying object. when i heard the art bell interview of feb8 i was so impressed by peter davenports sincerity, integrity  and dedication i decided to make this belated report. i hope it is of some benefit to you.<n>

My son and I were going down to the beach when I looked up and saw a bright cigar shape craft.  I thought that it was going to land on the beach.  It had contrails zig zagging behind it.  I looked up and it was the brightest looking craft.  I knew it was&#39;nt a airplane right away.  In fact I thought that they were going to land and talk to people.  I have never seen one that close up.  I swear I only looked away for a second and it was just gone.  I thought when we got to the beach that people would be flipping out, but no one seemed to even have seen it.  Once again, I look like the crazy one.<n>

I saw, what I thought at first was a shooting star, approaching from the north. It continued south and just stopped. It stayed there for about 5 seconds, long enough for me to continue to focus on it, and made a sharp 90 degree, (left), turn into space. It was so far out that I could not make out a shape, color, etc. Being a veteran from the U.S. Air Force and knowing what speeds our military and commercial aircraft are capable of doing, I know for a fact that it wasn&#39;t ours. I can also guess that the speed of this object was between 2000-5000 MPH just by visual vectoring alone. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have the exact date, time, but I never knew this web site existed.

From out of nowhere, an object appeared directly above and in front of us, and positioned itself in favor of the driver&#39;s side, but so that the passenger had full view as well. After a second or two of adjusting to the extraordinary event, I realized that the UFO was traveling the same distance/speed as we were, as if to keep up with us.  My impression now is that it wanted us to see it, as if it were there only for us to enjoy the light show.  The UFO was beautiful to me.  It wasn&#39;t exactly diamond-shaped, but more trapezoidal.  Geometrical and very angular.  It seemed to be hovering approximately 50 feet above us.  It was glowing a gorgeous, warm auburn, yellowish-brown color.  It was just beautiful and the feeling I get to this day is that it was &#34;showing off&#34; for only my friend and I, since the other 2 passengers had no idea that this was taking place.  After maybe 10 or 15 seconds of traveling a straight line with us, the UFO emitted 2 rays of light from either side of it, which shot out in different directions.  All 3 objects then disappeared.  I don&#39;t know how I managed to keep my eyes on the road for those 20 or so seconds because I can&#39;t imagine that I ever peeled my eyes off the spectacle.  The 2 passengers in the back had no idea anything took place.  I pulled over to the side of the road and my friend and I began sobbing in excitement.  I will mention here that I am certain this amazing event took place only because she was present.  She has extremely unstable energy and is an emotionally troubled person.  Her entire life has been plagued by poltergeists (which I&#39;m sure are just psychokinetic irregularities she createsv) and out of the ordinary experiences.  This type of experience is not unusual for her, and I believe that I was given a gift of sorts to be able to see what I did.  I feel very strongly that whatever was prope! lling th at craft, was there because of my friend and to fulfill my life-long wish of seeing a UFO.<n>
