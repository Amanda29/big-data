1/31/13 23:00|Brewton|AL|Flash|45 minutes off and on|Fireballs flashing like fireworks on the Florida/Alabama state line 1/31/13.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96155.html|2|ndxe201301| Fireballs flashing like fireworks on the Florida/Alabama state line 1/31/13<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a bizarre experience tonight on the Alabama/Florida state line. I was in the absolute middle of nowhere about 20 miles away from Milton, Florida when I saw four white fireballs in the sky. They were extremely close, fast, and made no noise at all whatsoever.  The fireballs would flash into the sky and then reform into balls of white light and fly around close to eachother. I pulled off the highway to see them as did other drivers.  They disappeared and I continued on my drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten minutes later while driving I noticed a red orb of light slightly smaller than the white ones and more solid to the left of me seemingly going at my pace and following me.  While that was happening the white orbs were back and above me to the right in the sky doing the same thing as before- flaming/flashing into the sky and reforming into balls of white firey light all the while flying around. Again, they disappeared into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the real kicker to this story is that I was almost home (Navarre, Florida) and I saw three of the white fireballs again and over ten light colored military tanks were pulling out of a side road heading towards where the balls of light were coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t speculate that the military tanks were going to investigate this I just found the timing odd.<n>

Then there were two more coming from the west spaced out in the same way.  We looked to the east and there were two more of these objects.  They are a bright orange color, and only stay lit for about 5-10 minutes and then just suddenly go out.  Tonight is a full moon and we are wondering if that has any relation to these objects as we have now seen them for about the last three months.  No one is reporting this on our news, paper or radio and we want to know what these things are!<n>

I wasn’t able to see anything just by looking around trying to fine the airplane then another flash!  As I’m looking at my video viewfinder I see more flashing lights some seem to be bigger than others not sure what’s going on. My video was set at 60 zoom looking at the Orion to the right upper area of the stars.  Could the military testing nukes in outer space?  Not sure maybe lots of colliding rocks exploding? It seem to be somewhat apart from each other that could be thousands of miles away?…….Anyone out there may no what this is or what could be going on…will try to down load the video it’s about 20 minutes long. Have lots of videos I just been holding back to see if any others had video the same thing………….Mufon give me a call soon…….<n> <n><n> <n><n> You should have on file my other reports....thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very cold and windy but the lights were not moving at all.  I ran to get my husband to look at these lights and he saw them as well.  The thing that was almost unbelievable to us is the size of this; at least two football fields across.  It seemed as if we were looking at it from the side.  We were watching for approximately five minutes and then it started moving very slowly to the north.  We watched it move about half a mile north and as it moved the lights became fewer and fewer and then all of a sudden it was gone!<n>

I was surprised because they were not on a normal flight path I usually see in my back yard and they were flying together in formation and very low to the ground.  As they slowly moved closer I could see that each craft had 3 white lights in a perfect triangle shape and no colored or flashing lights.  They were extremely quite, low in the air, and  slow moving compared to the planes I normally see flying in and out of PHL.  I estimate that they were only 200-300ft in the air and at least 60ft across.  They flew in line one after the other until they passed over the tree line out of sight.<n>

I looked up to see them and I noticed the plane but the other light was brighter than a star and moving faster than the plane.  My first thoughts were that it was a falling star, but it was moving horizontally.  It did not have blinking lights like a plane. Then it just disappeared. I had to pull over and take a longer look to find it, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made sure that wasn&#39;t seeing things by asking my son what he saw and he saw it disappear as well.<n>

As I was looking up I saw what I thought was a star formation of a triangle, but then I notice it was moving very slow South-East, the point of the triangle was North-East and the other 2 light were South-West, it was very long and there was no noise, or blinking lights all I could see were the 3 lights, as it moved away it dim out, all the lights at ounce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flashed my lite at it while it was lite up but I didn&#39;t get no response, and it was gone.  Then came 2 planes from the East and South-East, one was very loud and the other one was bigger, they made one past and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep flashing my light into the sky but nothing, in till about 6:46 pm, I look to the South-West and there were 2 lights in the sky one was lower then the other and was very bright and it looked like it was directed at me, the other light was higher and to the left of the brighter one and as bright as the stars if not more, there was no noise or blinking of lights. I t made me feel that it came from the triangle,  I flashed my light at both of them but I didn&#39;t get any response, I even used my flash lite and lite up my roof back and fourth with the light but nothing, they were both just hovering there, and there lights both went out at about the same time.  It lasted about 2 minutes.I looked at my phone and it showed 6:46 pm. I didn&#39;t see any outline of the objects when there lights went out. That&#39;s about it.<n>

What appeared to be another helicopter followed about a quarter of a mile behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd &#34;copter&#34; swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.  It stopped suddenly in mid-air, then turned sharply toward the east, all the while rapidly changing altitude.  It continued to sway from side to side and to bounce up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.  I was driving and had to focus on traffic, but my husband in the passenger seat watched the object until it disappeared completely.  The entire episode lasted approximately 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was high noon, the sky was a light grey, there was no rain, and no wind. Visibility was about five miles.<n>

It was very cool, clear, with highly visible stars and a ¾ moon in the W/SW sky. As I turned to do a 360 view I saw a very bright very white sphere off to the northwest moving very slowly toward the southeast. I’ve seen single engine prop planes move faster than this object. The object appeared to be 2-3 times the size of the largest/brightest star in the sky. It appeared to not be as high as the stars but more the height that an airliner may fly (35,000-40,000 ft). There were absolutely no sounds at all. The shape or color never changed. I kept expecting a sound as it past over me and finally left my view. The visual time was somewhere between 3-5+- minutes (I had no watch with me).  I remained outside for another 5+-minutes to see if I heard a sound like jet engines, but never heard any sounds. This was my very 1st sighting of som! ething I could not explain. I am 62 years old and have never witnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if this has anything to do with the sighting but I found it very odd. The day before, we were expecting some possibly sever storms so I had my weather radio on. When the weather threat was over I turned the weather radio off and moved it away from my bedside. It was still in my bedroom.  When my dog woke me up to go out, just before the sighting, I heard a noise in the bedroom that I thought was our old ceiling fan. It turned out to be that the weather radio was on and off station. I turned it off and went out with the dog. Now, I find it strange that the radio was on because had it been on when we went to bed we would most certainly have heard it and turned it off.<n>

The night was clear, with moon out.  Suddenly this sound started quietly at first and it got progressively louder.  I looked up and saw nothing except these three red and white blinking lights too far away so I dismissed them as being the source of this sound.  It grew louder and louder and I thought a plane was going to crash.  It was that sort of sound although I must say I&#39;ve never heard a sound like this before.  After about 5 minutes it began to fade and dissappear.  I suddenly noticed this man walking across the street, in a dark hooded shirt, black pants.  He looked at me, several times, even turned around twice. I can&#39;t say I saw his facial features, just that he looked like a man.  He walked swiftly and then when I passed a tree near me and looked again he was gone.  Wish I could tell you more.  I did not see any craft just the loud roaring noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very bright and we knew it was not a plane because it didn&#39;t have green and red flashing lights which most planes have and we knew it was not a star because it wasn&#39;t the same color as any star we have seen before.  The shape of the object was almost like a triangle standing up flying high and bright in the sky.  It also stopped in midair and turned around the opposite direction of where we were standing.  Then, the orange light shut off for about 2 seconds and turned on and moved away from us very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew it was traveling very fast because it almost dispersed into thin air like a star that&#39;s very far away.  No matter what,we knew it wasn&#39;t a star or a plane but a UFO.  Another thing we noticed was that it made no noise whatsoever .<n>

It was approximately 8:50 pm.  Out first impression was to think that it was a tower that the treeline was blocking all but the top of.  However, the lights on our towers were usually red and/or white, not this glowing bright orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after we verbally addressed the light, it began ascending Westwards, toward the direction of the ocean that was less than 4 miles away.  It was clearly visible, hovering for moments high above the treeline, then it made a motion in which a blurry dark orange to red short &#34;tail&#34; appeared to come off of the right side of the object that made me think of the term &#34;warp speed&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to take pictures with my iPhone. Almost instantly it seemed substantially smaller.  After a moment it blink out of sight then reappeared then blinked out of sight and reappea! red again. One more blink and it was gone.<n>

Just a few moments ago, I learned that it was actually a NASA launch from Cape Canaveral. While I&#39;m sorry to have wasted your time, I am pleased that my first instincts were correct.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Unidentified Object Over Stuart/Hobe Sound, Florida  While driving north on US Hwy 1 in Hobe Sound, Florida (just south of Stuart)on January 30th, 2013 - at approximately 8:49pm - a fast-moving, bright orange object caught my eye, to the east, over Jupiter Island. At first, I thought it was a plane, but noticed it looked too large to be airplane lights, and that it had a fiery / flaming orange trail. It was flying south, parallel to the coastline. My next thought was that it was possibly something that had been launched from Cape Canaveral, as we can occasionally see night-launches from our area. I had just driven from Jupiter/Tequesta, and had noticed a bright light (also in the east) possibly from a helicopter or airplane, about 8 miles south of where I saw the above-mentioned object. The reason I mention this, is because what initially caught my eye was the great speed of the orange flaming trail in relation to the light seen over the Jupiter/Tequesta area, less than 10 minutes prior. The sky was clear, with no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over in a church parking lot (east side of US Hwy 1) to get a better look, and immediately dialed my husband from my cell phone. (8:50pm) I told him to look to the southeast. I asked if he could see it from our home in Stuart, just a few miles north and slightly west of where I had pulled over. He could not. He is a pilot, and thought I might have been seeing a jet-engine flaring. I did not think so, due to the fact it was moving so fast, and also, so straight. (Horizontally) After about 20-30 seconds, the trail was no longer visible, but I could still see a light (just a circular light)traveling straight and to the south, but much faster than it had been moving while the trail was visible. At this point I assumed it might be a meteorite or satellite, but thought it unlikely due to it&#39;s speed and how it did not lose altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire viewing lasted less than a minute. I watched the evening news at 11pm, thinking I would see a report of something unusual. Since I did not, I decided to research news online. Upon finding nothing, I chose to contact your agency via your telephone hotline, where I was advised to put it into writing,in my own words.<n>

The unknown object stopped, and then started moving south while increasing in brightness and in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way it was an air plane.  I was in awe.

The first time the lights were observed was by 1 person around 11:00pm and was discounted as a plane but in a strange location (not the typical approach to the local airport).  The second time the lights were observed was at 11:50pm by 2 people.  There were multiple lights with different colors (red, yellow, orange) in roughly a straight line but not exactly lined up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed fairly consistent but did appear to fluctuate somewhat.  Then the lights simply went out.  The craft/lights did not appear to move, land, fly away or otherwise act like a plane, helicopter or other normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that the siting occurred is generally in the path of the local airport (Hagerstown Washington County Regional Airport - HGR) and it is typical for planes to approach the airport from this direction which we observe many times over the years.  When planes come in from a far distance, they appear to be standing still for a few minutes but then move to the left as they approach the airport.  This is the typical observance of landing aircraft seen by us many times.  The first reaction to what was seen on the night of 1-29-13 was that it was just an airplane, but after a few minutes of it &#34;not moving,&#34; we went to get binoculars, then the lights went out in about seconds.  Aircraft approaching the airport DO NOT turn their lights out completely right before landing!!  If anything, they turn their landing lights on as they get closer.  Again the craft did not appear to move at all and was seen in the same location about 50 minutes apart, then the lights simply went out.  ! We observed the entire area for another 20 minutes looking for the lights to re-appear, they did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another concern is that the location of the siting was about +/-10 miles southwest of a military installation known as Site R (aka “the underground Pentagon”) just north of Camp David.  This area is a strict no-fly zone and aircraft approaching the airport (HGR) must abide by the approved flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other observations we noted.  We saw some clouds, stars (big dipper), a nearly full moon, communication towers in the far distance with red blinking lights and several high altitude aircraft with their typical red blinking lights which were much farther up in the sky (perhaps 5,000 ft or 10,000 ft).  All of these items are observed nightly, which is normal.  The siting of the mysterious lights were distinct and nothing like the other lights or items listed above.<n>

It appeared to be a shooting star with no tail, and flew about half as low as plane generally do but could glide up and down like paper in breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it to the water front where as my view was obscured for ten seconds as I ran by trees and the craft was gone. it&#39;s bright light will stay in my memory like it knew I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes after I hear the sound of a plane flying by with no plane close enough to be making that noise. while it was directly above me I heard no noise, saw no machinery (wings, flashing lights, no object itself.)  Only the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had to be traveling at four or fives times the speed of any other plane I saw in the sky.<n>
1/29/13 19:00|Smithville|TX|Other|30 seconds|What was that?|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96138.html|22|ndxe201301| What was that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> A storm was moving in.  Since it was dark out, I wanted to go out and look at the sky to see if there was that eerie &#39;tornado&#39; color. I was in my back yard and looked to the SE a first. Then I noticed a glowing  - kind of like lightning bugs - to the due east in the neighbors tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just a flash from the (at that time) distant lightning, then from the corner of my left eye, I realized it was still there. We still had no rain, just far off lightning. I decided to pay more attention to the &#39;light&#39; coming from the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is I was not drunk, smoking or otherwise impaired, and JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE I was giggling at my fiancee to the stories he believes in when it comes to UFO&#39;s.  That is of utmost importance for me to explain!!  Any way...  I looked to the tree and at first thought it was a cluster of lightning bugs.  Then I realized they do not cluster in such a way.  Then I realized they colors were more of an amber light, not of the &#39;typical&#39; green glow associated with lightning bugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was thinking the above, suddenly I saw one get brighter then the rest and appeared more of a yellow color. Just above that-about 3 seconds later, there was a bright red with a slight white around it. I then went to run into my house to get my fiancee so I had another set of eyes, to only realize he had left to go to the store before the storm hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran (quickly, oh how fast I ran! back outside and the  wind gusted pretty good at this point and the &#39;shape&#39; seemed to jump down a branch in the tree.  Another larger gust came and just as fast the &#39;ball/grouping&#39; of light went up, then SE, then straight E as if a bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire shape couldn&#39;t have been any bigger than the average jay bird-bit it was GLOWING again as if a group of lightning bugs-but the red light was in the lead, as if the head... the above colors and moved as if a bird... but I know of NO BIRD on land that not only glows, but flies at NIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ALIENS... but I KNOW what I saw! I was in clear mind!  I keep looking out the window begging for the colors to come back to no avail.<n>

It was not because it kept going and it wasn&#39;t bright enough.  It looked like 3 whitish -yellow lights.  I now realize that they were dim because it was so far away.  It was moving fast and it was silent.  These lights were some kind of craft. I have never seen anything like it before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 44 years old and I have seen ufo&#39;s on two other occasions.

We live in Greenville, NC.  We were coming into Washington, NC when right above the tree-tops there was a flying object.  It was maybe 100-200ft up in the sky.  It was around 9:25PM and we watched it for a minute or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying from right to left.  It was something unbelievable.  At first we thought it was a plane but they have never and wouldn’t fly that low over the Washington area.  We live by an airport and could learly tell it wasn’t a plane.  It was cloudy tonight so if it was an airplane, we shouldn’t have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be silver in color and was more oval or the typical “UFO” shape.  It was flying incredible fast, faster than any airplane I have ever seen.  It had lights that could have been underneath of it but they looked more along the sides and on the middle of the craft.  The lights were different colors of white, yellow, and red.  They didn&#39;t have a synchronized pattern in their flashes either and they all flashed at different times.  It seemed to have a reddish/orange vapor trail following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got toward the 1 minute mark it just seemed to vaporize and it was gone.  We can only believe that it was a UFO and it was amazing.<n>

No crafts seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 40 year old male from Kelso WA.  On Sunday night, January 27th 2013, about 9pm, I was taking a walk.  When I am out walking, I am very observant, always looking to the right and left.  I don&#39;t want someone coming up on me, possibly to rob me.  I try to stay on guard.  I did not see anyone around.  All of a sudden, I look to my left and there is this girl.  It was like she appeared out of no where.  I did not hear her approaching.  She was about 4 feet from me.  Normally if someone is walking close by, I can hear them.  The girl appeared to be in her early 20&#39;s.  She was about 5&#39; tall and small framed.  I could tell she was an adult and not a child.  She had shoulder length bright blonde hair that looked almost white.  Her eyes were black with no white showing.  She was wearing sweat pants and a hoodie, but the hood was not covering her head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw her, I said, &#34;Hi, how you doing this evening?&#34;  She mumbled something, but I could not hear what she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She moved her head back and forth as she stood there checking me out curiously.  I felt there was something not quite right about her and felt a definite chill.  Though it was cold outside, the chill was not due to the weather.  I cautiously took a few steps towards her and she backed up.  In a moment she took off running, but not like any human or animal I had ever seen.  She ran with a fluid movement and there was no sound as her feet hit the ground.  She disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something just did not see right about her.  I have never seen anyone like her before or since.<n>

It was around 200 feet up in the air, closer than any aircraft I see flying in this area on a daily basis.  It was a large right triangle shape, with dimly lit lights that were dome shaped - spaced about a thumb width apart if I were to hold my hand up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights went all the way around the craft.  The space in the middle was black (it blocked out the stars).  It was a clear night, no wind or clouds for miles.   It flew over my head, heading south.  I would estimate at about 30-40 miles per hour.  I told my friends and family about it.  My sister told me today that one of her co-workers who lives in my area saw it too on his drive in to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise, and i watched it until the lights were no longer visible (estimating 2-3 miles away).  The lights were a really dim beige color, no other colors or flashing of any sort.  They seemed to be illuminating from within and were almost hard to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I see planes and helicopters fly over all the time and you can always see a silouette and blinking lights and also hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no plane or helicopter.

I saw nothing with my eyes but the image was in my camera.  The disc looks like a coin with relief details in the surface. It is clear without the zoom. It was big taking the moon as referenced in the picture, but I cannot tell about the size.  It looks silver and bright in the image.  I was shock after I realized what it was in my camera.

I pointed it out to my friend walking beside me, he noted aloud that it was accelerating.  We stopped in our tracks and just stared up at it.  A few seconds pass then it quickly starts flying in the opposite direction and then jerks to the west, then circles and starts flying east.  I took out my camera since this was my third UFO sighting and wanted evidence this time.  However, the view became obstructed by the top of a palm tree and we never saw it again.  There is a small airport very nearby, however I have never seen an aircraft move with such freedom.  In fact, I just viewed the Boca Raton Airport &#34;webtrak&#34; flight tracker from 3:17am-3:40am.  Not any kind of aircraft arrived, departed, flew over or nearby the airport according to several of their radars.  Im planning on contacted them to inquirer about what I saw.

The lights were equally spaced  and appeared to be in a straight line or file. I first observed then to my left and when I finished driving the lights were to the right of me; I was traveling on a mostly straight road.

The object was most definitely mechanical, and intelligently controlled. My impression of the object&#39;s size was that it was equivalent to or somewhat smaller than a helicopter, but I am uncertain.  The most significant physical feature was what appeared to be two blue-white lights in close proximity that seemed to quickly oscillate with yellow, looking like headlights. (Though they appeared as headlights, their apparent brightness remained relatively uniform despite three-dimensional maneuvering).  Somewhat higher and slightly offse! t from these was a smaller periodically flashing red light, but this was only intermittently visible, due I believe to the face of the object that contained the flashing light being turned away as it maneuvered.  Because of the lights&#39; brightness and the dark of night, the actual shape of the object was difficult to make out.  The object made no sound, of jets or propeller blades, and left no contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s motion was most peculiar.  It was capable of great dexterity and unpredictability, sudden acceleration and stops, hovering, and a very slow controlled vertical descent.  It would shoot off very quickly in a straight line, stop on a dime, hover for about 30 seconds, then perform a very slow zigzag, stop and hover again for a period, then dip and weave off to another section of sky and repeat similar motions. At two points the object stopped in air, hovered, then very slowly descended vertically to disappear behind the roof edge of the apartment complex on the corner. It remained unseen from our vantage point for about 2 minutes, then unexpectedly came zipping back into view. For the entire period of observation, the object stayed within the same area, roughly a square city block. It did not appear to be following any conventional search pattern, but instead behaved very erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting at the corner for a bus when I first noticed the object, noting it at first for the unusual brightness of the light and its low altitude. As I began to take photos with my phone (unfortunately, the camera is low-quality), a youth also waiting at the bus stop noticed and began to take video with his smart phone. As we continued to observe and document, marveling to each other and trying to identify the object, its motions became more and more bizarre, as described above. About 5 minutes into this, a resident of the apartment complex came by, noticed and commented on the strangeness of the object as well, but didn&#39;t stay for more than a moment. After about 15 minutes, the battery on my phone had gone out, and the object had disappeared beyond the roof&#39;s horizon for several minutes. As I traded contact info with the youth, the bus came; I got on and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can confirm without reservation that the object I saw was neither a plane nor a helicopter of any type. I did observe a police helicopter performing a search later in the evening in a different part of town, and can report that the light patterns and motions of the two were absolutely dissimilar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 29-year-old college graduate, history major. I work in education, helping to build websites for educational curriculum. I am not an active UFO hunter, and have never seen anything like this before. I don&#39;t know the fellow taking the video or his background, but he appeared to be about 18, and was just as flabbergasted as I was. The woman who observed in passing was most likely a college student, as that area is very close to the University of Texas. I am still waiting for word from the youth, hoping that he will send me the video to forward along. Unfortunately, the photos I did manage to get on my phone are pretty low-resolution, but if you zoom in on the bright blue object in the center of most of them, you will see the basic shape of the twin lights I have described.<n>

Sat on balcony to enjoy the evening warmth and night sky.  husband said look.  I looked up and saw a bright orange light moving from a southern direction heading to a northern direction.  There a total of 4 bright orange orbs moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were over the water moving at a slow pace so you had plenty of time to view them.  The first passed and disappeared over the top of the northern tower of rooms.  The second came next and followed the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said get your camera in case there are more.  I grabbed my sony digital point and shoot camera.  Managed to get it turned on in time to see the third large bright orange orb pass by in the same trajectory as the other two.  Snapped one pic of it.  Then my husband said record them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moved the camera to video mode and the third one had passed.   So we waited a minute at least and the fourth orb came from the south.  I started recording it.  The recording isn’t top notch because I was so excited over what we were seeing I kept moving too much and loosing it and having to refind it in the camera lense.  But it was on the same smooth trajectory as the other two.  I wished I had a tripod under the camera and the quality would be better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there were no more and we waited quite a while to see if more would come.  The thing that was most striking was how large the light looked when it was at least a half mile away over the ocean.  They all followed the same specific path of flight.  And there was absolutely no sound at all.  You would have missed them if you were not watching the sky.  Small planes flew in and out of a nearby airport and you could hear them over the ocean noise but these orbs made no sound before or after or during their passing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Male’s Description:  Facing west, from left to right facing the ocean I saw moving lights at approximately 1,000 feet up from the ocean.  Moving objects that progressed at a slow rate of speed.  The only truth I could decipher is the visual illumination of the craft and the absence of sound behind the illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two were visually flying together.  Once they left eyesight a moment later another single craft appeared and took about one minute to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last craft appeared 3 to 4 minutes later and took about a minute to diappear flying left to right.<n>

I was driving in a northerly direction, about 20 MPH, and saw lights moving in a southerly direction.  They were so distinct that I quickly stopped to observe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m looking to my left (west) and I see these strange lights moving pretty fast, not supersonic but I&#39;m guessing about 720 mph.  (See below.)  They were 6 of them, in a formation that changed as they moved.  It initially looked like two in the lead, side by side, two following in a straight line between the two leading, and two more in the rear that were side by side.  The formation appeared to change as they moved along.  They appeared to come closer to the earth, then moved up in height and veered toward the west, disappearing into the night sky.  This whole thing took place in a period of maybe 2 minutes or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was cursing myself for not having my camera, which I almost always have, but then thought I might as well do what I can with the iPhone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a strange light that looked like an umbrella, actually more like an inverted U,  and they glowed with a bit of orangeness.  There was no flickering.  And they looked nothing like an airplane.  I wondered if they could be helicopters and cranked down my window and there was no noise, from anything, even on the ground.  There was no traffic and it&#39;s a quiet area of Portland.  Besides, I&#39;ve seen many helicopters at night over the years and these were much higher (I&#39;d guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet) and were moving in a way that was unfamiliar to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am including the pictures I took with my iPhone4S, with explanatory notes.  I have not edited these pictures at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This first shot was taken at 8:35:27.  I don&#39;t know the source of the light pollution on the right of the picture.  The objects were heading southwesterly and beginning to ascend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This second shot was taken at 8:35:32.  An expert on speed/distance might be able to calculate the speed of the objects by comparing the movement with the times shot.  I&#39;m guessing at distances but looking at the map, am estimating they would have traveled from an area around Windham, Me, to somewhere around Waterboro, Me.  in the approximate 2 minutes I watched them.  This would put their speed at 720 miles per hour if I&#39;m right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third shot was taken at 8:35:50.  Note the comparative distance traveled in 18 seconds.  Speed?  See above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This last shot was taken at 8:36:41.  This was 51 seconds later and the first two of the lights had ascended, moving towards the southwest, and disappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the time from the first shot to the last shot was 1 minute, 14 seconds.  If they were traveling 720 miles per hour, this would mean they covered about 35 miles while I watched, including about 45 seconds before I started taking the pictures.  This seems approximately right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background:  I have a Bachelor&#39;s Degree from a 4-year, accredited university and am 71 years old.  I am a professional photographer, and tried to copy pictures of the event taken with my iPhone.  I didn&#39;t have my DSLR with me.<n>

I was watchng it in the sky wondering what it was. I watched for almost the whole block while walking along the south side of Zeering Rd between Olive Ave and Fosberg Rd.  Then  2 cars drove up towards me on the street &amp; headlights &amp; trees overhanging sidewalk blocked my vision momentarily  The cars stopped &amp; parked, one behind the other, small white cars.  A girl got out of eac car and said &amp;quot;Did you see that. Look it turned black!  Did u see it?&amp;quot;.  I thought they were talkin to me but they were talkin to each other. I said did u see that too? T he bright lite? One girl said &amp;quot;Look it turned black. Did you see that?&amp;quot;  They pointed to the sky and eventually I saw it I had misplaced it when the cars drove up with the bright lights.  It had turned black &amp; changed shape into a flat floppy thing shifting side to side in the sky. It started falling straight down and lan! ded in a tree (I saw the branches move when it landed) in the park across on the north side of Christofferson Parkway.  There is a soundwall on the northside of Zeering in between the paralell south side of Christofferson Pkwy.  I ran to go see what it was but by the time I was crossing street it took off from the tree &amp; flew southeast into a subdivision on the other side of Olive Ave. it was a large floppy black like an ocean stingray but more pronounced armiture. It was traveling about the speed of a car. I couldn&#39;t keep up. I&#39;d tried to follow it but it was Flying diagonally across lanes &amp; down the street. It was the most unusual thing I&#39;ve ever seen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 2013.  PD))<n>

He pointed out some lights in the sky to the southeast.  I observed 7-8 red/orange bright balls of light floating upward at a slightly slower pace than an average airplane travels.  The balls of light were almost twice the size of a star and flickered a little bit like floating balls of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the balls of light formed a serpentine pattern and were low in the sky, as they floated upward they came together to form a slightly curved line with a good amount of space between each one.  My brother went inside the house and then came back out with our mom and my boyfriend.  The four of us watched the balls of light disappear into the clouds, the whole indecent lasted about ten minutes.<n>

Upon driving closer to it, there appeared to be some sort of tether attached to another body, or as if it were a bridge between two ships.  Some sort of aircraft seemed to be going between the two bodies, back and forth as well as around th structure. the lights coming from this aircraft shone on the flat surface of the structure and around it.  It appeared to be somewhere in the sky south east of  the intersection of highway 46 and  highway 81.  The aircraft traveling between the massive metal structures also interacted with the ground, hovering probably 100 ft and beaming light to the ground. the structure that appeared  to be tethered to the large metal structure was cloaked in a dark cloud, but lights traveled between them.  What was unclear was its intention: it hovered above the sky as the small aircraft traveled around it and possibly was transmitting data, delivering something, who knows.  We also witnessed &#34;nothern lights&#34; while this was occuring in the south sky.<n>

Seen by USMC Scout/Sniper.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96088.html|57|ndxe201301| 2 Craft seen in Elk Grove, Ca. Defying inertia and gravity with no sound.  Seen by USMC Scout/Sniper<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Whom It May Concern,  I make this report of sound mind and sound health. I was a USMC Scout/Sniper from 1988 to 1994. I served in Kuwait and Liberia. I consider myself to be a highly trained observer. Thursday,January 24th I was tired from work and I fell asleep at 7 pm. I woke up at 2 am and I decided to make a cup of coffee. So, after 7 hours of good sleep and a nice big cup of hot coffee I decided to take a walk to a local park approximately 1,500 meters from my home. I live in a beautiful suburb of Sacramento,Ca. Elk Grove, Ca is south of Sacramento. I reside in the southern portion of the city of Elk Grove, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have, for the last 60 days, been repeating this very same routine. I generally sleep from 7 or 8 pm to 2 or 3 am. I am a professional Sales Manager for a local Elk Grove company and I have clients on the east coast. I start work on my laptop, contacting clients in Rochester, New York at 4 am my time and 7 am Rochester time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance from Elk Grove to Sacramento is 17 miles or 27 kilometers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give an accurate location I used my GPS that comes standard on my cell phone which is a top of the line &amp;quot;Samsung Galaxy III&amp;quot;... Please note from paragraph 1 that I am a trained Scout / Sniper from the USMC. I know what I saw and with that said I place the following report:  At 3:15 am I was standing in a local park in south Elk Grove.  The park is called &amp;quot;Machado Dairy Park&amp;quot; and is 1.0 miles south of Whitelock Pkwy and approx .2 miles west of Bruceville Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in the park about ready to sure-up one of the laces on my boots when I was drawn to some rather odd looking lights in the sky.  Traveling North to South, from Sacramento to Elk Grove I saw 2 craft that were delta shaped, but with the middles cut out resembling more of a chevron type structure.  These 2 craft were darting about the sky at fantastic speeds.  They were making right angle turns and skipping about as if they were on water.  I know enough from my training in the Marine Corps that these 2 craft were definitely intelligently controlled.  It had rained out yesterday,Thursday, here in Elk Grove and in Sacramento quite heavily and there was a lot of water on the grass in which I was standing.  I was going to lie down on the ground and try to quiet my body for a more accurate description because I knew in an instant that what I was observing was something very special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I overcame the wet ground and quickly got into a prone position on my back , I was positioned north to south. The objects displayed a disregard for inertia:  They were flying as if there was no such thing as gravity.  They sped up, then stopped, then flew at a tremendous speed, in my direction, so that to me they (appeared to be) standing still.  The next instant they changed course. ... In other words, the flying objects had overcome gravity. The objects were making no sound that I could hear and were about 1000 ft above my head with a visible ceiling of 3,000 ft.  I could at one instance see another flying object traveling east to west at about 15,000 to 20,000 ft and it had all the typical lights that one would see on a passenger jet ( i&#39;m 100% sure that&#39;s what it was).  Quite frequently I see passenger aircraft because I believe that I reside under the approach corridor for Sacramento&#39;s airport. I see a lot of aircraft and I know without a shadow of a doubt that these 2 ob! jects were not of this earth, or better yet, if they are, they displayed a secret technology that has been very well kept from the people of this planet. I have my own opinion on that and do not wish to cloud the issues at hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the craft were speeding up and stopping so quickly that it was as if they would disappear and then reemerge (appear) at another point in the sky.  I could see 3 faint lights at the tip or points of each craft. They were a gun metal black and looked to be perfect in shape.  A perfect triangle with and angle of 60 degrees at each tip.  Equilateral or Delta I believe.  The 2 craft then just quickly sped off in a western direction and within mere seconds were gone from my vantage point. I then quickly ran home and went upstairs and grabbed my binoculars (Vortex 8 x 42  Razor HD ) &amp; my spotting scope (Leopold Tactical Mark 4  12-40x60mm  mil-dot ).  Upon my return I did not see the 2 craft again. I spent another 40 minutes scanning the skies with my binoculars and my scope.  I just saw the usual aircraft for that time of morning. I plan to search the skis later tonight after work with my set of night vision because now I am &#34;hooked&#34; as they say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That concludes my report.<n>

I know what stars look like, the pretty white sparkling stars in the night sky, also some in red and blue color, I know how fast commercial planes go and how all of them blink red lights with steady speeds, and usually flys straight in the sky, I know government air craft can move in all types of ways and speeds, but what I saw last night on I-5 north at Exit 40 wasn&#39;t any of these types of aircrafts or stars in the night sky I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witness and saw was beyond anything of this world, or anything I  could ever imagine or believe.  There was a cluster of 6 orange/red objects that moved in a way, and in speeds that I can&#39;t explain, describe or ever imagine.  Right in front of my front windshield I seen these objects in the clear sky moving in incredible speeds backwards and forwards, side to side, up and down, diagonal, and circling each other in a way no air craft on earth could ever do.  These 6 objects were so present and visible in the night sky that I knew they were roughly 2&#34;inches from each other doing amazing movements and speeds, like dancing or playing tag with each other, but far enough away I couldn&#39;t see the actual shape, size, or structure of these crafts.  I know with everything I know, everything I&#39;ve seen, and everything in my whole entire life of existence that these were unidentified air crafts and NOT from our world.  This is the only way I can describe what I saw last night.  I don&#39;t have proof because it lasted for a few seconds and vanished from my eyes My mind is in such an unbelievably amount of shock, fear, questions, and amazement that I&#39;m completely numb from head to toe.  I watch these shows of people who experience UFO&#39;s in the daylight and the night sky, and thought to myself how amazing it would be to be apart of what those people experienced, but never EVER did I EVER think I would witness and be apart of that as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I&#39;m saying sounds crazy, and most of you will be thinking yeah right, whatever, your crazy, but if I had even 1% of doubt with what I saw and witnessed I wouldn&#39;t announce it for the world to hear, but I know without a doubt in my mind, 100%, I completely know what I saw and witnessed last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing this post to share it publicly in hopes someone witnessed it as well and shares what they saw as well.  I know we are not alone.  I am a 100% believer we are being visited and I&#39;m not the only one who has witnessed unidentified air crafts.  I&#39;m just another person who is willing, wanting, and not scared to share my experience with the world!<n>

My mother and I were in the front seat and both spotted what appeared at first to be a large airplane coming towards us. We both started what is that plane doing that low. It was a hundred feet  above the ground and coming right at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We travelled about a tenth of a mile and stopped in the middle of the road. We were stunned.  The craft had five huge lights, but they were not like any lights we had ever seen. They were orange/ red in color.  Once we stopped I could make out a curved shape like a saucer shape. I could only see the part that the lights lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached for my cell phone to get a photo and jumped out of the car. The light disappeared one my one within two seconds. I didn&#39;t have enough time to even click on my camera. I got in the car and my children and mother were yelling about this UFO. We went home, which took five minutes and I went in and looked out the back door! south. I saw the light again disappearing over the trees east of us. I would guess the distance at about twenty miles away.<n>
1/24/13 18:40|Clearwater Beach|FL|Sphere|15 minutes|Three Orbs spotted out around 5-7 miles of Clearwater Beach Florida while flying in our Cessna 172.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96086.html|62|ndxe201301| Three Orbs spotted out around 5-7 miles of Clearwater Beach Florida while flying in our Cessna 172.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight me and two friends decided to go for a sunset flight out of Clearwater International Airport in a Cessna 172.  We were airborne around 7pm (eastern standard time) and flew out to Clearwater Beach than turned heading south.  We flew over toward the Skyway Bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we reached the bridge the sun had completely set.  After doing a flyby near the bridge we turned around and headed back up toward clearwater beach (North of our location) flying along the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 7:40pm I noticed (while sitting in the co-pilot seat) an orange ball of light that appeared to be on the water surface.  For what ever reason I became fixated on the object, something about it did not seem normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching this object it suddenly skyrocketed to easily 4,000ft in under two seconds.  at this time I started freaking out and pointed the object out to my buddy (flying the plane) and my friend sitting in the back right passenger seat.  We all saw this object!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the 15-20 or so minutes watching this object it changed extreme flight levels over 10 times from what appeared to be from the water surface and at one point easily over 5,000 feet.  There is no way this was any type of known government aircraft for the G&#39;s this object would have had to be pulling were in no way survivable by any human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this bright orange orb I noticed two smaller much lighter colored objects (both orbs as well colored more like a light star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These smaller orbs seemed to be getting closer to the bigger orange orb and than would move away in a different direction quickly.  The big orange orb would then seem to chase them almost like a few kids playing tag with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all freaking out so much that we tried to make sense of this occurrence, we even started flying in different directions with the aircraft to view it out of different windows to make sure it wasn&#39;t some type of optical allusion out of the one win! dow we first started observing from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was easily (! from wha t it seemed) 5-7 miles off shore.  It even looked as if there was some type of boat near the objects, which in my mind any crew member would have had to have seen these orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the distance between us and these objects I can not say for sure the size of the objects, but for sure there was one larger orange orb (which seemed to be either a mother craft or something, just seemed as if it was in charge) with two much smaller lighter (whitish) orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know aircraft very well and have been around them my whole life, this was not a plane or a helicopter of any type.  This was not an aircraft/object flown by any human..... this thing shot from ocean level to 4,000 feet in a matter of 2 seconds or less (no exaggeration).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all know what we saw tonight.  We tried to take video but we only had iPhones which of course could not zoom in on these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed as much as we could and than decided that we needed to head back to the airport and land which was around 8pm or! so (give or take a few minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is hands down one of the craziest experiences of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Might I add we were all perfectly sober too, this is legit and like I said, we all know what we saw.<n>

I assumed it was landing lights from a plane.  As I got closer I noticed it hadn&#39;t moved and I could see 3 separate closely-grouped lights and what seemed to be a slight reflection of those lights off an object that the lights sat on top of. I could not distinquish the shape of the object.  Thought it might be an advertising balloon belonging to one of the nearby car dealerships but it was too high for that and no tether was visible.  As I passed the Portsmouth traffic circle and continued to the I95 Piscataqua Bridge the object stayed stationary in a position that seemed to be between Pease TradePort and Woodbury Ave.  It was dusk and difficult to distinguish shape of object just below the 3 lights but there did seem to be something with no well-defined shape- sort of like a light framework was all it looked like.  I lost sight of the object just before I crossed the I95 bridge.  Took exit 1 after bridge and pulled over as I had binoculars in my truck but could no longer find the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Hadley, Massachusetts (USA), I saw a large bright white comet-fireball-looking light/phenomenon vertically dropping in a slight arc around the area of what appeared to be Mt. Toby in S. Deerfield, although it was difficult to estimate exact location.  The phenomenon looked too large, too close and too bright to be a falling or shooting star.  It appeared to be what I would imagine a comet to look like except for its large size and apparent nearness.  It seemed to fizzle out before reaching the ground (horizen).  It would be similar to the intensity of someone shooting off fireworks before the mid-air explosion except that it was going DOWN instead of straight up.  There were no sounds detecte.d It seemed to last about just under 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very startling. I have not seen anything like it before.<n>

It stood out among the rest of the other objects in the sky like small stars and aircraft with their blinking lights. This bright light was hovering still. I pointed it out to my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked at it.  I said, &#34;What is that?&#34;   And at that moment it sped off super fast going sideways and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other in disbelief.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like that ever.

Suddenly, the power went out for several city blocks. They looked up, and spotted a large oval shaped object, larger than the Sun in appearance, moving slowly across the city in a NE direction, toward the Columbia River. The object made no noise, nor did it lose any debris; no unusual scents or animal movement known. After approximately 30 seconds, the object disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to the craft itself, it was dark orange in the center, turning lighter shades toward its outer edges.

The object was in the direction above Derry, NH - unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance-wise: quite. I observed what I initially thought was a plane but it maintained the same area for some time.  It was rectangular with stationary blue, yellow, white and red lights. Unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before.  I&#39;m in a well lit area and I was able to see this object for some time. I waited to see if it would disappear or move closer to no avail. I am in Londonderry, NH facing Derry, NH, (the airport is 7.25 miles northwest {behind me}) the object was in the direction of Derry heading south towards Salem, NH and then north then south again (not fast but over a period of time).  I went into my home to grab a pair of binoculars and couldn&#39;t locate.  I grabbed my iphone and noticed the object heading south again.  I tried capturing it on the camera and had no luck. I realize credibility is important in these cases -- having witnesses or a picture would be beneficial.  Its after midnight, I ran out to grab my lunch bag in my car as I forget to bring it in! earlier and didn&#39;t want the drink freezing and popping. Its 7 °F and no one is up.  My camera cannot capture anything but blurry image - there&#39;s no force or anything prohibiting me from getting a photograph.  I have a pair of binoculars in a box and do not feel like tearing my house apart to find it.  I will try to locate it this weekend in case of future sighting. I&#39;ve never seen one before and hope to see it again. I want to believe it is explainable like a plane or helicopter but the distance was too great; no noise; no predictability like a normal object.  We live pretty close to the airport that would be easy to explain; however I&#39;ve seen enough aircraft over the years at all hours to rule out. I am perplexed on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Is not cloudy or just a few clouds and the moon and the stars are bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly pull out my iphone to record it, but if you have an iphone you know is not great at night from a distance. It was awesome to see something like that.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  Maybe a new spy plane?  All I know it was huge.  I have the video I will d! o my best to post it.

I saw a light in the sky towards the east.  It was blinking, changing colors, and appeared to be continually changing its size and shape.  As I approached 431, I was within 100 to 150 yards of the object for a brief time.  I was a little nervous and crossed over 431 and headed towards 72.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another unusual light about five miles down the road.  The object appeared quickly over my left shoulder.  I noticed a red light illuminating the field beside me.  This object was much smaller in size. It appeared to vibrate while changing from red to blue very fast.  I was afraid and kept driving down the road.<n>

Then the ufo changed shape (triangle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It scared me  so much!!!<n>

After watching it for about 10 sec. It shot out in front of it two more lights of similar dimensions.  The lights spread to a equal distance apart from each other. Then after 5 or 10 sec.  All three disappeared. All three lights was moving at about the speed of a small passager jet and the lights was not as bright as meter and was not losing attitude.<n>

The light came from the sky above traveling sort of straight down in path not unlike large bright fireworks coming down out of the sky downward.  The color was mostly bright white and I think I detected just a hint of yellow and maybe some blue - again it looked almost like a bright ball or stream of light heading downward behind the treetops and into the horizon. I awaited a boom or was expecting to feel the impact it was so bright. It was kind of unnerving thinking it was a missle or somthing. But nothing, just silence.  No vibration from impact. So I assumened it must have been very far away. The direction for my viewing point would have been roughly facing South East.  The path of the bright ball or stream of light took about 2 to 3 seconds to travel from sky to horizon and out of site behind the trees as viewed through my bedroom window.  Again it was so bright that I thought is was fireworks landing in the woods 50 yards behind my house.  I got up, startling my wife, and stared out at that part of the sky and woods for 10 minutes or so, but not a trace of any other type of activity accept twinkling stars.   That&#39;s it. I searched the internet today and did find where a number of other sightings in upstate NY and PA were very very much like mine at the same time of night. It was relieving to see others had seen what I had seen apparently.  Thank you for having this forum for describing such experiences.<n>

It moved silently with no sound what so ever toward southeast direction and was flickering like a candle light as it was moving along with a constant speed about 30-35 mph.  It had no trail at all.  At one point, it stopped for about 5 seconds above my neighbor rooftop then took off again in the same direction.  I let me son know then ran to the back of the house and watch it from the deck.  It flew away toward southeast direction and elevated as it was moving along, the light get dimmer and dimmer then disappeared as it move further away from us.

Sunset had been just about 18:30.   As it was turning to go N, it banked and the bank of lights turned with it.  It looked like one quarter of the lights from the ships from Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind.  I assume these were entirely terrestrial, but am including this report in case any others saw them.  We were under wind advisory conditions and I can attest to 40-45 MPH winds and this would be a mean feat for any aircraft, especially lighter than air ones as these must have been.  They were going too slowly to have been regular planes and almost looked as if they were some kind of advertising gimmick.  I should note there is no military flight path nor event center I know of for miles.  I followed this craft with the eye until I could no longer see it.  I picked up my girlfriend (waiting about ten minutes) and immediately told her about the sighting.  As we went back toward W HWY-10, another craft, exactly the same, came over the crest and I had to stop the car to give her a good look at it.  Wind gusts were really getting high now, but the highly-lit craft (mostly white) with its bank of very bright lights took a similar flight plan and didn&#39;t seem to notice.  No effects on car, radiation or otherwise.  It did not occur to me to try to take video of either craft, if I had been very alert, along with traffic, I might have gotten blurry video that may have looked like a very new type of aircraft.<n>

My fiancé and I live in Crofton, Kentucky.  Like normal people we are skeptics as to what or who is out there watching over us.  Tonight around 1 am my fiancé went to take a pee out the backdoor (I was occupying the only bathroom) and immediately called for my attention.  So when I was finished with my business in the bathroom I went to join him at the back door to see what he was seeing.  At first I didn’t know what I was looking at, but then I saw it move. It seems to be saucer like and triangular in shape with lights that form the triangle.  I saw 5 others just like it in different areas of the sky both out the front and back door of my trailer.  They are moving way too fast to be any airplane or helicopter, and for the most part are remaining in their little sectors of the sky. Some are father away and the others are closer to us.  I can’t tell if they are in the atmosphere or just outside of it, but from the looks of it they are several miles away.  It’s is now 1:52 am I just looked and they are still out there.  I noticed that when they ascend they release a trail of sparks.  One of the 5 that we viewed released what appeared to be some kind of blue wave. Kind of what a shock wave from an explosion looks like only it was blue and didn’t last for very long. 1:56 now...  They are still out there!!  Can somebody please tell us we’re not crazy! I even made a Facebook post about it calling all of my Kentucky friends to acting telling them to look outside.  Whatever is going on out there... it can’t be good. I tried to record them with my iPhone4 but they are too faraway and it is much too dark out there for my camera to pick it up.<n>

I walked up my driveway to check my mailbox and saw them come into view, but not suddenly, rather gradually.  The 4 balls of light made a formation, two in the middle, top to bottom, and two to either side, and then proceeded to &#34;dance,&#34; or move around in a seductive type of aerial display if you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the presence of mind to take video of it on my cell phone, though it did not come very well due to it being dark out.  I was absolutely mesmerized and the objects held my gaze and wonder for several minutes, until they slowly, not suddenly, but not lagging either, just slipped away to the North, Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the 2nd time I had witnessed this type of aerial activity.  The first occurence happened in July of 2009 at around 3:45am in the morning whilst driving down Farmers Loop Road at which time! I was heading East, only to be visually waylayed by a large black disk in the sky that was slowly hovering North.  The memory is one of time being slowed down, almost made meaningless.  I took several cell phone pictures of it in the spot I first saw it in, though it appeared later on, down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me and I will email your organization the video and pictures.

I was at Klondike Park, a sandstone-rich park in Augusta, Missouri, which is in eastern Missouri about fifty miles west of St. Louis.  The brilliant white sandstone is why it’s called Klondike Park because it sort of looks like the rocks are snow-covered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a night hike. I was looking up at the stars, and it was a beautiful night for doing so, completely clear and far enough from civilization to where you could see a lot of them.  I believe I was looking up into the low eastern sky but I cannot guarantee that (I was looking up and to the right; if I had looked up and to the left I would have been looking at the Big Dipper and Orion). I happened to be looking at two ordinary stars, not very bright, right next to each other.  Since they were so ordinary, why I found myself fixated on them for more than a few seconds is a mystery. Anyway, it turns out that one of the stars was not so ordinary. Suddenly one of them starts moving straight away from the other, a very smooth movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, &#34;Oh it’s a plane,&#34; even though a few seconds before it had been completely stationary. Then, suddenly, it vanished! It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now since it had been stationary I don’t see how it could have been a plane or a meteor or even a satellite. Barring any weird astronomical phenomena I am unfamiliar with, I would have to say that was some sort of flying object, and since I could not identify it, I guess that was a UFO. But was it an alien spacecraft of some sort? Who knows? I don’t. But I definitely could not identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It seemed like they were moving closer but in different distances. It is very hard to give any kind of measurement because it was dark. We could not hear them at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden on the right side two lined up perfectly, one on top of the other. It looked as if it was headed straight for us so we drove out of the parking lot driving towards them so we could get a better look at them. We approached the intersection at Rosebud Road and Grayson Highway we could still see them up through the trees.  The two still lined up one above the other and to the left a few were still scattered about but they had moved closer together.  It looked as if they were hovering above the trees.  We turned into this Church parking lot to try to get a better look and out of traffic. The lights had faded out, almost like they went backwards away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the most unusual thing we had ever seen.  It wasn’t any kind of aircraft we are aware of. I’m not even sure anyone else saw them.  Again, the lights were an amber color not to red and not to orange.  I would say they may have only one light on each one. I just wished it had been day light so I could explain them in more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say it makes me wonder if we really are being watched.

It hovered for around 15-20 seconds and then took off a little slowly, it sat for another couple seconds and took off into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when I quickly grabbed my Iphone 5 and snapped three pictures.  It was around 6pm so it was slightly dark but the quality is rather good and you can see the lights spinning on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had my window rolled down and noticed the object to be very quiet.  Like a fan you&#39;d have in your bedroom in the summer.<n>

As I was approaching the Federal Blvd. exit, a flash caught my eye. A small (6-12 ft.) wide classic shiny disc was flying northbound across the horizon.  I followed it with my eyes for a moment and then it just disappeared into thin air, which was pretty amazing.  I scanned the sky to see if maybe I had just lost it for a moment an at the same time was fumbling form my phone to take a shot in case I found it again.  As I scanned I noticed a dark helicopter in the vicinity flying low at about the same elevation the craft was at.  The helicopter was quite a distance off from the craft but it gave me the creeps as I am a UFO enthusiast and realized the implications.  In no way did I leave the house today wishing to sight a UFO, I am far too intelligent for hoaxes and am a true believer so would never tarnish the subject.....Extra terrestrial??  Not enough time to give a 100% thumbs up on this...I have never se! en a UFO before this day....<n>

It was about 15 to 20 minutes past sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was approaching the intersection of Route 236 &amp; Pickett Rd, I noticed at my 10 o&#39;clock position, about a quarter of a mile away, a black silhouette outline of a cigar/disk-like object with rounded or blunted ends, flying slowly about 300 to 500 feet above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approx. 120 to 160 feet in length (5 to 6 single-family houses in length) and about 30 to 50 feet height at the thickest point at it&#39;s center, traveling in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  What seemed unusual was it&#39;s slow speed (about 120 to 150 mph) and it&#39;s relatively low altitude above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there where 4 or 6 white strobe lights on the outer edges of the black silhouette cigar/disk-like object w/rounded / blunted ends and the strobe lights were evenly spaced at both ends and at the top and bottom edges near the ! center of the object, all blinking in unison and sometimes blinking in a counter-clockwise rotating pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were regular jet aircraft easily identifiable flying high above in the vicinity.<n>

I thought that it looked very strange and was way too close to the airplane for comfort.  The other object appeared to be round and smaller than the plane. Both were moving east, almost paralleled one another and very close it appeared both moving upwards and East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fumbled with my cell phone camera to try to get a picture and by that time the object split off from the plane and went in a new direction. It was now moving in a horizontal line, where it was headed vertically before with the plane.  I do not have details if it was a exact angle or how this happened but it was then heading in a straight line to the right, due North I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the object is now moving in a different direction from the plane and it looked like it was moving much quicker than the airplane now but not so fast that it was completely unable to track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I followed it with my eye for a few minutes and the sun illuminated it for about 10 seconds and then it got out of the sun&#39;s illumination.  So basically it is a round, silvery gray object moving in a straight line now. I noticed that it had a bit darker silver dome and a brighter silver underbelly and it was not the shape of an airplane.  I say &#34;dome&#34; because it was not elongated like a plane, it was more round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it for a while and I knew it was too high up in the sky to get a cell phone image it was just too high!  I also did not want to take my eyes off it!  It was heading directly to the right, in a straight line and then it just vanished right before my eyes.  The odd thing is I had a feeling that it was going to vanish. I don&#39;t know how I knew this.  It&#39;s almost like a sense that it was going to vanish.  After it was gone I could still see the plane I originally saw and how the other object looked absolutely nothing like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that day was completely clear, crisp 40 degrees and sunny winter day without a cloud in the sky.  The other planes in the sky all had little comtrails and did not just vanish.  This other &#34;craft?&#34; definitely stood out as being bizarre...which is why I am writing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke into my phone and got all these details down as soon as it happened so things would not fade and get jumbled in my mind.  I hope this report is useful, maybe someone out there saw it too or there is an explanation.  It seemed different that just another plane.  Something unusual about it, which motivated me to write my first ever UFO report.  No one else was on the trail at that moment.  It was like just me and this thing and I was mesmerized just watching it.  It was actually a pretty incredible feeling and I am glad I witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The light seemed to be filtered, with a fuzzy or hazy perimeter.  The light moved but only within one pane out of eight [2 panes wide by 4 panes tall with the pane in question being 2 feet wide by 1 foot tall and the window sill being 36&#34; from the ground].<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my husband got to the computer room, the light was gone.  My husband asked me a few questions and then walked into the living room where he saw a small green light outside the northern window, at an approximate height of 10 feet.  The green light was close enough that my husband would have seen if someone was holding the light.  The green color resembled a light on the stern of a boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my husband approached the window and the green light, which was flashing in no discernable pattern, it moved away and down into the side yard.  My husband said it moved faster than anything he has ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked out the side window and watched as the green light moved back and forth and up and down but always away from the house.  My husband banged on the window but that did not affect the light&#39;s movements.  The green light went over the side of the hill, but we could still see it as it flashed through the trees and down a hill where there is no path and dense u! ndergrowth.  The light moved out of our view.  We observed the lights anywhere from 3-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When inspected at daybreak, there was no obvious evidence. However, three of our tarps were affected.  Two tarps were off of the items they cover: a wood pile and a lawn mower.  The day on the night of the lights, my dad had secured the tarp over the wood pile with heavy wood planks; the day after the night of the lights, he noted that this tarp somehow had folded itself backwards in half onto itself displacing the weights.  The third tarp over another wood pile was shredded in back, however there were strong winds one day/night prior to that night and perhaps that&#39;s what had happened to it.<n>

((sic.  2013))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:20 PM - After dropping off my girlfriend to her parents’ house, after having dinner and drinks at Novi’s Fountain Walk on a Thursday night (We were at Bar Louie), I pulled my car out of the drive way to head home, and began heading north 100 Yards on Elizabeth Ln in Novi, heading towards 10 Mile Road.  In the 100 yards to the exit of the subdivision, I could see a white light in the sky several miles away (less than 5 Miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was descending slowly, straight down.  As it was descending the light changed to a blue.  Thinking that it was a plane falling out of the sky possibly crashing I stopped my SUV 20 yards from 10 Mile Road (still Elizabeth Lane).  Watching the slow descent the light, that I could now see was spherical almost like a ball, it slowed just above the line of the trees that were in my line of vision.  It was clear, cold night, the air was crisp, and visibility was very clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, and stars could be seen.  The light was about 10 times larger than the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the light slowed and stopped, it descended, it started to change color to a green, then to white again, and then to a purple.  These were slow transitions and not flashing transitions.  The sphere then began moving up and then diagonal.  As it was rising I could see that, it was now changing to shades of red and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat parked in my car for about 5 minutes.  I then opened my door of my car and stood outside.  I stood outside for a couple minutes hoping somebody would drive by so that I could point it out to somebody that came by.  Several cars went swiftly past on 10 Mile, but no one stopped, and no one came down Elizabeth Lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to feel crazy, I called my girlfriend to step outside her house or look out a window to see this.  She refused to come outside as she had already changed for bed, and it was cold outside.  She tried to look out several windows, that faced the north, but all windows were blocked by trees and then next doo! r house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked, I watched as the ball/sphere began to circle back to where I originally saw it, all the time changing colors in a smooth transition from red, white, orange, white, blue, purple, white, green.  At times it seemed to glow larger and at times smaller.  The ball moved up and down in diagonal smooth patterns that I have never seen a plane or helicopter move like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15-20 minutes, I gave up on waiting for someone to stop to witness, two cars entered the sub never giving notice to me, half in my car, half out of my car.  I final began my drive home, noticing the ball began to move east towards slightly.  I eventually lost sight of the light when I made a turn south and headed home down Taft Road. Before leaving, I did try to photograph the object, my camera on my iphone 4s would not focus on the object in the night sky, and the camera could not pick up the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> My apologies for the typo.

My attention was drawn to them, as I was observing a low flying helicopter, because I saw a bright flash in the corner of my left eye.  The object&#39;s covered an area of the sky equivalent to an 8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34; sheet of paper at arm&#39;s length.  They were in no particular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves were roughly the size of an average star and similar in brightness, except for when they flashed.  The flash was very very bright considering the size of the objects; it was almost blinding if you were looking at them when they flashed - like a camera flash, but slower and longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects were viewed through a sliding glass door, at first.  Upon opening the door they appeared even brighter. As I observed them, some simply disappeared, but about 8 remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of seconds they began to move at a rate slightly faster than a commercial jet, at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One went west, one north, one east, and between 5 and 8 of them fanned out and moved in southerly directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the group of objects moving south were nearly overhead, they accelerated rapidly out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I awoke with something under the skin of my left front collar bone.  The area was red, but no entry wound was noted.<n>

They weren&#39;t very high up, but they were high enough.  They were silent, and moving in a very glitchy type of movement. After that we began to see figures coming up the hill.  They looked like just blank black forms.  They didn&#39;t look like human figures, they were curvy.  Please. Some one come and investigate this manner. I am scared to sleep now.

The lights appeared to be above a light layer of clouds, very high in the sky.   Currently, the clouds are 9000 feet in the sky, and wind is moving 5 mph from the southwest (currently one hour later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not moving, and appeared to make “smear” like shapes in the sky (especially the orange lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 3 other witnesses that we pointed out the lights to that were also stunned by the lights.  The lights eventually faded out after about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not able to see any stars or anything else in the sky.  The shapes were circular to oval, and appeared “smeared” (maybe due to cloud cover).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spotlights were shining into the sky from downtown Minneap! olis (due to clubs/bars), and as the lights hit the orange balls, the balls would seem to quickly illuminate from the light reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a good picture that shows what we saw as well.<n>

The lights appeared single and in groups of 3 to 5 and went from bright on the left to fading out toward the right.  We estimated that there were between 35 to 45 lights total (not sure when they started showing).  The lights did not appear to move all in the same direction.  Some of the lights also grouped together and others moved apart.  Attempts to photograph objects did not turn out (too dim and far away).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once I reached a straight away I realized that the ufo was actually hovering right over the freeway.  Once I got closer I noticed it had three circular white lights in a triangular formation pointing east towards me.  I remember wondering if it was looking right at me.  To the northeast at the same time I saw one more set of lights same color and brightness about 10 or 15 miles  away.  Going back to the first one, I came up to it like I was looking at the mountains going 70 miles an hour.  It appeared to be fixed in one place just hovering the lights flickering as jet engines look when they’re firing.  The light was so bright that as I drove directly under it, the light reflected off! my car, and it must have been 1000 feet up or more but the light was bright enough that I could see a faint grey outline of what looked like a boomerang, fat in the middle with triangle lights and then I lost sight of it behind my windshield.  When I looked again about two miles down the road I could no longer see either craft maybe because they were too high up to see in my rear view mirror.  At 19:49 I called the national ufo hotline.<n>

As I continued walking I saw that there were a string of these lights spaced out at even intervals.  I saw as many as five spaced out to the horizon at a time.  When they passed directly overhead I could make out a round-cornered triangle shape.  I was able to follow one across its path north and while i was watching it I saw another one pass by it at a different angle and direction...different from the others, then passed out of sight.  I continued watching until the last light disappeared around 10pm. In total I saw what I believe to be 8-12 of these lights.  It was not an airplane! I could see airplanes in the sky; I know their lights from growing up next to an airbase.  I took a short video with my iPhone but you cant see much.<n>

Sadly I was unable to take pictures but my eyes will be in that direction for the next couple of nights to see them dance in the sky again and this time maybe capture so! me photos!<n>

However, a very strange recurring noise is being heard.  It is a low thrumming similar to the sound of several helicopters all flying together.  But there aren&#39;t any helicopters.  I haven&#39;t seen any flying craft of any sort when this is happening.  I&#39;ve heard this noise multiple times throughout the month of January.  When I first heard it I assumed it WAS a group of helicopters operating out of the nearby Scott Air Force Base (which has no helicopters based there, by the way).  However, unlike aircraft in which the Doppler effect causes sound to grow and then fade away as the aircraft passes overhead, this sound grew like an approaching aircraft but then just remained constant!  I can discern no direction from which the sound is coming.  It is just everywhere.  Then it dies down and goes away after several minutes--about 30 minutes is the longest I&#39;ve heard it.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be at a substantial height, at least 2000 ft.  I brushed it off as an unusual sighting.  I observed it for 15 minutes and it did not move.  The next when I took my dog out at 9PM and the same light was south east of my home.  I observed it for about 15 minutes again and it was stationary.  All else was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11 PM I took the dog out again and it was gone.  When I got out to the driveway I saw it again.

Thought it was a helicopter until I realized that they do not have blue lights.  Light configuration was not indicative of any other aircraft we have in the area (and we are the HQ of USAF and location of Boeing repair so we have many types of aircraft in our area).  Lights appeared to have two different (or differently timed) flashing patterns and these lights were strobing so brightly that they obscured the vision of the craft.  I viewed this for at least 10-15 minutes as I was driving home from a meeting going through downtown San Antonio (from north SA to south SA).  It may have been traveling southwest to northeast, very slowly.<n>

I noticed a bright light fixed in the sky.  I approached the bright light thinking it was a street light.  I was wrong I literally stopped my car right up under it and looked up and saw a triangluar craft.  Ten I noticed the craft turned its light of which was located in the center of the craft. That&#39;s when I saw the whole body of the craft.  I have never seen anything like this. It appeared the occupants in the craft noticed me.  Because I noticed they started to slowly move the craft. I do a u turn to follow it but it takes off at this point with a high speed faster than any jet, plane or craft I witnesss. I tired to follow it but lost track. Then I drove around hat area to see if I could find it....that&#39;s when I saw the sky was practically filled withy these objects there were literally about 10 or or15 of the, some of the, flying around with their bright orange center lights off but they had these police like lights and each were shaped like a triangle.

There was also a loud, grating noise, which I initially thought was coming from my car, but upon rolling down my window, I determined it was coming from somewhere further away.  From what I could see, there was no discernable shape to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about a mile from the ocean in a heavily wooded suburban area with mostly summer residences (so about 90% of the homes in the area are empty in the winter), and there are no parking lots or shopping centers around that would emit any kind of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving, I kept an eye on the unusual light, noticing that the noise got louder as I got closer to it.  About 1/2 mile after I first spotted the light, the road takes a sharp bend to the left.  Making this turn, I&#39;d have thought, would have positioned the light behind my right shoulder, but I lost sight of it.  The noise, however, was still quite loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road I live on, which is a narrow, dark, dirt road, is now about 100 yards away on the right.  As I made the turn onto my street, I was astounded to find the light was now at my 11:00, about 100 yards away, still approx. 20&#39; above the trees.  My road is riddled with potholes, so one must drive quite slowly, and my house is about 150 yards down the road.  As I got closer to my driveway, which is on the right, I watched the light begin to creep forward, getting closer to the end of my driveway.  The noise, also, was getting louder.  I, irrationally, turned off my headlights, because I began to get scared, and pulled hurriedly into my driveway; the light was now only about 25 yards from the end of my driveway.  I parked my car and gathered up my belongings as quickly as I could and ran to the end of my deck, which overlooks the driveway and front yard.  However, in the time it took for me to turn around and register the fact that the light had now reached the end of my driv! eway, the noise disappeared and the light, which had been extremely slow moving, suddenly jettisoned off to my left, leaving only a long streak of residual light.  I remained outside for about 30 more minutes, but I didn&#39;t see or hear anything further.<n>

White light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was letting my dog out like I do every night and always look up to see the stars. I noticed a circle object floating across the sky.  It was dark out and a few low flying clouds.  This object was higher than. the lowest flying cloud.  It seemed to have some kind of low light under it and it only would light up 1/3 of the object at a time.  And the light moved counter clockwise.  It was hard to determine the diameter because of the darkness and distance.<n>

It was a V shape craft with many lights underneath.  The lights were a dull golden glow.  The lights displayed the shape of the craft producing a V formation.  It wasnt just outer lights.  There were rows of them.  This craft appeared to be rather large.  The craft itself looked black.  I then saw the craft cruise towards a cloud and beginning to become transparent.  I was so in ore of this craft I could not believe what I was seeing.  I nearly wanted to turn away as it didn’t make any sense to me.  It was so quiet.  Not even a sound of air rushing over it.  This craft was flying over a suburban area next to the city centre.  This craft was defiantly something of very high techical ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were a deep orange, a color I don’t ever recall seeing on an aircraft, and the size of the lights was much greater than that I have ever seen on any aircraft, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was clearly visible, as were many stars on this clear evening, and while they were much smaller than any moon I have ever seen, they were also much larger than any star I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spend a LOT of time on our back porch and see aircraft every day, both during the day and at night.  Having been stationed at NAS Fallon, NV for 3 years, I’ve seen many aircraft, and these lights appeared and behaved like no aircraft I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first saw them, there were from one to five lights at between 180 and 200 degrees from our location, and in my opinion they were no more than two or three thousand feet above ground level. Angle of elevation was very slight, maybe 15 or 20 degrees at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were almost stationary, but comparing their positions with fixed objects on the ground, they WERE moving very slowly.  They never appeared to change elevation during the 20-30 minutes in which they were visible.  Having spent two years aboard USS OAK HILL as a part of the Navigation/Administration department, I spent many hours on the bridge wings, taking bearings of fixed objects ashore to triangulate our position, and there are many lights on the ground in the direction these lights were, making it easy to determine if they were moving.  They WERE moving, but hardly at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light were generally moving from right to left looking almost due south, BUT while the lights often appeared as pairs, these pairs were constantly moving in relation to one another. At one point, two of the lights appeared to merge, and then separate as if one was moving slightly faster than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to Flight Service Station Phoenix, winds were either northerly or northeasterly, but it was stated that this was for elevations between 3,000 and 34,000 feet and these lights were lower than that, in my estimation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes after alerting our next-door neighbors, the lights disappeared and did not return.<n>

On January 14th around 6pm my 8 year old daughter let our 9 month old male dog (Australian Healer) outside via our sliding glass doors that face the backyard, and woods. I was standing behind my daughter, the sliding door was open about a foot, we were standing just barely inside the open door, waiting for the dog to finish.  My daughter shouted in excitement,&amp;quot;look mom, a shooting star&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I changed my gaze from the dog to her direction and saw a star shaped lighted object; it was traveling East to west and had a flaming trail coming from it; the object hovered for a few seconds just above our cotton wood tree and then continued in a downward pattern, heading east. It was hard to tell how big the! entire object was because it was very dark. It is odd that our dog never barked at it, or tried to chase it; a cattle dog chases everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter did get a longer look then I did and has been drawing pictures of it. In addition; there were some odd occurrences at our home around 2am that same day. Loud noises outside, the security lights going off, rattling and banging noises on my 20 year old daughter&#39;s window well cover, the dog growling and barking at the back sliding doors at nothing and then he would run to the front and bark. We did not see anything strange outside and I have no idea if there is even a need to talk about the incident. In conclusion, my family nor myself have never previously witnessed a UFO sighting and I can honestly say, I have thought off all the possibilities and can  not come up with a answer to what my daughter and I saw on January 14 2013. I did report the incident to the Waukegan Police department for non emergencies.<n>

It was an extremely cold day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking forward in my car with my children, we see a very huge and large object that was very bright, white looking object that was very high up in the air and was about a ½ block away from the school parking lot near the park area intersection.  It looked like a meteor moving across the sky, in a slight curve motion going over the high school.  It dragged a thick, wide, large flames cascading off the round sphere, still bright, with a moving motion tail of flames.  It was clearly visible to all, and very large and very swift.  There had been no explosion as a meteor would or any type of fire to any part of the earth and it was assumed it did not hit the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still idle on baseline road, before you know it, you sense something approaching for about a ½ second or less then appears very large and bright like a flamed sun, white in color, but did not blind you.  I thought there was a possibly we would die if this UFO would come closer to us or land near the intersection causing possibly a nuclear reaction, since I have never experienced anything like this in our lives so extremely close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stared, it seemed we saw enough to know this was bizarre and unbelievable.  As it came toward the center of the intersection, it was huge and you could not see behind this entity or the cars on the other side.  Most people were clueless because this thing is swift.  You have to have seen it when it appears at that time till it departs or else you only see a small flash instead.  Well that UFO went toward the left direction so swift, and toward the street Vineyard up and up swiftly over the houses and it was gone, and did not even hit a car or a home or the street; as I expected some type of landing or explosion or impact of some sort.  This UFO is hard to explain the movements as it seemed like to appear like magic and disappear swiftly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to proceed toward the high school very slowly staring at the sky for another appearance; because I was afraid it would hit the school or start part of the school on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought by now calls would be sent to 911 or NASA by now; possibly earlier sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drive and enter inside the front of the school, near their steps, we all see the sighting toward the lot high above the teacher’s parking lot near the store market Stater Brothers, which is opposite of which I came.  Several students on the steps saw the great ball of light, such a beautiful sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alert the school, they think it has to do with the winds and the power lines falling which was reported by school security guards; they are getting several calls at the main office &amp; other phones.  I still am worried that this UFO will eventually decide to land if it wants to, and when it does, I know something will catch on fire and I was worried it might be the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the conclusion since we saw the sphere come down baseline, it was on the left side of the road and there were the power lines that the school was talking about.  It must have hit the power lines and caused something.  The school had the fire truck and officers eventually block that area.  The description one security guard gave was that there was a Flash on the power lines and was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became very windy, extreme cold weather and a bright sun near the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am driving along Euclid Ave going toward Upland city and I had my window of my car rolled up and I could feel the heat of the sun.  When I began looking at the sun, I noticed it was so extremely bright, that caused my eyes to see dark circles as I randomly stared at it.  There was unusual large stream of rays coming off the sides of the sun in all it’s circumference which was also shinning white, and extremely bright.<n>

There is a wide view of a long distance mountain range &amp; the southern sky from my front yard where I was standing.  Looking at the mountains I saw an extremely bright white light moving slowly toward me.  It was moving from south to north slightly west of my position.  My first thought was that the light was much brighter than any plane or helicopter I’d ever seen.  It seemed to be illuminating the clouds in front of it the length of 2 airplanes.  I watched the light for about 10 minutes thinking it must be a military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came out of the clouds &amp; flew low, lower than any large planes would fly in this valley.  It moved very slowly &amp; smoothly, sort of floating along.  I kept waiting to hear the engine, but it didn’t make a sound.  I knew it wasn’t any military craft.  As it got closer I realized how low it was, it was just above the tree tops of the 100/120 foot pines on the west side of my yard.  Then it went behind the trees.  Again I wondered why I couldn’t hear an engine or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it came out from behind the trees I could see the bottom of it.  It was a black(matt finish) triangle shaped craft with a white light on each of the rounded tips &amp; a dimmer white/orange light in the center of the belly.  I watched the underside pass by me while looking west through a 25–30 foot opening in the trees.  I couldn’t see the entire craft at one time; it was much larger than that 30 foot opening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch even after I couldn’t see it anymore thinking it was going to run into the mountain north of me.  When I didn’t see an explosion I went inside &amp; told my husband about it &amp; drew a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was odd that it was moving so slowly &amp; I thought it was odd that the light was so bright, but the thought of it being a UFO didn’t occur to me until I realized it wasn’t making any noise &amp; it was very low.  Then when I saw the matt black metal underside I was convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t told anyone besides my husband for fear of ridicule.  Since that night I research UFO sightings on the Web every chance I get.  I was surprised no one reported it, but as time passed I thought if there were other witnesses maybe they were just as afraid to speak up as I was.  So I decided to file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m still in shock &amp; try not to let it consume my thoughts, but I’m sure what I saw was not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since it looked like a normal star yet moved at the speed of a jet with a sold light I continued to watch it until moments later it stopped, moved slightly to the left (west) and then slowly moved as if it was positioning itself where it remained throughout the night to become the brightest star in our sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it periodically throughout the night it remained as a normal star.  Note we had very heavy chemtrails today and also there were electromagnetic pulse-looking things going across the United States from the northeast toward the southwest on weather radar at the same time I observed this.<n>

It was blink of an eye fast.   I wasn&#39;t even sure if I had seen something, when my passenger said, &#34;What was that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I mentioned it to a coworker and she had told me that she also witnessed this, and like myself, wasn&#39;t sure if she had actually even seen it because it was so quick.  She told me that immediately after the flash, all of the street lamps and parking lot lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No reports of transformers blowing or explosions in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days earlier (I cannot remember the date exactly, possibly the 01/09/13), in close vicinity to where I witnessed the flash of light, I saw a strange shape hovering in the sky.  It was probably about 12pm.  It was shaped almost like a helicopter on top, like an outline, but nothing at all on the bottom, and I could see completely through it.  I saw no helicopter blades or any actual body at all.  I could see the mountains through it.<n>

I was on the phone with my brother from California and was turning East onto Big Beaver Rd. and then planned to turn right onto Rochester Rd. in Troy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was turning East onto Big Beaver, I looked up at the street and traffic lights on that corner and noticed that there was a orange orb of sorts that looked like it had a flame in the center of it flickering just above the street lights and moving in a horizontal fashion at a slow pace.  I could not comprehend what I was seeing, so I turned into the parking lot and just parked to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it might be a Chinese lantern, but it was close enough to see there was nothing surrounding the flame like orb.  I then noticed a second one appear close behind it going in the same direction.  At that point, I told my brother that I was seeing something unusual and that I needed to get off th! e phone to try to video tape this. Very quickly, the two lights had moved very far away in the distance and a third light appeared.  The three lights got into a triangular pattern and looked stationary for about 30 seconds or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that I had gotten off the phone, parked my car, and pulled out my iPhone to take a photo and then some video.  I regret that I did not have the ability to pull out my camera and start videotaping when these two orbs were closer to me!  I’m very upset that I did not just hang up on my brother and start videotaping right away.  What shows up in my video are the three lights in the distance, very high up in the sky in the triangular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was in the parking lot, there was a lot of light pollution from the parking lights, so I drove past them and parked again and got out of the car to keep videotaping.  At that point, the lights started to disappear one by one.  The entire incident was approximately two minutes in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life.  There were other cars at that intersection during the same time, so I’m sure there is someone else out there who witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about what I saw and going through all the possibilities, I’m convinced that this was not a Chinese lantern. To see it so close, move so slowly, and then quickly ascend and move SO far away so without any wind tells me that this is something else entirely.  The objects made no sound whatsoever.  The third one appeared only after the other two were high up in the sky.  Up close, they were almost organic looking in nature, and did resemble a flame of sorts, but not a flame.  That is the best way I can describe them, as I have nothing else to compare them to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see a metal object or disk.  It was simply this beautiful, natural looking orange/reddish light, gliding along. Ironically enough, once I stepped out of my car and started video taping, I heard police sirens in the distance.  Nothing has been reported locally, although some night prior, our local Fox2 News station did a report on lights in the sky that people in the metro Detroit area have been seeing.<n>

I believe that anyone who had raised his eyes to heaven would have seen around the west of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was perfectly clear without a cloud, was the apparent size as seen Jupiter so bright but was rather a dull red, the light was constant without flash sequence, I noticed two people passing by and confirmed what my daughter and wife also saw, not heard any sound to accompany him, I live near the international airport for over twenty years in the east of the city and opposite to the location of the sighting, where planes spend every hour leaving and come, I know th! eir codes green white and red lights, all very bright, and they do not stop near the zenith of the sky, this was totally different light,  I can´t apreciate the object´s form.<n>

It appeared to be a lighted lantern.  I pulled over to watch it.  It was moving to the North East, about the speed a helicopter would travel.  As it got closer to my location, but still at a distance, I noticed a second object, just the same as the first, but a little brighter, traveling the same route, just a little more south than the first.  The first object slowed then appeared to stop and hover as the second approached, maybe 1-2 blocks away.  The light of both had dimmed a little, but the light of the second remained brighter than the first. They were both moving very slowly at this time. Their movement was almost undetectable if you didn’t have a fixed object to compare it to.  I opened the car door to listen for sounds but heard nothing, so I then turned off the car and stepped out and still heard nothing. It was quite cold (7  degrees)  so! I thought I might be able to hear something.   They proceeded to move north at this time, very slowly.  At this point I decided to leave, quite shook. I opened my sunroof when I was less than a block away and could see one of them directly above me.  I continued on my way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 6 yellow orbs that had the light and color of something burning.  I told my girlfriend and she saw them too.  I went outside to see what they were.  There was no sound what’s so ever.  The orbs continued west for a couple minutes and then two started to go around each other and then one of the them went out.  The rest continued south and then went out.  They went out and did not pass out of view, I have a view to the south for a long way and they were still within my view.  I called local sheriff’s office and they had no other calls.  I called local air force base, but they had no information.  My girlfriend found posting of similar/same sightings from the Sacramento area that occurred at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It would become really bright, then dim, bright, then dim. It was moving very slowly, but there is no human aircraft that can compare to what we saw.  It kind of looked like two tiny things stacked on top of one another when the light was dim, but then looked like one when it was bright.  I wish I could describe it better... the orange color was very pretty and vibrant.  A mix between bright orange and a dull orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first minute, the lights became even dimmer, then disappeared all together.  It had the same slow glide the whole time.  It did stop for a split second, but it literally was barely even a stop..  It was strange.<n>

I live in Bigger, South Lanarkshire in Scotland –   A few miles from the start of the Scottish Borders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first what I thought I was looking at was either a bright star in the sky or an aeroplane. However, having watched it for 5-10 minutes I was intrigued enough to get my binoculars.  On closer inspection it was clear that the light was not coming from an aeroplane.  From a distance the object looked like the brightest star in the sky with a fair amount of illumination in the sky around it.  Through the binoculars the object appeared to be a series of blue, reddish, purple and white lights almost like a kaleidoscope of colour and appearing in a state of flux and flirtatious movement.  The intensity of the light appeared to vary over a period of time and the object moved across the sky as you would think a star or planet would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my location I initially viewed the object whilst I was looking 135 degrees south east from my home in Biggar (According to the compass on my I-Phone).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m intrigued to find out and understand what this was as I never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks in advance.<n>

There was some cloud cover and could not see any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the lights directly in front of my car there were 2 at about 20-25 degrees above the horizon and a third a little farther away at between 15 degrees above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed odd to me as there were no  FAA lights. They alternated red and orange. The lights seemed to be moving southbound in my direction.  Two of them went directly over my car, the other was to my right (east) of my car.  The one to the right was the brightest of the three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not know if there was any noise as I was in my car with the windows up.  There was also some cloud cover, and the lights were below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be willing to speak to an investigator, if needed.<n>

About 16:45 Orlando, FL 32812<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two groups of three each large orange glowing balls travel across the sky from East to West. While they were in two groups, they didn&#39;t appear to flying in a tight type of formation such as military craft would.  As they reached the Western area, they began to &#34;fade&#34; quickly until they were no longer visible.  They didn&#39;t appear to speed off but, rather fade away from bright orange to gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving very fast across the sky. It took only about one minute or so to travel across my field of view from East horizon to West horizon.  However, I still got a good sustained view.  They appeared to be large and low in the sky.  The location is in the flight path of Orlando International Airport and I watch planes every day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything even close to looking like these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard Peter on Coast to Coast AM talking about sightings like this in other areas of Florida.

It was partially cloudy with several clear spots.  South west from my location a large orange light ascending straight up into the sky caught my attention.  After several seconds, it seemed to flicker out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then 2 more came from the same spot as the first.  When the fourth came up, I ran upstairs to wake my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the blinds just as the fifth and sixth came up.  Then three more, one after another appeared, traveling the same path.  They all came from the same place, ascended straight up, then either disappeared into the clouds, or just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects initially looked like a rocket being launched from the ground.  They never went back down, just up.  I could not make out the shape other than maybe round or oval, they were just large, bright, very orange lights traveling at a fast and steady speed. They clearly came from the exact same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed to have come from the area of Antelope Island, maybe even south west of that.  I heard no noise coming from them when I was outside, and I have never seen planes or jets that were bright orange and silent.  I don’t know what they were.  I only hope someone else may have seen them too.  Maybe there were more than the nine I saw?<n>

All other air traffic moved opposite direction, except 1 high speed plane that followed the same path a couple minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like flares, but instead of falling, were going up and moving North pretty rapidly. Way too fast to be flying lanterns.  Covered many miles in a matter of just a few minutes.  Basically the same speed as a small plane.  Looked like planes taking off in formation for an air show, but no sound, and a steady orange glow.  Seen by others on the lake that night.<n>

We had driven for several days from Melbourne, and one of our stops was in a small town just over the border of Western Australia.  Later that evening at the camp site, just after 9pm,I was standing outside, a few meters away from our caravan where the rest of my family were asleep, with my phone using a star map to look at the constellations.  I remember it was a very clear night with no clouds, buildings or airports for kilometers.  On the star map, I was facing north east.  I was holding my phone above my head so I could track what was on the screen to what was in the sky.  I looked away from my phone, and in the sky directly above me, two rows consisting of about 3 blue, white and red coloured lights running parallel blinked in and out and moved across the sky in an easterly (left to right) direction until the lights morphed into only one row and flattened out to be ! horizontal, which spun and blinked in and out of view and then looked as though it did a hook turn and was coming straight for me before a tree blocked view and the object disappeared.It looked as though it got bigger when it was heading in my direction. It had been so real that I screamed and started crying.  I ran straight back to our caravan and woke up my parents.  It had been a solid shape because the outline had been clearly visible and the stars had been blocked.  It couldn’t have been an airplane because it was completely silent and completely disappeared from view. It was also to large to be an airplane,and also had too many lights.  My first thought in that moment of shock was that it had been some kid playing with a toy UFO, then it registered to me what I had just seen.  I’m not sure if there is any other explanation to what I saw, but I believe it had been a UFO.<n>

It did not appear to be moving, but it looked like it was changing colors (from white and blue to white and blue and green to the spectrum of the rainbow) and shapes (round but not a full circle, then straight and long) but it was very far away so it was hard to really see details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look at the sky a lot and 99.9% of the time when I think I see something strange I always end up figuring out what it is (like a plane at a weird angle so the lights are brighter than usual for a moment or something simple like that)  I couldn’t figure out what this was, so I pulled my car into a shopping center, stopped my car, and tried to zoom in on it with my android cell phone.  I also tried to take some pictures but I didn’t think they came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I remembered I still had my camera in my car from a trip I took recently so I tried to zoom in on the object with the zoom on my digital camera.  I still couldn’t figure out what I was seeing so I took a few pictures of it.  I have no idea what I captured, but I wanted to share it and see if someone could figure it out for me.  I will email the pictures I took for your review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Observer information - I am a 51 year old women. I work as a Systems Engineer in a software development company.

Since it was in the winter it was pretty dark outside.  Once we stepped outside of the porch light another light source caught my eye.  I looked up and a spherical shaped white/pale orange pulsating light on the other side of the trees across the street from my house.  it was completely silent and moved in a pattern that a plane or helicopter could not imitate.  it would move back and forth in periods of 3 before finally moving off towards the east going toward the town of Laurinburg at a slow pace before speeding up.  Growing up I have been taught how to recognize civilian and military aircraft during the day and night because we have a small local airport and a military base called Camp McCall nearby.  I can say with confidence that this sighting was something that i have never seen before.<n>

These “fireballs” at first were thought to be helicopters, then planes. They did not make any type of audible noise, no lights that flashed, or any other type of identifying marker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These “fireball” craft orange in color would fly coming from the SE heading NW below the cloud cover, how-ever the first one and the last one of these seven would head North.  These aircraft would fly in their respective directions then disappear out of sight.  As soon as one would disappear another would then reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night, roughly 37F, winds ESE at 15MPH, visibility 8mi. it had previously rain that day so the ground was wet, but was not currently raining at time of event.<n>

Because I was driving and did not stop, I could not ascertain the speed of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other vehicles had stopped on the road to look.  I thought they were helicopters, but when I opened my window, I heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found many references on the internet to similar sightings in this exact area and in neighboring counties, some with photos that look exactly like the lights I saw.

It seemed like such a natural thing to see that I first thought it was a shooting star.  My second thought was that shooting stars cannot be seen in daylight and not so low to the ground and certainly not neon green! I didn&#39;t think about it again till today when I found a note in Wikipedia about green fireballs<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fireballs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still not certain what I saw can be described as a fireball but it was rocketing green neon ball of light that disappeared into nothing - quite low to the ground.<n>

The sky was over cast and no moon or stars. I saw a big red glow in the woods and thought it was a house fire. We went to check it out and saw a aircraft with 3 lights in a perfect triangle shape.  Lights were red blue and white. The craft was as big as a tennis court.  It took a few quick spins around and lifted up over the trees. It was about a football feild away from our car.  It was moving about 10 mph and was wobbling. It was above a cow pasture and when our car got closer it started flying faster and the blue and white lights turned off.  The red light turned toward us and it moved across the road into a hay feild, flying with the flat of the triangle foward.  As soon as it crossed over all the lights came back on. It flew fast but still wobbling across the feild and up over the trees.  We drove the car to catch up with it. When we got to the bottom of the hill, we saw it again, fly over the highwa! y and over the river and back in the trees on the other side and the last we saw it.  There was no sound , no windows and not anything I could ever imagion seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, I drove back to the same location to see if I could find any markings or limbs down, but it was hard to say because I really didn&#39;t feel like getting out and walking in the snow.  I stopped and talked to the farmer of the property and  he said he saw strange lights behind his barn last night around 10am.  He at first thought someone was messing around but soon got scared because it was so strange.  Behind the barn is where the cows are fenced in.  And behind the barn is a field and tree line.  He didnt think any cows were missing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, I called the vestal police department. They took it very seriously. The police said there have been many reports this month from vestal . He said even some police have witnessed strange aircrafts. The officer talked to me for almost 25 min.<n>
1/8/13 19:15|Funston|GA|Unknown|30 seconds|Orange lights suspended in the sky|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95886.html|226|ndxe201301| Orange lights suspended in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my father-in-laws house talking with his neighbor’s wife and her son in the yard shortly after dusk.  As she was talking to me I noticed a bright orange-ish light in the sky to the east.  My initial thought was that it was the planet Mars as it has a similar color to it when observed through a telescope.  As I was thinking to myself, Wow, Mars is really bright tonight”, the object disappeared.  I interrupted the neighbor as she was talking saying “What the hell was that?”  The conversation stopped as the three of us looked in the direction the light had been in.  Seconds later, two similar bright orange lights appeared in the distance simultaniously.  They were fairly far apart and did not appear to be a single object.  As we all collectively started guessing what they could be one of the items did what appeared to be a J-hook and then both of them simultaneously disappeared.  My initial thought was that they may have been flares but other than the horizontal J-hook by one of them, they both appeared to be sitting perfectly still, unlike a flare that would be either rising from it being shot or sailing downward on its parachute.  We kept our eyes on the sky for hours after that but didn’t see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Like a P shape, and an O shape, not typical clouds.  As he was looking at it, 3 red lights emerged, in the shape of a semi-circle.  The back 2 crafts were blinking a bright white light, while the front craft was a solid red.  We were in discussion as to if it was one large craft or 3 small crafts.  We could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft(s) moved from south to north slowly, in which time my brother came to my house next door, and stated that there were UFOs outside.  At this time my daughter and I ran outside to witness and they started moving towards the east (towards the ocean).  We watched them move in the same speed and stay in the exact shaped, not wavering from their semi-circle shape, until it went over the treeline and we couldn&#39;t see them any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother tried to take picture with a camera and they weren&#39;t showing up in the screen.  My daughter took out her iphone an! d they were also not showing up on her screen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, we noticed cloud trails in the sky and NO air crafts for the next hour.  When we noticed the trails leaving, we then noticed the air crafts coming back into the sky.<n>

They moved around apart then but then would come back close together. I ran inside for a scope to get a better view and my neighbor ran in to get a Telescope and as soon as we came out they moved away quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked like it was flying in the culver city area.  Last night around 1:15am I was cleaning my apt and looked out the window and saw the exact same aircraft again.  It would fly from end to end faster than any helicopter or plane.  It would ascend very high and then swoop really low and disappear, the reappear in another side of the sky.  At times it looked like a disc with a row of blue green lights, then when it would fly higher and higher, it would only show a reddish orange light.  The thing about it, was that it kept flying in the same pattern. I had never seen anything fly, disappear and reappear the way that thing did. I ended up driving towards it in culver city, and of course couldn&#39;t see anything.  I know that other people who were driving or were out in the city saw it too.<n>

It moved very slowly away heading south easterly.  It slowly increased in altitude as it moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for several seconds in disbelief and had a very eery sensation come over me.  There were several lights on the craft, way more then an aircraft would have and they were so bright that it seemed to mask the actual shape of the object, though I concluded it was a triangular shape based on the points of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were blue, red, and yellow.<n>

I&#39;ve lived on that street and therefore know there&#39;s no tower there, and I&#39;ve never seen any light there before.  It remained in the same place while I sat at the light.  It also did NOT twinkle or blink; the light was constant.  Possibly a helicopter, but it was a very windy and somewhat snowy night.

1/7/13 04:30|Sedona|AZ|Unknown|10 minutes|Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95858.html|244|ndxe201301| Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 4:30 a.m. today, I was inside my house and heard an extremely load engine sound flying over my house.  It sounded a little bit like a plane, but much much louder. It sounded more like a garbage disposal in slow motion flying overhead.  Very eerie.  It was something flying over my house and although not 100 feet above, still very low flying. It came from the direction of the airport and was passing overhead.  This engine noise I heard was in the sky.  It flew over my house and overhead in my general vicinity for a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up living near an airport for many years and know the different sorts of sounds airplanes and helicopters make, including when there is engine trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what the sound a military helicopter and jet sounds like, and today the sound I heard was not anything I have heard before and it stayed in the area around my house flying in a strange pattern.  This sound stayed overhead in my neighborhood after it continued away from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is freezing outside and I was cold in my house...no heat on in the rest of the house, except in my bedroom. I did not know where my coat was and had to stay inside.  If I hear this again, will be ready to go outside and look!!! If it is daylight, I will get a picture too!  It went back and forth over my house area in the sky for about 10 or 15 minutes.  I could hear it very very loud flying over my house and nearby.  The noise was not so loud after 10 or 15 minutes or so, but I could STILL hear it flying loudly in the nearby neighborhood over the city.  I have heard the noise that sounds like an explosion here in Sedona about 5 or 6 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of one other person who reported seeing and hearing what I am reporting today and the report is dated 12/20/12 on NUFORC.  This person reported seeing the craft, I only heard it.  BUT, I have heard a similar, non-airplane, sound about 2 months ago over my house and it went slow like a helicopter travels...this loud sound was very different-like a garbage disposal in slow motion and very very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock listening and was so cold..so, I did not go outside.  I know that there are people awake here at this hour and I hope someone reports this also.  One of my cats came over to me and sat up with a quizzical look on her face and she appeared to listen with me for as long as I heard this sound!  Sorry, no other witnesses, only my cat!!!  The last time I heard something similar to this sound flying overhead was in California where I grew up and it was about 12:30 at night.  When I went outside, I did hear the initial first loud sound I heard flying over my house for a few seconds, but after a few seconds it stopped.  I stood waiting and watching the sky over my house for about 10 minutes.  I then saw a light flying over the area near my house and it was moving very fast..about 5 minutes later, I saw two air force helicopters and they came flying toward my area very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two military helicopters moved into a position where they were facing each other and turned lights on so light it was almost blinding (it was at midnight) and stayed in mid-air for about maybe 15 minutes in this position as if they had something between them they could see, but I could not.  The light I saw before they came flew toward the area the two helicopters were hovering over and before the helicopters arrived, the light disappeared.  The military helicopters are very very loud, however, the sound I heard today and the sound I heard then over my house was much much different.  I awakened a friend who lived 2 houses away and she witnessed seeing the helicopters come and get into the position I just described.  The military helicopters stayed in this same position for about 20 minutes or so.  The sounds of their engines were deafening.  I cannot believe anyone else in my neighborhood could sleep through this noise!!! My friend and I were the only ones who witnessed or! heard what I am reporting in California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other UFO craft when I was younger. I know what I heard flying over my house today is not an airplane or helicopter or anything that is explainable because of the weird loud sound it made.   The loud sound I heard this morning was very very loud and the closest description of the sound I can think of would be a grinding garbage disposal (in the sink-an insinkerator) in slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope somebody else heard and saw what I heard and reports it here.<n>

Initially it held its position for about two mins.  Then slowly, it began to rise up about another ten to 20 feet and traveled west toward the Chesapeake City Park and then northwest toward Battlefield Blvd and Interstate 64.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was heard from the craft when it PASSED OVER my vehicle or when it passed over the other witness&#39;s residence.  Though, I did notice that the radio in my vehicle was disabled while I was driving and only when I arrived home did the radio turn on without me touching the tuner or volume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was dark and triangular; it appeared at first glance to be a bright yellow light.  On closer review, it also had smaller red and blue lights.  None of the lights were blinking or changed within the first four mins, then the bright yellow light began to pulse slowly while the craft was moving throughout the remainder of the sighting.  The craft moved slowly at a 25-30 mph pace. In total the sighting lasted for about 15 mins.<n>

1/6/13 22:00|Hyannis|MA|Oval|45 minutes|UFO seen in downtown Hyannis on two occasions within the hour of January 6, 2013.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95920.html|249|ndxe201301| UFO seen in downtown Hyannis on two occasions within the hour of January 6, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cold Sunday evening in Hyannis Massachusetts on Cape Cod.  I was driving to my friend’s house from the store at 10pm on January 6th, 2013.  I was on my way to go have a relaxing night watching movies with my friend until I noticed something unusual in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an orange glow in the sky that was definitely not a street light because of its height in the sky.  I was facing southwest when I noticed the stagnant glow the size of a small pill in the sky.  I was watching it for a minute debating what it could be; a fire, an airplane, a helicopter, or maybe even a star I’ve never noticed before.  I decided to take a picture and a video on my cell phone because of how unusual it was.  As soon as I began taking the video the glow began to move south and started to blink.  The blinking consisted of organge, red, and white colors.  Since this was on Cape Cod it should be known that I was basically at sea level, if not only a couple feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, what I had figured was an airplane now had started blinking.  I tried to reassure myself that the reason for the glow being completely still was that it could have been flying towards me.  Eventually it moved towards me and was soon almost completely overhead when I noticed how low to the ground it was.  I have never seen any aircraft, especially at night, flying this low. It was probably about 10-15 stories high, I would guess.  I then noticed that it was oval in shape with lights on the top and bottom and a band of white light wrapping around the craft.  Perhaps this was another light or possibly a window, that I am not sure.  At this point it was roughly the size of a penny or dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend I was visiting to tell her what I saw when the craft took off in almost one second into the northeast into the next town.  I told her I was going to follow it so I did with no luck.  I turned around to go back to Hyannis when I noticed that same orange glow sitting in the sky in the same area I had seen earlier.  I called my friend back to let her know it was back so she could go outside to see it.  The only problem was that she could not hear me at all over the phone.  I could hear her perfectly but she barely had any idea what I was saying.  When I got to her house she said not only was the call cutting out but there was an odd electrical whining type noise in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend got into my car and we drove to the same parking lot across the street to look at this strange sight.  When I started taking a video again the craft repeated the same path it did earlier eventually taking off into the northeast.  I once again tried following it but this time it was completely gone.  The video I took with my friend was the best video by far as it show the erratic movements of the craft in the sky.  Unfortunately the cell phone did not pick up the actual ship but it did pick up the blinking so the path of the craft is clear.  It should be noted that there was no sound at all when the craft was in sight.  My friend and I decided to go back to her house and give up on this UFO hunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went to work excited to show some of my coworkers the footage I taped.  When I asked my manager if he believe in UFOs, he showed me something odd that in turn made me write this repot. Apparently on the Cape Cod Times Online blogs someone written an article about how in 1971, to almost the exact date, two boys saw an orange glowing UFO in Hyannis and Dennis.  I found it too coincidental that almost 40 years to the date this happened again.  I would like to point out that I do live near Otis Air Force Base so it should be noted that it may be either out of this world or possibly a military craft.  I would also like to add that the media I have of this incident will be sent separate since I have yet to upload them online.<n>

We saw a light that looked orange and was circular shape make an arch as it flew slowly across the sky.  As it descended it looked like it was falling then abruptly it disappeared. It was strange and was definitely not a shooting star or a meteor because there was no tail.  After we got our ice cream we noticed five helicopters in the Denton area from various points across the sky.<n>

We saw east in the sky what we thought were two airplanes flying one behind another.  They were flying from the northeast to the southwest in a line.  We were still looking in the sky and saw two more flying very close one behind the other.  I continued looking in the sky and there were two more flying very close, again, one behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no noise, they left no emissions or smoke trails.  They flew in a line about the same height, all going the same speed.  The last one I saw by myself because my grandmother and my cousin went in the house.  I saw another flying object this one seeming a little further away than the rest and it looked like it was falling at an angle from the sky I don’t know where it went because I couldn’t see it when it went below the tree line.  All the objects seemed to have the same shape.  They all had lights that were orangish red.  I can’t see that well, but my grandmother said they looked to be in the shape of a triangle with a line below the triangle with lights all over them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altogether there were 7 flying objects, moving in a trail one behind the other, with the last one being further behind the rest and a little further out descending rapidly from the sky.<n>
1/6/13 20:30|Kennett Square|PA|Unknown|30 minutes|Flashing light hovers in sky.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96228.html|254|ndxe201301| Flashing light hovers in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night of January 6th, 2013 around the time of 8:30pm.  I was riding in the car with two other individuals on the road 926, in Kennett Square, Pa.  We began to make a right turn onto School House Road.  I was sitting in the back seat of the car behind the drivers seat. I just happened to look out the window when a flashing light hovering about 100 yards above a tree line which caught my eye.  It was approximately 150 yards away from the road or right where a field meets a tree line.  I asked the two other passengers in the front seat what it was because I know there are no towers, or anything in that area that flash light the way this object was.  Initially it was brushed off and regarded as a helicopter or something of that nature.  However, as we continued to travel up the road I kept watching the object and totally rejected the notion of this being a helicopter or anything of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft emitted flashing lights, but in a pattern from left to right and each was its own individual square.  Other than the light being completely unnatural for the area, size, the way they blinked left to right and the overall length of the lights flashing across the craft; it also sat perfectly still.  I drew attention to the craft again, sighting the fact that it was not moving and there was no way this was a helicopter.  Both the driver and passenger looked out the window to the left again until our driver agreed this was no helicopter and there was no explanation for what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to the next intersection of School House Road and Longwood Road, where we made a left turn, traveling maybe 75 to 100 yards up the road before we stopped, pulled over and were parallel with the object.  The object again was on our left, sitting perfectly still, continuing to flash lights from what seemed to be left to right.  We watched for a total of thirty minutes.  During this period of sitting on the side of the road the craft moved, and I cant describe this in any other way than “like an alien spaceship would” quickly shifting from left to right but very smoothly.  As it was moving, it going away from us.  It eventually stopped a fair distance away but still close enough to see very easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when the weird got weirder, before it began to move it appeared to be sitting horizontally, as it moved away it seemed to turn almost vertical and the flashing light went around the craft a faster.  As I said before it settled again and went horizontal like it was before and hovered perfectly still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watched I noticed a plane flying in from the right side of the sky, and this plane was “hauling ass”.  The plane went directly underneath the craft but at some distance below it, than banking a hard left out and away.  The plane lingered out the far left of the craft.  The craft eventually moved away far enough and we had watched it long enough to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this is not the end.  After we decided to drive away, we turned around and went back on School House Road, making a left going towards Route 1.  We stopped at a Wawa, when we parked, we parked one spot away from a man in a green Chevrolet pickup truck.  The man was wearing a dark olive fleece with a United States flag stitched to the side of his arm.  He was 100% military the only weird thing about that is, he was sitting there listening to a some sort of radio, CB?  I have no clue.  Now all this may just be a coincidence; however, if you were to know where we live like I do, you would know you never see a “G man” sitting outside of a Wawa on a Sunday night listening to a radio the night people happen to be witnessing a UFO sighting.  He seemed to be intently listening to a radio... Coincidence or there for a reason you decide but it looked very suspicious given the very recent prior event.  Did I mention the fact that what we saw as far as lights go looked identic! al to a craft caught on tape Christmas day in the same county... Ya.  The only thing is none of us could provide a 100% description of what shaped the craft was due to it being dark but our consensus was circular because of the way the flashing light looked as it moved left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I finished I looked up and saw an orange ball, it looks like a flame to a candle but round, and it glowed very brightly.  I stood still in the quiet of the night to see if I could hear any kind of engines in the air but the night was silent.  It came from the south traveling north and then it turned east and vanished.   As I stood there wondering, another came from the south, this time I got my neighbors to look out with me and the 2nd one took the same path as the 1st one, then vanished.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

The distance to the objects was hard to judge but I would guess they were about one to one and one-half miles away.  At first, I only saw one object (which is what caught my eye) and I thought it was our local air ambulance.  That gives an idea of the elevation and speed of the object, not particularly fast or high above the ground.  I then saw the other four objects.  All five were moving together but not in formation.  Their position changed relative to each other, but they were grouped fairly close to each other (visually, never more than probably five degrees apart).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife to the room to show her what I was seeing.  We went out to our deck.  By this time the object had quit moving.  There was no sound that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them for several minutes.  Since we were observing them through the limbs of a pine tree, we went back in th! e house and I went out through the front garage door and into the drive to get an unobstructed view.  It took me only about 45 seconds to get to the driveway and by the time I got there the objects had completely disappeared.  No sign in any direction.  So the objects had obviously disappeared very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a biology and earth science teacher and have spent a considerable amount of time observing the nighttime sky and I have never observed anything remotely like this.<n>

We were just about to pass the exit for Claremore when out of no where, a bright light appeared in the sky.  It was almost dusk at that moment and the sky was a dim bluish- grey with pink outlining the hillside.  The light seemed to have the sun reflecting off of it and it appeared to be a thick vertical line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it might be a jet leaving a trail of smoke behind it, but as we watched it closer it didn’t appear to be moving at all.  The line of light would become longer, then it would shrink back and become a sphere of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it did not appear to be moving, but rather hovering in one place in the sky. To the left of it we could see a regular airplane flying towards it.  It had a long line of smoke behind it and it was not as bright as the unidentified object. The bright light than began ascending straight up into the sky very slowly! as the plane grew closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I held our breath because from our view, it looked as though they were going to collide.  Right before the airplane reached this object, it sped up in the sky.  It was going straight vertical.  When it moved up, there were two short smoke trails behind it.  You could actually see the smoke moving and billowing behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer we got, we saw that there were flashing lights at the top of this object.  It continued vertical and continued to have a light aura all around it.  The light seemed to be vaguely changing colors.  We got to a point where we were completely underneath it, and my husband had to look straight up through the windshield to see it as it was over our car roof.  He explained it to look like a ball of red with smoke trails and flashing lights.  After this one last look, it was too high in the atmosphere to see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued driving and about two minutes later, we saw a black military plane flying lower in the sky.   At this time, we also encountered four small uncontrolled fires.  One w as in a neighborhood and a few were in the trees.  The smoke was very thick on the road.  I’m not sure if this is related but I thought I would share it anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s very common to see people burning in Oklahoma but they usually do that closer to spring.  It helps their crops come back the next season.  We assumed it’s a rocket shuttle but there has been nothing on the news about this.<n>

If it would have crashed, it  would have been in a residential area.  It was no a helicopter, because the object was long, probably, the size of two 747 airplanes, but made no noise.

It was very fast but slow enough to be able to see it.  It had 3 red lights on each corner.  We saw it twice. It flew a little slower than a shooting star.  It was about 1000 feet up in the sky.  We were amazed to see them so we observed for about 3 more minutes until we saw a rock type object glide through the sky about the same speed as an airplane but it was really close. (400-500 feet) we were looking at it for abou a minute until my girlfriend got scared and wanted to go inside.  It was definitely not any type of aircraft we&#39;ve eve seen before.<n>

As I drove between the two overpasses, I looked upward to see a large fireball above my vehicle that seemed to be slowly drifting to the northeast.  It made no noise.  I slowed my rate of speed to watch but with traffic behind me, I was unable to stop and watch.  I continued driving for a little less than a mile until I was able to pull onto Fort Hill Road in Easthampton.  I looked to the northeast and witnessed two glowing orbs in the sky.  As I took video on my cell phone, one of the orbs flickered and disappeared.  One orb remained.  Shortly after, another orb appeared below the remaining orb and appeared to ascend.<n>

I didn&#39;t think to report those because I felt that they might be natural in nature (example:  ball lightning). This however was different and definitely not natural.  This time they were craft. Two of them, shaped like crescents, boomerangs, a &#34;V&#34;, or however you want to call it. Half transparent, no lights, no sound, and traveling around 2500 kph by my estimate. Though they had no lights, they were visible from ambient light from Tokyo. They seemed somewhat transparent. The same way that a small lone cloud is visible but also transparent looking in an otherwise crystal clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight around 6:10 pm, we were coming home from dinner.  The sky was super clear and many stars were visible (rare for Tokyo).  As my wife unlocked the door to our apartment, I was enjoying the wonderful view of Jupiter.  That&#39;s when suddenly the two craft entered my field of view.  One was traveling to the East/Northeast, and the other was traveling to the East/Southeast.  Their trajectories and positions in the sky were perfect intersecting mirror images of each other.  When there positions had reached a distance from each other of about the width of six to eight of their craft, they went into formation flying east for a moment then banking hard to the right quickly flying out of sight to the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these are ours, we have mastered at least three or more ground breaking technologies that aren&#39;t even officially on the drawing board yet or even considered possible.  I mean, forget about soundless supersonic flight and cloaking. What I want to know is, how do they pull a 500 G turn without killing the occupants.<n>

Holding my arm out, they were the size of my smallest fingernail.  They were stationary about 3 minutes, the glow was mesmerizing.  The three on the left, one by one, drifted up twice their original altitude to the southwest in one minute, and vanished.  The fourth one drifted south in one minute and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression is they were about 5 miles away.   I saw approximately 10 low airplanes in the immediate area, half appearing lower and half appearing higher in the sky than the orange lights.  Actually, the orange lights were not far from the John Wayne Airport, and air traffic was everywhere.  I saw no helicopters at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an educated 59 year old female, familiar with the UFO phenomenon.<n>

He stopped the car to observe direction of location of impact.  He described the event as ‘a teardrop shape object from which smoke and what appeared to be flames or heat of some type from the bottom of the object streaming to the top of the object’.  The object stopped its descent at which time he observed an oval shape having a black ring at its bottom’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness sightings:  55 year old male and 59 year old female. The 17 year old male rushed to our home to tell us he saw a UFO.  Disbelieving his claim we accompanied him to the front yard of our home and looked in the sky at the direction he instructed.  We saw a small silver/white oval in the distance hovering above the far corner of a neighboring house across the street from our house.  The sky behind, around the object was clear blue, not a cloud in the sky that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 55 year old male rushed to get our camera a Nikon 15megpixel, gave the camera to the 17 year old male who then snapped a series of 16 pictures of the object. We are able to make out the object in the pictures however need to locate the means of enhancing the picture to clearly define the object.  This said, based on our ability to view the object it is indeed is a domed oval shape having a darken space at its underside (what we assume to be its underside).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 15 minute or so observation we witnessed the object bank (assumed as turning) then disappear from the sky.  Shortly thereafter the 17 year old male witnessed military jets (4) fly over the exact location where the object had been located.  The 59 year old female witnessed 2 of the 4 jets fly over the aforementioned location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnessing of the jet fly over:  59 year old female: Obviously military because of the tight formation (commercial or private aircraft would never fly as closely together as these jets did).  The jets were black, wings angled back towards the fuselage of the plane.  The jets were silent just as the unidentified flying object was silent.  The jets flew from the east/ southeast to the west/ northwest.<n>

I quickly turned my head to look, the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was that we saw, was gone in a split second.  There were no obstructions, we looked at every direction.  It simply vanished.  I ruled out the fact that it was no typical airplane, helicopter, or any man-made flying ship because of the speed in which it disappeared, there was no evidence it was even there, not even a red light off in the distance.<n>
1/3/13 21:12|Davenport|WA|Triangle|seconds|Three dim red lights in a triangle formation moving fast.|7/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111386.html|297|ndxe201301| Three dim red lights in a triangle formation moving fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was January 3, 2013.  The time was about 12 minutes after 9 o’clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in the hot tub.  The sky was very clear and cold with lots of stars in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three dim red lights passed over us in an almost due north direction.  They did NOT flash like an aircraft’s lights do.  At first we thought we were seeing a shooting star, but there were three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely NO sound associated with these lights.  They were much dimmer than civil aviation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights stayed in the same “formation” the entire time we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved very fast; much quicker than an airplane; unless said plane was very close to the ground.  If it had been a commercial jet sized plane, it must have been much closer to the ground than the normal flights that pass over this area because the lights were at least twice as wide as a commercial jetliner’s lights appear.  Perhaps it might have been a military aircraft that we were not supposed to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it made NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the other things that struck me as odd was that the lights, while in a triangular formation, did not look right for a plane to me.  Normally a plane has lights at the end of its wingtips, and another at the tail, and maybe one under its belly or nose.  Such lights clearly delineate the outer edges of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights passed over in a skewed triangle.  They did not appear to line up with the direction of travel.  If it was a plane, it appeared to be flying sort of sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for a sonic boom, because they appeared to be going very fast, even for a low level plane; but they made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen a lot of things in the skies before, but nothing ever looked like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to our Center, and we consider him to be highly reliable.

1/3/13 20:15|Fairfax|CA|Sphere|10-20 minutes|Saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light and was completely soundless.  ((Sirius?))|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95944.html|299|ndxe201301| I saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light and was completely soundless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3 January 2013, my son and I were watching TV in our living room.  Our breakfast nook is just off the living room and I happened to glance out of the large windows to our left.  I saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light.  My son asked me if I saw what was outside the window and asked we what it was.  I replied that I didn’t know and we both went outside to get a better look.  The object was almost due east of our home and we didn’t hear any sound. It was above a ridge to the east and was completely motionless.  After a few minutes I went back inside to get my binoculars and then observed the object for a minute or two. I gave the binoculars to my son to see if he could make out any details. He could not, so I got my iPad and took some still photos.  There was still no sound and the object did not move. I switched the iPad to movie mode and shot a one-minute video of the object.  Since it was rather cold we both! went back inside.  About a minute later I noticed that the object was still in the same position and still pulsating with light so I went back outside and shot another one-minute video of the object.  This all occurred at about 8:15 pm PST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I examined the videos and found that what we both thought was a single light had other, clearly visible lights around it.  There seems to be a triangular shape to the lights.  I have no idea what it was that we saw but I’ve never seen anything like it before.  I enjoy seeing the night sky and know many of the constellations.  Orion was well above the object as was Jupiter.  The night was crystal clear.  I don’t know what I observed I know what I saw.  I am a high school chemistry teacher and my son is in training to be a firefighter.<n>

There was only one and it had a spherical shape.  It lowered to tree level and the lights shut off.  I have an opinion that it may have went into the golf course or a large park nearby to land.

It was a short time after about 5pm so was getting dark, but it was a cold clear dusk with hardly a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where we were stood you can look north to the Malvern hills (1,400 ft) in Worcestershire, which are around 30 miles away from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I noticed as we were looking out towards the row of hills was a white spherical light appear in the sky, above and to the right of the hills. I watched it &#34;switch on&#34;, or appear suddenly, and my first reaction was to think a plane has just switched it&#39;s lights on as it was getting dark. (I have since spoken to other people and for several reasons I don&#39;t think this makes sense with being a plane.)  At first, as I thought it was a plane, I didn&#39;t pay it much attention and continued talking to my friend for around 30 seconds until we both suddenly noticed it had moved up above the Malvern hills into the sky and started randomly looping and smoothly accelerating and decelerating in quite large circular patterns. After about 20 seconds of this it went up higher directly over the hills, and as it did so over about 5 seconds it faded from it&#39;s previous white light colour to a more gold colour and then into a definate orange, and was still making smooth looping patterns at various speeds above the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to travel down in front of the hills, and was a fierce orange colour, very close to that of the average British street lamp. Because of the time of day and the season, the hills and most of the land was black with darkness, with a pale blue/whiteish sky behind and the orange light traveled down in front of the hills then in a diagonal direction (south-east-east as we were looking north-west) and traveled in a relatively straight line at a moderate steady speed until it merged in with the lights of Gloucester city centre and we could no longer see it.  Gloucester is around 10 miles from where we were stood, and the Malvern hills where the light was sighted is 30 miles.  The whole sighting was probably around a minute and a half.  The first minute being the light above the range of hills and it then took about 30 seconds to travel from Great Malvern over to Gloucester meaning a speed of about a mile a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I relayed back to one another the events several times and both agree on what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I live near the CVG airport, and l know what all the planes look like as I used to work for the airline as a flight attendant.  The object I saw was definitely not an airplane.  It was cylindrical, and eminating light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and watched as it seemed to get closer.  When it did i could then see weird bright lights eminating from it, and at the bottom of the object I saw three bright red pulsating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point right over my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to ascend to the sky, and after a moment it was gone, through thick clouds we&#39;ve got this morning.<n>

I could not hear any helicopter sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in a very highly populated area of Seattle, other drivers on the freeway were noticing it too.  The light looked as if it was projected from a directional source laterally but had light emitting on all sides.  It did not seem to be aiming its light at anything in particular.  Nothing on the ground or trees appeared to be noticeably lit from the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it while driving for about 10-15 minutes then exited the freeway and lost sight of it.<n>

It made no noise and looked as if it was reflecting light, not emitting light.  It was a clear night and if there had been any details on the object (landing gear, engine housings) they would have been easily visible, but there were none.<n>

You suggested I complete an Event Description form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:27 on January 1st, 2013, I witnessed two objects approximately 60 yards south of me heading in a northern direction at approximately 40 feet in the air and traveling at 20-25 mph over a heavily populated residential area.  At first they both seemed to be triangle in shape, but as they flew over me they seemed to morph into globs of bright yellow, orange, reddish and very bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched them fly over me there was absolutely no sound or prop wash.  At about 100 yards past me the first one accelerated at an incredible speed as did the second one a few seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an Ex-Air Force personnel I am familiar with Military Aircraft (SR71’s, Stealth Fighters and numerous other aircraft) and maneuverability of such aircraft.  From my experience at many Air Force Bases around the world, no aircraft that I know of had the acceleration capabilities of these two objects, let alone the ability to morph.<n>

I really thought it was something on fire and coming down until it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept staring at it and then it went in reverse and raised up.  It stopped again before going higher and I lost sight of it behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in downtown Honolulu, the Ala Moana hotel is directly across the road from my apartment, the object was hovering at the level 3/4 from the top of the hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know a floor level or anything.

We were about three blocks west of Disneyland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound as it moved south.  The fireworks was very noisy.  As the show ended and as everyone reentered the house, I remained outside to observe the orange light.  It was about a football field west of me.  Silent and totally motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three minutes the light went out and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light, not ordinary aircraft lights and the absence of any sound I found interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter but what else can hover that long without any sound?<n>

I live in Eastern Orange County, Fl, approx 12 miles east of the Orlando Intl Airport (OIA) in a rural type area.  The objects appeared in a somewhat vertical line but were staggered behind each other at different altitudes and fairly low on the horizon.  It appeared as if the objects were floating or traveling slowly to the north.  These objects appeared to be lower than the air traffic in the area that was departing from OIA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air traffic appeared to be initially departing to the south and then turning crosswind to the east and then turning toward a north departure from the Orlando area.  It was very apparent that the orange glowing objects were not aircraft.  I watched the objects for approx 1 min and the ran into the house to get my wife and son.  Upon returning to the front yard, we saw 3 remaining orange glowing objects in the sky.  Apparently the other! 2 or 3 objects had disappeared.  Two of the three remaining glowing objects faded quickly while heading in a easterly direction.  The last object continued to glow but slowly faded as it traveled in an easterly direction and it appeared to gain altitude until it was out of sight.<n>

Out the front windshield of the truck I saw a round craft with 6 lights- from left to right: 4 red, 1 white, 1 red light.  The craft was hovering just above the cottonwood trees approximately 60-70 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled out to my boyfriend if he was seeing what I was and to drive forward to get a better look!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was gone in a blink and he missed it.<n>

The size and brightness of all were consistent; the origin on the horizon was also consistent but the later 3 or 4 moved more toward due south than the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first noticed them to when they stopped coming was about 10 minutes and at least 18 were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came in random numbers, sometimes 2 or 3 in close procession and sometimes 1 at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the lights; they traveled faster than the common aircraft I see in my neighborhood (at cruising altitude) but it was not possible to estimate their altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate about 45 to 50 seconds from when they appeared on the northern horizon to when they disappeared into cloud cover or otherwise vanished at about 40 degrees above the southern horizon.<n>

We were all in her backyard when I noticed a firework going up into the air.  Fireworks had been going off since New Years Eve, so I didn&#39;t think nothing of it until my friends husband called it to her attention. I then really notice how slow the fireball was moving and how it never exploded into a firework.  The fireball never made any noise.  About 8 of us watched the small red/orange fireball continue to slowly float up into the sky until it got to the clouds, it then shifted course and began going North until it disappeared into the clouds or just disappeared.  It definitely appeared to be a fireball,  I thought it was a firework at first, it moved very slowly almost carefully.  The other witnesses were my friends family and my boyfriend. None of us have have any background in science or government, just normal American working class.<n>

There were multiple smaller, colorful lights flashing that made it clear that the object was a disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A beam went down into the water for seconds at a time.  It appeared to hover over the ocean for 15 minutes without even moving at all, it was perfectly still.  Then, all of a sudden it flew away fairly quickly.<n>

On this occasion there appeared to be two red lights with them which I assumed was a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced these were not lanterns as the objects were too large.<n>

Although this was on New Year’s Eve night, I had nothing to drink or substance of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my significant other’s house for the evening and decided to go home about 1:25 AM. I traveled about 3 mis north, then turned west on to 74 St South. Immediately, as soon as I was facing due west I saw a very bright orange light directly in front of me. It was moving very slowly in an erratic pattern appearing to move north, then drift in an easy turn to the east (toward me), then to the south, then straight up, almost straight above. I would say it was about a 1200 feet up and almost a mile or so away when I first saw it. I was so amazed and so entranced with the phenomenon, I called my friend to tell her to go outside, she did not answer. I called her several more times hoping she was would see it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not continue to drive and watch, so I pulled over to stare with curiosity and a bit of trepidation. When I first saw it, I thought it was a helicopter, but within seconds realized it was too big, too bright and moving to erratic for a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I parked I knew immediately it was not a helicopter or plane.  At that same second the intensity of the color got brighter and more yellow-orange.  It was sitting in the sky at about 8:00 to Jupiter, just kind of hanging around, like it was a fiery balloon floating in the wind.  It was not so large that it could have been easily covered in the sky by my thumb.  As it started to climb straight up, the fire of it flickered more intensely, but the flame itself started to die out and soon it was extinguished. However, the “object” was still visible:  it was not round, but I could see it was spherical.  It did not emit much light, but yet, I could see that it was there, lighter gray than the sky and still doing the same lazy floating pattern of drifting.  I decided I needed to get out of the street where I was stopped and go home to watch it from my back yard, which was only about 5 mins away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost the object then.  It was gone by the time I got home. There were more clouds, then, as if they just appeared out of nowhere; where it had been was not clear any longer.  Jupiter was there as was some duller stars, but no object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very consistent with a fiery ball, although it did not sent out sparks or trail any flames or vapors, it was like watching a flame wax and wane, change color and intensity, get brighter, then snuff out.  By the time I got home, I was so alert and hyper-vigilant that I am not sure I will be able to sleep for several hours yet.<n>

We were on our way back to her apartment.  My husband, brother, and two young children were in another vehicle and were just ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up in the clear dark sky was a formation of five red fire ball looking lights.  It did not have an actual shape.  They were too close to be helicopters and too large to be an airplane.  It also was not far from the ground, about fifteen stories high.  At first my mother thought they could have been a firework that had just exploded and the lit up particles were falling to the ground.  But they continued to stay in the sky.  We pulled over to watch the lights for about a minute or so.  They were not really moving too fast.  We got back on the road and arrived at her apartment about a minute later.  I looked up in the sky and there was only one light.  I came back out after eating and there were no lights to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked the local newspapers and searched the internet to see if anyone else might have seen and/or reported these lights.  So far nothing can be found.  We were not the only people driving around last night who could have possibly seen this occurrence.  My husband and brother also saw the lights in the sky and wondered what in the world they were.  I’m a skeptic on these kinds of things.  But I just can’t get over what I witnessed last night.  Hopefully with this post maybe someone else can help identify what it was or possibly witnessed it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn&#39;t really even believe what I had seen until I heard of the other call.  I heard some loud whooshing but I don&#39;t believe it was from the objects because they were too far away.

At first it appeared to be three lights, two orange with a white one in the middle.  As the lights moved very slowly across the sky, they coalesced into one orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My one son and I saw this one.  I moved to the window and watched it.  I told him it was a helicopter, but I knew that it wasn’t.  When it got across the street, the light went out.  Whatever it was, it did not fly-off or anything, it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t really think that much about it until we saw the second one follow the same trajectory.  This time we opened the windows and listened for the sound.  I called my other two kids into the room to see it as well.  There was no sound.  None at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were standing there, three of them came up on the horizon in approximately the same location.  They flew in a triangular formation along the same path.  Halfway across the sky, the light in the rear, flew off at a rapid pace 90 degrees from the original path.  This one flew away from the house, as opposed to the other two that were flying along the back side of the house.  I got my binoculars out, and thankfully, the city lights illuminated the sky as a backdrop.  I was able to see the formation of something ahead of the orange light.  It appeared to be some type of triangular shape, but I couldn’t see it any clearer than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it across the street, and again the light went off, but I could still see the shape of the thing moving across the sky.  My binoculars are not very powerful, but I watched it as long as I could.  It continued in the same direction until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A sixth one did the same thing a few minutes later.  I have no idea what they were, but they were not helicopters nor were they airplanes.  They looked like nothing that I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes later, there was a series of about three helicopters circling the area.  I do not know if they were related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I thought that the orange light was the afterburner of a jet.  The object was moving too slowly to have been a jet with an afterburner, and when I got a closer look with my binoculars, I could tell that the orange was some kind of light.  It was not produced by burning of fuel.<n>

It was too dark, and there&#39;s nothing but audio to support my claim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve seen planes, helis, and even fireworks, over the past couple years, but this impressed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fireball moving across the sky laterally, but with obvious trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anybaody else saw this, let me know.<n>

It was a brilliant, bright red light that moved from West to East across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling much faster than an airplane and it momentarily changed direction mid-flight upwards and then resumed course West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached closer to us it was quite large and very, very bright red, almost glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer to us the object stopped mid-flight and shot off away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s like it disappeared into nowhere.  We were quite shaken up as it was very unusual.<n>

Saw a pair of stationary, small, red-orange lights in front of us, to the sky north, slightly northwest, one to the up and left of the other one.  I was watching with my friend, who was driving me home, and we entered a small bend in the road.  Our view was blocked for a few seconds by a tree, due to the curve, and when we had a clear view, the left light was gone, leaving only the one that was on the bottom-right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went North for two minutes before turning East, and nothing else changed during this time.  I kept watch while my friend watched the road, and I saw the object flare up, like fire does if it comes into contact with a new chemical substance.  It sort of shrunk into a four pointed star shape then brightened and became much larger, white in color, before going back to orange and dropping an orange object that looked to fall to Earth.  The new object was the same size and color as the other one.  The new object disappeared a little bit above the ground, from our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the first object started fading, like a satellite that is going out of the sun&#39;s light, gradually becoming dimmer.  It disappeared for a minute, then appeared again, in the same spot.  It then kept fading in and out, almost like it was pulsing very slowly.  It disappeared just before we reached our destination.<n>

I decided to drive to the far north end of town and observed what I thought were three (3) planes flying unusually close and moving faster than normal in an east bound direction.  The objects were flying single file behind one another with approximately 500 to 1000 yards behind one another.  I would describe the objects as pulsing orange and red (more red) and from my distance would appear circular.  However due to distance, an actual shape could not be conclusively determined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that these planes were flying way to close for FAA regulations and were moving faster than normal. It is important to note that these objects were due north of a medium sized airport.  It is also important to note that I have lived right under a major airport highway for a major city airport and my town is in a direct path way (most of the time) to this airport mentioned above.  I state this simply because I have a lot of experience watching planes take of and land.  I am also very aware of normal lights on planes.  I am also aware of covert lighting, dim/ no lighting procedures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that if a plane normal plane is moving at 500-600 miles per hour at this altitude (10-15,000 ft?), these objects were moving under super sonic speed but pretty close.  It is a cloudy night tonight and these objects could be seen for some distance to the east.  By the time they flew over me and I was able to get my binoculars out of my trunk, they were gone.  That was fast.  It took me approximately two minutes to dig for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the only other comments I could state is that they were not blinking lights on the wings of a plane.  The object would have been totally engulfed by what ever this red/orange object was.  It was moving too fast to be commercial aircraft, which would have been in that particular area.  I am not aware of any further witnesses, but people driving home may have seen me point my spot light at the last object for a brief moment.  This seemed to slow it down for a second. It then flew at the high rate of speed, out of sight.<n>

On our way home I saw two lights coming from east to west.  At first I thought it was fire works.  However, after watching them hover a few minutes they traveled off to the west and seemed to fizzle out. They were followed by 2 more.  We watched them do the same thing then two more appeared and repeated the process. We were still trying to figure this out.  Could it be flares, weather balloons, satelllites.... It was bizzare but we were trying to come up with a logical explanation.  We then circled around about a half mile directly acroos from where we had been and we saw two more objects again repeating the same tract.  As we watched from this direction we could see that the lights were not fizzling out as we thought but were going above the cloud cover.  We drove home and I filed this report asap. We were not drunk or high.<n>

Except for the distant sounds, it was pretty quiet.  As I turned to go back inside,  I saw clusters of  seven to nine orange-red in color lights all at the same speed and height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several of theses clusters, but separated  a quarter of a mile apart.  They were followed by slower moving individuals, following each other one by one in a straight line.  I rushed inside to get my binoculars, shouting for my wife to come out with me, and I was able to see some kind of orb like thing with a brighter center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were pretty frantic at this point because they kept coming and coming.  Lasted for about five to seven minutes.  I’m going to contact the local police to see if there were other observers that called in, and what they might think it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought if might be those Chinese candle bags that can float across the sky, but the candles couldn’t generate enough heat to float the bags because it was so cold.  No sound, just passing by.  Besides, they were going too fast.  I’m at a loss.<n>

There were two commercial airplanes in the vicinity that were travelling at much faster speeds and were audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights suddenly disappeared and within 10 seconds a single similar light appeared in the direction of magnetic north, slowly ascended in altitude before suddenly vanishing.  We were unable to see any further similar objects, though we continued searching the sky for approximately 30 minutes after we lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is our secong New Year&#39;s experience, though the last year&#39;s experience was with a differnet light pattern and possible craft outline.

The rotation made the triangle change its shape.  The lights moved in a very fluid way.  They were bright but at the same time appeared dim enough to possibly look like nearby stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:06 am two of the three lights faded away.

Me and my wife had a couple of friends around to celebrate New Year&#39;s Eve with us. Shortly after 10pm we ran out of coke so me and my friend decided to walk to the BP service station which is just behind our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we made our way we observed 2 orange lights steadily moving from the direction of Victoria point towards the back of our house. I am unsure if the light was actual light of the moon light reflecting on the surface of the crafts. They did not flash or make any noise (but did seem to shimmer slightly) and maintained the same distance from each other constantly. As they moved out of sight one of the lights faded away. When we returned my wife and My friends partner told us they had seen them too but observed 3 lights instead of 2. We didn&#39;t know what to think and left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, shortly after midnight, about 12:04 we saw the lights again, 3 of them in a triangular formation coming from the same direction.  Again they moved so silently and softly maintaining the same distance from each other.  We were facing towards Victoria point with a clear sky and the moon bright and up to our left.  It was when these objects moved underneath the moon that we were convinced that they were alien crafts.  The light from the moon cast down on top of them revealing three huge disc shaped crafts with what appeared to be a hard metallic surface.  It was hard to tell how high they were but they seemed quite low. Possibly the height a news chopper would fly at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say with up most certainty that they were not planes or helicopters, hot air balloons, weather balloons or any other man made craft. I have seen all of these things numerous times throughout my life and they look nothing like what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to ask me any questions that you may have about our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind Regards<n>

First the two objects were flying east to west in a formation which seemed quite strange i.e one of the lights was low on the horizon and behind the other light that was higher up from the horizon, plus they seemed to be flying at a fast speed, not zipping across the sky at an unfeasible speed but faster than planes tend to go .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another brighter, whiter light that I took to be a plane flying along the normal South to North air route for Portland International airport was flying to the West of the orange lights and didn&#39;t garner my attention until it started to fade out,  I don&#39;t know how but it was there then started to diminish and was gone.  At this time the lower light was no longer there (I don&#39;t know how it went it just wasn&#39;t there anymore) whilst the other kept along the east west path it was on and too faded out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another light that seemed similar to the two previous orange lights much lower on the horizon, for about 20 seconds which then dropped away from my view beyond the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this a plane one with the white and flashing lights came into view and flew an arc westward over towards Portland City Center.  This gave me the impression that the other lights I saw were quite a ways off and going much faster than this plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the orange lights through my binoculars and did not see the red and white flashing lights that planes normally have.  It may be that they were aircraft that did not exhibit the normal night time lights, but these had no flashing lights on them, were in a formation and seemed to be moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to put this up as I am intrigued to see if any other folks saw this or have an opinion on what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She noticed five bright orbs hovering over the neighborhood sky.  She called me to quickly look and I tried to adjust my eyes to fully comprehend what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, my mother in law got up to look as well as I ran to find my camera.  Two dissapeared together simultaniously and then the other two, and finally the last one.  We researched further and noticed they were similar to Phoenix lights back in 1997.  Quite a way to start the new year!!<n>

My first thought was this must be a Chinese lantern,having never seen one before.  My neighbor said it was too contained and perfect in shape,and the glow was too uniform in to be flame.  As we watched it moving at approximately 35 m.p.h,about 1 minute later a 2nd one, then 3rd and so on until we counted 9 of them.  they followed each other in line and as we watched them start to ascend higher they started moving in different directions and elevations as we watched them fade off in the distance.  They seemed controlled and peaceful.<n>
