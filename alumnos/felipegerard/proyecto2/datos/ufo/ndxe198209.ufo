Slender in build and perhaps 52 inches tall. Mature in appearence yet without any secondary sex characterists of any kind. Dressed in a pale colored short sleaved shirt and green shorts. Light weight boots were noticed on its feet. The ears and nose appeared normal for a humanoid. The head was slighly larger in proportion to the thorax than would be normal yet was attractive in its shape. Dark brown hair covered the top and back giving it a receeding hairline appearence. We encounterd this personas we were leaving the rocky summit of this Mountain. There are only two trails that leave the summit and our backs were between the subject and the trail head. We had no prior warning of his approach to us and seemed to appear out of nowheare. He greeted us by asking the question, &#34;What can you tell me about the flora and fauna here.&#34; I asked him to clairify what he wanted to know. &#34; I want to know if there are Bears here and are they dangerous.&#34; I informed him that here are small Black Bears here but they are not aggressive towards humans in general. He responded, &#34;Very good&#34;. His voice was normal sounding with no accent. He stuck us both to be a college professor or scientists in his questioning but had such a gross lack of basic knowledge about the woods that we both turned in surprise to talk about this person, made eye contact  and then turned quickly back to talk more with him and he was gone.  There was no possible way that he could have gotten out of sight of us so quickly as there is a very limited amount of room on the rock we were standing and it led directly to the trail behind him. In any event we ran around the top of the summit looking for him and then ran down the trail perhaps a quarter mile looking for him. We saw no sign of him. We existed the summit via the other trail and walked rapidly in hopes of findi! ng him t here but did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What seemed so strange about this encounter was that it took place on a very cool fall day, perhaps 40 degrees F.  He was dressed for summer and seemed perfectly comfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I not sure this officially qualifies for a close encounter of the third kind but I find it curious that this encounter has stayed so fresh in both of our minds 25 years later.  He and I talk little as we live 2300 miles apart but when we do speak the first thing we say is &#34;did you see what I saw.&#34;  The answer continues to be &#34;yes.&#34;<n>

My description will follow a brief short story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were playing ball in a school field.  He got my attention by pointing in the sky at this craft. We immediately knew it wasn’t a plan, jet, or helicopter.  We ran home, about 80 yards distance, and told my mother that something strange was in the air above the house.  She indulged us by going outside to see.  She is a religious person and wasn’t ready to accept this; however had no choice but to believe what she was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly went to the neighbor’s house to verify with them what we were seeing.  The neighbor swiftly said, &#34;I will not talk to any reporters about this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time 5-7 minutes have passed and the craft is now hovering approximately 300-500 ft. above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is in one almost football looking shape and colored bright silver like.  It is hovering and all the sudden splits into three parts and begins to change brilliant colors and maneuvers as if it was showing off its talent.  Incredible color change like I’ve never seen and hard to describe.  It put itself back together and hovered about 3-5 more minutes, then in the blink of an eye shot off in the sky and then it was gone.   An unforgettable sight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/18/82 19:00|Gilbert|WV|||Qualified witness observes three lights maneuvering strangely in the western sky.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56425.html|4|ndxe198209| Sept. 19, 1982 at approximately 7:00pm EST Gilbert, WV 25621 (on Browning Fork Road near Katy Fork)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background information on the observer: I am a private airplane and helicopter pilot.  I am a self-educated software engineer, and I now own a software development company based in Austin, Texas, developing high-speed machine vision systems for clients all over the U.S..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  A formation of 3 lights, appearing in the sky above a ridgeline, with mechanical and precise motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard after carrying several buckets of coal to the basement for our fireplace.  I was looking westward along a mostly flat ridgeline approximately 7 miles away.  From the north end of the ridgeline, noticeably well above the ridgeline itself (i.e. in the sky), a single light emerged, moving at a relatively slow speed.  Once it had moved along for a few seconds, a 2nd light appeared in trail behind it, emerging from the same location the first one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights continued to move southward, in lock-sync, above the ridge until approximately halfway across.  At that point the lights stopped, in a very odd, mechanical fashion (i.e. there was no deceleration, just instantaneous cessation of movement) and immediately a 3rd light appeared from &#34;behind&#34; the southern-most light and stopped at a symmetrical point with the other 2, forming 3 lights in a straight line and spaced equidistant from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights sat there motionless for approximately 10 seconds.  At that point, the new light continued southward, and the original 2 lights retraced their original path northward, and all disappeared behind neighboring hills.  The motion again was completely mechanical; instant acceleration and completely synchronized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves were single-point white lights, with no other observable characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((personal data deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite sober-minded to us.  That fact, combined with his technical background, suggests to us that he probably is an excellent witness.  He provides a diagram, which shows the motion of the objects he witnesses.  PD))<n>

I was walking home one night in the month of october or september. I lived near the downtown circuit at the time. I always admired the city lights on the east side of the river at night. one evening I noticed colorful lights in the sky it was not very cloudy as i looked I could not believe my eyes. The ship was as large as 1 or 2 city blocks or maybe 2-3 football fields in length. Lights were everywhere on this ship. I could make out a definite rectangular shape looking at the lights. It was moving from the north to the south. not very fast but not very slow either. The lights were not reflections, i saw red green yellow blue. It might have been about fifty feet in height and width. I came closer to my house and then it was gone. I told a few people but no one believed me. I would guess it to be about 1500 ft. in altitude. there is no way I was seeing reflections. There was no sound from the craft. I too wonder if there is a secret military base here in town as a previous U.F.O. report states. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw was of Holographic Design.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in September 1982.  PD))<n>
9/15/82 22:00|Eidson|TN|Chevron|4 hours or more|We saw multicolored lights in the night sky  in Eidson TN in  fall 1982 that were the shape of a football-field-size parallelogram.|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24573.html|6|ndxe198209| We saw multicolored lights in the night sky  in Eidson TN in  fall 1982 that were the shape of a football-field-size parallelogram.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having 5 kids and a small 3-room house, to gain a little peace of mind, my mother would allow me and my brother, the two eldest, play outside after dark on warm nights.  In the fall of 1982, in Eidson, Tennessee, while playing hide and go seek outside in the dark, my brother (11) and I (10) saw a large group of round, multicolored lights in the sky that seemed to hover over a nearby moutain top.  My brother ran inside and told my mother who came outside after him while I &#34;kept an eye&#34; on the strange lights.  The three of us stared up at the lights while my stepfather and other siblings looked out the front door.  My mother decided the three of us would try to get a closer look while my stepfather stayed behind with the younger children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hurried down the gravel road that ran beside our house to the base of the mountain.  We wanted to get a closer look before the lights should disappear.  At the base of the mountain, we saw two of our neighbors, a boy and his father.  They had spotted the strange lights in the sky, too.  They had flashlights and apparently had the same idea as we had of getting a closer look at the strange lights.  We all hurried together through trees and underbrush full of stickers to the top of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw straight above our heads was a cluster of multicolored lights that weren&#39;t set in any apparent color pattern.  We were quiet and way out in the country, and the only sound we heard was crickets nearby, no unnatural noise such as an engine or anything else manmade.  We all stared upward, wondering what exactly we seeing.  The lights seemed to be of one craft.  The craft must have been quite a distance up because the flashlights fell on nothing when we shined them in the direction of the lights.  There were no stars or moon out that night; the sky and our surroundings were pitch black, so we saw nothing except the strange lights in the sky and whatever our flashlights illuminated.  The lights seemed to roughly form the shape of a parallelogram.  The craft seemed to be gigantic as the lights extended far across the sky directly above us, maybe as long as a football field.  The lights didn&#39;t move or twinkle.  They were red, yellow, blue, orange and white.  The lights didn&#39;t just form a rough outline of the craft, they were all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it didn&#39;t move or make any sound, and it was getting late, we all decided to go back to our homes.  Naturally none of us had any film in our cameras, and the nearest store was 30 miles away and probably not open that late anyway.  We peeked at it a few times out our windows before settling into bed and finally falling asleep.  In the morning, of course, the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date of September 15, 1982, so that the report posts to that year.  Location of sighting appears to be Eidson, TN, but may be Edison, TN.  We can find neither in our mapbook.  PD))<n>

I was 18 at the time.  I noticed lights on the horizon in several directions which look like half moons.  I then noticed two small lights moving slowly through the ski.  I thought it was an airplane, until it stopped, and changed direction back the way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this for about five minutes during which the lights came closer to me.  I ran inside and called for my mom &amp; dad and my younger brother who was 16 at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next ten minutes we observed the lights as they came down to about tree top level.  They would float back and forth, moving perhaps 10 yards at a time.  Then they slowly moved from the back of out house to the front.  They paused over some trees at the corner of the yard and then slowly moved out over the town toward the north.  We watched them until they were out of sight.  There was no sound that we could hear and we could not make out any form or object, just the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see the half moon lights after the floating lights left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/15/82 17:00|La Crosse|WI|Disk|20 min|I saw a disk hoovering over a Parking lot with aprox 30 others.  Lights revolving around it.

Motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened over the south side ShopKo parking lot.  It was very light and bright sunny afternoon.  My Mother, myself (age 14), my 3 girlfriends were getting out of our car.  I looked up and noticed a large disk shaped object.  It was silver/grey or metalic looking.  It had windows around the disk.  There were red, blue, green, etc color lights revolving back and forth around it.  It just hoovered over the parking lot.  Stationary never moving.  It had a low hum.  Definetly not an airplane or hellacopter sound or ability to stay still.  There was no breeze or wind comming off of the ship.  I yelled at it to take me.  It didn&#39;t.  My Mother told me to shut up!  I did.  Everyone was looking up at it.  Then it just took off faster than light and disapeared. This was reported to the police and on the news.  No explaination for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/82 06:00|Republic of South Korea||Cone|3 minutes|Cone shaped, silver, smooth craft with lights hovering through military field site.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41218.html|9|ndxe198209| Cone shaped, silver, smooth craft with lights hovering through military field site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stationed in South Korea as an aviation helicopter maintenance mechanic, my unit was deployed to the field for a major training exercise.  I was at the field dining facility at about 6:00AM and noticed the fog rolling into the valley that our unit was set up at.  I noted that due to the fog, that there would be no flying that morning until the fog cleared.  The sun had come up and it was daylight.  As I was watching the fog move I noticed that the fog began to part as if something was disturbing the air.  Out of the fog came a cone and top shaped object of silver color, smooth skin, and had rotating green, blue and red lights at the top and at the bottom. The craft made no jet engine noise or internal combustion engine noise whatsoever.  I did detect a slight humming noise but the craft was about 1/2 mile away and I could not hear it well.  The craft hovered slowly at about 10 to 15 KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) and did not deviate at all from its course.  It slowly passed over our training site and then moved up into the valley and then disappeared into the fog.  I looked over at the Dining Facility Manager, a senior NonCommissioned Officer of the US Army, and asked him if he just saw what I saw.  He nodded in agreement and then stated, &#34;We didnt see nothing&#34; and then turned around and walked away and never mentioned it again.  I detected no military markings, weapons, or any type of surveillance equipment.  I detected no US Flag markings or any International Flag markings or International Number designators on the skin of the aircraft at all.  It left no fuel vapor and it left no exhaust smoke as a jet engine would or an internal combustion engine would.  In the area were 18 US Army Attack Helicopters, 12 US Army Observation Helicopters and over 250 US Army personnel.  When I mentioned this incident to my squad leader he just laughed it off and told me that it was probably something from North Korea checking us out.  I explained to my squad leader that it was not a military aircraft.  He told me to forget about it.  To lend credence to this incident, I made the military my career and retired as a Senior First Sergeant/Master Sergeant of Army Aviation.  I also had for over 15 years a US Government Secret Security clearance that was renewed every 5 years after a thorough NSA background check. To me and to the dining facility manager this was something that neither of us were familiar with and knew that it was not something that could be classified as a military aircraft or top secret spy platform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

9/14/82 19:00|Calion|AR|Triangle|10 seconds|It was black with a bunch (100 or more) small white lights (Like a christmas tree/decoration) and hovered silently.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33716.html|12|ndxe198209| It was black with a bunch (100 or more) small white lights (Like a christmas tree/decoration) and hovered silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am updating this to try and be as accurate as possible. I was around 12-13 years old and my mom and I were travelling from El Dorado to Hampton (Northly direction) to see one of her friends around 7:00-8:00 at night. My Step-dad was with us but he was sleeping. To get to Hampton from El Dorado you must drive over a bridge (as it is the only bridge within a 20 mile radius and the Ouchita river is fairly large). As we approached the bridge (it&#39;s in a small town by the name of Calion) my mom looked to the left and said &#34;I wonder what that is ?&#34; As I looked we saw a triangle shaped object/craft hovering over the river. It was black in color and had a bunch of white small lights (like you would see on a Christmas tree/decoration) all underneath(100 or more). (It was similiar to the craft reported by the person in Owen Sound, Canada in 9/2/83 but the lights did not pulse or blink). It hovered the whole time we watched (my mom had slowed the car down to a crawl by now). It was about 150 yards away from us, right above the trees, directly over the river and 3/4 the size of a football field. It made no sound (we had our windows down) and shot off into the sky like a missle/rocket from a complete standstill. I have read reports stating it may be that UFO&#39;s use water as fuel and I have often wondered if it was just &#34;re-fueling&#34; while hovering directly over the river. I was never interested in UFO&#39;s until my mom and I saw this object/craft that night. The sky was clear and you could definitly see the shape and size. I have told many people my story but I was so glad to find this web site and document what we saw. It&#39;s good to know others have had strange unexplained sightings. The image has been in my mind ever since I saw it and will probaly remain forever. Keep up the good work. THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE. WE ARE NOT ALONE! You may contact me by e-mail if you have any questions. Remember this was years ago and brains have destroyed some of my beer cells by now but I will answer to the best of my mem! ory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/14/82 02:00|Ripley|TN|Unknown|45 min|The three of us watched a large object with flashing multicolor lights in neighbors field for 45 min to an hour|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48562.html|13|ndxe198209| The three of us watched a large object with flashing multicolor lights in neighbors field for 45 min to an hour<n> <n><n> <n><n> While celebrating the birth of a new granddaughter in Dec., my ex-husband(who is a good friend) asked me if I remembered what we saw in Ripley when my daughter was 4? When he mentioned it I instantly recalled the event and how it got pushed back in my mind I&#39;ll never know. Anyway,my ex was a young Methodist minister and was assigned 3 small churches in and about Ripley.We call it a circuit. We lived in a small parsonage in the Edith community which was a bit in the country. My Mother had gone with us on the move to help with my daughter who was 4 at the time. We&#39;re from Mississippi. My ex.was going to school at Lambuth college in Jackson, Tn had 3 churches and boy were things hectic. Anyway we had an elderly couple who lived next to us that we&#39;d become friendly with. They were in bad health so we took it upon ourselves to sort of check on them. They lived about 350 to 400 feet from us if that and had a huge garden spot to the side of their house and back view of ours. Our bedroom window faced their garden and part of the house. We&#39;d been in bed for awhile and my mom comes knocking on the door and says,&#34;children, gret up,get up, there&#39;s something going on at the _____ next door! I wake up and think what in the world now. I was on the right side of the bed with the window next to me and when I looked in that direction I saw lights flashing. My ex was awake at the same time and said,I&#39;ll bet its an ambulance. Mama,by this time was in the room and was going on about,&#34;look at that ,its an airplane! I&#39;m trying to get awake and say Mama,how in the world would an airplane get out there?!!! So I peeked through the window,well we all werepeeking and there was this thing flashing all these multicolored lights right in the middle of these folks garden. I told my ex,Man that&#39;s ot an ambulance, why would they be in the garden out back, and have you ever seen an ambulance like that. This thing looked like a christmas tree lit up. there were red,blue,green,yello,white and amber lights just flashing all over it. I mean, if anyone had driven by,they couldn&#39;t have missed it. It looked like it was a pretty good size,the garden area had a lot of land on the back side. It didn&#39;t make any noise and it seemed like it was just a little above the ground. Mama is saying she thinks its a drug drop from a helicopter, I&#39;m half awake and trying to sort this out and get her to calm down and be quiet. My ex is just WOW,look at that. I tell Mama, its not a helicopter,its got the wrong lights,its quiet and why in the world would anyone drop something in the_____garden in podunk Tn. I don&#39;t really know what I was thinking,it was just so weird. so we watched it for a long time. It just kept flashing and seemed to be turning, it kinda looked like a lit up turnip. That sounds silly but is easily understood. My daughter doesn&#39;t remember too much of this but woke up and thought it was Santa Claus. The lights didn&#39;t seem to have any pattern,they were just flashing all over this thing. What my ex and I did notice was that the lights didn&#39;t seem to be shing outward in a long direction but were confined pretty close, and cast shadows. By now,we&#39;re wondering why the ____ haven&#39;t woke up and noticed something strange in their garden.My ex had the bright idea of just going out there and finding out what was going on. I asked him if he was crazy,didn&#39;t he realize that we didn&#39;t really know what that thing was,my mom told him it was drug dealers and he&#39;d be killed. I mean this was just really,really surreal. Mr. Davenport,at this time I don&#39;t think UFO had even crossed our minds. I know Mama didn&#39;t. That would be just too far out of her realm of reality and experience. So we watched some more. We remarked that if it was a helicopter we&#39;d hear something,It was so close I could have probably hit it with a rock from our back yard. About that time,Mama pulled the curtain open wider to get a better view and I was trying to get her to quiet down and don&#39;t right in the window and the thing beamed a whitish ,blue light right at the window. Well whatever we thought it was, we all knew we&#39;d been spotted. ___and I hit the floor with the baby,and Mama started crying and screaming that we were going to be killed. I remember peeping up at the bottom of the window and seeing this thing out there sorta of shifting and this light going through our room like a searchlight. Then it just shut off, the object rose slowly and just eased on. No big burst of speed, or anything like that. Mama wanted to call the police about drug dealers,my ex started the UFO thing and I remeber telling them,look, we can&#39;t call with wild stories about drug dealers cause that implicate the old folks next door, and we really didn&#39;t know anything of the sort, I told my ex that, we were new,in a goldfishbowl being in the ministry and young,what would people out there think of their new preacher seeing ufos in the neighbors garden? And God forgive me,I told my little one that it was santa checking the area out and that if she told anyone he wouldn&#39;t come back. The next day,I went over to the ____ house and asked them if they heard noises the night before. They told me they went to bed around 7 and didn&#39;t wake up until 6. They had a big,old house and probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed much anyway as their room was on the opposite side. I eased around and took a look at their garden area and there was no sign of any kind of depression,suggesting a landing,but the old stalks in the garden were whipped around.Looking back now,this was a very extrordinary event,maybe even more so than I know.How this got into the back part of my mind is the real mystery. But I was just 29 years old in a strange place and trying to be the perfect preacher&#39;s wife and model mom. I just installed a scanner and tomorrow am going to e-mail a drawing of what we saw. I&#39;m 50 now,my ex is 53 and my mom is 76. I don&#39;t know what we saw. Neither does my ex. My mom to this day still believes it was drug-runners as she calls them. Me,my ex,who lives in Memphis and my Mom would have no trouble answereing any questions about this. Don&#39;t take my sense of humor relating this as this is some kind of joke, its just that it was just that way. Since then I&#39;ve seen a &#34;few&#34; strange things and have no reason to mislead anyone. I just think by reporting what we see only helps us get a grasp on this thing. I would like to add that my mom is a very fine lady and pillar of her church. My ex is a man who I don&#39;t think would even know how to fabricate something and me.... I just tell it like it is. We are educated,sound minded people. By the way,I did post a sighting for Ripley for 1999. It was 1990,large rectangular craft. My typo.

I have been back there fishing many of times and know the area well. The Big Muddy is not very wide, at that spot not no more than 100 feet.I was getting in my car when I saw a green light and a red light moving slowly in the trees.I got out and started walking towards them.The lights started coming up river, closer towards me.They were going up and down below tree level.I was laying in a shallow ditch right at the trees,no farther than 50 yards from the river.The lights seemed to be a good distance apart. I never did see a shape.About half way through my sighting,I saw a beam of light,no more than a foot across,searching through the woods.I could see it hitting the ground.I watched for several minutes and it hit me how scared I was.There was not a sound at all.The object started moving down river and I got the hell back to my car.I watched it for several more minutes there when it came above the trees and shot off into the night sky.I know what I saw and I hope they are friendly.It seemed like hours,but the whole thing lasted for over 30 minutes.Been looking up ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/12/82 22:00|Wiley|GA|Flash|5 minutes|I witnessed 3 large diffused flashing lights just above the tree line near Tallulah Falls, Georgia.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49410.html|15|ndxe198209| I witnessed 3 large diffused flashing lights just above the tree line near Tallulah Falls, Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening just before going to bed I noticed a large diffused flashing light just above the tree line outside my living room window.  I first thought the object was the moon and perhaps the wind was blowing a tree branch in front of the moon to make it appear to flash.  I watched for a about 30 seconds.  I got up and looked out the window and saw three of these large lights.  I went onto the front porch to get a better look.  I walked inside to have my 16 year old son verify what I was seeing.  He also witnessed the lights.  I asked him if he could hear any noise from an aircraft or helicopter, he could not.  My 6 year old daughter also saw these large diffused flashing lights.  We went inside so that I could get my glasses when we returned the lights were gone.  The sky was very clear and star filled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/12/82 05:30|Mason City|IA|Sphere|1 minute|While helping on paper rout, early morning, right orange globe went down off to my right.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54911.html|16|ndxe198209| While helping on paper rout, early morning, right orange globe went down off to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw the large orange sphere I was with my son doing the Sunday morning paper route, which was very large.  The reason I remember the approximate date so well was when we got home I sat down to read the Sunday paper and there was a report of a John David Gosch that had disappeared while doing his paper route.  All that was left was his red wagon on the corner where he was last seen.  My son held two paper routes, both weekly and Sunday and since the weekly route was a small paper, he usually ran his weekly paper route with just the dog along.  When I read about the Gosch boy, my son never went on any paper route alone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son stopped and bent down to tie a shoe lace and as I turned to my right, this huge orange ball came from behind us, straight through the sky and gracefully went down somewhere behind one of the houses that Frank Lloyd Wright built.  I say gracefully because there was no sound, no tree tops blowing in the wind - it just floated straight and fast.  Naturally, by the time I grabbed my son by the back of his shirt and said &#34;did you see that&#34;.  He had missed the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I didn&#39;t see the orange ball, but I know it was there. I was sitting out on my deck, actually I sleep outside all summer when it&#39;s not raining and is warm enough.  It was probably about 11:30 pm and I was still sitting up watching the stars, etc., when a light came over my deck.  Like a strobe light actually.  The back end of my deck, looking north is about four foot off of the ground and there is a railing around the deck.  This light hit the top of the back railing and moved down across my deck, up to and over me.  I was facing the light and was sitting back almost to the wall if my house so I could see the big dipper.  All of a sudden it was like I was in broad daylight.  I leaned forward and looked to both sides trying to see where the light was coming from.  I thought someone had put up some kind of new yard light or something.  As I looked around I saw that no else’s back yard was lit up and the light was just around me.  It didn’t even cover my whole deck.  After about 4-5 minutes the light crawled back across my deck and disappeared so I just forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, Saturday at about the same time the light came back.  This time I got up out of my chair and went over to the back railing so I could look up over the house.  There was the big orange globe.  I was standing in daylight, literally, the light was so bright, but you couldn’t see a stream of light coming from the globe.  There were no blinking lights or anything.  It was absolutely motionless.  I stood their staring at it for about 4 minutes, at least it seemed that long.  I did notice Mars behind and to the left of the globe.  It was much farther up and not nearly as large so I do know it wasn’t Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t seem to be perfectly smooth because I could see brownish (like indents) marks all over it.  There were no windows or anything and you couldn’t see where the light was coming from.  I really had the feeling that I was being watched.  I live in a regular ranch style house and that thing was bigger than my house.  It’s hard to judge distances but it looked like it was right on the other side of my house.  I remember getting a little aggravated because it didn’t do any thing and I said “for heaven’s sake say something or come down here and say something”.  Don’t just sit there!  I went over to my chair to grab a cigarette and when I returned to watch it again, it was gone.  There was no sign of it.  Not shooting off through the sky – nothing.  Once again, no sound, no trees blowing in the breeze – just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When talking to my sister who still lives in Iowa, she said she had seen the orange globe almost two years earlier.  Now, I do have a huge imagination but my sister does not.  She said she was sitting outside on her back porch after dark and this bright globe looked like it came up out of the ground and rose just above the tree tops, then just sat there.  She went to get her husband to see and by the time she turned around it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note Characteristics:  I checked emitted beams because I was bathed in a circle of light, and The object landed because I know the first time I saw it - it went down but it&#39;s more like it went into the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/9/82 16:10|Mount Kisco|NY|Sphere|30 sec|light blue sphere connected to glowing red/orange cylinder at rear, travelling south.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27165.html|17|ndxe198209| light blue sphere connected to glowing red/orange cylinder at rear, travelling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Towards evening in early September 1982 just before my son Michael was born on the 10th I was upstairs in my house in Mount Kiscolooking out of the bedroom window facing west. The sky was a clear blue, but slightly at and above the tree line I noticed a red glow in the sky. I thought someone had set off a firework and I looked more intently. The red glow was moving from right to left in my field of view (or southwards) I thought this was very strange and then I saw that there was an aircraft in front of the glow, but it had no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front part was a glowing light blue sphere and attached to the sphere at the rear was a brightly glowing/pulsating orange/red cylinder the length of which was about twice the diameter of the blue sphere. The diameter of the cylinder was about one quarter of the diameter of the sphere and projected straight back parallel to the direction of flight for about two or three sphere diameters. I thought to myself that the cylinder was the power source driving the sphere forward. There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without any reference it is always difficult to tell whether an object traveling in space is far or near, especially if the surfaces are smooth. However, I estimated that it was about the size of a Boeing 747 or larger and flying at 2000ft in altitude at about 500 mph. It was only in view about 10 or 15 seconds altogether. Of course, it could have been larger and further away, but probably not smaller or nearer as it was behind the tree branches on my property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it disappeared from view I rushed downstairs and exclaimed to my wife that I had seen a UFO. She looked at me very skeptically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the next day in the New York Times there was a small mention that an unidentified craft had been sighted by several people. It had been tracked on radar as coming over the Canadian border flying south until it reached Atlanta and then it turned abruptly east and headed out into the Atlantic. There were various nutty explanations given by learned people who had not even seen it. E.g. Mars in the ascendant!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1982 is approximate.

I counted about  17 or so in 1982.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I, and three children, came home from a school play around 9:00 one evening, and were looking at the starry, country sky. My son and I stayed out and continued studying the sky after they went in. I happened to look at an almost 90 degree angle,toward the north, and caught sight of what seemed to be a very distant and small star. There was a red, pinpoint dot of light that came into view on the left side of the star [or object]. It disappeared as it got very close to the star. Another red light, exactly the same, appeared on the left side, and then another on the right,all doing the same thing, appearing, and then disappearing as if entering a loading or entry zone or something with a definite paced speed and format. I counted about 6 or 7, and called my 13 year old son over and showed him.  I counted about 10 or 11 more of these red dots of light entering from all sides of the star, and then disappearing. I&#39;ve considered that it might have been  a meteor shower, but the activity seemed so uniform and there weren&#39;t any flashes or explosions that I could see. I don&#39;t know what the main object was either, but I felt that it was a lot closer than a star. I&#39;ve never heard of anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
