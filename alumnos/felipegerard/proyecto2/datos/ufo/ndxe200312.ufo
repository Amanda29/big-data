It blinked on and off and suddenly went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a red cluster hovering in the eastern sky.  It appeared solid and was blinking on and off.  It did not move.  Ironically, we saw the exact same light exactly two years earlier on new years eve 2002( we were sober I might add).  It hovered for approximately 15 minutes and then the light went out. It was to high to be a plane and no way was it a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Have never seen anything like this; approx. nine yellow-orange lights in random pattern first seen in general area above confluence of Wenatchee and Columbia rivers, spread in sky and moving slowly from northwest to southeast.  Some lights moved up, others down even to below horizon line.  Witnessed by three adults and one teenager from good vantage point near center of Wenatchee.  Lights eventually either died out or moved beyond range to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The path was slightly erratic, the light was unsteady and wobbled from side to side.  There was a cloud deck, and the light stayed under the clouds the whole time.  The craft(s) flew directly overhead, making no noise.  As it passed overhead, we could see that the light was coming from approx. 7 individual lights.  The craft(s) continued overhead, and on the south/north path.  This path continued until the craft(s) were lost to sight.  The light was orange/yellow in color, and seemed to shift hue, but only very slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One witness, a college graduate, says that it reminded her of &#34;a box with lights on it , with the light coming from within&#34;  A second witness, 26, says that it looked like &#34;one object with lights in a pattern.  Equally bright...  The same color orange.&#34;  The third witness, 25, was the first to spot the object, seeing a bright orange light, at first thinking it was landing lights from an airplane coming in to land at the nearby airport.  The lights were the wrong shade, however, and that is what grabbed his attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite sincere and credible.  PD))<n>

I walked up the street and looked at a street light but behind the street light I could make out 5 far away dots of light that moved uniformly up and then to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/03 23:00|Canyon Lake|CA|Cross|1-2 hours|objects flew up thousands of ft., dissappearred,re-aprd, touched eachother, very fast, yet floated at times.|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34973.html|5|ndxe200312| objects flew up thousands of ft., dissappearred,re-aprd, touched eachother, very fast, yet floated at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live waterfront in Canyon Lake not far from Edwards AFB, the entire back side of my house overlooks the Santa Ana Mts.to the West or left. directly behind are hills with nothing for miles and to the East or right is Edwards AFB. On New Years Eve I was sitting in my kitchen looking west/left towards S.A. Mts. Both my girlfriend and I saw 4-5 objects huvering just over the mtn top, they would all (one by one or 1-2 at a time) &#34;shoot&#34; straight up several thousand feet, huver for a while dissappear for a while, re-appear sometimes much higher approx 15k ft., other times just over the mtn. top. they all had strange light formations mostly bright, but dimming periodocaly or lights sudenly tuning off. I was able to keep a pretty good eye on them with my binnoculars. was unable to see much of a formation do to it being at night, their lights gave too much of a glare. when lights off they looked like the eagle on the back of a silver dollar with a string out the bottom. almost like a kite string.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next day New Years day at approx. 2-4 pm the same objects appeared and when I looked with my binnoculars they defineately looked like the eagle. the color they gave off was like that of an old motor cycle tail pipe, goldish blues, then grey, and almost incadescent at times. the string on the bottom appeared to be a jet stream or exhaust about the same length as the craft. They (3-4) flew the same way as the night before. huvering, &#34;shooting straight up, floating side to side while perpindicular (slow 360&#39;s) then turning the other way. this lasted for approx. 1 hour, somewhere between  2pm &amp; 4pm. since then i have seen similar objects several times usually late at night. I have also noticed a sincere increase in military aircraft for approx 2 months now. prior to last Oct-Nov. there were rarely any aircrafts flying over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (El Toro air base happens to be directly behind the sightings) If it is closed? aprox 2 weeks ago in he middle of the week around 2pm an aircraft traveling approx 4-5K mph,(based on fighter jets that go overhead at 1.5k mph?) went overhead it looked similar to the space shuttle without any wings and was white or silverish. since 1-1-04 i leave my binnoculars out, this is reason i was able to see this aircraft. after it passed overhead, the turbulnce caused the middle of the lake to raise up in a circular fashion as like a round wave approx 10&#39; diameter, then it became a wall type wave approx. 20&#39;-30&#39;long for a brief moment and turned into a whirlpool about 10 diameter. it was by far the fastest aircraft i have ever seen. 2-3 days after that for two consecutive days there were at least 20 rocket trails in the evening. the first night they were from the south towards Mira Mar? the second evening north/west towards LA. the day i saw the super fast object no trails were in the sky. I do have some photos and camcorder tape of all the above, not the best quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This thing was round like a small orb but it was all different colors like reds and greens and yellows. and the middle of this circular thing was swirling around and changing colors like some kind of prism thing. I dont know what it is but i would like to know if anyone else has spotted something like it. It didnt move around in circles or zig zag in the sky like people say but it did move and I know it wasnt a star it was way to low. Whatever it was it was weird. could you possibly give me some info on what this thing could have been<n>
12/31/03 22:50|Penfield|NY|Light|3 min|I saw a bright light or very shiny matialic light moving at very high speed, & change of direction like nothing i ever seen befor|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36526.html|7|ndxe200312| I saw a bright light or very shiny matialic light moving at very high speed, &amp; change of direction like nothing i ever seen befor<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was new years eve,  at 10:30 pm.  I was on my way to my best friends house by myself to spend new yrs with them.  I was heading south on salt road.  As I was driving tword sweets corners rd.,  were i would turn left or east on sweets corner rd.  I saw a round or egg shap light.  A very bright light or even maybe a matillic shine.  I slowed down to watch the phnonomon.  First I looked to see if there was any 1 around useing a flashlight.  But there was no beam were the light could have come from.  It seemed to be a small light.  And I have never seen any air craft that could have made the turns or moves this light made.  It seemed playfull to me.  Don&#39;t ask me how I know that.  I was not afraid.  I had heard of swamp gasses and things like that ,  can look like a object hoovering.  But this light moved up and down very fast,  and moved side to side in no obvious pattern.  I am not suer if there is swears there,  but its definetly not a swamp.  I also wondered if maybe there were tatonic plates moving that they say can cause lights.  but the earth moving that i could feel in my truck.  I never got out of my truck.  Like i said it seemed small.  And i couldent figuer out why any craft would be making thouse type of turns and dives that it did.  when it looked to be close to the ground,  i did not see any illumanation of the field or grass.  very strange.  Than it took off very fast north bound,  and it was out of sight.  like it eather took off so fast and dissapeared,  or it turned the light off.  I don&#39;t no witch.  (please excuse my spelling) When I got to my friends house,  only a mile or 2 from the sighting,  i told them i think i had my first ufo sighting.  They laughed and brushed it off.    I tried to give them rational reasons for what I saw.  I am 36 yrs old.  I have known these people for 24 years.  They no me,  and that i don&#39;t just tell storys or lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen what they call floters in my eyes befor I get a migraine.  Its very normal to see thouse.  But this thing was def.  out there at the corner of salt road and sweets corner road.  I don&#39;t no what I saw,  and would love an awnswer.  But I no there are not any easy awnswers out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/03 21:00|Sacramento|CA|Oval|10 sec.|Bright oval shaped object, flameing center, large tail, varying magnitude, moving across sky rapidly.|3/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35363.html|8|ndxe200312| Bright oval shaped object, flameing center, large tail, varying magnitude, moving across sky rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was gazing out towards the East horizon, a large bright object appeared like out of a dark veil from the south - east, at a low altitude, apox. 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was oval shaped, laying horizontal, it&#39;s top side was bright, and bottom side was bright, the center front to back was like a white flame, not as bright as it&#39;s top and bottom. A bright comet tail followed the object, apox. ten times the length of the object. The objects diameter was as large as a cargo plane (maybe two or three degrees across, 1.5 degrees from top to bottom). The object traveled from the south east to north east, that is, it changed bearing and from traveling north on the east horizon, to a north-east-north direction. It vanished into another veil of darkness. My estimation of speed is that it traveled perhaps 1000 mp-minute. Based on a apox. est of distance in feet, measured in time traveled. The event lasted about 6 seconds, taking a guess.<n>

We grabbed the digicam and walked out the door.  We had an amazing view of sunset from outside of our apartment so we took a few pictures.  I have a habit of snapping between 2 and 5 pictures in a quick duration just in case one is blurred or one doesn&#39;t come out.  When we downloaded the pictures I commented that something must have been on my lens, but looking at the pictures, I realized this object was only in one photo of the set (taken within 10 second duration).  There are sunlit clouds around but the object is framed in clear blue sky.  There is a metallic reflection on a disk shaped object.  You can zoom in on it and it becomes even clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 30-something biologist and I know this isn&#39;t a bird...it wouldn&#39;t have left the frame that quickly anyway, neither would an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be willing to forward the photos.  I would like a second opinion on what this could be... ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed three photos submitted by the witness.  There is a tiny, dark object in the second photo, but we cannot identify it.  It may be a bird, but that is pure conjecture on our part.  We do not know what the object is, and it is too small for us to be able to determine unambiguously what it is.  PD))<n>
12/31/03 16:45|Warner Robins|GA|Oval|10 mins|There was 3 round circular objects, one was Red, they first appeared to be stars, it was 4:45 in the afternoon, there were no others.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34244.html|10|ndxe200312| There was 3 round circular objects, one was Red, they first appeared to be stars, it was 4:45 in the afternoon, there were no others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4:45 pm i was checking the air in my tires when i looked up and saw the moon, as it is out early this time of the year. There i saw what first appeared to be 3 stars, with one being red. the Red one was about 3-4 inces away from the moon and the other 2 were about 1-2 inches away..I didn&#39;t think much of it right away, but i looked around and there were no other stars in the sky so that got me curious. The objects were a long way away, almost like they were even with the moon..i scanned the sky again for other stars and still did not see any. The Red one seemed to move ever so slow, the the other two moved just a little, about this time my Son, who is in the Navy and is getting Married Saturday as he is on his way back off the coast of Iraq. he is stationed on board the U.S.S. George Washington an aircraft carrier and he sees jet fighters all the time, they are suppose to leave around Jan 19th headed back off the coast of Iraq to provide air support for the troops he works hands on with the planes as he is an AO, Aviation Ordance man, loading the bombs on planes, he is used to seeing the best we have.. I asked him to take a look at the objects i saw, he first said they were stars, but after he saw them move a little he said , &#34;Dad, those are not stars, they are moving around, by this time the Red one was about 6 inches away in the 8 o&#39;clock position Using the Moon as the 12 O&#39;Clock position, the other 2 were about 3 inches away in the 5 pm and 7 pm position, they would move a little then stop, move a little then stop, about 7 mins into the sitings the red one took off super fast..the other two were now in the 6pm and 9 pm position, there they stopped for what appeared to be a couple of mins, then they moved again but with a little more speed, in about 2 more mins they both took off super fast and that was the last we saw of them. There was nothing else in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a former Deputy sheriff, left there and went to work for the local Air Force base as a DOD worker and saw planes all the time at my work, i have never seen anything move in that type fashion and then leave in that speed..This is no joke and i would be interested in talking to any one that may have saw this that same day, this was New Years Eve, 12-31-2003. Others should have seen them as they were very high and appeared to be close to the moon. The time was between 4:45 and 5 pm. I wish i had not had my head up by rear at the time as i have a new cell phone with picture capability, my dumb fault.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I stood up I stretched out alittle, while doing that I turned my head to look out the window that was right next to me and something caught my eye immediatly.  A white triangular object flying through the sky with what appeared to be a black circle on the the bottom of it.  I only got a few seconds look at it because it went past the trees in from the woods in my neighbors house.  It seemed to be moving fairly slow, and it was hard to tell exactly how big/far away it was but it seemed to be fairly big from the view I got from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Top and bottom are of saucer shape, in the middle is a bright light. There were two of them and my child thought that it was a couple of birds circling each other. The cloud formation was folowing the object that was captured on camera. The clouds, at first, were in a circular motion and dropped into the clouds which then came up through the clouds and headed right behind the object. My child also told me that there was a strange sound coming from the object like a car screaching to a stop, but slightly different. My other child said that the sound was like a high pitch whistle. I will try and send a copy of the photo, but do not really know computers. Hope it makes it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a red, blue, and white flashing lights in the air, circling the area to the north.  The red &amp; blue lights seemed to be flashing like the lights on a police car.  I watched the lights circle the area to the north around Stoney Creek for about 5 minutes, then I got my binoculars to get a better look.  I was able to see three flashing red lights on the object along with an undetermined number of white and blue lights.  I watched as the object flew to the west, towards Rochester.  As it flew to the west, I lost site of the object from my vantage point.  I went to the west side of the house and was able to continue tracking the object as it flew in a circular pattern over Rochester for about 5 minutes.  I then lost site of the object behind some trees for the next 10 minutes.  The object reappeared and flew south turned around and flew to the north, at which point I lost track of it.  The object seemed to be moving about the speed that a helicopter would fly, but made no sound.  The entire event lasted about 30 minutes.  My backgound is:  24 years old, physics graduate student, never have done any drugs and don&#39;t drink alcohol.

The first object began to descend in a very slanted motion and the other two followed, one hanging back a bit further than the other. As the objects descended further, the slant they were on began to appear like they were taking a nosedive, then began somewhat of a hovering movement. These objects along with the smoke at their tail, which was now a very bright pink light as the sunset, appeared to stop descending. It&#39;s very difficult to explain, but somehow the trail of smoke that was attached as a tail was now above the objects, almost like the trail was a very bright light being shined out of the top of the craft, but it still resembled smoke of some kind. All 3 objects just sat there in the sky. This went on for the 15 or 20 minutes that I was stuck in traffic in that area. As I began to merge onto I-95 2 more lines of &#34;smoke&#34; began coming from west to east. I can not say what came of these objects, as they were out of my view as I entered I-95.

It is unmoving and at first I thought it was Saturn since that planet is supposed to be very close the next couple of days. Well, wrong part of the sky for that. I noticed it at about 6:45 and it is still very bright and unmoving in the sky. It surely must be a planet, like Venus, but I am not able to verify that yet. Whatever the case,it is very cool to look at and wonder...I can see why Venus is mistaken for a UFO so often now as I have NEVER seen a planet this bright before! Maybe it&#39;s a satellite?? I believe this would be in the western part of the sky, opposite to Orion constellation which is plainly visible also. It is well below and to the right of the moon and bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I drove south on highway 287, between Berthoud and Longmont, Colorado, I noticed a craft quite a distance ahead in the sky. It caught my eye because of its brilliance. Initially I thought it must be the sun reflecting off an airplne. However, though craft moved across the sky; unlike sun reflecting on an airplane, the nature of the brilliant light did not change. It then briefly appeared to glow even brighter and expand to a larger sphere and just disappeared. It never appeared in the sky (the entire sky before me)again.  I frequently observe aircraft which reflect the sun at this high altitude and the nature of the light reflected changes as the aircraft moves - this do not do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The distance and size of object was approximatly half of the aircraft(Boeing)-then it taking off and one mile away from ranway. Looks like, but am not sure for 100% there was an aura around the object. The speed of the ball was hard to tell exactly, but much slow then a small private plane. It was very very black, no shining or reflection. Someone else should saw the object, becouse it floated near by SFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a bright light low in the sky just above the tree line The light seemed to have a flashing red light as well. This really bright light seemed to hover and move around in the same area for 15 mins. I repeatedly looked at this light not believing my eyes. There was no explanation for this thing to be there as I often wake up during the night and look at the stars and usually see planes in the sky with flashing red lights going past but this thing was definately not a plane. I was pretty scared and hid under my doona for a while and had to check this thing out again so I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes to get a better look at this thing but the light was to bright. I then tried to go to sleep again but decided to have another look at this thing and this time there was another bright light high in the sky but appeared bigger than the one lower to the ground and never had a flashing red light and it was just hovering there in the one spot. I tried to go to sleep again but had to check it out again as I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing and this time they had both gone and there was just the usual distant stars in the sky. I live on a property 30kms from town and there is nothing to explain these lights it definately was not a reflection or a plane. I just hope it don&#39;t come back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was around 10:30 PM, I was sitting on my bed looking out the window.  My view is from the third floor facing South West over looking Fort Belvoir and Davis Airfield as well as Lorton and Newington.  The clouds had formed a layer at approximatley 2000 feet.  Below the cloud layer visability was good.  All of a sudden an area of the clouds became bright green and a glowing green fireball (for lack of a better term) decended to the ground from the clouds.  It seemed to come down in the area of the Fort Belvoir Proving Grounds between Backlick Road and Rolling Road. It had an aura or fog around it; a greenish haze. From my house to the area of the Proving Grounds is around 1.75 miles in a striaght line of sight.  The core of the fireball was about the size of a B-B at arms length. The whole affair with the fog / haze was about 1/4th of an inch at arms lenght. If it was a meterorite than someone should try to retrive it as it must be relativly large. It was not far away because the green glow in the cloud layer was a good referance point for distance.  It came down about 10 degrees off of perpendicular.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I were outside in the spa.  I spotted an object moving from the NE to the SW.  First appearance was at about 1030 (with 0900 being the east horizon, 1500 the west).  It was round and about as bright as the brightest star visible in the southeastern sky.  My wife saw it immediately, as I said something like &#34;meteor&#34; when I first saw it.  But it moved slower than a meteor and didn&#39;t disintegrate.  I followed it until it disappeared behind the roof of the house (I stood up to extend my viewing time).  Its highest point was just to the south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked my wife about what she saw.  How large?  About six times as large as the brightest star (which was the EXACT figure I had in mind).  Color?  Slightly orange (I agreed).  Nature of the light?  A bit diffuse, as though an intense light was shined on a cloud.  Agreement again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The track never varied.  There was no noise.  There was nothing visible around the light.  Its intensity never changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A satellite?  No, it was too late in the evening to see satellites, and the track would be quite unusual for it to be either a satellite or space debris.  A meteor?  Possibly, but given its speed, constancy and duration, unlikely.  It was definitely not an airplane (no sound, no flashing lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went upstairs to get a better look out of the window, where my partner and daughter joined me. By the time I looked out of the window there were another two or three that had joined them. They then all formed two groups and after a few minutes, one by one they disappeared. Seconds later three returned in a 45 degree angle, travelling upwards. Two more then joined this group and made some kind of triangular formation. The next thing to come into view was a very bright large circle, rising from behind the houses, which is when all of the circles gradually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m in agreement with you on,the wasted effort of reporting what I saw after all its not like they could do much about it.  I was very excited since this is my first sighting of an unidentified flying object.  It was on the 29th of dec. 2003 at 6:50 that saw this glowing almost round shape (at first it seemed like a very big and bright star) coming from the south west then just stoping and then moving slowly to the north then just sort of hovering  this lasted about a minute and a half then it just slowly went back to its south west position hovered some half minute or so and then zoomed off towards east at an amazing speed. I stared for another five minutes or so and then went inside trying to convince myself that I should call someone.  I went outside and stared at the sky again and saw what could only be ;  a) the same object that had returned to almost the same spot but much higher,or b) a different object that was near the same spot, and was either smaller or higher,  this time it did&#39;nt hover, it moved slowly, and then zoomed away to the south east. end of story. I know what I saw, and am 100% sure of what I saw.  Unless its some kind of manmade experimental object,that is out there well we both know what else it could be.

The object was first seen between tree branches on the lower edge of the horizon.  The object was blinking red and white and moving in an unfamiliar fashion.  Did not move like a plane or helicopter.  It hovered and flitted around in a zig-zag.  After a few minutes of this, the object shot straight up in the sky, and hovered there.  Then the color of the lights changed.  The lights initially were bliking at the back, once it started moving over my house, there were red and white lights blinking in a chasing light type fashion across the front of the object.  The oddest thing was, there was absolutely no noise whatsoever from this.  It was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be circling or revolving around each other, but the movement did not resemble any aircraft I had seen before. After about 3 or 4 seconds of this, one light went out, and the other moved rapidly away, then blinked out. About a second later, in the same part of the sky where the second light blinked out, a set of lights (one flashing white, one pulsing red, and one green) appeared; these lights appeared to be some sort of aircraft to me. The lights moved to the left, then to the right, and appeared to go out so I quickly went in the house and shut off the porch light to see better. When I came back outside, they were on again, and were travelling from east to west. I then figured this had to be an aircraft as that I often see a airplanes taking this route, so I went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanted to add that my front door faces east, and that I would estimate the lights to have been about 2 or 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made no noise whatsoever.  It was traveling west.  Then all the sudden 3 minutes later it shot up straight into the air at an incredible speed and vanished thru the clouds.  I live in a rural town.  I was the only one outside.  It was no more than 100&#39; feet the ground. I thought ufos were a hoax or some secret goverment craft.  But not anymore.  No one believes me when I tell them what I saw.  I thought about calling the Airforce base or the police but I was too scared too. I do not want to get involved with the authorities of the goverment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After laying there for about three minutes, I heard this sound, some type of aircraft zoom in over my neighborhood, hover overhead, then zoom away.  This was not a plane or a helicopter, I could distinctly tell the difference, and I knew that something else was outside floating above my neigborhood. It sounded as if it could have been a plane, but planes do not move like this. It did not last very long, but it was very loud. I thought I was the only one that heard it but after telling my husband about it this morning he said that he heard it to and he knew without a doubt that it had to be a UFO because of how it sounded. I did not get up to look outside because it honestly scares me. I know that there are other beings out there however after seeing the movie &#34;SIGNS&#34;, I would rather know whether these beings were peaceful before I get up to look one face to face.

Ok now when i saw the object before we pulled into the parking lot it was so close to us i actually got scared, and when i lost sight of it for that 6 sec till we got into the lot it must of flew 2 miles in 6 seconds to where it was when we saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking along the lake, going southbound on the walk right next to the lake, a few hundred feet before the buckingham fountain pathway.  From my perspective it looked as if it were hoovering over the shed aquerium and the observatory.  It moved VERY quickly and manuvered around as if it were a toy plane being flown.  The lights on the UFO seemed to blink like a normal plane but it was deffinitly not a plane.  There were broken up clouds across the sky, as if they were providing protection from being seen.  When i made it back into my appartment, on michigan ave., i noticed a plane, or jet going very fast across the sky, toward the lake.  At approxamently 11:15 A.M., December 29th 2003, there was a hellicopter that flew JUST over the buildings, which is VERY low and very unorthadox considering the terrorist threats.  I feel something in the air...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were moving upward, one behind the other and appeared to be going over the ridgeline. At that moment, she conveyed to me what she had witnessed and I ran outside. Oddly, when I got to the front porch, the lights were now horizontal, heading back across the center of the mountain well above a neighbors house. They appeared to be going through the trees. {The lights were always spaced about 30 ft. apart throughout the sighting}. I witnessed these lights for about 5 seconds and then they went out instantly. There are no roads or paths on this mountain and it is very steep. It would be impossible for any vehicle to travel over or across it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the western sky and saw an unusual tight cluster of lights moving across the sky to the south. I got my 8x35 binoculars and observed a large cluster of lights and with a smaller cluster to its rear. The rear cluster had a strobe light. Initially I thought it was a military aircraft with a chase plane. As the craft continued south my view of it changed and it appeared to be triangular shaped as the view continued to change it was three lights in a straight row. The craft was making a gentle turn to the southwest the view changed to what I assumed was looking at it from the rear and it appear as an arch of 4-5 white to yellow-white lights strobing from left to right. No sounds were heard and no other aircraft were in the area. We see many commercial flights overhead going to and from Europe and this did not fit any of their running lights. I used to be a crewman in Army helicopters and it did not match anything close to a helicopter.

I waited for some sound as it had to be going greater then the speed of sound at that altitude but no sound ever came, it was absolutely silent. About three minutes later I went back outside and a small light piston aircraft at about the same altitude was seen going from South East to North West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I first spotted the object about 10 degrees from the constellation Triangulum. I quickly moved to my eyepiece and tried to follow the object. It was difficult to make out any detail except for five gold colored lights, the rest of the object was unidentifiable. At first I thought it may have been a plane but there was no noise, no strobe or marker lights, and it was way too high up. If I had to give it a magnitude in comparison to the stars Id say about magnitude 3 or 4. The object dissappeared and reappeared 3 times until it finally disappeared about 25 degrees east of Polaris(North Star).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took the N.Y.State Thruway home. I was traveling alone. Somewhere between the Catskill and Coxsackie exits I saw a triangular-shaped object approaching from the north-west. It moved very slowly and hovered over the lane I was in. It had 3 red lights along it&#39;s points that did not flash. As it moved over my car I looked up through my windshield and saw the body of the craft. It was a matte gray. My windows were closed so I could not discern if there was sound or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A mile or two before this occured, I noticed a police car along along the left side of the Thruway. All traffic slowed down because of this. Once this object appeared, all cars accelerated to speeds of 80-85mph. I know others saw this and I want to find out if anyone else has reported a sighting on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a public school teacher in New York.&#34;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32150.html  While we were going home on a local road, I saw a stationary triangular object (black) over the trees. Interestingly this exactly matches the description of the person I quoted what I saw. It was triangular (perfect triangle), and had red lights along its points (did not blink). Thought it appeared black to me, probably because it was dark, however gray color that was reported would be close enough to my witness since it was daylight for the other person. I can bet 100% a gray object would appear black in the dark. Also this object did not make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This  requires me to sit on the floor.  From this position I am able to see up into the night sky without any effort.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an unusually bright light directly over the neighbors house.   (My neighbors house was brightly light up for the holiday season, so I found it partcularly strange that I could even see a star with so much light over there., but I sat down to read and forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4:00 a.m., a log I had loaded fell against the fireplace door and started leaking smoke into the house, so I got down on the floor to adjust the fire and once again the light caught my eye.    I remembered thinking &#34;That is a bright star.   I have lived here 13 years and never noticed a star there before, and is it that thing flashing&#34;.   So I grabbed a pair of binoculars and was astonished to see it was in deed flashing in a sequence of white, red, and green.   Its flashes were so definitive that they brightly light up the sky around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there on the floor in the dark and watched it for about 10 minutes and decided to call my husband at work and tell him about the weird thing that was over the neighbors house.   We joked about me signaling the aliens so if I disappeared he would know where I went and he told me to keep him posted.     After I hung up from talking to him I started looking around the sky to see if there was anything else &#34;strange&#34; out there I had never noticed before and I saw another similar object directly across the sky from the firsts one.    I am no good at distances, but I could say from one mountain top to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once again called my husband and noticed at that time the first light was very much lower in the sky and much closer to my neighbors house.    That really interested me so I sat there and watched it move until it disappeared behind the mountain.  I then took my attention back to the other object and it had gone behind the grove of pine trees and was no longer visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well you better believe I have checked the same spot every night since.  The object was there again on New Years Eve at roughly the same times and pretty much experienced the same series of events.  Have been watching every night since, but it has been cloudy here at night, so haven&#39;t seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights on the object Not sure if you could consider the colored flashes reflecting off the sky an auora or haze? Thought I may have caught something that looked like a red flare type thing shooting out of the second object on the first night, but wasn&#39;t directly looking at it with the binoculars so didn&#39;t mention it, but when I read the question thought I better mention it.   Couldn&#39;t swear to it though it was just like a short red line for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t known exactly what I saw come out of it, just something flare like and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light flashed white red green Actually there was a plane that flew under the second object shortly before it disappeared.   We are sorrounded by hills and pine trees so it is difficult to say exactly where the plane came from.<n>

On my trip back to Paducah after the holidays I was traveling west on West Kentucky Parkway around 9:00 - 10:00pm when I noticed a large red object directly in front of me (about 1/2 mile) and 1/2 mile up in the air. The red object also had a whitish halo around it. I did not notice any other vechiles around and no towers. The object stayed there for 20 seconds or so and dissappeared up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving at 70mph on the highway and did not see anything after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/27/03 20:05|Lucasville|OH|Unknown|1 hour|MUFON/OHIO REPORT: The unknown obj hovered in the vic of the Portsmouth Reg Airport for 90 min..|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35645.html|64|ndxe200312| Description: The unknown object hovered in the vicinity of the Portsmouth Regional Airport for an hour to an hour and a half.  It had blue, red, and white lights flashing at various times.  It was a mile to two miles high.  It made no noise.  It was not seen on the Tri-State Airport&#39;s radar in Huntington, WV. or Indianpolis Center radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow up investigation: Mr.A.(name on file for privancy reasons), states that on the evening of the sighting he was headed for his garage.  He looks up and spots the light.  He goes on into the garage and when he comes back out he looks again and sees the light is still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He first thought, it was a helicopter out near the atomic plant but then thought that it may be near the Portsmouth Regional Airport which is about 6 miles from his location.  He stated that this was in the east to southeastern skies. He began to think that a helicopter was flying towards him because he saw one large very bright light which is what a helicopter would look like if coming head on.  However, this object seemed to barely move if at all at times.  It seemed to hover in the same altitude of approx. 5-6 thousand feet up. To him it seemed there was blue and red with the white light somehow together, dimming and then getting brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. A. called on his family to come out and look at the light.  All memebers in the family were curious as to what it could be.  His son looked at it through a telelscope and said that he could not make out what it was because it was too large and bright when veiwed through magnification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. A. then called the Ohio Highway Patrol Post about 5 miles away.  The person he spoke to said there was a hill right oustide and they doubted they could see anything.  Mr. A. says he does not think they even looked because he did not hear back from them even tho he asked they let him know if they saw anything. They did not go to look while he was on the phone either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later he called the Portsmouth Regional Airport and spoke to the base operator.  He did not get any names from whom he spoke with.  He asked to be connected to the control tower stating that he was a pilot.  Not getting connected he then called the tower directly.  The tower operator told Mr. A. that they had nothing on radar of an unusual nature.  The tower operator asked Mr. A. if he saw a plane, to which Mr. A. said yes. This was to test to see if the radar was working properly.  That was all that was seen on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then Mr. A. looked in his airport directory book and called the Huntington Airport.  They also said nothing unusual was seen on their radar.  He also tried calling Indianpolis.  Nothing was found unusual on their radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time he was on the phone the light vanished. Mr. A. says that it had been in veiw for over an hour.  I asked Mr. A. if it could have been a star or planet? Mr.A. said that he is very familair with the stars and planets in that part of the sky and also that he watches planes coming from the airport all the time.  He was adamant that it was not a star or planet. He also says that he knew it was not a satelite or meteor because of the slow if at all movemment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comments: I commend Mr. A. on his determination to find out what the source of the light was! He sounded sincere in his story. He sounded puzzled by what he had saw and the family members did not know what it was.  They were just as puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has come our attention here at Ohio MUFON that over the past year several unidentified lights and objects have been reported in the near vicinity of Lucasville, Ohio.  Some of these locations are: Proctorville, Chesapeake, Rome, Wheelersburg and several from Portsmouth, Ohio.  We also have had reports from Huntington, WV.  In 2003 we had an upsure in sightings from these areas. This is a somewhat rural area with few reports in past years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filed 3/17/04 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Donnie Blessing and MUFON/Ohio for submitting this report.

It was a slightly illuminated brownish/orange, sphere shaped object that wasent going anywhere.It just hung there in mid air. Anyways I grabbed a set of binoculars that I carry with me in my truck and managed to focus on the object just as it started to move out towards the ocean and out of range. About 5 min later a streak of light shot across the sky coming from the direction the object went to and then disapeared into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They came back inside to take me with them in the car, thats how skared they were.  When I went outside they even saw it again (this being the third time) I did not see it, they said it was happening right by the moon.  The whole time we were in the car I kept looking for it, but I didn&#39;t see anything.

I followed it as we were driving and then I just didn&#39;t see it anymore. Didn&#39;t move or anything -- just disappeared. Then a bit down the road (about 1-1/2 minutes later) I saw what appeared to be a huge light, almost a very wide chemtrail just hovering in the sky and not moving. We were moving, of course, as we changed direction on the road, it shifted from one side of the sky to the other from our vantage point but the object never actually moved. I eventually didn&#39;t see it anymore.  It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen because I&#39;ve seem chemtrails and this didn&#39;t look like an ordinary one. By the way, the sky was very clear. In fact, I could see the crescent moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The white trail of smoke was similar to that from a jet plane but much wider. I got a very good look at it for about 20 minutes till it disappeared over the horizon. I have know idea how far away it was, but my first thought was how large it was and how long I was able to watch it slowly travel out of sight. I was very surprised I did not read or see anything on the news, particularly my local news outlets.

Thats when I realized the formation was to accureatly turning to be seperate units.

12/27/03 15:40|Carnesville|GA|Circle|3 minutes|20+ circular objects seen over Georgia|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34158.html|73|ndxe200312| 20+ circular objects seen over Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived home from a friends house with my two sons. I climbed on the trampoline and laid back to gaze at the clear blue sky. I saw many buzzards flying about but what caught my attention was a cluster of bright circular objects much higher in the sky than the birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were circling each other in a whirlwind/tower pattern. Each followed its own course, but they all were circling and, as I was to soon find out, going upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came out of the house to talk with us and I asked her to take a look at them. She watched them with me until they slowly vanished in the atmosphere. The objects at the top of the &#34;tower&#34; began to disappear first followed by those at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be bright white with a haze around them. I also noticed a refraction of some sort on the outside of that. Like bending light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wanted to shrug them off as birds and leave it at that. But my wife urged me to look closer and really observe them. It was then that I knew they could not be birds. They were circling much to fast and I&#39;ve never seen birds shaped like orbs that disappeared into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing we both noticed was that when they circled around on our side of the loop they were brighter and seemed to reflect the sun. When they were on the opposite side of the loop they were dull and faint. That would be the result of astetic distance because they were blued by the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several buzzards flew between us and the objects and it was even more obvious how high they were. Later, a jet flew by in the same area where the objects had been. The jet was very far away by the time it appeared to be the same size as the objects had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects obviously traveled upward and not horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We haven&#39;t seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was debating with myself as to what these objects were before I thought to retrieve the video camera. By then they had all vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could draw a picture of how they appeared and email it to you, if you&#39;d like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.  ((name deleted))<n>

Above it and to the upper left hand quadrant was a smaller one about the size of a nickle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object kind of floating with the wind which was moving from SW by W (I&#39;m A sailor and am very cognizant of wind direction and speed.) I commented that it looked like someone&#39;s balloon had gotten either loose or out of control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me think it was a balloon was the fact that it looked like a target, circular in shape with an orange center and a black perifory. This color combination changed from black out side to orange outside and as that happened the black moved to the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed I was looking at some sort of prismatic plastic balloon that changes colors as it changes angles to the light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then something happened that made me realize this was not a ballon at all, because it stopped and hovered for a bit then it began moving into what would have been the winds opposite direction. The smaller one did the same thing also. The two of them moved in a floating manner and there were no sudden or quick movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time both the man I was talking to began to realize we were looking at something entirely new to both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However about two minutes into this sighting the large circle went up on it&#39;s side turning the target like image on end. It was at this point we realized we were looking at a disc.  There was no dome it seemed to be a flat disc with only a small thickness in proportion to it&#39;s size.  After about a minute more in this position it again went circular and turned once more to the side   Now we saw a glittering flash indicating that we were looking at something metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flashed momentarily then went on it&#39;s side at this point the colored side would have been facing away from earth with the shiny side down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an instant when a blue green light best described as aquamarine in color emanated from the circular disk in a cone like manner,and completely around the disc, so much as we could discern form the angle we were looking at it. The light seemed to be widening as it shone down towads earth. This lasted for about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile the two objects still close enough to be observed without having to look from one to the other, the small one went up on edge and we lost sight of it never agan to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the larger one exhibithed the light phenomenon, we saw it return to it&#39;s original orange and black colors and still the colors seemed to bleed into one another and exchange places black inside orange outside and vice versa, kind of reminded us of a lava lamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time we noticed another course change the large one still it&#39;s approximate original size began to change directions and again going with the wind began to move out over the ocean. We watched it turn from circle to flat and back to circle. all the time this object was not hurrying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed that we were watching something totally new to us, then without so much as a change in course the orange and black circular disc facing us back on the beach and still at this time the size of a quarter just absolutely and completely disappeard before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to guess the height of the objects we were looking at,but since we had no way of knowing what size it was we couldn&#39;t accurately describe the height . There was no relative size to compare it with . However based on the size of one to the other and comparing the two we thought perhaps if one of the object s the larger one was at 3ooo feet the smaller one would have been perhaps 5ooo We could only guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that day was crystal clear not a cloud, or a mist or anykind of sight inhibiting thing that would have caused us an illusion of any sort.<n>

At first I thought it was a local helicopter, but then as I drove closer to it I realized it was not anything like a plane.  I stopped in the middle of the road to take a good glance at it. It was a triangle figure with three bright lights at each corner of it with a strobe effect red light in the middle.  It was going very fast but gliding very smoothly and it was relativley proportioned low in the sky for a flying device.  I freaked out and speed the half of a mile home.  My house is surronded by fields mind you...so when I got home I was really freaked out.  I started to get out of my car and I heard noises like someone/something was tapping my car and someone/something was dragging their feet on my driveway (which consists of rocks)  So I heard the noise of feet scraping against rocks.  I called my mother and woke her up and had her come open the side door and start to walk outside so whatever was making noises in my driveway would disappear.  I went into my house safley, and began to look out the window and saw the same triangle figure except it was going in the opposite direction than I origianlly saw it.   I then glanced outside a couple mintues later and saw another triangle figure with a blue light, and a couple mintues later another figure with a green light.  So i dont know if it was the same triangle figure and it changed it&#39;s middle light? Or if theyre were three triangle figures in the sky.  I was really freaked out by the situation and I still am.  I get scared driving down my street in the dark, I am afraid I will see it again.  And I am not so lucky that I live near fields...which it is rumoured that the UFO&#39;s like to land there.  It is not a plesant expierence to go through.  Im scared ((deleted)).<n>

After the witnesses from Sicamous, B.C. contacted me over what they had saw, I immediately started an investigation into the case. I called the Sicamous RCMP Detachment and requested to speak to the Constable who attended to the call. I was told by the dispatcher that he wasn&#39;t in that day and I left a message for him to call me back at my toll free number. I did talk briefly to the dispatcher who took the call that night from the excited witnesses. He did confirm a report was made and a RCMP Constable did go to the witnesses home to see what all the fuss was about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several days had past I received a telephone call from the RCMP officer who drove out to take a look at what the family was reporting. (the reason why there was a delay in the officer calling me back was due to him being off for a few days)  The police officer was pleasant to talk to and we had a nice discussion. He was very helpful in providing me with information on what he saw when he arrived at the location. He was directed to where the object was sitting in the sky. At this point the witnesses said to the officer that the object had moved slightly up higher in the sky and that they had taken video of it. The constable also told me that the witnesses said that it looked more like a diamond in shape when it was lower and orange lights had kept coming and going from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The RCMP constable said the witness did point out one orange colored light to him, which he admits to seeing, but he did say he did not see it move. On the large object which caught everyone&#39;s attention that night, I asked the officer if he would be able to describe this to me. He said it was stationary, blue and red lights with clear lighting, almost white light in the middle. The officer also said he did not know what it was. It could have been a number of things. The constable did look through the binoculars at the object and gave me the description of what he saw and whatever it was, was just sitting there. So the officer did see it but he cannot testify to it moving around as he did not see this happen while he was there for a short period of time. The member went back to the detachment to get a phone number for a UFO group who might want to look into the sighting and passed it along to the family. The family called a UFO group and left as message but no one returned their call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They kept searching on internet and found HBCCUFO ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another update will be coming shortly with the results of what was caught on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone in the local areas around Sicamous, Salmon Arm, Chase, Sorrento, Enderby and communities in-between have maybe noticed this object, or something else unusual in the skies would you please be kind enough to contact me with the information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

I was wrapping up my year end reports for 2003 when a telephone call came in on December 31, 2003.

Whilst making the report she felt that she wasn&#39;t being taken seriously ... and that maybe they thought her to be a little crazy.. however when an hour passed and the RCMP officer arrived in her yard it was a different story.

I asked the witness about how she was holding the camera, knowing that any slight movement while video taping can make &#34;something&#34; appear to move. In the footage it shows the object moving erratically around the sky. The other members of her family who stood watching this event unfold saw the very same thing with the naked eye..... something flying all around the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said these objects (plural as there are more than one at different times) ..... was also seen by her husband whilst he was up in the mountains which is around their area. He described one of the objects as being as big as a house and covered in lights. At the time, he was waiting for his daughter and her cousin to return with the snowmobile. He watched the object with his naked eye and estimated it to be approximately a mile away from his location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was so excited and frightened at what he saw whilst he waited... that he immediately drove back home, ran into the house and told his wife of his adventure. She thought he had been drinking as he was acting strange and obviously was very scared. Knowing they had to go back out to that location where the object was seen because they had to pick up the kids, the gentleman said he was not going back out there alone ! The husband&#39;s sighting took place before December 26, 2003, and what the family caught on tape on December 26, 2003 was the same object. It had returned. They also saw the object through their binoculars and described it as being in the shape of an acorn or a diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an extraordinary sighting because not only did the object shine brightly and move around erratically ... but at one point when it was stationary ... it shot out a large red fireball, then six bright orange lights appeared in the sky around it. Each of the orange lights had another two white lights on them. These white lights shot a beam of light towards the ground. Approximately half an hour later four more of the large acorn/diamond shaped objects showed up and sat either stationary or moved around the sky. The witnesses said the objects appeared to have hundreds of lights on each of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These folks have recently moved into this home, but the previous owners said they used to watch in the daylight hours ... on many occasions silver disk shaped objects flying over and around the mountains behind the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This case is under investigation and this is only raw data at present.

CHBC TV is a part of the Global TV network which is one of Canada&#39;s giants in the media business. The story ended up airing not just on that station, but aired all over British Columbia on Global BCTV. They ran the story at least three times as a part of their news. Once at 6:00 p.m. Friday night, again at 11:00 p.m. and again on the Saturday morning news.

For five minutes we paid no attention to this &#34;Planet&#34; however my peripheral was drawn to its increasing intensity once again. About the size of jupiter, this object burned a bright orangish red.  Using a fence post as a fixed object it seemed to be traveling  south west indirectly in our direction at a very slow pace It appeared to be growing even more in intensity.  Al the while my friend was retrieving a fresh battery for the camcorder.  As soon as the battery was placed into the camera the glow seemed to do a standing 180, and over a 15 sec period dimmed and as the camera was turned on it flashed 3 times in 3 second intervals, brightness decreasing each time and that was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both were orange in color and pretty much maintained the same distance from eachother.  A smaller blue object appeared to be moving away from them towards the western horizon. My son and I both observed them, and he went in to get the binoculars to get a better look. We watched for several minutes noting that they were moving across the sky but were a great distance from us. I went to get the video camera, and my son looked back outside, and they were gone.

Except this time the object looked a lot closer because it was a slighty bigger and brighter star like light. There was also a plane I could see in the same veiw when it happened this time. And instead of manuvering, the object  just flew straight down thousands of feet to the ground (past the treeline at least) at a rate of speed no jet or meteor could go. this looked to be more than 100 miles away so I wasnt so tempted to drive over to the possible landing area. But Im sure it was the same object I saw more than a year ago in the northeast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first skittering like a bug.  So I was curious, I watched for a few minutes and it was dancing all over tthe sky.  I went to get my camera and tried to take a picture with out much luck.  Then I got my video camera and started to shoot it.  It was a round circular light that was growing larger and smaller in diameter, it seemed to have some red and blue smaller lights spinning, althought this can&#39;t be seen as good on the video.  It was also exploding like a firework on the 4th of July many times.  This can be seen on the vidio.  I continued to tape the light it was shooting across the sky faster the a shooting star at times.  I had my zoom on it and it shot right out of the screen and back through it afew times really fast.  It exploded out of sight.  I went to get a new tape so I could try to get some more. It came back in sight. I shot some more without the zoom so I could get all of the movements.  I got some more but not as intense as the beginning. After awhile longer it vanished.  I was totally amazed I had called a friend to tell her.  It was really something!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not the star &#34;Sirius,&#34; which we suspect it may have been, we do not know what the object was.  PD))<n>

We were traveling north in Iowa from our homes, and were driving for about 55 minutes through some remote areas that I was familiar with.  Between the towns of Springbrook and Preston we noticed a strange light off to the left of our vehicle in a field. The light was an odd blue oval shape. The light appeared to have no source, and looked transparent. The light also seemed to have a smoky quality, but there was no smoke moving. I noticed a small red light flash near the road (which was much closer to the car than the blue light). We also saw identical lights in and around the blue light. The red lights were very dimm, except for the one next to the road. We circled around a 3 times and it was in the same place and we saw the same red lights. We then drove back to our and discussed the matter, and concluded there was no reasonable explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were going down the stret outside my grandparents house, and as we went down the street we could see a strong light in front of us.  I asked my grandmother what it couldd be, she said it could be an aircraft. But, I saw it just disappear. It then came back, about 100 feet above where it was before. It then proceeded to make one zig zag maneauvre, and just flickered away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember thinking it looked like one of the train cars that transports chemicals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the truck and followed it for a few minutes. It then released a puff of smoke from the center of itself and vanished.We noticed a military plane fly right through the puff of smoke it had left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like that before.

We stopped our vehicle as it appeared that a crash was near.  The &#34;plane&#34; suddenly made a right angle turn and stopped.  What we could see was the &#34;edge&#34; of a &#34;saucer&#34;. It was diagonal in the sky...top, left side higher than the right lower side.  It was easily seen in a sky that was almost completely without clouds.  It was about as bright as a plane&#39;s vapor trail on a clear day.  The object slowly changed its position, but never lost the &#34;brightness&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw another &#34;plane&#34; do the exact same apparent plunge to the earth and make the exact same turn and the 2 &#34;disc edges&#34; remained in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since they were just sitting in the sky, we drove the few miles left to our hostess&#39; house and told them all to go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 of us who observed this event, jumped into the car again and drove until we could see this phenomenon again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured on December 26, 2003 around 3 pm EST.

Then the bright light at the end of the contrail just hung in the sky in the same position for a while, them shifted degree angles.  AT times it was extremely bright, then it would fade.

Huntington officer Chip Olinger was warming up his car the afternoon of December 26th, when he reported seeing a circular object in the sky. He radioed officers Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover, who saw it too. Olinger says it wasn&#39;t like a 1950&#39;s type flying saucer. He says it was big, but didn&#39;t have a hump in the middle. The three policemen say the object drifted toward a church steeple, then shot away without a sound. Officer Hoover says they didn&#39;t mention it before, because they were worried people would think they were crazy. Now, the officers are wondering if anyone else saw the circular object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I saw 4 objects in the sky directly over Watertown NY below the level of the clouds (background blue sky). I was wearing sunglasses, and could see them clearly while I looked through my glasses, when I looked without them they became alomost impossible to see. The sun was reflecting off of them, and one was distinctly &#34;V&#34; shaped. They were metallic, as they reflected the orange glow of the sun. They appeared stationary at first, but as I stood there, I saw they were moving south. One by one they seemed to &#34;wink out&#34; Before the last one winked out, I saw a large, slow-moving &#34;white streak&#34; approach it, as it flew past it, the &#34;v&#34; shaped object winked out. I watched this long white streak move very slowly across the sky, it left no kind of vapor trail at all. I watched it for several minutes before my view of it was obscured by buildings. Again, you could only really see it with sunglasses on. When I removed my glasses, it simply blended in with the sky. It did not appear to be an airplane, it was far too long in shape, and it left no vapor trail. Neither did the 4 other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

My backyard faces East and there were no surrounding lights so the stars were very bright white and  ltblue, appearing to twinkel.As I was admirring, a different color caught my eye, coming from the East, a very large orange light was flying in the same manner as a plane but only a mass of orange light could be seen, keeping my eye on this orange light I called for my son. When he came out to witness it he thought it looked triagular in shape.Because it was so late and cold it was also very quite, and this thing had no noise before or after it passed over. By then my son(16)had told his cousin(17)to come take a look, at this point I was facing south on my tip toes watching this object still glowing orange as if to be flames, and suddenly a &#34;a smaller mass or ball of orange light or flame&#34; popped or broke off from the larger one and slowly decinergrated into air as the larger one was desending and very slowly appeared to dim and then it faded out or we lost sight? we were in total awe, waiting to here a sonic boom or see an explosion but nothing. I have seen questionable things in the sky before but this time I had two witnesses. I felt driven to share this after finding this web sight today for the first time.I&#39;m curious if someone in the same area saw what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a few seconds later  we saw the same light seperated into  3 lights again and turned  red and yellow adn orange and green so fast like a blink.. then we started to follow it  but it just kept on doing the same thing.. i don&#39;t think it was any kind of an airplane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw this bright white light coming toward my house.  I stared at it for what seemed like a long time and the light was move closer but extremely slowly.  I though I could see a pointy light at the top but realized it was my eyes tearing up do the cold weather.  Then  I started to listen for a noise but had not heard any.  The object was getting closer to my house and I started to get a little nervus.  I called in to my friend and asked him to join me and see if he could figure out what this was.  I also wanted to make sure that I was not seeing things.  He joined me out side and we continued to watch this light move closer.  we still could not hear anything so he grab his camera with the telephoto lense and pointed at the light seeing if he could get a better view.  At that time the light went out.  I said &#34;Where did it go&#34;. He replied it still there but its turning, It looks like a giant wing.&#34;  as it passed near the house we still could not hear anything no noise like a jet or copter.  as it made it way over the mountain we could see the light come back on and it moved out slowly.  After words we talked about and though it might be a B2 but I had a B2 fly over the house earlier that summer on its way to and airshow and said that even that made a noise.  To this day I still dont know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It hovers and stops for thirty seconds or more at the top then descends back down towards the horizon then ascends again and again. There is only one light/object, it&#39;s movement is not like a satalite, plane or ultralite craft. It appears to be at an altitude where the wind can affect it as it looks to be pushed around by winds, ground winds presently around 10- 15 mph gusts, 31 degrees f.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a celestial body.

Also, I checked the report database, and the things I&#39;ve been seeing seem similar to the April 2002 report from W. Liberty, KY.  I&#39;ve seen 3 to 7 of these &#34;things,&#34; which seem to have red and green lights.  Tonight there were 4 that seemed farther away (higher), and the three closest seemed to &#34;take turns&#34; with flashing patterns of their lights.  When I first saw these back in August, I stayed outside (it as 2 - 3 a.m.) for a LONG time watching, and what seemed to be the largest and brightest at one point descended to about streetlight level, at the top of the hill from my back yard about 60 yards away.  (I high-tailed it into the house at that point!)  I&#39;ve seen them multiple times since, but not as clearly nor as many as tonight, when again there are 7, spread out in an oval pattern.  I was so relieved to have my daughter here so I could point this out to her, and say, &#34;See!  I&#39;m NOT crazy!&#34;  She agreed that she saw them.  (Her theory is &#34;terrorists.&#34;)  We are located about 50 miles W/NW of Ft. Knox.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just come outside with my dog Bippy she really like the snow.  I was about to throw a snowball out to Bippy when a big green fireball with sparks stopped me in mid-throw.  It was desending at about a 45 degree angl in the northern sky it seems to just go out right before it would have not been visible to me do treeline.  At first I thought a meteor then i thought fireworks but i know it wasn&#39;t fireworks i&#39;ve never seen a meteor but i have seen shooting stars and it absolutely wasn&#39;t that.  It traveled slow and was very vivid with no sound. It did look like it could have been a flare from a flare gun but don&#39;t flares leave a big trail of smoke behind?  This had no trail only white sparks and the fireball was very green like a green intersection light.  It seemed to be farely low in the sky to my location like i could have got in my car and found it with in a few miles.  I wouldn&#39;t be so curious if it wasn&#39;t for all the very similer reports I&#39;ve been reading on this site.  I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll hear that other people saw this too.  I do remember right after the fireball went out a plane or something high in the sky moving what seemed to me to be very fast for a plane but not unGodly fast across the sky heading in the exact direction where the fireball when out but was very far away to the point where when I notice it seconds after the fireball went out I had turned completely around and was now looking south southwest the fireball was north northeast from me.  All i could really see of that was the typical light on it just like on a plane.  It just seemed to be moving faster then any plane i&#39;ve ever seen in that area. mind you i&#39;ve always been a night sky gazer and at the time was in the backyard of where i live and have lived for the past three years.  Never seen anything like that ever or even heard of anything like that before that.  Thats why i was surprised to see so many similiar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced that this is a serious-minded report.  PD))<n>
12/25/03 20:42|Indianapolis|IN|Other|4 - 6 minutes|Gathering of six objects with pulsating red and white lights, no sound, broke into 2 groups of 3 traveling in different directions.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34142.html|97|ndxe200312| Gathering of six objects with pulsating red and white lights, no sound, broke into 2 groups of 3 traveling in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a gathering of 6 red and white pulsating objects that were in a loose formation when I first observed them. There were two outer red lights with a white light in the center of each of the objects. The formation then broke into 2 groups of 3. 3 moved to the west, the other 3 moved to the southeast. From our vantage point from a second story apartment balcony, I would estimate that the objects were approximately (at first) 15 -20 miles to the northwest at an altitude of approx. 5 - 10 thousand feet. The objects appeared to travel at a steady pace; somewhat faster than would an airliner. The westward moving objects went out of visual range within about 3 minutes. The three ojbects moving to the southeast passed just to the west of the apartment complex. It also seemed that two of the objects passing over the area where we were were gaining altitude, while the third remained at consistent level. There was no sound that could be heard from the objects. As they were passing above us, I pointed out a high flying airliner to my friend, to compare the difference of the airliner&#39;s running lights as compared to the objects. The original formation&#39;s exact location would most likely have been about 2 -3 miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis.One interesting point is that while I was in route to the apartment complex, I noticed airliners coming in to the airport on their regular flight paths with what looked to me to be extremely - almost excessive - displays of brilliant &#34;collision&#34; lights. They were so bright that when I spotted the first one, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was actually seeing an in-coming aircraft or a brilliant UFO. This would have been about 30 minutes prior to the sighting of the formation from the balcony. On my way home, at about 9 PM, I couldn&#39;t help but noticed that all large in-coming aircraft to Indianapolis International were displaying the same &#34;excessive&#34; brilliance as the ones that I had seen about an hour before. This causes me to wonder if what we saw from the ! balcony was only the final minutes of an episode that had gone on in the skies above the city for some time. I have seeen UFO&#39;s before this incident, and would like to think of myself as a seasoned &#34;sky watcher&#34;. I have become familiar with aircraft standard night time appearnces and proceedures   in the area. From the points mentioned in the above despription, I would have to say that there was nothing &#34;standard&#34; regarding the brilliance of the aircraft or the appearance, movement, and formation of the unknown objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live by a small lake, trout lake, it&#39;s not an isolated area, it is actually situated beside some busy roads.  I was sitting in my garage waiting for my car to warm up.  In the distance, above the horizon/buildings, a very bright white light appeared, the bright white light seemed to be rising very very slowly, or maybe it was moving forward north, towards my area.  This light looked like a really really big star, or a helicopter search light, or a car headlight in the sky.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter at first, then it was apparent that it was travelling north.  as the object was above the small lake, i could now see the underside of the craft and I am positive that It was triangular in appearance, black/stealth in colour.  the lights that i remember seeing are red/greens, there might have been blue.  at this point, the craft had been travelling in a straight line, but after it had passed the lake and was almost straight above me, it veered left (east) and I am positive that a regular passenger plane would not act in this manner.  I chased the object a few blocks and the triangular nature was evident still.  the object was now hidden behind trees and i gave up the chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw it directly above some power lines from our viewpoint (the power lines were approx 30 feet away) and it appeared to be slightly bigger than than a #2 pencil point. Strangely enough, it was not a clear night, it was definently cloudy and although it was pitch black out, you could still make out the UFO&#39;s black sphere against the sky. The sphere had one large round, orange light, like a spotlight almost. It was very bright. It was stationary when I first saw it, and then started moving quickly in irregular patterns. It moved unlike anything I&#39;d ever seen before. After what seemed like an hour (although it was in reality only 5 minutes), it dissapeared in a zoom like manner. The only way I can describe how it &#39;zoomed away&#39; is it kind of looked a little bit like the Starship enterprise &#39;zoom&#39; in Star Trek (except without the bright flash). This was absolutely not a satellite, nor any plane that I know of. My entire family witnessed this event and I assure you, there was no special Christmass eggnog involved. I&#39;d be more than happy to draw this UFO or make a computer graphic of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it (the brightest object) was an airplane.  Then I saw another (less bright) object near it and thought they were two airplanes flying in a pattern.  The brighter object, however, did not move as far as I could tell.  I called my wife to look and she thought it was some kind of light tower but it was too high in the sky for that conclusion to make any sense.  I kept thinking, &#34;this has to be a plane,&#34; because it was near a small airport where private props and small jets land and take off.  The brightest object remained stationary for about 5 to 7 minutes while the second object seemed to go back and forth toward the brighter object.  Then I noticed a third object, less bright than the other two objects, on the other side of the  brightest object.  It too seemed to move back and forth toward the brightest object.  Finall, the object with the brightest lights seemed to veer off and the other two followed it.  Some details:  the brightest object seemed to have a long rowof lights either as headlights or side lights;  i looked at the objects with binoculars but could not make out and form;  at one point i became afraid because the  brightest like did not move as i expected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to 2003, which we believe is what the witness intended.

The witness (driver) who called is a ex military man (air defense). The first thing the witness asked, did HBCC UFO receive any reports from around 1:00 p.m. today. I told the fellow that I had not received any other than his call. He was sure that two other vehicles had observed the same object he and his passengers witnessed as the two vehicles in front of him braked the same time he did. He also mentioned that if he had of been by himself he may not have reported seeing this strange object over Airdrie. The two passengers who had an early Christmas at another home received a pair of binoculars as a gift, which I packed away with other gifts in a bag in the vehicle. The witnesses had just come out of their home and were driving down 8th Street heading south. Approximately two minutes the driver said to the passengers, what the heck it that? Approximately one kilometer away from their location they all saw what looked like a large round ball or chrome colored marble as he described it sitting stationary in the sky above a colored shack which is on the opposite side of Big Springs Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the witnesses were very excited, or in his words, freaking out as to what they were seeing. The driver told one of the passengers to grab his new binoculars so they might get a better look at this strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the binoculars were located in the bag filled with gifts they zoomed in on the object. The driver slowed the vehicle down so the ones holding the binoculars could get a better view of it. The sphere did not move, it sat hovering in the one location. From when they first noticed it, they said the whole event may have lasted for approximately 15 or 20 seconds before it disappeared. It &#34;did not shoot off&#34; in any direction. It just vanished !! (blinked out) The driver who said he had worked in air defense for many years and was very familiar with what is flying in our skies, said he has never seen anything like this in his life. Also the witnesses roughly estimated the object may have been hovering at an altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The driver later on that day ended up driving back to the shack where the object was seen hovering above. He parked his vehicle and got out and had a good look around just in case he might have been able to see it again, or to see if there may have been any physical evidence left around this area. After a short while on location he told me that he felt rather uneasy and got back into his vehicle and left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they witnesses had watched this unusual object they picked up the Airdrie Echo newspaper and spotted a new articles on a few sightings which were recently reported to the newspaper.

We were still climbing to our cruise altitude (33,000 feet), at what I estimate to be 350 m.p.h.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere had a very subtle hi-tech texture (i.e., plates, relief, and radii) vaguely resembling the Death Star from Star Wars. The UFO seemed to be static on the air, and due to our high speed -and its relative small size- we passed it at a distance of about a 100 yards in just a second, though it was long enough for me to realize that what I was looking at shouldn&#39;t be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately checked with other passengers, and many saw something weird passing us too: but none wanted to go deeper into the subject. I believe I was the only one looking intently through the window before the sighting ocurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She called me out to say that she was seeing balls of light in the sky.  This was located north of Wenatchee.  We are in south Wenatchee.  They were shooting up off of what looked like Birch Mountain. It began with 9, but 2 of the orbs or balls of orange/red light disappeared immediately, the other 7 seemed to rise up in the air, the color never changing or dimming in any way.  At firt they  flew into a triangle formation, then went to a straight line.  These lights did not blink or flicker ever.  They spread out without moving it seemed, but moved to the east little.  Then one by one they disappeared.  Just like a light had turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was rising and moving toward us. we all got out of the truck and i said &#34;UFO!...oh no its a helicopter.&#34;...the closer it got the more it didnt look like a helicopter.  It passed right over my head about 50 feet in the air, it was soo low.It had a bright spot light on the front but it was like inside of the craft...it had 3 white lights under it in a triangle.  The craft was black and it had red blinking lights on the back and some on the side.  The sound it made was nothing like i ever heard, it was going slow about 25 mph.  i could even tell that it was slowing down and going lower.  it went over the trees in the woods were i no longer could see it. my friends did not beleive in aliens before that night, but we know what we saw.  we were freaking out talk when i said &#34;shhh!!! yal still here it&#34;..the sound was getting louder.  it came back from the far left of the woods going up.  we just watched it as is slowly got went over the trees. About 2 minutes after we seen it we smelled a burning smell.  we knew no one would just start a fire a 3 a.m. we would have smelled it before.  we thought the craft had a purpose for going back there so the next day we went back there...i cant talk about what we found yet cause i dont know the whole story and what is really going on...but its crazy....beleive in aliens they exsist!!!!!<n>

This is at least the third time we have seen this.  I tried to set up my telescope to see it better and by the time I got it my my viewfinder it disappeared.  But, I did see what I thought was a triangle shape in my viewfinder of the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had 1 dim light on the front and it was green.  They sat in the sky for about approx. 3 minutes. They lowered at around 2 minutes but did not touch the ground and they moved really fast while they did this. I think i heard a noise coming from the objects but i did not know if it was from the objects or from a distance. they were not too far away from us. One object did start to glow red then they disappeared. I think it might have been a signal to leave. it was snowing alot but we know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Our view from this room is unhindered by either trees or fences and we have a clear view for several miles. My husband was looking out of the window, sat bolt upright in bed and said &#34;something&#39;s going down over there&#34;. When I looked I couldn&#39;t see anything but he was adamant that he had seen a red ball going down through the air. Then he said &#34;look, there&#39;s another one!&#34;. As I looked out, I saw a glowing red light rising UP. It rose slowly and then just went out, It didn&#39;t fizzle, there was no cloud cover...it just stopped being there. Our window was open, and there was no noise that we could hear associated with this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I suspect that this was something going through re-entry, but I do not understand how the pieces moved away from the main unit at a 90 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving what we thought was unusually slow for a plane.It was moving in a northwestern direction, more north, then it appeared to stop in mid-air for about 5 seconds then it changed directions and headed in a western direction, in the direction of the Los Angeles international airport.  But it started gaining altitude rapidly as it was getting lighter and lighter.  Then at 7:28 it suddenly started falling out of the sky toward the ground in a straight line down.  The light was flickering on and off as if an engine was struggling to turn on.  But the light didnt flicker in a pattern.  I lost sight of it falling but I continued to follow it in the direction it was falling and it reappeard still falling and flickering.  I would describe the flickering as if someone was turning on a light off and on rapidly and sporadically.  I contacted the FAA emergency line but they werent helpfull at all. I contacted 4 MAJOR Los Angeles tv news stations and they werent helpful either. I also called Edwards Air Force Base and they gave me the number for the UFO center and told me they couldnt help me anymore.  I dont know how radar could not have tracked this thing because there were other planes around everywhere and it fell out of the sky to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She observed a reddish streak of light at high altitude passing overhead in an easterly direction. It did not seem to be moving rapidly. She observed it awhile and when it seemed to fall downward in a rapid rate toward the cabinet mountain range she called out to me to come see something strange. I was upstairs on my computer and after she called me a second time I came to look. By the time I looked whatever was causing this effect had apparently fallen on the Montana side of the cabinet mountains and left the appearance of a very tight funnel at its base, very red near the bottom, that reached up to the upper atmosphere. My wife was never able to discern any object, such as an airplane, as this whatever steaked across the sky. As soon as I saw the funnel or plume I got my camera and began taking digital photos. The first exposure was at 7:15:17am and the last was at 7:26:30. I took 50 exposures. I had to leave for work after the last exposure and my wife said that by 9am the sky was totally clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at some of what we believe are the photos described above, and our impression is that the object probably is a typical contrail.  Sandpoint is not far from a major east-west corridor for commercial aircraft heading to Chicago.  PD))<n>

Her comment was &#34; now will you believe me&#34; i watched for 15 + minutes until it decended completely to the ground with a slight visual on it. i went in to talk w/her about this and returned within 3 minutes or so. just in time to observe it rising slowly and traveling tree line towards the rim. too many things have  been happening here for no one or nothing to be said. i know what i saw and it seem like the same thing that i saw very close up a few years ago.  i know how other people feel when they want to tell someone, but you know society.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got a chance to see this object that was boommerang shaped, the lights or glow was only lit about the same as the night stars. It was moving North to South very quickly, it faded out once again and I tracked it across the sky to where it might end with its speed and it faded back into view just before I lost it over a well lit area.

It just went black. It didn&#39;t appear to have crashed into the ground as it went black above the horizon. It could have just disappeared in the clouds, but the clouds didn&#39;t seem to be that thick to me.

One was about a dark-colored form changing parachute-like (not the round kind but the more oblong or oval ones) and the other a brownish jelly-fish like one that appeared to be &#34;swimming&#34;.  The one I saw, I at first thought to be a orangish brown tarp or plastic sheet or trash bag that had been blown up into the wind and was just blowing along while slowing undulating or changing shape as though made of a very light material.  And it very steadily traveled in its general direction, from north to south over the Isthmus/Willy St. area. (Unfortunately I did not think to check if it was actually going with the prevailing wind - though I do remember there being only a light wind that day.) It did not radically change shapes or take on any definite common shapes, but just stayed generally oblong (like the &#34;parachute&#34; story). The sky was clear and it was a around sunset so the object was fairly well lit.  However I had hard time focusing on it.  Sound-wise I heard nothing from it and the neighborhood was quiet.  It was about the size of my fingernail at arms length.  Moved right to left about a fist width every second or two.  I watched it for about ten seconds then it became obscured behind tree branches so I walked down the block about 40 ft to a clear view.

I was listening to the radio and a loud interference occured (the same as if a mobile is about to ring,exept louder) i was looking forward at the van in front when a very small bubble like object floated across my view from right to left, it had green and red flashing light effects over the surface and floated over a small fence until i could no longer see it, as this took place the radio had two more interferences and didn&#39;t happen again for the rest of my journey.  I was very confused and unsure of what i had seen, the two things happening together made it very sureal.<n>

At first I thought it was like a &#34;balloon&#34; much, much larger than a child&#39;s balloon compared to the size of cloud and how I visually saw object. I am sorry I could not give approximate height since I am not knowlegable about estimating such! As I continued to observe object it descended in a zig-zag, stair-step fashion down to the west across front of cloud right to the very center and middle of the puka hole in the cloud holding steady. It did not appear like the marijuana eradication black helicopters here...was not long shape and did not have rotors, just black and round. Seemed to high up in the sky and clouds to be a helicopter really.  Then in just a few seconds time it zipped down from the puka-hole and off to the west past the cloud and completely disappeared and no longer visible in the cloud or sky. This was rather startling as I expected to still be able to see it, whereas, it did a fast vanishing motion. I kept watch on the cloud and sky looking for it. Then totally unexpectedly it did reappear again from the east portion of the cloud, gradually coming out of the cloud and then fading back into the cloud. This left me with a rather disturbing feeling. I know the viewing time was 4 minutes long as I timed it on my stopwatch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

I looked up at the stars to see what was available to my telescope.  While looking at Orions belt which was straight up I noticed a Grey object flying fast. It was not a blurring speed. It was about the size of my thumb at an arms length. There were no lights and no sound. It moved from right to left over my house and out of view.  I tried to make the shape out but couldn&#39;t because it was so dark and it moved pretty fast. I tried to determine what it could have been. I came to no conclusion. All I know is I got an erie feeling as I watched it cruise on by.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I start to look down again I do a double take and they&#39;re still there. I see these gray circle shaped objects moving across the sky from south west to north east approximately. They were completely silent from my perspective. They seemed maybe three times the diameter of Jupitor but not as bright. I&#39;m not sure but they seemed to be in rows of 6-9 across moving in a column. Their speed was about the speed of a passenger jet comming in for a landing at Dulles Airport. I happen to live under flight path to and from Dulles. These craft, or whatever they were, seemed to follow that flight path. I have no idea what their altitude was. If I were to guess I would say maybe seven or eight thousand feet. I can&#39;t be sure though. To give you some idea of what it looked like to me, the first impression I had was that of a planetarium moving the lights across the sky. Eccept the circles positions relative to each other were not stationary. They sort of floated very slightly in relation to each other as they moved across the sky. I can&#39;t say how many because the column was there when I looked up. From what I saw it could have been anywhere for 15-1500.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

I could not see anything defined and they looked as if they were 100-200 yards off my back deck (which is about 100 yards above the lake) and a couple of hundred yards above the lake (Soda Bay). They would continue to circle each other (approximately 40 yards apart) in a diametrical fashion (opposite each other). After approximately 15 minutes, one of the sphere&#39;s would start to advance closer to the other one (while still circling) until it met up with it. At that point, it appeared to join the other light and continue to make the same circle as one light. After approximately 10-15 minutes, one of the lights started to move away from the other one until it was opposite again. They would circle each other in this fashion for approximately 15 minutes and repeat this same process again. The whole incident lasted for over an hour. It should be noted that there was absolutely no sound during this observation and no indication they were search lights (no trail lights to the ground).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of advertising lights, circling one another.

El objeto era de forma ovalada, pero con dos alas en la parte trasera, almenos a mi me parecieron alas. En seguida cojí los prismáticos para mirarlo y apreciar su forma con mayor detalle, ¡y no sólo aprecié su forma, si no la manera de moverse!. El objeto en cuestión se desplazaba en linea recta sin variar su altura, ni su posición, pero mientras realizaba este movimiento de traslación, realizaba un movimiento de rotación sobre su centro. Este movimiento de rotación, por llamarlo de algún modo, consistía en que el objeto, realizaba giros y sacudidas, de 20º aproximadamente en el eje perpendicular al eje imaginario que marcaba su movimiento de traslación. A las 17:30 llegarón mis padres a casa y les indiqué el objeto en el cielo, lo observaron, pero no consiguieron apreciarlo tan bien como yo con mis prismáticos. También lo vió mi abuela, que le pareció o dió la sensación de ver un avión de forma extraña como callendo en picado, pero,... esto es lo mas interesante y curioso, el objeto no caía aunque daba la impresión de que sí lo hacía. No se explicarlo bien... No se si hera un efecto óptico, o qué, pero la cuestión es que es lo ma s extraño que he visto en mi vida. A eso de las 17:35 perdí de vista el objeto en la zona de detrás de mi casa, que da a una montaña. Otra cosa a tener en cuenta, es que había un helicóptero de tráfico en la cercanía y a decir verdad, estoy seguro de que los pilotos observaron el objeto.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object stayed in the air for about 45 seconds, it got bright and then dimmed a little, then it got as bright as the sun and dimmed again but this time in got smaller and smaller until it vanished.  this also happened again around Edwards air force base, but this time all of us noticed about five to ten jet fighters were flying around, the fighter were crisscrossing the sky like they were looking or chasing something. Soon we got in to the mountains and it was over cast so we lost sight of the fighter jets.

I immediately was silent and quickly tried to discern what kind of astronomical event had just occured.  I then turned to my two friends (one of whom is an experienced sky jumper and has done jumps at night) and asked if they saw the &#34;meteor or whatever that was&#34;. When they both broke their silence and said they had saw it as well, we all knew that it was no meteor, considering how close it was, its appearance, and its relatively slow speed.  We all had watched a meteor shower on the beach before.  None of us could come up with a legitimate explanation for the object and we were all a little freaked out.

Just to note they formed a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Description is not inconsistent with a &#34;sighting&#34; of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, we believe.  PD))<n>

It was a off white colored boomerang shaped object passing slowly, directly overhead at about 200 to 300 feet. The color seemed more of a emission of light rather than the color of the object. It was having an effect on the air in front of it as it moved, creating a wake which was visible. Directly behind it was either high heat emissions or it had the capability to mask itself as being transparent, (which is how it seemed to me), because the sky behind it was translucent, except for the leading edge, (thus the boomerang shape).  There was no change in the air around me as far as static charge and no sound. The object continued on ESE at the same rate of speed until I could no longer view it. It was as if it was a hologram barley materializing in the air.<n>
12/20/03 17:53|Chelsea (Pontiac) (Canada)|QC|Triangle|about 2 minutes|Sighting in Chelsea, triangular craft with very bright light in middle and smaller lights, no sound, very fast.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34023.html|158|ndxe200312| Sighting in Chelsea, triangular craft with very bright light in middle and smaller lights, no sound, very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, how to start... It was 17:50, and it was in Chelsea, a small town of the Pontiac region, right beside the Ottawa region, on the other side of the Outaouais River, in Québec. The precise location was above the clean separation of the &#34;Basses-Terres du Saint-Laurent&#34; and the &#34;Bouclier Canadien&#34; (I apologize, I don&#39;t know the english version of these geographical regions). I was on my way to work, it was my mother who was driving, when we noticed what we thought was an extremely bright star. We kept on discussing as we watched the star dissapate slowly and by then, we could clearly see three a triangular form. The best way to describe it would be, if you take a perfect triangle, and draw three lines from every corner of the triangle to the center, those three lines would define the shape of the object seen in the dark skies. When it shone brightly, we could see nothing out of the ordinary, it really looked like a simple bright star. But then, once the light had faded, not only could we clearly see the form, but we can notice a total of about 6 lights that stayed on the shape. One at every corner, and one in the middle of all three lines. I remember, we rolled down the window, and we could hear no sound emanating from the craft. Knowing that there are mountains near, we only had about 2 minutes to gaze at it until it flew out of sight, past the mountains. We were all amazed at that time, but then, when my mother and I came back from work, I was looking at the stars again, hoping to see my UFO once more, and then, one of the bright stars faded again, and the form could clearly be seen once again. I was simply amazed. This time though, the craft was flying in the opposite direction and was heading, well, seemed to be heading for Hull, a town next to Ottawa, on the other side of the River. I was flying lower than before and much faster, it was about 23:33. The 6 lights were also less visible and once the brightness had faded, it was very difficul to follow its trajectory. Our hypothesis wa! s that it was (and I must specify that this was my mother&#39;s idea) that maybe it was a plane that forgot to take off its &#34;brights&#34; as it took off. But after a short debate, and my explanation that planes do not have &#34;brights&#34; in front, like a car, she changed her opinion to mine, that is that it was a UFO. But I still think it could&#39;ve been a space shuttle. The line that was vertical could be the vertical wing on a space shuttle and the two other lines could be the wings, with the lights as any flying craft would have. And the brightness could&#39;ve came from the gigantic reservoirs of fuel that ignite and propulse the shuttle up into the atmosphere. The only thing wrong with this is that there are no space shuttle launching pad around, and not for miles and miles around. Also, the chance of seeing the same shape twice, and so low in the air would make out to be quite a waste of time and a very weird space shuttle trajectory. Might I also add that very few planes ever do fly above this town, and one last detail: the craft was not moving vertically nor was it very high in the sky, nor was it loud. Silent. Silent, and moving horizontally and extremely fast. I can only come to the exhaustive conclusion that it was and remains a UFO, that is and Unidentified Flying Object. Might I also add that it would not be the first time that there are sightings in this town. Personally, this is my second sighting here, and I know other people that have seen just as much.<n>

It was a round type of craft with two rows of what appeared to be oberservation windows quite wide in the front of the craft. The were fully lighted and the craft appeared to be just floating along. We pulled over and observed as it went over head. It made no sound as it was only a mile or so over head. The lights wrapped around theright side of the craft. We could not see anyone , but felt we were being watched. I am wondering if anyone else reported any sightings around that area. It was quite large, we couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Anyways I thought it was kind of funny how the hair was standing on my arm but I went ahaed and put my jacket on got out of the car and went inside for a minute. As Iw as in the house I heard something outside and went to the kitchen window and looked out towards the back yard and saw some light. I was thinking it was a flashlight or something like that and went outside and then it happened...My hairs started standing up on my arms again as I was walking around the backside of the house I just happened to look up and seen a circular object lightly illuminated hovering about 50 ft to 75 ft in the air over the house. It was glowing from a blue to white haze. I had no sound at all. The sound I heard before I went to look was like someone coughing outside or something. It sat there and hovered for about ten minutes and then slowly started moving from side to side for about 3 minutes, then just like BAM it shot off to the north and and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

E ele fazia esse zig-zag em direÃ§ao a uma usina siderurgica que a nessa cidade de ipatinga-Minas Gerais e me dava a impressao que ele estava evitando ficar mais que 1 segundo em territorio da usina siderurgica e depois do zig-zag lateral e seguia por cima de uma estrada municipal e me dava acreditar que esse aparelho em altissima velocidade lateral tiva fotograf! ias, E seguiu da mesma forma atÃ© sumir de vista, fiquei tao impresionado com o ocorrido que nem chamei os colegas pelo radio para ver, tambem foi tao rapido que nao dava tempo deles sairem dos seus postos de trabalho e correrem para fora e conferirem o fato, depois que fiquei olhando aquela bola de luz com mais ou menos 2 ou 3 metros de diametros desaparecer e eu apreciando cada segundo ai sim chamei todos pelo radio e divulguei o ocorrido e todos acreditaram em mim e alguns dos meus colegas ja tinha visto algo inesplicavel, mas esse Ã© o meu primeiro relato mas nao o meu primeiro avistamento, desde crianÃ§a tenho visto luses no ceu azul se movimentando em altissima velocidade de um ponto A ao ponto B ou desaparece como se fosse um raio. E desde que atingi a maioridade tem coisas extranhas me acontecendo, tenho precentimentos com muitas coisa por exemplo: advinhar que um dos pneus de minha motocicleta ia furar, uma vez sonhei que um amigo e colega de trabalho tinha tido um! acidente e quando cheguei no trabalho ele me contou que teve ! o acidad e mas tava tudo bem e so estava enfaichado tal como no meu sonho, outro exemplo: poucos minutos antes de ter um acidente comigo proprio eu o precenti antes alguns minutos, se alguem que eu conheÃ§a tem uma doenÃ§a ou sofrimento eu sinto primeiro em forma de uma fadiga depois uma depressao e depois vem na minha mente o ocorrido, as vezes mais forte as vezes mais fracos e as vezes simplismente nao os tenho, e eu sou uma pessoa muito agitada vivo tentando me controlar, por causa dos precentimentos eu ja ate me consultei com um padre catolico e pastor evangelico, o padre me disse que nao tem explicaÃ§ao para as minha premuniÃ§oes e que nao tinha mao de Deus nisso, e jÃ¡ o pastor evangelico disse que isso acontece com 1 a cada 1000000 e que Ã© Deus que esta me indicando o que devo fazer.

I felt compelled to look behind me; there was no one on the trail, but I looked up because my eye was caught by what I thought was a plane, but it didn&#39;t have the body of a plane.   It was at about 20 to 25,000 ft altitude.   The sun shone on it and there was a silver, metallic flash on the body.  I watched it gliding and in seconds it vanished into thin air, completely evaporated.  The sighting was of too short duration to determine the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I had seen an unidentified object.  I continued walking.

I stepped outside onto the patio facing south. I looked up thinking to myself that the stars were so bright and pretty. I also remarked allowed to myself &#34;Well Lord, the stars are still in the sky&#34;. At that moment I saw what I thought at first to be a falling star. However, what at first appeared to be a star, was extremely bright bluish white. It appeared to be coming directly at me very fast, then turned east while at the same time coming closer. Then, all of a sudden the &#39;star&#39; grew in size, appearing like an irregular oval-shaped rock, still bright, but appearing to be sort of &#39;bumping&#39; going slightly up an down, slightly losing speed, toppling/rolling over, and leaving behind a bluish white trail (similar to a chem trail). Then the object disappeared instantaneously. I stood there trying to memorize exactly what I saw. My first analysis was that it was probably a meteor/asteroid? I also expected to hear something about a meteor thumping into some farmers field. Nothing. So thought I would report what I observed, hoping perhaps that someone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While most of my classmates were leaving, a few of us sat down and waited for our parents to catch us up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The others were talking, I just listend to them and layed back on the ground.  The sky was very clear that night. I remember myself wondering why everyone else could ignore this beautiful nightsky. It was very dark, almost no lights around us.  Suddenly I recognized a very bright star.  I&#39;ve been interested in Astrophysics since I&#39;m alive.  So I know for a 100 % that this light didn&#39;t came from a sattelite, or something else epxplainable.  This light hasn&#39;t moved at all and didn&#39;t make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it started to shine brighter than before.  I still hasn&#39;t moved. I focused even more on it.  Then this one bright light splitted into 3 smaller lights.  They weren&#39;t as bright as before, but I could easily see them taking positions.  In about 20 seconds they&#39;ve reached their positions and I saw a triangle. I can&#39;t tell if it was a big triangle object, or 3 small ones.  There wasn&#39;t any sound in the sky.  They/It immediately started to fly away very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tough it&#39;s been a while, I remember this and other encounters at it was yesterday.<n>

Then smaller lights witnessed moving erratically around larger light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of December 18, 2003 I saw a bright flashing light in the southeastern sky. The light was a very brilliant white, with an aparent magnitude of -5, that seemed to strobe about twice a second. After strobing for about eight seconds the light dimmed to amber color, with an aparent magnitude of -2.9. The amber object had a bit of haze around it. Then the amber object appeared to move eastward. I then saw a much smaller light that seemed to move around in an eccentric patttern beneath the first object. The smaller object proceeded to drop earthward and faded from view about halfway to the horizon. As the larger, amber object continued to move eastward, another small amber light appeared beneath the larger one and moved about much like the first smaller light. The large amber object continued to move slowly eastward for a minute or two and then appeared to fade out. The incident occured within my sight for at least five minutes. I observed the phenomenon with the aid of binoculars as well. There are currently some photos of the lights seen over Eureka, Ca., taken by another observer, posted on the website of a local radio station -- www.((URL deleted--photo removed from website)).com.

Out of the darkness it just appeared in the sky. Thought at first it was a falling star, but quickly realized it was large like the full moon. A bluish/white ball with long tail of the same color, but the tail and around the sides and back of the ball looked like a glow and streams of light shooting out from it. A look of irridescene in color and appeared to be &#39;coming in&#39; almost at a straight angle. Off in the distance I could see some farm houses and as the object got close to what appeared to be a small ridge and farm lands, it just disappeared from view. It was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away when it just vanished. I thought that maybe it was some type of bomb, waiting for the big explosion.  But there was nothing, no sounds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husbands view:  My wife said, &#34;look!&#34;  I looked over.  It looked like a blue ball and was something like a giant ball from a roman candle.  I thought this because it was blue behind it. Huge (like the moon) blue ball looked like 20 ft. to 30 ft. off the ground when it disappeared, just like nothing was there.  I was waiting for an explosion.  It looked like it was around 300 yards away in an open field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed the stars were out (it was cloudy earlier) and very visible- Among them I could clearly see a spherical shape- not just a starlike point of light, maybe at most three times bigger than the stars around it- softly glowing a honey color. It was almost at the zenith, but just in front of us. It seemed to hover, but it was moving amongst the constellations, so that ruled out it being a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 or so minutes (it felt like a very long time) during which the object had drifted off to the side (I watched it) the road became more winding and trees obscured my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wearing glasses, so my vision was 20/20. My roommate was driving, so she couldn&#39;t have seen it (looked up).<n>

Object was ablating as it fell and 2 or 3 large pieces were seen breaking off of the main object. The fireball burned out approximately 30 to 40 degrees from the horizon. No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very similar in appearance to green fireball I observed on 11/5/03 though it was a lighter green and the sky was lighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expect there will be several reports since this fell during rush hour traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The largest planes that leave or come to this area are &#39;hopper&#39; planes, which holds maybe 25-30 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:30 tonight my husband and I heard a loud noise which brought us running outside.  Unfortunately, our eyes were not adjusted to the dark so we could not see the body of the object, which seemed to be cigar shaped.  It was just over our house when we got outside and was very low to the ground, maybe 200 feet in the air.  There were two lights (reg. airplane sized) one above the other slightly tilted with the upper light being forward in the direction it was moving.  It turned very slowly so that the lights were eventually horizontal to one another.  It was much too large to be a helicopter.  I would say the size was about that of a large passenger plane.  However, it did not sound like a passenger plane nor could one fly this slowly.  I had enough time to run into the house get the binoculars, turn off all of the lights and still watched it for another 10 minutes.  It seemed to hover over the mountain for about 5 of those minutes.  There was another small white light near it while it was hovering, and I thought it to be a small airplane.  (but now wish I&#39;d given more thought to it while watching) It then seemed to land, but it may have just gone over the mountain and out of my line of view.  My husband is a mechanical engineer and has studied and understands aircraft, he had no idea what this was....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, the radio signal was reduced to an annoying &#34;buzzing/humming&#34; noise.  I tried cranking the dial up and down on both AM and FM but to no avail.  While I was trying to acquire a signal, I began hearing a &#34;whirring&#34; noise in the ambient background.  Unable to find a radio station after several minutes, I gave up and turned my radio off--strangely enough, the digital numbers on my clock still worked and the minutes seemed to pass in a normal time-frame.  Once I had turned the radio off, the &#34;whirring&#34; sound became more prevelant.  As soon as I consciously thought about the &#34;whirring&#34; sound, I suffered migraine-like pain in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lay there massaging my temples I suddenly felt a sensation of absolute and total primal fear.  I wish I could describe it better but essentially, the part of my brain that warned my ancestors that they were about to be eaten by a saber-toothed cat fired off at full strength!  I knew that if I moved or turned on my lamp that something &#34;bad&#34; was going to happen to me--I&#39;ve never been that afraid in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe three minutes after the migraine ensued, I heard high-performance (military) turbines speeding through the sky at what I estimate to be less than 1,000 feet ASL.  As soon as the jets - I distinctly heard two aircraft - came over the town, the noise, the feeling of dread and the pain ceased immediately.  For the next few minutes, I heard the jets perform a hard climb and then all was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am new to the area I live in and I don&#39;t know my neighbors, so I was reluctant to ask strangers about any experiences they may have had that night.  I am a University student, a security expert, and an aircraft enthusiast.  In general, I am fairly skeptical about UFO phenomenon and extra-terrestrials.  I hope this report serves to further your cause in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not know what the witness may have heard, or experienced.  PD))<n>

Well, I was at my boyfriends (it was 10:30pm) and I went over to his neighbors house to ask if he&#39;d watch the stars with me and he came right out and we sat on his steps.  I pointed at the object that I was watching move earlier and said see that star right there? tell me if you see anything strange.  It wasn&#39;t 1 minute later that he stated he definately saw this star moving around like I had.  I took the binoculars to have a better look and I noticed a hexigon formation of these stars right above our heads (high up but close enough to see fairly clearly) and although they looked like bright stars, they were moving around too.  It was clearly a formation of objects perfectly spaced from eachother in a hexigon pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

At first I told them it was probably a jet headed toward us so we were seeing all the colors. As the colors flash, it appears to change shape to a diamond or triangular shaped light. But the &#34;star&#34; started darting about, going up several degrees at one time, then holding, then zigging to left or right. We started calling out these directional changes to one another, as well as colors, to verify we all were seeing it right. This was in the southeastern sky, but well above horizon in mid sky. After about 15 minutes, the &#34;star&#34; became stationary, and we went inside. I just checked, and it&#39;s still outside in more northern position, but did not move much while we observed it this time. The color changes have died down. Nothing else happened. It just seemed like too much movement and light color changes to be a regular star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What looked like a large ball of fire (10x the size of largest nearby star), pulsating from red to orange, danced like a firefly 34-40 degrees above the NE horizon for 2-3 minutes.  Then the object stopped flashing red-orange, turned solid reddish-orange and remained somewhat stationary for another maybe 2 minutes, during which time much smaller (small-star-sized) red-orange object(s) appeared from within and below the large fiery object and proceeded to approach the horizon, forming a completely vertical dotted line of small fiery lights extending from the larger object.  As the line of smaller lights proceeded towards the horizon, the distance between the smaller fiery lights and the larger original object grew greater until the smaller objects were within a couple of degrees from the horizon and then disappeared one by one.  The large fireball remained stationary for about another minute after the smaller ones disappeared, then it began flashing red-orange and started dancing again, still in the same location.  Then the light dimmed and the object danced off to the north, remaining 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  It traveled in this manner for 45 seconds or so, through a distance of air space that usually takes a satellite 3-4 times longer to pass through, and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is strange. I went outside to say goodbye to my dauther-in-law and as I was coming back inside the house, I looked up to check the sky again and I saw another unusual looking sight. OK. Now this one was really strange. There was no sound, and I could acutally see a structure. There were 2 or 3 lights off to the right of the object that looked as if they were part of the thing, but  what held my attention was that the largest part of the object was shaped like a rectangle and was covered with white lights in 4 rows of 5 or 6 lights. This thing seemed to float rather than fly as it slowly crossed the sky. I know this sounds like a case of over imagination since I just reported another sighting, but if UFO data is to do us any good I guess we just have to report what we see to the best of our ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At best some one would describe it as a bright star or a commercial plane coming towards you.  There is considerable aircraft traffic where I live and usally you can see objects such as these that turn out to be planes.  Here&#39;s the problem the object never moved or a least seem to stay in the same place for a least 45 mins.  When I first saw the object it seem to have a solid white light to it.  As the time pass by the color seem to change to an orange red, but still keeping it&#39;s intensity.  I would have to say it was 20 to 25 feet above my visual horizon, but keep in mind the light was some distance away from me.  Towards the end the object seem to get lower and eventually went below my visual horizon.  One more thing, the light seem to move from side to side.  But it could have been my eyes playing a trick on me...  Did anybody else see this???<n>

As we were speaking on the phone, I spotted the lights she was telling me about. There were 2 white lights with a smaller red one in the middle. The white lights remained on during the entire sighting but the red one would strobe occasionally at a fairly fast rate. It hovered behind the trees at a distance for a couple minutes, then rose to a greater height and flew off in a westerly direction at a fairly moderate rate. There was no sound and we could not see an actual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They vanished and then 1 re-appeared west of the first location, but at the same height.  After 1 or 2 seconds it vanished.  I did not observe them after that, but there were as many as 10 military jets flying over the area for up to 1 hour afterwards, just flying back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have had an interest in UFO&#39;s for a long time and may have seen others before, as a result I ALWAYS carry binoculars 10/40 in my car. I quickly pulled them out,As I focused on them I realized they were NOT birds but some kind of small flying wings, gray colored against dark gray clouds. they were flying with great precision and never banked but remained perfectly horizontal while at the same time changing postions quickly and sort of rhythmically. They would change positions fly for a second,change positions fly for a second or 2 and change again.They would stay very close together the whole time and the formation was not perfect like geese fly. But kind of an arc at times almost as if they were playing with each other as thy flew. I watched untill they were gone, They were going North to South right over downtown area, just east of flight path of san jose airport.I think of myself as kind of a macho guy,I dont scare easily. but when I could not rationalize what I saw I found myself left with a creepy helpless feeling that these things are just flying were ever they want and no one is stopping them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11:00 p.m. to make it there on time. Just as a habit I looked up to the night sky to gaze at the stars. Off in the distance toward the west and moving east/north east I spotted what I thought was a very low flying plane. As I continued to watch the object some things began to occur to me. On the out skirts of my home town there is a TXU Nuclear Power Plant about 5 miles out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t often see low flying anything because of it. As the object came closer I noticed 3 very dim lights on it. On the left was a green light and on the right was a red light. In the middle, slightly higher was another red light but it was noticeably smaller than the two on either side of it. I know that all planes have lights that display these colors but these lights weren&#39;t blinking that were on constantly and did not flash once. I was still thinking that this might be a plane but there was no sound and with how low it was flying anything moving or flying through the air would have some sort of engine noise but this thing was perfectly silent and steadily moving ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not until the object passed over head did I see the true shape of it and it was a perfect triangle and looked mostly black or a dark grey. I jumped in my truck and tried to follow the flying triangle but lost sight of it behind nearby houses and trees as I made my way to the road. By the time I reached the road it was hardly visible and disappeared into the night sky. I estimate the size to be about that of a private jet or small commercial carrier and the speed at about 50 mph and the height that it was flying between 120-130 feet. I don&#39;t know or assume the object had anything to do with the nuclear power plant but I think they may have some sort of radar that could have possibly detected the object.

12/16/03 22:00|Valencia|CA|Circle|40 seconds|Both my wife and I saw a flying saucer craft directly over our back yard at an altitude of no higher than 75 feet. It was above us for|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33866.html|204|ndxe200312| Both my wife and I saw a flying saucer craft directly over our back yard at an altitude of no higher than 75 feet. It was above us for about 40 seconds with no sound and seemed to hover/glide on the spot. We clearly saw design characteristics.Metallic highly shiny body, no visible linkage between metallic components, about 100 feet in diameter, portholes in the middle of what appeared to be an upper level or dome and bottom the porthole were all around the craft except for the front (on direction of forward movement.) There was a window that was angled inwards about 45 degrees in the front (forward direction). The window appeared to be in the under side of the craft. We could see orange/bluish light coming from the inside but did not see any occupants. The window was about 4-5 feet in height and probably about 10-12 feet in length. The craft had small ski like devices on either side (lower) of the frontal window but they seemed to be like docking devices like the shape of an S but the top of the S facing forward. Underneath craft were rectangular (2) long shapes that covered the diameter of the craft and in the middle section of the bottom side. The rectangular shapes were part of the body but protruded in rectangular shape. No insignias, just solid metallic body. I kept saying what a beautiful craft and my wife kept saying oh my god the whole time.The craft made no noise whatsoever. It seemed to levitate but with that slight side to side movement.At the time of sighting, I was cleaning my swimming pool a round 10:00 PM. The is a residential area (Santa Clarita Valley) where 10:00 PM is like 3:00 AM. I spotted the craft coming towards the house in a southwest direction and instantly knew that was not a normal shaped craft. I ran some 12 steps to the family room and called my family but only my wife ran out. As she did, the craft was right on top of us, motionless except for the slight gliding from side to side. It stood there about 40 seconds. It faced downwards and that is when I saw the window. I also could determine that swimming pool lights were not causing reflection on top side and that in effect it was highly reflective. After that it kept moving in the same direction at 40-50 MPH and began to disappear between homes. I jumped on top of a block wall and saw it continue (between homes) for at least 4-5 miles and then I could not see it.I told my wife not to discuss it but to draw what she saw as I did. I had more details but we agreed that we saw the same things.While we were seeing it, I made sure there was no helicopter suspending this craft.We called the local sheriff&#39;s office and they said they had no reports. The craft had to cross the Interstate 5 freeway to head towards my home and at the altitude which means someone had to see it on the freeway.There was a sighting filmed in Mexico City near some high rise buildings. What we saw resembled that very much. Please keep me posted. Since the experience I have read everything there is to read on the subject. I am confident the government knows more. This object was a solid craft and definitely not powered by anything man-made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date for the sighting.

We were driving north on Highway 180 west from Silver City, New Mexico which is 35 miles from Cliff.  Out of the southwest we became aware of a large orange light a small an hour or so above the horizon.  Our first thought was why was Mars so big and so orange.  Then the light faded slightly as a second light appeared on the left of the first, then in the same manner four additional lights appeared each fading to black after the first, then it was gone.  We notice 2 or 3 airplane lights in the same region.  We continued driving and approximately 6 minutes went by and we say one orange light again.  Again we observed what appeared to be aircraft lights.  As we approached our home, once again we saw the orange light - only 2 actually because we were then engulfed in trees.  Then one mile further, which was the driveway to our home, we saw the light entirely surrouded by a large amount of blinking lights which one would assume were planes.  But they came on suddenly at the same time and were twinkling lights, not like your usual planes.  There were at least 20 at the same time and I think many more because of the twinkling effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never in my life made a report of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/16/03 17:50|Wendover|UT|Light|5 seconds|Beautiful, gold hovering lights.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33904.html|208|ndxe200312| Beautiful, gold hovering lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon pulling into the parking lot of the Peppermill casino in Wendover, Nevada I happened to be looking out the window of my truck, drivers side.  Hovering directly above the Wendover airport was a gorgeous gold light.  I could not tell the shape due to the brightness.  It reminded me of a golden firework...I said to my girlfriend in the passenger seat, &#34;Look at that&#34;!!, but by the time she looked it had disappeared.  The light seemed to vanish from the bottom to the top.  The Wendover airport is tiny, so I don&#39;t know if anyone there saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving Wendover the following evening (December 17) lo and behold, at the 33 Milepost marker, 33 miles east of Wendover, at 1833 hours, I was talking to my girlfriend about how beautiful the gold light had been the night before.  At that exact second, she screamed, &#34;Look!!  Look&#34;!!  And, out of the passenger window, just south of I-80, were three beautiful gold lights!!  I mean, what are the chances of that happening?  They appeared to be quite low in the sky, and they seemed to be in formation, with the closest one being the lowest (maybe 500 feet high?) and the next farthest one a little higher, and the farthest a little higher still.  They were the exact same color of lights that the one over the Wendover airport was.  Bright gold, with a little orange tint.  Then, while we were viewing those, they went out one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both cases, none of the lights were moving, they were stationary.  They were a gorgeous sight, especially the one over the airport, which was the closest to us I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Wendover airport is located directly on the Utah/Nevada state line, although it just barely be in Utah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a graduate degree in management.  My girlfriend has a graduate degree in social work.  We were not under the influence of any drug/alcohol.  The weather was perfectly clear, the temp was in the 20&#39;s for both sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was front passenger.  Glanced right and saw a red and a green blinking light seperated by and just below a greenish haze.  At first I thought an aircraft due to colored lights, and assumed green haze was a lit tail, as on commercial planes.  Planes around here often fly low.  However, after a minute I looked again and it seemed as if it had not moved.  Looking harder, I was sure it was stationary and maybe a tower.  Called wifes and sons attn. to lights.  Lights invisible from wifes angle.  Son confirmed lights stationary.  Asked wife to make a right, to check if lack of movement was only perspective.  1 block later we reaquired lights in sight and my 7 year old son yells &#34;it&#39;s a circle!, Dad, I&#39;m scared&#34;.  I&#39;m saying to myself, &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; when I see 4 cream colored lights in a semi-circle on bottom.  I rolled down the window and said again &#34;what the hell is that thing!?&#34; aloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just Then (!) the thing (I estimate an altitude of less than 300 feet) shoots approx. 1/2 mile east in less than .5 seconds, stops for maybe 2 sec&#39;s, then shoots away up and east at 45 degree angle and is gone, just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day wife&#39;s co-worker mentions he and 4 friends who live in condo&#39;s directly below sighting were outside smoking, and saw Exactly what we did at the Exact time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> wife kept our sighting to herself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In the photograph it is white, roughly oval in shape with some shading visible, against the blue sky. He had seen it before and so was occasionally watching for it when he did see it again, ran uptairs to get his 35 mm camera, and managed to get a decent picture. On the 4x6 picture the object is about 1/8 inch long, 1/16 inch wide. It may be a disk at an angle so I will try to get more detail from amplifying the pic. I was working overseas at the time and have just this week come home and am filing this report for him. He said it was stationary until it disappeared when clouds passed in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I cant be the only person to have seen it My email  tardo03@hotmail.com  I was walking out to my truck to head to work. I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11pm to make it there on time.

The way this thing changed colors is like a horizontal hold on a TV, and when the horizontal line passed down horizontally, it would change colors. This vehicle, from arms length, looked like a dull pencil tip. At the time I saw this event, I noticed a deer, in my side yard, go into a full sprint AFTER I saw the intense white light. After this, I tried to forget about what had happend, but I could not forget, so I closed my eyes. The instant I closed my eyes, my right sholder blade muscle starting twiching rapidly. I thought the rapid twiching would just go away, but it did not. This went on for approximately 10 seconds. I became worried for some reason, so I widely opened my eyes, and the instant I did, the rapid twiching just stopped, as quickly as it had started; it just stopped!  FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS  At the time I saw the first sight of the vehicle, I was laying on my bed, facing the west, looking up diagnally, when my eyes locked on to this vehicle I noticed the first change in colors and at the same time it was hovering. The sky was clear, windy, and at night 4:30 AM. I noticed this vehicle decending in an S like pattern; continuing to decend in the S-like patteren until it just disappeared over the canyon&#39;s horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me explain this intense white light. This additional event took place at 5:45 AM after i saw the vehicle do its thing in the sky. I could not sleep knowing what I had just experienced. I mean you try and go to sleep after you see this outragious thing in the sky, but sleep was not possible at the time. So I just lay there hoping to be abducted, just so I would know what it would be like. Just for the experience, and then this is what happend. Lying there in hope I would see more then just this unidentifiable flying object in the sky,  with my eyes half-open, because I was a little sleepy given the time. This ultra-white, intense bright light, covered my side yard and totaly brightened the yard. I could see the grass, the trees, the bark on the trees, from where I was looking from, (my west bedroom window). After this event happend, the rapid twiching took place. Later I had a headache and felt dizzy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was enormous in size, huge white/blue/green color  ball at what appeared to be the front, w/a white tail behind....kind of looked like this  &lt;   ) i don&#39;t know the length of time it was in the sky before we saw it, but we saw it for about 2 seconds, shooting straight horizontal towards the west, extremely fast. It disappeared so quickly, wouldn&#39;t say disintegrated because it was so big. To have dinintegrated, we would have probably seen it break down a lot more than just disappearing. It looked really close as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend said his dad told him that sometimes satellites that fall into the atmosphere burn up, &amp; people confuse them w/ufos...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was out in the country, very dark, and as I was looking at constellations I turned around to the west and I saw a bright light bigger than a star and going horizontally and then vertically like when people make the sign of the cross and it continued to do that until I went into the house. There was an aura or a haze around it. The next day I heard on the television as I was walking thru the house that a UFO sighting was made in Lake _________, California.

It was in the west part of the sky at around 19:00. Thought it must have been a planet or something to be so big and bright. It didn&#39;t move any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few minutes later I saw a dim star directly above me that was moving. Nothing special but one constant light(like a star) moving across the sky from south to north. Not a plane because it had no strobes. Looked like a star moving at about the speed a plane would move at except it looked to be at an extreme altitute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when I was leaving at 21:30 I looked and both of the earlier ones were gone. I happened to look around again and saw something odd in the east part of the sky. Another big star except this one looked like it was rotating and the light was changing color. It did not move but it was flashing from white to blue to green and to red. It looked like a star that was going super nova or something because of all the colors. I also noticed about 5 planes in the sky, 2 of which were heading directly at it. Then as I drove home I kept looking for it then when I got home it looked like it had moved farther east because it was smaller but still flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can&#39;t say any of it was a UFO for sure. Could of been something with the atmosphere or increased light pulution as I got to my house. Either way it was cool to watch and not something normal. There were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked into the kitchen for a snack, and when I looked out the window there was this object. It was substancially far away. At first I thought it was a star or a plane because there was a plane flying close to it. I told my friend Josh about what I saw. We had both had previous UFO experiences and had done our reading on the subject. The object started out white then vacillated, blue, then red, than white again. It was spherical at first but as it moved in a small up and down motion the shape became unclear. It moved up and down, then left and right but not far enough for the manuverability of a plane. It seeme to get a bit closer. I had been talking with Josh and watching it at the same time for about five minutes before I got a strong uneasy feeling. I looked around then back at the object. After a few seconds the feeling subsided. About eight minutes later the feeling came back but stronger. It was strong enough to make me gasp out loud. I felt like it was watching me. It seemed to come a bit closer before it flickered a few times then dissapeared. The anxious feeling subsided then. The object was about the size of a pin head but got to about the size of a pea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it appeared to be holding still, after 5-10 minutes, it moved very fast in a northerly direction, and, then moved from one point to another, slowly, then very fast again.  At this time, it is still moving about in the same portion of the sky.  This same object has been seen for over a two months period (from September to December 12, 2003, by two of the witnesses that is presently making this report.  We called the Coast Guard, the weather station and  finally the UFO hotline to report what we have been seeing for the last 4 months and were told it &#34;must have been a star&#34; and, we just thought it moved.  The object we are now seeing in the western sky, appears to be the same as what we have been seeing, only then it was it the south-east portion of the sky, and moving about just as it is this pm in the western portion of sky.  I looked for it for the last two nights and could not see it.  We then saw the same object in the Western sky, as stated on this report.  We do not &#34;do drugs&#34; and have not had anything to drink (yet) and of a clear mind and of average to upper average intelligence.We have NEVER seen anything like this before and we are certain, without a shadow of doubt as to the accuracy of our statement.  The object appears to have bluish green lights underneath or across it and they appear to be flashing.  In my observing this object from September to December 12, 2003, I would spend two to three hours just watching it move about.  Two of the witnesses are practicing attorneys and were apprehensive in even attempting to report our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that Venus is in the western sky at the time indicated by the witness.

They were motionless for several minutes and I could not take my eyes off of them.Then they moved northward, confirming my thoughts that what I was viewing were not stars. I ran into the house to get my mother to come out and look. She witnessed them moving off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happen to notice a daytime half moon, next to the moon i happen to spot 3 star very close to the moon, i though it was mar and venus or jupiter or saturn. as i keep looking at the star i notice they were moving alway from each other seem strange, so i kept my vision on it and saw the light(look like star at night time) moving alway from each other, while 3 more try flying close to the two. I thought they were bird or ballon, but they were too high up the sky to be bird or ballon i could see a glow around the object they move real fast and slow down to a halt. i still couldn&#39;t figure out what it is, when they move behind the cloud i can&#39;t see them, i know it up there then one of the object took a 90 degree turn and flew so fast that modern plane cannot do this kind of thing. the way it flew in the sky is unbelieviable. NASA or any country that have flying capablity cannot do what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was more or less round in shape and glowing. It was very bright one second yet vanished into total darkness the next. It was fairly large, perhaps about half the size that a full moon appears when seen with the naked eye. The shade of blue was a light greenish blue or pale aqua color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no noise from them, and they were flying at approximately 250ft. I watched them until they flew out of sight over my house. The light was soft - fuzzy and pale yellow. I am not given to flights of fancy, but I like to keep an open mind on things. Oh, and if it matters, they were coming from the south, heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it landed we could not see the light any longer. We live near Travis AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/13/03 16:25|Fitchburg|MA|Cylinder|2 minutes|Bright Rod shaped craft seen shortly after sunset,; North Central Massachusetts; 10 to 1 length to width.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33786.html|247|ndxe200312| Bright Rod shaped craft seen shortly after sunset,; North Central Massachusetts; 10 to 1 length to width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the sunset today from my kitchen table. After the sun had fully set, I remained at the table, watching the small TV in the kitchen. At 16:25, something caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked back out the window and about one fists width above the horizon and a little left of where the sun had set, there was a very bright line in the sky, about the length of my thumbnail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first though it was a contrail, but it seemed too straigth and even, to the naked eye. I used a pair of small birdwatching binoculars to get a better look and discovered that this likely was not a contrail. The front and back where completely flat and the length of the object was extremely straight. It was an absolutely perfect, highly elongated rectangle. After drawing it out to the shape I saw, I come up with a length to width ratio of about 10 to 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to keep still by placing my elbow on the table and using one of the window edges (it&#39;s a three window bay window) and the siloette of a leafless tree across the way, in order to determine if there was any movement. For the first minute or so I observed the object through the binoculars, it sisn&#39;t move at all. Then, over the next thirty seconds or so, it slowly moved about it&#39;s own length to the right, then stopped moving again. I aboserved it for another 30 seconds, then it just suddenly hanished. No fading, no perception of it zipping away, it just was gone in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a sky watcher and we have frequent airliner traffic over the area, with plains coming and going from Logan airport. I know what contrails look like and landing lights, etc... This bright object was absolutely straight and of uniform width and the  ends were completely flat. The four corners of the elongated rectangular shape were perfect 90 degree angles. The perception was that this was something  far way and very large. I categorize the shape as cylinder, but it was impossible to determine the shape of the object&#39;s third dimension from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I could tell, the object was perfectly parrallel to the horizon. The object was bright, likely that it was just reflecting light from the sun, which had already set from my perspective, possibility it was self illuminated?<n>

I reported it to you a few days after that happened. I beleive the craft or crafts left some evidence on the winshield of my Jeep. we were driving and it was wet and cold and I noticed something on the window. At first I thought it was fingerprints or something but then I looked again and saw that it was a definate symetrical pattern and a perfect circle. I asked My friend If he had put anything on the window. he said no. then he said there was one on the passenger side also. I pulled over and we examined the window. the picture on the window matched our drawings of what we saw that night. the strange thing is that it will not come off the window. we rubbed really hard but it would not change or come off. I am hoping that there is a logical explanation for this. I thought at first maybe THAT (the marks on the window) was what we saw that night, but I saw it out of the side window as well and there are no marks on the side window. My friend is convinced there is writing or symbols by the circle marks. I could not be sure of that but there are definately 2 things on the front window of my Jeep that won&#39;t go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In truth, I didn&#39;t believe that there was no such thing as UFOs, not until today. I was on my way home after meeting with my friends in a nearby cafe. There was rarely any cars at the moment. Temperature was 48 degrees F. The sky was very dark, clear, and stars were visible. When I was approaching my intersection to make a left, I saw it. On the top right corner of my frontal car window, an round shaped, bright light greenish light suddenly caught my eye. I stopped my car in the middle of the street and looked at it. It started to get brighter and then it &#34;warped out&#34; leaving a trail of the same exact color for about half a second and vanished, as if nothing was there. After it disappeared, I thought about many things for a moment. It could&#39;ve been an airplane, a helicopter, fireworks, or something.. it was NOTHING LIKE IT. Then, my whole body started to get goosebumps and my eyes with tears. I froze right there, in the middle of the street for a good 30 seconds. I once saw the UFO sighting shows in television before. It looked exactly like it. If whoever reads this gives me video clips of different sightings, I might be able to pinpoint something similar to what I actually saw. I know other people will not believe me. I called some of my friends that were awake and some didn&#39;t even believe me! This is the first time I ever write this type of report ever in my life, but this event cannot pass without notice. It will be treasured inside me for the rest of my life. I&#39;m a little shocked and frightened at the same time at the moment, but now I know that we are not alone in this universe. I hope other non believers will eventually see what I have seen and feel the same way as I do now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If i had a camera, I would&#39;ve took a picture of it, but even though if I had one, I couldn&#39;t, because the duration of the event was too short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Call me if there is something that is related to my sighting and your investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving with my two sons and wife.  My 15 year old son told me there was something in the sky that looked strange to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled to the side of the road.  I looked over and saw what appeared to be a huge blueish light about 30,000 feet above the ground hovering stationary.  What was more odd to me than the light was the fact that emanating from underneath the object was a beam of light that went all the way to the ground. I have spent time in airplane cockpits so I am sure I got the altitude pretty close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I know of no light posessed by Man that can travel such a distance without dissipating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I told the kids--the other boy was twelve--to GET THE CAMERA.  During this time my wife was was just looking at it with a confused look with her mouth sort of agape.  We were all a little bit frightened.  We couldn&#39;t produce a camera in time unfortunately and after about 10 minutes the light or craft or whatever left the area at an impossible speed.  Just zippped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it left there was a streak of blue in the sky where it had been.  My kids are are still amazed by it as am I.  My young son told a class of students about it and they all laughed at him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife won&#39;t talk about it, probably since she has a very high-profile position in the defense industry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were looking north-east and we saw a total of three (seperate times) orange-ish colored light balls appear in the sky and then fade out. They appeared to be approx. the size of a pea compared to the tip of my pinky finger at arms length. This would last only about a minute or two.  There were a lot of small blinking lights near and around these objects we saw (more than likely the blinking lights were military beause we see them all the time). We heard no noises nearby but these were way off in the distance.  These orange-ish balls could have been flares that the military use for practice, but I just thought we would report this incident anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (My daughter was the witness to the Hillsboro ufo incident on Aug 22nd. report)<n>

First I thought that is was an aeroplane, but when it did not move for minutes at a time, I decided it must be a star. At the moment, the dusk was starting to fall and the other stars were not out;it is not uncommon to see the north star at dusk. One thing was, the light was getting brighter with a brilliant white glow. I called my father to let him know about it in Roanoke; he confirmed what I was seeing. When I arrived at my house in Roanoke, I pulled out the binoculars and telescope. With the binoculars I could see a round light with a spiderweb like texture (i.e. Binoculars may cause distortion from the distance and brightness). I noticed that there was an unusual amount of aeroplane activity in the sky and around the object. I pulled out the telescope and positioned it to the ball of light. Each time I went to look through the telescope the light moved downward like it was landing. I pulled up my telescope from the back yard to the front to gain a better view and by the time I made it to the front yard, which took about 30 seconds, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my scanner on and heard usual police activity in the area, but some messages confused me that come over the air; Some of which were morse code, and someone said &#34;Turn down the lights and the talking so we dont spook the horses&#34;, that meaning I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to the Roanoke Regional Airport and found no activity of Military presense, and I called the security office at the airport, which they acted as if they did not know what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roanoke has been a hotbed of activity in the last several months with military presense, mostly the Army and Air Force doing practice runs and drills here. There have been a few UFO incidents in the sky with tractor trailer shape aircraft shooting fine mist and floating long distances on that single shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped my truck as we watched them frolic in the sky darting stopping swaying it was as if the craft was on wheels ,with the precision it operated. The craft quickly left as it had came , so I contineud home . My son and I were amazed and didnt really understad what we had seen . when all of a sudden there was another craft coming from the west sky, it looked like a rocket and it was moving very fast toward us. We watched as we turned into the drive of our home and regocnized the rocket as being an airforce jet heading in the direction that we had seen the teardrop crafts. I than understood that the objects that we had witnessed had shown up on radar and the airforce was on persuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw an airplane from one mile and my son said oh, air plane. I said yes this is a Saudi Aramco air plane. They have a few of them to shuttle there staff and also helicopters using same route on a daily bases.  While we were driving, traveling 30 miles speed we saw a plane and it did not move. We came close to it, it was on our right side not far away, maybe 300 meter in the air. So we stopped to see it. I thought it is going to land or had a problem, but Safaniah is 40 km away so we came to complete stop. The plane still in the same place. I thought it was Harrier fighter plane (saw them during gulf war) but this one is white and so beautiful. The minute we stopped, I asked my son to make right turn towards it and this thing started moving north.  We both said oh it is moving now, good but moving at a high rate of speed. May be 10 seconds and it is gone. Nothing else in the sky as it was a clear day too. By the way my son was driving off road and only under my supervision.

As it passed to the west of our position it had a triangle shape with the lights the tips of the corners and a red light toward the aft of the craft. As it was flying away from our position It had Three lights across the rear. It did not have red or green anticollision lights or any kind of flashing or blinking lights on It. I could not her any sound and It was the size of a 747 or C5 cargo plane. The area I was in is in one of the main final approach corridors of Deroit Metro airport and I am used to seeing a varity of aircraft at night. From Northwest Airlink Canidairs cr4 and bae 146&#39;s to md-80&#39;s and 747-475&#39;s and this craf did not resemble any of them. The closest planes this craft would resemble is the F-117 and B-2 Stealth bombers and their landing lights are only visable when the landing gear are extended. It could have been a plane that but I have yet to see one that looks like this one did<n>

It rose straight up and then down, right and left and then  came back to it&#39;s original height. I awoke my husband and he stood there for about 20 seconds before it took off and went over the starboard bow in front of the bridge. I didn&#39;t hear any noise except for the sound of the wake our ship was making. We don&#39;t know what to think, maybe a ufo or a spy drone??

Secondly, I punched in UFO on Google and this is where I am.  I am somewhat disturbed by what has happened last night and on the way into work this morning I still feel disturbed.  About 1930 hrs last night, I stepped out onto my back porch to check on the horses.  Coming out of my door, I immediately noticed a plane with red and blue lights on the wings and that it appeared rather low flying, since most planes are at cruising altitude around my place.  As I looked just to the right of the East bound aircraft, I noticed a huge white light traveling in a Southerly direction.  I said, “man these planes are going to collide,” I immediately yelled for my wife “come here now and quickly.”  As she came out the back door I said “what is that” she said “that is a plane”, I said “no” pointing straight up “that is a plane, with the red and blue lights on the wings” (this was the plane the object I thought was going to collide with as it was just about over the house now.)  She freaked!  I freaked and started shaking “no way, absolutely not.”  Ok, I was not disturbed by the fact of a white light traveling (reflection from the sun, etc…); I was disturbed buy the fact of its speed and its ability to stop on dime.  Now this stopping could be explained by my angle to this being about 50 degrees or so to me standing on the deck and could mean this object was climbing.  That it is explainable.  However, I know what is off that deck out over the area during the day as much as I do at night.  I am disturbed with the fact that as this object traveled and stopped traveled and stopped, traveled and stopped, it freaking disappeared!  It was gone!  Poof!  I am a professional and cannot go around blabbing this off that I saw something that cannot be explained.  I feel better now that I have described this as it defies everything I have ever thought physically and mechanically possible.  Do what you do with! this stuff – I do not care.  Thanks for listening.  One other thing is that shortly after that incident about 4 minutes or so, another plane was on the same path at about the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/11/03 19:10|Waterford|VT|Light|10 seconds|Six bright, white lights in apparent formation approached at high speed with military aircraft in vicinity|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33737.html|267|ndxe200312| Six bright, white lights in apparent formation approached at high speed with military aircraft in vicinity<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking up the hill back to the house from our barn at 7:05 pm EST, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2003, I was looking down at my feet in the deep snow (so I wouldn&#39;t trip), when I noticed a flash of light fill the sky, seeming to come from behind me.   When I whirled around, I was startled by the appearance of six bright light whites in two apparently separate triangular groups.  Each triagular group of three lights appeared to be the size of a folded postcard held at arms&#39; length. The lights appeared to be quite close to me in terms of distance - maybe 250 yards - and it was immediately apparent that they were moving toward me at high speed descending from an initial altitude of a couple of hundred feet.   There were only the six bright lights, quite small in size, with no structure discernable around them or between them.  The lights were not flashing, and were a constant white colour.  One other witness feels that there were some pink tinges associated with the lights.  Nevertheless the relative spacing between the lights remained absolutely constant in the 10-15 seconds that I observed them, as though they were rigidly connected.   The two triangular groups moved together, with no change in the spacing between them other than an apparent increase in size as the object(s) approached.  There was no sound either preceding or during the appearance of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same moment that I first saw the lights, I noticed two aircraft flying one in front of the other well behind the lights and at a higher altitude.  I believe that the aircraft were military aircraft.   We do not live near a commercial airport, but we do see military planes (A-10&#39;s; F-16&#39;s) from time to time as we border military area Y-2 in New Hampshire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noted the navigation lights and strobes on the two aircraft.  The planes were travelling from right to left of my field of visions, perpendicular to the apparent direction of travel of the lights which was more or less directy towards me.  The lights were not near the aircraft and it did not appear possible that the planes were the source of the light phenomenon.  The lights were much closer, at a lower altitude and moving in an entirely different direction than the planes.  The relative positions and movements of the planes and the lights, and the exact simultaneous extinguishing of the lights (see below) in my mind precludes flares as being the identification of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights approached from the southwest, and after 10-15 seconds of observing them all six lights disappeared at exactly the same moment, with no change in direction, no residue, nor sound of any kind.  They simply vanished at once while in motion towards me, as though someone turned off a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two aircraft made a wide, sweeping turn around our property and at some point about one minute later another two aircraft joined the &#34;pattern&#34; circling our property.   The planes remained circling overhead in a fairly tight turning pattern for well-over one hour (approximately 1 hour 20 minutes) at which time they flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was witnessed by three people who agree on the details of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were about the length of the diameter of two full moons. They were long, slinder, and pointed in a vertical direction. These lights were fire orange in color and moved slowly in an upward direction. The lights pulsated in brightness. The lights were about 400 yards apart from one another and faded away the higher they traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not tell whether they were in front or in back of the clouds, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove down the street, west on West Little York toward Hwy 290, and I saw two young men taking photos of the lights. The light on the left was 2-3 times the size of the one on the right, and they were both pulsating periodically. After only about 10 minutes, they dissappeared, the light on the right ( the south ) dissappeared first.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed it out to my 19-year-old son, who works with me. We observed it through his infrared scope and zoom digital camera. It appeared to be a very bright, solid object without appendages. Occasionally it showed a bluish tint, but basically was white. It was clearly not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, balloon or anything else we could think of, and it was much too bright to be Jupiter or Mars. In addition, the weather on this day and evening has been very windy, especially for LA, and yet it just hung in the sky without moving for a minimum of 20 minutes. This really added to the anomaly, since any untethered object like a balloon would have moved very obviously. It must have certainly be seen by thousands of early evening (5:50 to about 6:30) rush-hour commuters. After about 20 minutes, we decided to drive towards it. We were successful in keeping it in sight, but eventually it receded and we lost sight of it in the SW skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness intends a date in 2003.

The object did not move for around 45 mins to an hour then just disapeared. The object was not a plane as no movement. The object was not a star or planet as I have been avidly watching this part of the sky recently to see mars approach to earth. I have therefore become very familiar with that part of the night sky. at one point some clouds went infront of the object and it was obscured and therefore had to be some distance away. The object did vary in size and intensity once or twice. It was a bright circular light that seemed to be the sort of light emited when you burn tungstan. The only explanation I could think of was a helicopter as it didi not move though I have observed one (the police one) locally at night on many occasions and saw nothing in its apperance similair. I have no idea of size or distance did seem to be far away, over the areas of local towns- maybe Barry or Cowbridge. I am only reporting this as I know if it was as it appeared I am sure there will be many more detailed reports from those areas and just wanted to corroborate any reports that came in. It was very unusual and I am at a loss to explain it. PS I am sceptical of all this but I did watch it for an hour. No camera at home though!!<n>

Colors blue, green, red and white.  Oriented almost vertical.  They were stationary when first observed to the southwest of my home in the country.  They appreared to be at approximately 5,000 feet above ground level.  About one minute after I saw them, they began to move in an easterly direction at about the speed of a Cessna 172 aircraft at cruise.  As they passed to the south of my home and were obstructed by the house, we could hear no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the back yard, but could no longer see the object.  After about five minutes, we looked again and saw it at a much higher altitude, in about the same area were we could see Mars during it&#39;s close passage to the earth a few weeks ago.  It remained almost stationary then for 30 to 40 minutes.  We observed it through a telescope.  We could never see a shape, only the lights which blinked or rotated in a non rhythmatic manner<n>

They were blood red with 6 black spots each. Their shape was weird, it was like a triangle but the sides were bent and had three sharp-looking points. They zig-zagged around mostly, but at one point, it was as if they sensed my gaze because they shot a ball of flame at my grass. The confusing thing about the ball of flame was that it extinguished as soon as they hit. When I went down to look at the spot, there was a brass-looking ball of metal there. Then I looked back up, and one of them was right above me. They shot a beam of light or something like that at the ball and it vanished. I touched the beam of light when it was there, which was for about 3 seconds, and it felt weird, silky and yet it had a hard feeling to it. Up close, I could see a window in the thing. There was a blue humanoid looking creature looking at me for about 2 seconds and then the thing flew back up and disappeared. The others were gone when the thing in the sky flew back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun had set, and the dusk was gradually fading into night. The hills and mountains were shrouded in black and the horizon glowed a bright pink bordered by a dull yellow. We were in the middle of the desert, mind you. At some point on the highway, my brother asked me if you can see shooting stars more clearly in the desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite dark enough for that,&#34; I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, three orange-yellow lights flashed into view in the sky over Prescott. At first I thought it was an airplane, but I realized that couldn&#39;t be the case: the lights were arranged in a staight line of three fireballs, and the one on the far right blinked out, and the middle one followed it and blinked out as well, leaving only one light in the sky. A split second later, however, the middle one flashed back into sight and then the far right as well. The three fireballs shone brightly; they were round and fat and cast a constant glow, meaning they didn&#39;t glimmer or glitter at all. Except for when they blinked, their luster didn&#39;t oscillate at all: no glimmering, shimmering, glistening, glittering, gleaming or other such pretty verbs. After some 7 seconds or so, all of them blinked out one by one--from the right to the left. They vanished into thin air and didn&#39;t return.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was left hanging unmoving in the sky was a grey/black cigar shaped vehicle with a bump on the top.  I watched it as I pulled into the parking lot.  I thought if it was an airplane, it would keep moving.  It just hung there.  I kept watching it for a few more minutes and it never moved.  The color was odd for an airplane in this area as well.  I don&#39;t recall seeing a plane that was black/ grey and did not reflect light off of it.  It made no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/9/03 19:54|Terre Haute|IN|Triangle|5 minutes|Slow moving silent triangle defined by pale yellow chevron and a single bright center light with moving north in southern Vigo Co.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33702.html|284|ndxe200312| Slow moving silent triangle defined by pale yellow chevron and a single bright center light with moving north in southern Vigo Co.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west on Harlan Drive (commonly known as Stuckey Road) about 4 miles east of US Highway 41 in southern Vigo county.  I saw a bright light in the sky to my south at a fairly high angle of elevation. There was little apparent motion of the light, not unusual in itself. This is about 10 miles south and a little west of Hulman Field (airport) where F16 fighters fly in and out all the time.  However the duration of event and its lack of apparent motion and the brightness of the light were triggers for my interest.  I turned south on Hutchison Street off of Harlan, still on my path home, and I saw the light was now less intense  and I stopped my car about 1/2 mile south of Harlan Drive and got out to look at this object.  At this point I could discern that there were five pale yellow lights in a symetric chevron with the point in the direction of what I perceived to be a slow movement in the direction of north by northeast. The apparent size of the object was about the size of my thumb with my arm fully extended.  There was a single white light in the center of the apparent triangle formed by the vertices of the pale yellow chevron and this light flashed on and off at a slow rate.  The center light was not a harsh white like a strobe light. Also the white light seemed very big for a what would normally be an anti-collision strobe light on an aircraft.  I watched the object over the period of a few minutes gradually go north and become obscured by a tree line to the north. It was completely dark, the sky was partly cloudy and the moon was almost obscured by clouds.  I could not determine the actual size of the object as I had no references to determine its actual altitude. If it was a small craft like a fighter, it was pretty low; if larger who knows?. I could detect no sound. This object might have  easily been some kind of conventional craft, but I have never seen any aircraft with such pale yellow running lights on the leading edge of its wings, and operating so quietly. There w! ere no red/green navigation lights. Hence this registered very strongly with me as an unusual sight.  For what its worth, I am not qualified in any way as an aviation expert; I am ex-military.  This thing did not spark anything except curiosity in me, and I tend to doubt this was any kind of ET craft. However it was flying; it was a real object; it was strange enough to be called unidentified.  So in my book, its a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was an rocket from the air base but it sat there in the sky for almost 30 min. Then it began to sink into the horizon out of my point of view. It could be a star but this would have been the birghtest star I have ever seen. It looked like it was definitley inside our atmosphere. Simply because I could not see any stars around it. The only stars I could see were directly above me. The stars above me were very dim due to the marine cover that was setting in. We are due for rain tomarrow so the clouds are building off the coast. The light was west of me so it was in the direction of the fog on the horizon but I could see it like it was right in front of the marine cover. I could see lots of planes flying around in the sky mostly five at a time. I saw two jets one below the object and one above it fly past the object coming from the south. I could tell they were jets because of how fast they moved past the object from such a great distance. It looked like alot of activity in the sky all at once then when I couldn&#39;t see the object because it went below my point of view I saw less and less air traffic. I am used to seeing bright stars in the sky but this was not a bright star it was inside our atmosphere. I have a feeling that this is goig to be over looked and not reported or it will be described as a weather ballon!<n>

It traveled from west to east.  It was definitely not an airplane.  I thought it was the space station.  While I was inside getting binoculars, my 10 yr. old daughter said that it turned reddish then disappeared.  I have never seen that large and bright light in the sky.  We watched the sky for several minutes after but did not see it again. I think it was something entering earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The street I drive on Bronte st. has very little lights in areas of it. There is also a known air travel for planes. But I looked up and this plane was not a plane it had no blinking coloured lights. And it looked somewhat like a fat plane sideways but much much bigger, with 3 bright lights. How it moved had me staring at it, I almost pulled over. It was slow and just hovering, waiting. It would go up and then down, and then after a few minutes I seen to other objects in the morning sky. These were planes Jets, heading towards it at opposite sides. The UFO, quickly just disappeared leaving the two jets just to cross eachother. I felt as if I was crazy, I just seen a UFO, and two jets trying to get to it. Wow. I am still in awe at what I seen. At least now I know. NO matter who tells me that can be easily explained, honestly that one can not be, this was way too huge, too high and too low in the sky and far to quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My daughter is also a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sightings, but a massive low frequency, slow cycling(2-3 second intevals),  rumbling sound that covered several miles and lasted 20 minutes. Similar to an eormous engine, like a locomotive starting up, but much larger. On the scale of an earthquake or tornado that sounds like a train coming into you house. Came from west of Beachwood,Ohio. (There are no trains located near this area and I have lived here for 51 years and never heard anything like this).There was some activity 2-3 miles away with a helicopter circling in the same spot for the 20 minutes I watched. Police departments had other complaints, but no answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor that lives about a mile closer said that she also heard it, and that there were several helicopters circling the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife&#39;s students live in that area and stated the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/8/03 21:30|Myrtle Beach|SC|Light|30 minutes|Bright orange light lasts 3-5 seconds over ocean, accompanied by multiple strobe lights|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33684.html|295|ndxe200312| Bright orange light lasts 3-5 seconds over ocean, accompanied by multiple strobe lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have seen this phenomena several times over the last couple of months, and did a web search to see if anyone else has seen it, hence this report. I live in an oceanfront condo, and was sitting on my balcony overlooking the ocean when a bright orange light appeared approximately 25 degrees off the horizon over the ocean. The light was bright enough to reflect in the water, although how far away it was I could not discern. The light basically blinked on, remained bright for about 3-5 seconds, and then quickly faded out. It did not move. Another light appeared about 5 minutes later at about the same height, but a quarter of the horizon north. Another appeared 10 minutes later, directly in front of me, at the same level, and as soon as it faded out, another one appeared maybe 5 degrees away from the first. The light is large, to my eye approximately 10 times larger than Mars. Focusing binoculars on the light does not provide any discernible object, with no running lights visible after it fades to indicate an aircraft. There was a full moon out, which backlit the sky enough to make any physical object visible through binoculars. The sky was clear. Each time I have seen these orange lights, they are accompanied by a multitude of white strobes, numbering anywhere between 10-30, which move across the sky at various altitudes, but the movement is erratic. I am used to seeing aircraft strobes as planes departing and landing from the Myrtle Beach airport fly across the ocean regularly. These strobes do not track like an aircraft, but erratically bounce around. At times a red strobe can be seen alongside the white strobes. Mostly the strobes can only be seen with binoculars, however it is not uncommon to discern them with the naked eye once you know what to look for. I have always seen these objects between 9pm and 11pm, sometimes they last for two hours, other times for a half hour. Tonight I observed a set of 6 white strobes move inland for the first time. They normally remain offshore. The strobe! s are very small, which makes judging their distance difficult. The strobes and orange lights sometimes appear on one side of the horizon, then the orange light will appear on the opposite side, and the strobes appear to race across the sky to it. A multitude of aircraft with strobes moving as a group may appear they are moving erratically due to the nature of a strobe light. The only explaination I can devise concerning the orange lights is possibly the glow from afterburners, although there is no aircraft visible when it fades, ie no running lights. Two guests have seen these lights on different nights with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A lady who I know very well wanted to tell me about something she and her husband and two children witnessed on December 8, 2003 at approx: 8:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her husband had just picked her up from a friends house and they arrived back home shortly after. They pulled into their long driveway only to see the two kids standing outside yelling and pointed towards the mountain behind their home. The husband stopped the car quickly and both parents jumped out in fear as they had no idea what was wrong, thinking the worst. They almost immediately noticed a white oval shaped object sitting stationary over the back of their property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oval shaped object had a solid ring of blue lights which seemed to be moving around the white colored object. A slight and annoying hum could be heard coming from it. The Mother went over and grabbed the two children and went into the house with them, Dad followed close behind. They thought it would be safer than standing outside as they had no idea what is was they were looking at. Once inside the home, they proceeded to a back bedroom, closed the door behind them as not to allow any light from inside the home to give away where they were. (feeling frightened at this time)  But still curiosity was getting the best of them. So they watched the object, still sitting in the exact spot from when they first noted it. The family told me the trees which were below it were all lit up in a white light, and for a good distance around the area. After a total of approx: 4 minutes of watching this unusual craft, it slowly started to move. As it did so the witnesses claimed they could see sparks dropping off the bottom side of it. The sparks were reported to be a white in color. They told me that there was no quick moment to the object, it just rose up rather slowly and as it reached the top of the mountain this is where they lost sight of it. The craft did not blink out, they thought it just crossed over the top and maybe moved down the other side. They reported that whatever it was, was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The husband told me it was not a helicopter, no way !! He said we were very close to this thing, and what noise it gave off was minimal, except for this consent humming sound. The husband also said area residents would have been blind not to see this as it was so bright and large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: After I talked with the witness in the mall I made arrangements and did go to visit the whole family earlier today. I sat with all of them for a long period of time and I can say this for certain. I believe they saw something really strange as everyone was still very excited over what they saw that evening. I also will be going back tomorrow to look around the area where this object was reported to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

The sky was clear. It was about 1AM on the dot. As I was driving, I noticed in the top left corner of my windshield a bright ball of light coming almost straight down toward the ground. At first, I thought it was just a drop of water fallind down my windshield, and that a street light had refected on it, making it look luminous. But I was definitely not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It fell at a constant speed, very slowly. It moved in a straight path, and just slightly toward the left. We were driving, South/SouthWest-ish. It was A bright white ball of light, with no tail at all. I was only able to see it for about 3 seconds or so, from the time it came into my view from inside my car, until it was obscured by some high trees that were along side the road. It looked about the size of the fingernail on my pinky finger if I hold it as far away from me as possible. And my guess would be that it was only a 5 or 6 hundred yards away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t going to say anything about it to my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat next to me. But I noticed that he was looking in the same direction, and that he had seen it, also. I asked him &#34;Did you see that?&#34; And he told me he did, and had no clue what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved way too slowly to be a shooting star, and was way too bright, and too large. And it was definitely falling down from the sky, rather than towards the horizon in front of me. I heard no strange sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I put a checkmark in my report that the object landed, because it appeared to be nearing the ground until it went out of view, but it may not have actually landed)<n>

It was kind of pulsating and changing its color to white and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew toward our direction and when it was finally over us it kinda stopped and started moving in a circular/spiral motion right on top of us as if it was looking down on us until it got covered up by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wouldnt be an aircraft as it seemed to be outside the atmosphere like a big red star. And no planes can fly that fast (like a speed of a shooting star in zigzag direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had goosebumps all over my body all the time I was watching it with a few friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What could it be?<n>

Below these bright lights there was a row of small green lights. I had my friend slow the truck down to a crawl and the lights keept coming towards us. The object then turned 90 degrees and acceldrated instantly and headed north and disappeared into the clear night sky.As this object turned I observed the same pattern of lighting on the side and back of it. This occured on Dec. 7, 2003. I could not enter the proper date above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to December 07.

I didn&#39;t pay much attention at first, thinking it was probably an aircraft with the sun shining on it. I noticed over a 10 minute period that it was hovering and only moving slightly. As I got closer, I realized it had no wings, tail, etc. Just a bright ball of light. I pulled over and watched it for another 5 minutes, when suddenly I saw 2 more appear from right behind it, and they were smaller but just as bright. They started darting all around the bigger one like mosquitos! I came on home to get my telescope, but by the time I got situated, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went outside to get a better look and spotted the 2nd object it was identical to the first, and moving in the same pattern as the first object. Saw both objects in the eastern sky. I watched them for approx. 5 minutes when both of them simultaniously began to move in a northeasterly direction and behind another cloud bank and out of my view. I contacted a local T V station meteorologist and he verified the altitude of the cloud bank. No other sightings were reported. The objects were noiseless. They were both the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was then I noticed the ufo appeared to be dark in color, indicating to me the ufo was made of a hihgly reflective material.It was also more of a disk shape rather than a sphere.This sighting took place in broad daylight just before sunset and when it moved in front of the cloud it appeared to be &#34;white&#34; in color.The 2nd object appeared &#34;white&#34; in color at all times for the duration of the sighting.The clouds were moving rapidly from Northeast to Southwest. This is a rough estimate of direction.Winds were approx. 10 MPH. The objects moved AGAINST the wind. Indicating to me they were not kites and not an elaborate hoax.Both of these objects seemed to defy the laws of aerodynamics as I understand them.Please contact me A.S.A.P. via e-mail.

They told me that in about ten years the earth will be shifted out of its orbit and great changes will occur. They wont tell me if every one will die or not.there plan is to transplant several humans to a planet similar to earth.I am one they have chosen to go.At first they were going to share their knowlege of what they call trans magnetic flux propulsion with us,but we shot at them and treated them as hostile.They are monitoring us constantly and choosing people to go.Some people are already gone and have been living there for as long as 10 years.They asked me to write this so that some who listen will believe me and also be allowed to go and be saved.Do not take this lightly a large mass is heading twords earth and will colide with us in ten years. The government knows this and is huridly trying to duplicate this alien propulsion to save only themselves.The aliens assure me they wont figure it out in time and they dont wont those type of people for the new earth.They are violent and greedy and corrupt.Only the least of men will go and the meek.I have been chosen to go but I will be last.I must stay until the end to warn people.Most wont believe me but those who do will be saved.If you are rich give all but what you need to others who have nothing.Do not give anything to those who already have what they need like big charity organazations.Give and help dirrectly to the people or persons who need it and do it in secret.The aliens will know and will save you.A new earth is waiting for you dont loose hope,in time everything you have lost will be restored to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I scrambbled to see what it was, I saw the second light off to our southwest. They were about the same altitude and same size. We noticed the colors kept changing from whitish to orange, green, red and various colors in between. I got my telescope out and looked at it. It was then that I could see the shape and how the colors swirled from the inside of the object. The colors changed like that of our fiber optics. It was fascinating to see. The object made no sound and hovered in the same spot for 5 in. or so. The object to our south went red and got very small and appeared to drop straight down. Then it was gone. The second object that we had watched for so long did the same thing and then reappeared after a min. or so. It remained there for a few more min. and the slowly descended down behind the treeline across the field. About 10-15 min. later we were going to town and the first object had reappeared and was there for about 1 min. and turned red, shrank in size and was gone. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life! It was awsome! And on my birthday! If anyone else from the area saw this please respond!<n>

I was sitting in the passenger seat and he in the driver&#39;s.  As we were talking I began looking out the passenger window to the north.  A bright red object high in the sky caught my eye.  I continued to watch thinking it was a plane but then the light slowly started to go dim and then out.  By this time my husband wondered why I was ignoring him and stopped the car.  Then we were both looking out the passenger window when the light slowly reappeared and then one more a short distance from the first did the same.  We started driving again and then turned heading north.  The lights continued to get brighter then slowly dim and go out then reappear. We watched the two red lights until we pulled in our driveway and could not see due to the trees. Neither one of us were under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  We did not try to walk around and see them through the trees, we just decided to go in and tried not to think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also telephoned the witness to find out a little more about the sighting. I had a nice conversation with him, and he went on to explain exactly what he saw. On December 5, 2003 (in the video clip the witness tells that the sighting took place on December 6, 2003. The sighting actually took place on December 5, 2003, a simple mix mistake) he saw a pair of unknown objects at 5:43 p.m. while out Barbecuing. When he noticed the two objects, his first thought was a couple of satellites were flying side by side. But he starting thinking this was really strange looking because one of the objects would quickly move past the other, then the object which then followed behind, would make the same moment and fly up a head of the other. The witness said it looked as if they were racing across the sky as each one tried to pass the other. He mentioned that the speed of these two unknowns was incredible as both moved so very quickly. The two objects eventually went into a cloud bank and disappeared. They were a very bright orange in color. An example he gave for the color and size of the two objects were that of the brightness and size of the planet Mars when it was at it&#39;s closet to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellows son, at a different location from where his Dad was saw a single unknown object traveling south at a low rate of speed,  it quickly sped up and was gone.

Within seconds of spotting these lights I witnessed the higher of the two flash very brightly, then disappear.

This encouter took a couple of seconds to occur and gave me ample time to study the object and take note of the fact that it most definetly was not an air craft that is known to the general public. The object seemed to have take off from a standstill hover and jet down as if propelled; not a falling or orbiting object of any kind.  I should also point out that we later saw a low flying plane and saw regular commercial planes for comparison later which solidified my belief ( or disbelief!) that what I saw was neither a plane nor a helicpoter. After seeing the bright red light, I looked into the sky and saw an alarming number of oddly placed lights in the sky. It was early dusk and there were not stars out yet. Also, I am familiar with the area in which this occured and have never seen these lights. Other people in this area have been seeing things lately and everyone here is talking about low flying planes. A lot more happened during this sighting that took place over 45 minutes, we even experienced slight time loss in that it took 55 minutes to drive 25 miles while we were driving at a constant rate of 6o mph. One last thing, we never heard any aircraft sounds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last phone converstaion still no word from photographer after three months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I did recieve an email for Georeg to begin with that said &#34; can you think of any reason they would show themselves to you, is there anything there or just military presence&#34; During our phone converstaion he stated UFOs have plasma drive and that is the  glowing around the object you have filmed. Also, stated &#34;they may be trying to communicate with you&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to look at the footage, and we will request that the other witnesses submit reports.

It was clear directly above and nearby my neighborhood. I could see the stars very clearly, and I happened to look west out over the ocean, which is approx 15 miles to the shoreline from where I live. I noticed an unusual bright light, that was different in appearance to the other stars in the sky. From the naked eye you could see a flickering to it around the center of the light source, which was very bright. I took the dogs in, and got my spotting telescope to get a better look at it. What I could see was a center mass, round, illuminated, very bright, white light. Around the center mass which appeared to be considerable in size, there was a radiating, almost slight flickering of reddish-orange light source going all the way around the center mass. I watched it for about 5 mins., then decided to call my wife out to take a look, and maybe give her opinion of what she thought it might be. I asked her to give her honest opinion, and she said she never seen anything like it. We watched it for awhile, and had to follow it just slightly with the telescope, as it had lateral movement to it. But basically it just hovered out over the ocean, above a fog bank. Now what was interesting was a plane (possibly private) was heading in it&#39;s direction only at an angle, like it was on its own flight path, with nothing to do with this light source. It seemed to be just heading out over the ocean, and didn&#39;t appear to be heading to this object. My wife noticed the object retreat further back over the ocean as if to avoid this plane. As the plane continued on it&#39;s way, the light source came back to it&#39;s original location and 5 minutes later just dissapeared. Gone in an instant. We discussed it about a half hour later, and both of us noticed, that when this plane was heading in the objects direction, only at an angle, the object retreated in such a manner, as to not bring attention to i! tself. It was very quick, very smooth and fluid (maybe 5-10 miles)in a blink of an eye. It was so smooth, almost like it was blending in with the sky, at the same time it dimmed it&#39;s lights ever so slight, that if you were&#39;nt paying attention, it wouldn&#39;t have even been noticed. Now I did witness this object two nights ago, however about 7 p.m in the eve. Same basic location, although a bit closer to shore. I went to my neighbors house and had him look at the object through the telescope, and asked him what he thought. He also was perplexed, and has never seen anything like it. All three of us went through all the logical explanations of what it could be, and all three of us came up with the same answer, this object was totally unique, and we could not explain what it might be. Now being a logical person, I called three news station to see if there we&#39;re any reports, and they did not receive any calls. I called Camp Pendelton Marine base which is just North of this sighting, they did not have any aircraft, or manuvers out on the ocean. I called Miramar Marine Corp airbase, located about 25 miles south and to the east of this sighting, they also had no aircraft, or manuvers going on in this area. Typically, this would&#39;nt have me reporting this to your agency, however This object was unlike anything I have seen in my life, I also have two other witnesses that feel the same way. Now, it very well could be explained away, as an aircraft, a star, a helicopter, or balloon by those who chosing to do so. All I know is this object was capable of very, very quick movement with angular flight paths. It also was unlike any light source I have ever seen, it was incredibly bright, and the radiating reddish-orange light that surrounded the object almost appeared to be on fire. Anyway, I saw what I saw, and if it appears to be something explainable that would be fine by me. I am concerned tho&#39; with Camp Pendelton to the north, and just north of that is San Onofre Nuclear power plant. I suppose this would be just coincid! ental, but it just seems odd. One last thing, Miramar said if something we&#39;re out there, they would&#39;ve picked it up on radar, however it was out there and they didn&#39;t catch it on radar. Thank You for your time, if you have any questions, I left my cell no. on your recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I am an amateur astronomer and often go out into the country to stargaze on clear nights. On three separate occasions I have seen these objects, which appear to be brilliant green or blue lights that are so bright I am amazed no one else has reported them. The first time I saw them I was certain there would be something in the paper about them the next day but there was nothing. They were as bright as a full moon and came in three &#34;flares.&#34;<n>

It then moved to the south eastern sky where it remained static for approximately two hours. The object emitted brilliant white, blue, and red lights which appeared to flash in sequence. As an aerospace worker with more than 20 years experience in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, I determined the object was not conventional. It remained in a static position for two hours and emitted no sound. As I had no optical devices, such as binoculars, I could not confirm its true shape. I can confirm that the lights observed with the naked eye were aligned horizontally and appeared to flash or pulse in a left to right sequence. My observations were confirmed by my teenage son who likewise witnessed the event. I placed calls to the local airport and television newsroom to inquire if there had been other reports. There were none made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe Mars was out at this time and I remember attempting to find it when I first started to gather up the trash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just coming up the back stairs to my apartment from taking the garbage out to the street when a yellowish/white glowing object caught my eye above and straight out towards me. I was standing facing my door and peering at the peek of the roof just above my head when this object began to (or continued) to travel towards me and over the peek of the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of going inside I waited until the object passed over my head. As it passed over me (I would say at least 5000 feet, I know this because I live near an airport) I followed it with my eyes until it rested adjacent to a tree limb in the foreground and the UFO in the background. It hovered for a moment and it began to wobble. This was very apparent. It was not a plane or helicopter, and this was very apparent. It moved smoothly with no sound, and when it hovered it wobbled. After about 1 minute of it wobbling beside the tree branch, it began to descend into the horizon. I went back down the stairs and followed it to the end of my parking lot until I lost sight of it again. It was moving quite fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Thought it looked like a Chinook helicopter but after a while I noticed it was not moving.  I was getting closer to it.  Stopped in Deming to talk with my salesman who was in his car behind me.  Asked him what the black object that was not moving was and he said he did not know.  Had no binochulars to look at it with so we continued west on I-10.  Observed for another 10 miles or so when it became to dark to see it any longer, since I was looking over my shoulder to the east.  Object seemed large, around 500-1000 feet across and up &amp; down.  Had no shape to it, just looked like a blob.  I would estimate altitude between 5000-10000 feet.  It was probobly about 5-20 miles south of interstate.  It did go behind a mountain as was driving west but reimerged once I got past mountain, object never moved.  Object size and altitude are just guesses since there was nothing to compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness intended a date in the year 2003, and we have changed the date above accordingly.

I&#39;ve seen it twice before in the past couple months.  It was a bright, glowing, yellow, rounded shape (either circular or a sphere) travelling very quickly.  It was very large, way too big to be a plane.  If it weren&#39;t moving, you&#39;d think it was the moon at first.  The first two times I saw it, I was outside and it just appeared in the sky then quickly zoomed away out of sight.  The third time, I was inside looking out the window and saw it flying a little slower.  Also in this last sighting, the sky seemed to flash about 20 minutes later as though there was lightning (which there wasn&#39;t) but I could no longer see the UFO from my window. I don&#39;t know if the flash had anything to do with it or if it was the result of something else.  In all cases, it was always travelling a lot faster than any planes would.  The first time it happened, it was around 2am, the second time I think it was 11pm, and this last time it was 5am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights began to the right and lit up one after the other from right to left. First 5 or 6 in straight line, the remainder at various heights but close in proximity of height (estimate 500 to 1000 feet above the ocean and 1-3 miles from the shoreline) Only 3-4 lights could be seen lit at any one time. The lights were orange-yellow in color and appeared to be shining directly at the shore as each one faded in and out. While lit, the lights could be seen hovering slightly upward and to the right very slowly, as if almost floating. Night was partly cloudy, and the lights were definitely below the cloudline as the lights were very clear and large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving and somewhere south of Hagerstown I noticed a formation of lights in a triangular shape hovering above the trees and buildings off to my left.  I tried to get my husband to look at the object(s) to see if he could determine what it was, but he said it was probably just a plane or helicopter.  I could not constantly look at the object as I was driving.  It then &#34;floated&#34; slowly over the road in front of us and off to the right of I-81S.  At this point in time I could vaguely make out a dark triangular shape of the craft as the area below it was very well lit and the craft was very low.  There were no strobe lights or blinking lights on the craft, only white lights that outlined what I assume to be the underside of the craft.  After passing to the right of the road for a few seconds, it crossed over I-81 once again at a very low altitude, then I lost sight of it as I continued down the road.  I know it was not a conventional airplane, as it hovered and was moving too slowly.  I thought it may be some kind of experimental military craft, but why would they be flying it so low (what seemed to be only a couple hundred feet above the ground) and in such a busy, populated area?  I would love to know if anyone else had witnessed this craft, or if anyone knows what it may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witnessed the flash umtil it dis-appeared behind a nearby tree top. At first I thought it was a meteorite, but then I realised that it was rather large/close and between me and the clouds. The weather was windy and cool with partly to mostly cloudy skies. There was no sound that I could hear associated with the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our ridge is parallel with Blue Mountain, elevation aprox. 6500 ft. and there is maybe 1 mile between us. At 7:00pm on 1/3/2003 we observed a multi-colored object that looked to be about 4 or 5 times as big as a star roam and at times stop all along the ridge of Blue Mt with an inch or two of sky showing; meaning we never saw it land on the ridge it just sort of floated above it. I looked in my binoculars but could not make the shape out-it just looked like different colors blurring together. This area is frequented by commercial planes that I assume are coming from the SF bay area and for the time I took to really observe this object I saw no less then 12 planes pass right in the vicinity of this object. I am stunned and amazed by what we saw as I&#39;m sure others in our area must be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; in the eastern sky at this hour, would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could accept that the object was a genuine UFO.

My first instinct was hat they were airplanes but then as i saw there irratic movement i began to think differently. I ran inside and grabbed the video camera and i watched as they jumped around the sky left, right up down.. etc. It was then i saw this object that looked like a plane as well but closer with red and green and white flashing lights but as it came in fast, it slowed down and came to a complete stop and hovered then moved left after it was going right. One after another these crafts appeared, shifting speeds and flashing different colors, still surrounded by tinier flashes. I have all of this on video tape luckily and it&#39;s undeniable what you see. Along with this the same night, i saw what looked like twinkling stars in the sky but when i zoomed in with the camera they chnaged from red to green to blue and white. I have about a hour of footage this time. The crafta moved without any sound, shifted speeds, and wobbled while hovering in place.

It was like a long narrow cloud, except it moved from west to east at an amazing speed and never seemed to get wider or more narrow. We both said boy look at it race across the sky. We watched it till it went out of sight to the east. We went back to cooking our hot dogs and looked up about 5 min later and watched another long narrow cloud like thing again race across the sky from west to east. This also reached from horizion to horizion. Like the other it RACED across the sky no way was the wind blowing this that fast.

The sky was clear after sunset. It hovered and sparkled. A red sphere flashed by going south. My neighbor came out on his balcony for a cigarette. The white light hovered. When he went in it started it&#39;s  vertical decent. It went down very slowly a bit at a time until it disappeared in the trees, at 500 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to describe the light. In the binoculars it has strobing red and other colours but white is the predominant one. It is white hot like a sparkler and hard to tell size or shape. I find it hard to believe that no one else has reported this as it is predominant in the sw sky and by the airport. It went down just before a jet landed. There is a population density around the airport and surrounding hills, and again I can&#39;t be the only one who sees this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior of the light suggests that some people at a glance would view it as a star or a one spotlight plane on approach. It makes no sudden moves, as it moves in increments. This is a wonder-full event, lasting 20 minutes, from when I start viewing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

While attempting to make a left on to a very busy street I noticed an object in the sky.  At my location it was easy to gain repeated visuals of the target as there was a fixed object (telephone pole)which the target was in close proximity (like lining up the sights on a rifle), total approx viewing time 30- 45 sec.  The object caught my eye because it reflected light from the sun (like a single mirror).  The object appeared to be large and stationary (that is to say it did not appear to shrink or grow in size due to forward or reverse motion, also, it did not move Left or Right or up and down in my view of the horizon).  The object appeared to be shiny gray in color and oval in shape.  As I looked at the sun in the West the object was about 45 degrees from it at my location.  When I looked away (to check for on coming traffic) to make a left (heading west) the target was no longer their.  I scanned the horizon to reacquire the target, but it was gone.  I do not believe it was a plane (to large, no contrails,and not the right shape), at first I thought a blimp, but I could have easily found the target again as a blimp cannot deviate so drastically as to appear to vanish.  The day was cold (approx 33 degrees); the sky had very little clouds (the thin ones that are high in the atmosphere), However, nothing could have obstructed my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we looked up we saw  a row of three orange lights close together, followed by another three (two side by side and one slightly behind). Then another three followed in a triangle formation (two in front and one behind). The three in front seemed to stop and wait, then the second three stopped until the back three caught up. then they were obscured by the clouds<n>

12/2/03 18:15|San Diego|CA|Circle|10 minutes|Three dull  yellow lights in the sky!!!|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33590.html|356|ndxe200312| Three dull  yellow lights in the sky!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 1814 I was out on my balcony smoking with my wife and was looking at the night sky as I always do when ever I go out. I happen to look over in the area across from my apartment towards the stadium, and noticed what seemed like a bright landing light on an airplane over the horizon. At first I thought it was just that because it was not moving really fast or turning rather just sitting in one place. Then as I am watching this light waiting to see it turn for the glide slope for it&#39;s FAP into SD Airport another light came up from below the horizon at least from what I could see to be the horizon with a building in my view. Anyway another light came up same color and size as the one I am watching, and moved along side of the first light. These lights were a dull yellowish color not blinking or turning other colors. So with the two lights now side by side, the first one moved up and away towards the 2 o&#39;clock position at about 1,000 feet agl, and not fast at all. It was kind of like a bump and go method the second light just stayed where the first object was while the first object moved across the horizon. Now I did not and could not see any visible beacon lights on any of the objects and was to far away to hear sounds of engines, but they were perfect in size and remained a constant dull yellow color. With the 1st object now moving away and the 2nd hovering in place, a third light of the same two I am watching moves to within about 25feet of the 2nd light and begins to hover along side. There were other IA flying all around the area some on FAP and others going to and from the costal area, but none towards these objects. I being foolish in my thinking said to myslef in my mind, I can see you and I know you are there and then I got freaked out. As soon as I said it the object I was looking at got real bright like it was flashing towards me and then all the lights were gone like as if someone turned the light swith off gone. I don&#39;t want people to think I am nuts I&#39;m not, I am in th! e militray and know what to look for when spotting aircraft and the different types of aircraft we have. However I am suprised that I am the only one to report this as anyone who was looking up at the sky would have seen this as clear as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me being the ufo lover I am, my brother didnt bother looking but my stepdad did. He too saw what he describes as a saucer kind of shape that was silver in color and had a had a light blinking on top.  We only saw it for a few seconds then it was blocked by hills.      It could have easily been a blimp but when we came back to check ten minutes later we saw nothing. And when we saw it before it was not moving.

As the train pulled up to the Edison Station, I noticed a small white, oval object hanging in the partly cloudy western sky, approximately 30 to 40 degrees from the horizon. It was about the size of an aspirin viewed edge-on and held at arm&#39;s length. The object appeared to be slowly changing shape, like an egg rotating on its short axis. I could not tell if there was any sound because I was inside the train. The object blended in with the background enough that if you looked away, it would take a few seconds to spot it again. It appeared to be illuminated by reflection from the sun, and it stayed in the same spot as the train pulled away from the station. It did not look like a helicopter as I did not notice a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then saw 2 small lights moving across the north side of the cornfield.  After 2 to 3 minutes they came back across the field and disappeared.  The field continued to be lit up for several more minutes.  Then the light went out and it was completely dark again.  At no time did I hear any type of sound and at no time did the light move.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A helicopter looked to be chaseing the UFO but really looked as though it was just fallowing it to look at it closer. Then the light of the UFO faded out a little as it began to move slowely about 30Mph toward the ocean away from UCI going towards Newport COast. Then for a sort moment it looked like a meteor flying with a trail on each side, but really it just had a bright orange light on the front of it and the light faded from the front to the rear of the UFO giving it the meteor affect. Suddenly it disapeared into the sky and that was the end, for a few moments the helicopter circled the hill and I flashed it once but it left just shortly after the UFO left.  Moments later about 30 minutes or so later, I looked towards UCI and ElToro base, then suddenly 5 to 6 flashes of white light flashed into the sky all in about 1 second, then just as the white lights finished flashing about 5 to 6 more flashed but in the color of electric blue, same amount of timing. My night was completed. Thanks to the government, I almost had a heart attack. It was my second time, but not this close. First sighting was about 400 yeard + away.

Shaped in somewhat of an arc, there were more than 8 of these lights.  All white in color, and clustered close together.  It almost appeared to be an effect of something breaking through cloud cover.  The brightness was intense.  The object(s?) did not appear to move as I had pulled over to the side of the road to watch from a stationary vantage point.  The object(s?) were stationary during their entire appearance.  And just as they had appeared all at once, they &#34;went out&#34; in the same fashion.  The direction I observed these/this object(s?) was towards the Fort Campbell, KY side of Clarksville.  Although I would guess that the distance was not far enough away to place it on the post.  This could have been maybe up to 4 miles away from my position.  As to the size, I&#39;m guessing VERY VERY LARGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had parked on the uppermost roof level of a parking deck, adjacent to Baltimore&#39;s city hall. After admiring the view of the lit up city hall dome to the north of me, i continued towards my car due north. I turned to my right, or the east, and saw a series of very dim lights in a chevron formation moving quickly to the south. The arrow shaped arrangement of lights meaned there were possibly 5 or 6 on each &#34;wing&#34;These lights were very dim, and i could barely see them. However, they did continue to move in an erratic pattern to the south until i could not see them anymore. The boject made no sound, and the lights stayed relative to their original position on the craft. If it was not some type of spacecraft, I think it could have possibly been a kite, or possibly a flock of birds. Barring an optical illusion on my part, it could not have been much else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object didn&#39;t appear to be moving, but the light (goldish orangish)did vary in intensity.  I calculated it to be in almost a direct line with Orions dagger which was pointing in a southerly ground direction so I could go home and see what planet it might be.  It suddenly disappeared.  No clouds in the sky...half moon in the other half of the sky.  Strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A perfect description of the dramatically bright, twinkling star, Sirius.  PD))<n>

We noticed a broght light moving very fast from east to the west, north-west; from overhead to around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. It was approximately the size of 3 or 4 stars put together and was whiteish in color.  The city street lights were so bright that I said that it must be low to be seen below the clouds.  Once we got out of the city, we saw the stars come out because the sky was clear so this object had to be very bright to be seen by us through the street lights.  It covered the distance in the sky in 2 seconds and did not leave a trail.  I am familiar with seeing satelites, conventional aircraft, and meteors and this definately was not one of those.  Two other couples at our family get-together saw the object as well.  I am trying to convince them to write a report.  They were also west bound on I-94 when they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very high in the sky and was the size of a ball point pen tip held at arms length.  I normally would have passed this off as a plane, but I had exactly that to compare it to in the sky.  The object passed behind the contrail of a jet airplane moving in the opposite direction, but left no contrail of it&#39;s own.  Also, the object seemed to reflect the sun&#39;s rays inconsistently, and was not constantly illuminated by the sun as the airplane moving in the opposite direction.  The thought passed through my mind that it may be a satellite, but I have never seen such from the ground with no visual aid.  Lastly, I detected no characteristics of the object from the list below.  (Is that odd?)<n>

Shaped like an upside U.|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33571.html|379|ndxe200312| Bright object seen in sky while driving to work. Shaped like an upside U.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a stop light on my way to work on 12.1.03. I was looking at the clouds because it was a nice day w/lot&#39;s of clouds. I seen an object high in the sky that struck my eye because it was bright and amongst grey clouds. The best way I can describe it was that it was like a U shaped light bulb, floursent. it was like a u upside down w/two long parallel shafts. I couldn&#39;t really see the top part so it may not have actually been U. I looked to see why it was so bright and seen the sun peaking through the clouds but it couldn&#39;t explain in my mind why it was shinning. it wasn&#39;t a reflection type of shine. it was throughout the object and did not flicker. It was almost like a giant luminous light bulb. It was like the light was the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell it wasn&#39;t moving because the clouds were moving through it or around it.  I sat and watched this for the few minutes that I sat at the light. I noticed the women in the car next to me notice it as well. I sat there focused on the object trying to logicly justify what it was but could not. The light then turned green and I had to drive on. I tried to look for it as I drove but when I got that chance to look up it was gone. I am new to the area and I heard there is an air base near by. It did not look like anything we would be flying??? I have never seen an object in my 32 years of life that struck me like this. It was as if as soon as I seen it I thaught &#34;wow, i&#39;m looking at a ufo&#34;. I wasn&#39;t freaked out or scared but felt very peaceful. I told as many people as possible when I got to work. They looked at me like I was crazy but I didn&#39;t care. I kept telling it over and over. Maybe it can be explained but the feeling it left me w/can&#39;t be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/1/03 05:50|Washington|MI|Changing|2 hours, 5 mins|Observed for two hours a bright white light, with two chevrons of bright white light on one side move erratically in the sky.|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33515.html|380|ndxe200312| Observed for two hours a bright white light, with two chevrons of bright white light on one side move erratically in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a clear southern sky at 5:50 am while getting the newspaper, I looked up and noticed a bright white light (like a distant star) moving evenly to the south. My first impression was that of a satellite. Suddenly the object moved in the opposite direction, toward me, and became much closer and brighter. It&#39;s movement hesitated, almost stopping, and hovered. It appeared at times to be a bright round ball of white light with two chevrons of light of equal length on one side of the round ball of light. The side chevrons appeared on one side (180 degrees of the sphere) only. For two hours I watched in amazement as the object moved erratically, in seemingly random but tight patterns. After the first half hour of my observation I awakened my wife and she also observed the object. Gradually with random, back and forth, circular movement and up and down motion, it moved in a northwest direction further and further away - but very slowly. After 1 1/2 hours I asked my wife to awaken my daughter. My daughter also observed what we saw. At times of movement the object appeared to leave a faint trailing edge of light. The tips of the chevron at times appeared to twinkle. After two hours and five minutes of observation, now daylight, the light moving farther and farther away (higher in the sky) I lost sight - just as cloud cover moved in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think it may have been a blue color. It was moving in a fast motion and in weird ways it seemed to be moving further away from me and then I went to call for someone and when I went outside again it was gone. I can&#39;t remember the size but it was big but not as big as a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/1/03 02:00|Lemoore|CA|Light|10 minutes|Bright red light , moving upwards and at crazy angles|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33600.html|382|ndxe200312| Bright red light , moving upwards and at crazy angles<n> <n><n> <n><n> ok.. me a a freind of mine when we got off of work at NAS LEMOORE NAVAL BASE, we headed down to the river not to far from base.It was a very clear night and i recall seeing a few shooting stars. We settled down fishing off one of the damns that were there and we seen what we thought was a flare being shot off. It just topped over the tree line and it stopped .. we thought nothing of it. Well it started moving towards us slow,and upwards and the same time. This really really intense light started moving faster making these very sharp turns... we watched it do this for about 5 minutes as it was moving upwards. There was this flash,and right after that we seen like a tail as if it was moving like a comet would but only going up. Shortly after the flash,this red ball of light vanished... FAST and at another really sharp angle. Adding to this.. i work on this base.. i know every aircraft that is here, I know alot about many of the planes that fly around here. I know for a fact that it isn&#39;t  one ofthem around here that can fly that fast a make sharp turns as this did. Also i know what position light and taxi lights look like on many of the aircraft and none have this big ass red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
