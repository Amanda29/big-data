When the car quit running I thought that maybe there way a wire loose and went into the glove box for my new flashlight.  All of the lights on the car went out also except the idiot lights on the dash.  I put the flashlight togather and it would not work.  I took out my lighter and got out to check the engine.  My mother was helping look for loose wire ect. and was right next to me.  Being late at night and next/ between wood and a swampy area you hear a lot of frogs, owls,dos and other night dwellers calling.  When the noise stopped my mom started looking around to see why.  I was still under the hood trying to see what was wrong with the car.  When mom asked me what that thing was I didn&#39;t really understand what she was talking about until she pointed out the craft.  As there was no moon its a little hard to tell the size but I think that it was about as big as a football field long and twenty to thirty feet high.  It had lights around the edge.  These lights flashed in an altrenating pattern of red, white, yellow and blue or green.  There was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly following the power lines down the river.  I guess that we watched this object for three to five minutes.  In all this time there wasn&#39;t a sound from any animal in the area, but the minute that it went out of sight all the frog, owls ect. started back up.  Mom and I got back in the car and were trying to figure out what to do whent I noticed that the headlamps were back on.  I looked at Mom and said maybe the car would start.  Sure enough it started just like a new car and we drove on to Lone Rock and the first bar.  That was the only time I have ever had a drink before going to work. Mom and I only talke to each other about this for years.  No one else.  After she died in 1981 I did talk to a few other people but they seem to think that I was having fun at their expense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/22/67 22:30|Albuquerque|NM|Unknown|~1hr|A property search and a  "close encounter" with unknowns?|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37423.html|2|ndxe196709| A property search and a  &#34;close encounter&#34; with unknowns?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, I am a 52 year old man. I&#39;m not sure this fits in this arena, and it has taken me more than 35 years to come to grips with this; Sitting in my apartment at my parents watching the news, I heard my dogs barking a lot more than usual for the badgers that ran around my area. Then they stopped all at once. I remember feeling my hair raise up and stay there, like a static generator was next to me. I got out of bed and went outside to see what was going on and saw nothing unusual. Coming back inside, I went to bed watching the news. Less than a minute after I laid down, a voice (somewhat mechanical sounding) said; &#34;I want you to come with me.&#34; OK. I&#39;m scared now. There were a lot of strange things happening in this time and I was thinking I was being sought out by some cult or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and went into my closet and got my .38 pistol and went back outside. I still saw nothing different. The voice again said: &#34;I want you to come with me.&#34; This time it was less mechanical sounding and more gravely. My dogs still weren&#39;t barking, but they wouldn&#39;t come with me around the property (~5 acres). My bitch aussie growled at the next shed and wouldn&#39;t come closer than about 25 feet. The voice came up again saying the same things and still the gravely voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the apartment and closed and locked the door and called my dad in the next house. He told me I was dreaming but would meet me outside and check the place out. We checked the house, the shrubs around the property and the sheds. We found nothing. The dogs STILL wouldn&#39;t come with us to the sheds, but were playful and jumping round us until we got to that shed. There was nothing in it that we hadn&#39;t put there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some barefoot prints in the dusty ground about the place. They did not look like human prints, and didn&#39;t look like any animal I had hunted or seen. They weren&#39;t very clear because it was real dry and quite fine silted soil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some strange sounds like a high pitched whistle that came and went as my dad and I were moving from the shrubs to the sheds. But we didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no memory of anything after that. Not going back into the house, not getting back into bed or saying good night to my dad. He has no memory of anything beyond our checking the sheds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More than an hour passed from the time I went outside the first time and the time I came back inside.. The news was over and Johnny Carson was on TV when I came back. This property inspection normally took about five minutes to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

The light disappeared behind a grouping of trees.  As we continued down the road the lights reappeared in the road, one half mile in front of us. We were unable to discern the shape, as we were looking directly into three bright white lights framed by two larger red lights. The five lights spanned the two-lane road country road.  As we stopped and turned away from the lights, the object moved quickly in our direction. As we approached a more populated area the object shot straight up into the night sky.  We reported this sighting to the county sheriff’s office.  Two local papers, the Journal Herald (no longer in print) and the Dayton Daily News, picked up the story from the police report and published reports from our interview.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was called out class, both of us being high school seniors, and interviewed at length by uniformed U.S. Air Force, Project Blue Book officers.   I was later called of class and interviewed by the same officers. In addition to the interviews, the investigating officers conducted some type of radiation test in the area where we reported seeing the object. They indicated to me that they were able to record a higher than &#34;background&#34; radiation count.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was observed by one of our teachers who later reported to my friend and I that she also saw a bright light shoot straight into the sky.  She was on a road, over looking Tipp City, approximately three miles due east of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An official Project Blue Book report was filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

In all of these years, I have never reported this event nor told many people about it.   I am retired now, but had a long career in public service and can be vouched for by many for being a conservative, level headed and highly credible individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of the shower (directly to the outdoors as the shower was simply a wood frame with a 55 gal drum on top filled with water and a spigit to release the water) late in the evening so it was dark (and almost no ambient light in the Viet Nam boondocks) and the night sky highly visible with no cloud cover.  The Viet Nam night sky is almost devoid of stars except for a few scattered along the northern horizon and the moon was either not out or not bright.  In that type of setting, I always look up at the sky as I do anywhere I have a good view of the night sky.  I am a habitual night sky watcher, but not in any amateur astronomer sense, rather just looking at the stars and the Milky Way when I am where I can see them and watching for satellites (I think having been able to watch Sputnik pass overhead when I was in high school had something to do with that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, all that was in the sky was an object that was about 40 degrees above the northern horizon at about my 2:00 o’clock as I stood facing northwest.   The object looked the way a satellite looks in the night sky in terms of size, shape and reflected light, but that is not what is was.  Rather than moving in a straight line across the sky (although satellites can look a little wobbly at times, which this did not) it was moving in a sharp zig zag pattern, while at the same time making forward progress at a rate much slower than a satellite moves across the sky.   Although the forward progress was not fast, its sig zag movements were very quick.  The sig zag movement was very sharp and precise in the distance it moved right to left and in the angle it moved forward with each sig and zag.  This movement was not erratic in any sense of the word nor was the object wandering in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the object moved side-to-side in a sig zag movement, its forward progress was in a straight line across the sky, moving from my right towards my left.  I stood and watched the object for about ten to fifteen minutes.  During that period of time, the object moved from about my 2:00 o’clock to about my 12:30 and was now around 70 degrees above the horizon.   In that period of time, a satellite would have traveled all of the way across the sky and disappeared (actually in much less time).  This was no satellite.  As the object reached about my 12:30, it suddenly stopped and then shot straight up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for a minute in sort of a dumbstruck daze before walking back to my tent.  I have no idea what I saw, but had a strong feeling that I had observed something that was not from this world.  I didn’t say anything about it to anyone and as I said above, have hardly ever spoken of it to anyone in all of these years.  But I have long wanted to report what I witnessed (and unfortunately I was alone with no others near at the time) and so I now have (and also to MUFON).  If it is possible, it would be great to hear back any thoughts regarding my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light moved vertically and horizontally stopped and hovered. I thpught it wa a helicopter and I just kept watching it. It started to moved closer to my location. It moved so close that I could make out the shape and color. It was triangluar inshape with rounded corners. It appeared to be a light of white body color and had resessed round lights the pulsated around the base and changed color and intensity of color as it moved around the base of the craft. the color og the lights changed from white to variations of yellow then light green getting progressively darker green then pink to various shade of pink to red. I went outside to get a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> there was no sound no wind it was huge relative to my frame of reference and possibly 20 stories up. the craft hovered over our location for 30 seconds and then moved off. I went upstairs to tell  my parents and to see if they had seen it. They had no and by the time we alerted them it was just another moving lightinthe sky. We did not reportit at the time beause the police would assume that we were a couple of stoned teenagers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note;  Many many years later I brought the subject up to my parents again. My father mentioned that he as a youth had seen a UFO in Illinois. I asked him to describe what he saw and he described the same object I had seen. Parents particulary fathers are not inclined to remember the ravings of a 16 year old girl.  I can only conclude that we saw the same object several decades apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for the very delayed reporting of this but I only just found out about you. thank you so much for all of your hard work and dedication. As for myself all I can say is the question of whether or not there are UFO&#39;s is one question I do not have to wrestle with . The answer is yes and it was not a UFO for I identified it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you again<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We hid on a hillside over looking the ocean as it was beginning to get dark.  A 2nd trooper and myself were sitting on the hillside looking west with a few tree scattered about us. We had a good view of the ocean. Movement from the right attracted my attention. Crossing rapidly from the South to the North was a circle of light approximately the size of a dime,relativly speaking,moving at a tremendous speed. This was unlike any aircraft, rocket, or astronomical object that I had ever seen before. I was an astronomy hobbiest and Science Teacher prior to my military envolvement so had some experience in sky observation. The other trooper also witnessed this event and we both spoke at the same time saying, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; The object passed from our view in 6 to 8 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My husband took the eldest son to the local shop, should have been away about 20 minutes. He did not return until about four hours later we were getting worried over the two of them.  Then he returned and we wanted to know where he had been, his reply was to the shop.  He did not realise how long he had been away.  Then my son started talking about where he had been, he described somemen and what I realised later was very much like the inside of a space ship.  He did say what the men had done but to be honest I cant remember that bit. This child was too young less than 3 years old at the time so he had no prior knowledge to draw from.  It has been on my mind ever since and I am glad that I have told you now at least I have shared the experience.  He was not harmed in any way but was always intelligent as a child.  Shortly after their return we saw an object in the sky it was a cigar shape at first but then it turned and was a cicular shape as you imagine a ufo really it turned and was gone in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  NUFORC has received many reports that are similar to this one.  We do not understand how young children, who apparently have had little or no exposure to the UFO phenomenon, can apparently possess seemingly detailed knowledge about the specifics of the subject.

9/15/67 00:00|Cedar Point|KS|Light|5 minutes|It is interesting to me tht I've had three encounters. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64768.html|10|ndxe196709| It is interesting to me tht I&#39;ve had three encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting my experiences having noticed the heightened awareness of UFO’s, i.e. the History Channel.  Therefore, I am submitting these events purely for the sake of your collection of data. I&#39;m sorry but I prefer to put all reports into this one, I hope you don&#39;t mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Experience 1 of 3 It was in 1967.  I was 12 years old living on a farm in Kansas.  I was on the second floor in my bed about midnight or after, not sure.  I awoke to see flashing lights, like an ambulance, coming across the corn field hovering just above the corn. It came into the farm yard and hovered making all sorts of loud noises like sirens.  A bright light lit up everywhere and that was the last I remembered till the next morning when I ask everyone at breakfast, “What was that big light and all those sirens?” Nobody new what I was talking about and it was accounted to a dream.  Of course to me I felt I was not dreaming at all, however, it did stop after the bright light peaked. So I concluded maybe it was a dream, but really didn’t buy it.  I let it go nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting thing about this experience is what happened 25 years later. For some reason it started to bug me that I never resolved that experience I had at 12.  I had insurance and wondered if I could get hypnotherapy  to recall what really happened.  To my surprised I was able to see a license hypno-therapist.  It became legit because the therapist said it was most likely some trauma that caused the experience and I suppressed it to this particular memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He put me under hypnosis and regressed me back to that night.  I recalled the story as it unfolded while in my regressed state.  The story was very similar to the memory I had except that I was able to see more of what happened in the farm yard.  I was up out of bed and looking out the window.   I saw two lights whirl around in a gyroscope fashion.  They kept doubling until there was nothing but a ball of light and then the white out happened.  When the session was over I ask the doctor what he thought about it. He said, &#34;I have no idea, perhaps a dream (?), but I don’t really no for sure.&#34;  He did say there was no sign of trauma, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One further note, after this session I found I had a very difficult time talking about it. I even wondered if the doctor, while having me under, put a notion in me to not talk about it.  Because every time I tried, I’d wind up saying, &#34;forget it, I can’t talk about it.&#34;  I would even get like a lump in my throat and words just wouldn’t come out.  That was 14 years ago, it’s only been in the last 5 years or so I’ve been able to discuss it as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Experience 2 In 1975 I was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip.  We were just coming to the west end of our town.  We both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. It zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour.  It went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds.  It left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far.  I stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, HWY 56 in Kansas).  We got out and could see nothing.  Both of saw and described the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Experience 3 This was January 1, 1997.  I was backpacking in the Mark Twain Forest of Missouri.  It was about 11pm.  I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together.  Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.  Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.<n>

School went into recess for a month to allow students to participate in the potato harvest (in the northeastern tip of Maine).  My best friend and I were &#34;picking potatoes&#34; one afternoon and as I was taking a breather I noticed a silver disk slowly skimming across the top of a narrow strip of trees about one-eighth of a mile away.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise at all and did not observe any lights. It was not rotating. I said to my friend, &#34;Look at that!&#34;  It continued on its path just above the swath of trees until we could no longer see it.  I observed this object for about 10 seconds.  My friend and I both decided to do an oral English report on our sighting, but he backed out and I ended up doing it alone.  I got the whole spectrum of reactions. Loring Air Force Base was in the immediate vicinity, about 5 miles away.  I grew up watching all kinds of planes fly through our rural skies (including B-52s).  This thing was nothing like what we were used to seeing flying out of Loring.  I&#39;ve always felt that it was extraterrestrial.  That was the strong impression I had at the time.  I have come to believe that this craft was scoping out Loring A.F.B.  There was an incident, called &#34;The Loring Incident&#34; which occurred in 1975 wherein discs of unknown origin hovered over Loring&#39;s nuclear weapons depot unchallenged, 5 feet off the ground; it resulted in about a dozen more Air Force Bases nationwide being put on a heightened state of alert. I had another sighting in July 1972 in the same general area.  I was laying on my back on the high-dive of a camp pool on a cloudless Maine night.  The stars are so clear and thick on these Maine nights that you feel you can reach out your hand and scoop out a bunch of them with your hand.  Zero urban light interference. What I saw was a medium-bright &#34;star&#34; in the night sky that zig-zagged down the horizon, paused, and then retraced its path to where I had first seen it move.  Then it faded to black and that was the end of it.  This lasted about 15 minutes.  Again, this UFO was, in effect, if not in actuality, directly over Loring A.F.B. Loring A.F.B. was the SECOND air force base to store atomic warheads. (The first was in New Mexico where the bomb was developed.) I had a third sighting in West New York, New Jersey, in March, 1997 (across the Hudson River from New York City).  At sunset I looked out a window facing south and saw a bar of bright light suspended in the sky; it did not move.  I looked at it through my 10-power binoculars.  It looked like pure energy.  No surface or texture of any kind was visible, just this blazing cylinder of golden-white light.  It was beautiful. It was three times as long as it was wide.  It was hanging in the sky at an angle, not straight up and down. I watched it for about 30 minutes and then had to get some sleep before going to work that night.  When I woke up later it had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was approximately 9:30 in the evening.  It is important to note that the dining room windows of the house face the Kentucky hills and the Ohio River Bottom lands.  We were finishing up for the night, when my sister (who was emptying a thermos out the dining room window) reported having seen a strange &#34;red&#34; light in the sky.  By the time we got to the window, of course, what she had seen was no longer there.  Our curiosity was arroused enough to go outside in the cool Autumn air. We were standing on the corner of the house (me, my Mother, Sister, and very small niece and nephew) when from the North, over the house which sits on a hill in front of my sister&#39;s house came the first &#34;craft.&#34;  I would like to mention at this point that I am an avid fan of aviation, and very familiar with aircraft (although I do not have a pilot&#39;s license).  The craft was &#34;elliptical&#34; shaped approximately the size of a 747 (today) if a curved lines were drawn from wing tip to wing tip and from nose to tail.  It had a superstructure.  Quite frankly, although this was YEARS before the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I would have to say that it resembled a smaller version of the Mother Ship in the movie that came over Devil&#39;s Tower.  It had a band of very irridescent lights on it&#39;s rim, which seemed to flash in a red-colored sequence.  There were windows, or &#34;portholes&#34; on it&#39;s body, and superstructure.  Except for a very low, almost inaudible hum, it made no noise.  It slowly passed over my sister&#39;s house, went approximately another 200 yards, and hovered over the fields of the river bottoms. We stood in amazement at this event, and while we watched in awe, another craft, identical in description flew over and hovered close to the first at a lower altitude level.  Then, a 3rd, 4th, and finally the 5th craft.  Once the final craft was in position, it seemed as if they were communicating with each other using the sequencial lights, and some very bright lights on the superstructure.  Suddenly each one emitted a very bright white light, and then went totally dark.  The time frame from fly over of first craft to the darkening of the ships was approximately 30-35 minutes. After the crafts went dark, they each did a ultra-high speed vertical climb, as their form could be seen in the clear, moonlit night.  Although my family and I did not report this to officials (and I&#39;m somewhat nervous about reporting this to you, although for all these years I&#39;ve wanted to tell someone other than the VERY close friends that I have told) for fear of being ridiculed.  There were reports in the local newspaper the next day of &#34;Strange Lights Appeared over Ohio Night Sky.&#34; This event to me was proof-positive that there is life out there.  In addition, being a person who does believe in a &#34;supreme being&#34; I find it ridiculous that in this vast-endless universe, on this tiny planet, that we are so &#34;special&#34; as to be the only form of intellegent life.  The event of the late 60&#39;s has also left an embedded desire to see crafts, or have an encounter again.  I find myself looking up to the heavens a lot of times when I&#39;m outside at night.<n>

About 1 mile out they simply stopped and hovered there for a minute and then left even more quickly than they came.  When they left, they went back in the direction they had come from, the horizon, and it was so fast that they almost seemed to diappear.  Everyone saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/7/67 22:00|Dublin (Republic of Ireland)||Circle|7 minutes|20-25ft classic circular hovering UFO.  Amazing object to behold!|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49142.html|16|ndxe196709| 20-25ft classic circular hovering UFO.  Amazing object to behold!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting occured in Sep. of 1967 [two years before the Moon landing of Apollo-11 - I was very interested in the space-race at that time]. UFO (flying disc/saucer) seen first at a distance of about 1 mile to the north of the city. Approached/descending and came up the middle of the street in housing estate [four miles from city centre]. Hovered overhead for about 2 minutes at a height of about 20ft. Trapezium shaped window on side of the circular craft. Flying machine rotated on its axis 180 degrees and window moved to other side. It was so low that I could actually look into the craft through the window of this machine - whitish interior - nothing else observed through this window [obviously, if there was a window something could look out of it]! Sighting occured at around 10pm - twilight - craft kind-of blended into the dark sky background. Noiseless/silent. Looked like something out of a film. I was 12 years of age at the time of sighting. Amazing sight and left me with a sense of wonder at the time - flabbergasted/goggle-eyed/knew I had seen something really unusual - not from here. Also seen by my 13 year old brother who can confirm the sighting. At the time of the encounter we were out for a walk in local area. First thought the object was a plane/helicopter - bright white spotlight underneath the craft turned off as it approached. Knew immediately that it was a &#39;classical&#39; typical UFO [from watching TV programmes and newspapers/magazines of the time]. Object moved/floated up the street over the tops of the houses in a southerly direction for a distance of about 150ft. After about 5 minutes the disc/object shot up into the sky at high speed. Dark metallic blue colour - very close sighting, typical UFO - very distinct as such. Looked like a flying machine from 200 to 500 years into the future. Impressive, very visual, solid-flying-machine, unmistakable as UFO and typical of the photographs that I have seen of these things. No markings on craft to identify it. Seen at very close proximity - less than 20 ft from the ground - saw the underside of the machine. Circular shape. Hovered above houses in local area - just above the roofs. At one point directly overhead. Have read extensively about the subject over the years. My personal conclusion: UFO&#39;s are real - seeing is believing. Origin: probably other dimensions. UFO&#39;s/NDE&#39;s possibly related. We are not just biological creatures but also spiritual beings. There is a bit more to the universe than science/religion tells us or would care to admit [outside their box]. Even after all these years since the sighting [39 years] I am still amazed that I saw such an object and have not personally seen anything like it since. Find it very odd that after 60 years no answer/explanation to the subject of UFO&#39;s has been forthcoming from science/religious communities.  Presently interested in astronomy [have 16-inch Newtonian telescope] &amp; chess. Christian. The UFO enigma seems to be a conundrum/puzzle/mad-hatter&#39;s riddle - a world-wide phenomena - a question with no answer, as yet. Yes - people are seeing and photographing these objects. Many hoaxes have been reported but I think a high-percentage are geneuine reports. Billy Meier&#39;s pictures are very good [possibly real] but I think his story is off-the-wall, a diatribe which ruins his case. This testimony is geneuine, honest and true. I have no ulterior motive in reporting it [similar report also sent to Mufon website in Feb-06]and would like to remain anonymous although you may contact me privately by email if you like. Do you believe in fairies/UFO&#39;s/angels/God?  What is the sound of one hand clapping? What is the riddle of the Sphynx? Who are we/what are we? What is the nature of reality? Is there life after death? What do you think of NDE reports? Is the Ark of the Covenant under the Temple Mount? Is this the end of the age? Is the Christian story true? Are there codes embedded in the Bible text? Are crop-circles telling us something - symbolic? There are more questions than answers and the more you understand the less you know! Well, that&#39;s about it from me - I hope you find this report interesting and believable?  Just file it away with the other 1,000,000 sightings that have been reported over the years. I&#39;m hoping that someday somebody will come up with the real answer to this phenomena and enlighten us all - a logical, lucid, rational, believalbe, provable, truthful explanation will suffice - at the moment we are living in a fog of possible solutions, bubble-geum answers with no end in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I am sure of is myself, brother, mother and father were standing in our front yard in Mt Washington, Maryland, and we saw this craft slowly drifting across in front of us about 300 feet away and 300 feet up.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, glider, balloon, inflated object (hoax) or anything we have ever seen.  It reminded me now of the Jefferson airplane blimp if you ever seen that on their album or poster.  It sort of looked like a cross between a box kite and balloon but was not either of those at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was close enough that I remember seeing the operator of this craft staring at us, as it drifted by.  Time seemed to stand still and it also seemed as though we were under the control of the operator of this craft--very, very strange indeed.  I think about this often and would love some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have other experiences which have happened later on in my life which really make it seem as though I’ve been abducted several times.  I honestly don’t think these experiences were dreams and probably should have my brain tapped into to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There was a large tree in the open field next to the dirt road we were walking on and he told me to jump the pasture fence and go check it out. As I was looking up at the tree, facing the opposite direction from the others who were still walking along, I saw an object come over the treeline in the distance, some 1/2 mile away. It moved rapidly and silently over the field and was gone in an instant. I yelled at the others and asked them if they saw it also, and they said saw what, we didn&#39;t hear anything? That was when I realized that I had not heard any sound either. It was like two silver pie pans with no lip inverted upon each other. It was wobbling side to side as it passed,and could not have been more than a few hundred feet up, depending on the size which I would estimate from the tree it went over to be between 30-40 feet in diameter. We had large planes from Fort Campbell fly over occasionally, they seemed to turn west off our barn roof after we had painted it with silver aluminum paint. I know what they looked like, and sounded like, this was nothing like anything lfying craft I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Large number of police saw 3 objects within an hour of our sighting but on the other side of mountain that they disappeared over.  Interceptor aircraft attempted to engage.  See below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime around this time,  (1966-1969)...It may very well have been Labor Day Weekend in Sep 1967, I was camping near Crestone, Colorado with several cousins.  It is 40 miles north of Alamosa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just watched the sunset and could just see the other side of the valley to the west.  We all saw the same thing.  I saw it first.  It looked like a very large meteor was about to hit the other side of the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got everyone&#39;s attention as the object got closer.  It was a ball of fire coming down from space.  At around 30,000 feet, it split into three balls of fire.  At that point our mutual reaction was that it was a mirved missile hitting the western range of mountains surrounding the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to take cover behind a very large boulder when the three objects made a 90 degree turn and came across the valley straight at us.  Our thoughts later were that they were intelligent and had detected us watching and decided to buzz us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took approximately 5 seconds to cross the 40 mile wide valley flying perfectly horizontal and in a 3 abreast formation with one slightly ahead of the one on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at about 9000 feet on the side of the 14,000 foot Crestone Mountain range.  The three objects were trailing several thousand feet of sparks (?) and looked like they would pass just overhead and hit the mountains behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rushed to the other side of the boulder and took cover, but the three objects disappeared over the mountains peaks to the east.   We stood around in silence for a few moments and then started asking each other what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all recent college graduates.  I  was leaving for Air Force Officer&#39;s Training School on the 13th of September and then going to Pilot school, so it very well could have been September 1967 right before I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided that it could not have been UFO&#39;s or anything in the Human inventory, but we still were thinking (hoping) meteors.  We had all expected a huge impact explosion and minor earthquakes when they surely hit on the other side of the mountain range, but felt and saw nothing.  The three objects had made a roaring noise that had drowned out attempts to yell at each other until the silence after the passage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we went down to the Crestone trading post to buy a newspaper, but there was nothing in the paper.  We telephoned the Alamosa Sheriff&#39;s office and asked about large meteor impacts or UFO reports...nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, we bought another paper and discovered that less than an hour after our sighting the Colorado Prison on the east side of the Crestone Mountains had seen three lights hovering around the prison.  The Colorado Highway Patrol and local police had chased the lights around for over two hours while the off duty guards were recalled to duty in case of a helicopter prison break.  Nearly 300 police saw the lights that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the Colorado Highway Patrol called Petersen AFB to check for radar images and the base reported positively and at the request of the Colorado Highway Patrol launched two F106 intercepters.  The Air Force thought they were police helicopters patroling around the prison or looking for escapees and didn&#39;t know the lights were being chased by the police for two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilots had the images on radar shortly after takeoff and were closing fast.  The lead pilot asked for permission to fire weapons and while waiting, the radar images and the 3 lights went straight up accelerating far faster than an air to air missile could have flown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weapons release was never given to the pilots who had attempted to follow them until their F106&#39;s could climb no higher and the objects went out of sight straight up into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all purchased copies of the newspaper to keep forever, but none of us have ever been able to find those newspapers or any other record of the incident.  One of these days after I retire and have lots of time, I would like to find the old newspaper files.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgement even though we are all over 50 now.  In fact one of the cousins does not even drink coffee because it is a stimulant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any records of the incident I would gladly pay for copies.  It would be nice to have the hard copy documentation for my own satisfaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure my cousins that were there would also like to have copies of their own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a security clearance and still work for the US Air Force, one of the cousins is now a lawyer, and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and ex-Green Beret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This should be well documented because of the number of people that saw the lights near the prison and the newspaper article.((Number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
