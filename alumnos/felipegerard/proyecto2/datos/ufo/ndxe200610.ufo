Everyone (except for us and a couple other nighthawks) had gone inside and it was quiet.  I was aimlessly searching the skies, and my eyes fell upon an area between the roof of a house across the street and a tree in its front yard.  A green sphere flew up between the house and tree, moved left a short distance, and descended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wear glasses, and my first thought was that the light was a reflection from my eyes onto the lenses of the glasses, but my friend (who wasn&#39;t wearing glasses) said she saw the same thing I did.<n>

She made a joke about the fact that it looked like a jet intercepting some kind of UFO. I brushed her comments off at first, assuming she just saw jets or something typical of the Seattle area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-15 minutes later, after she had arrived, I was looking outside in my backyard and saw the exact same type of objects she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several of these high altitude objects in the sky over the next 20 minutes or so. Some looked like jets, but a few did not. I&#39;m no expert here, so for all I know these could be extremely high jets or it could just be a NORAD exercise or something, but someone said I should post it here so I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily, I caught some video of a couple of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ofjc7RiqPw#GU5U2spHI_4<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A contrail, we believe.

My back door faces east towards the I57 highway which is approximately 400 hundred feet to the east of my home.  I always check the sky and get an idea of the weather.  This was approximately 8:00 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the eastern sky which was mostly cloudy and immediately observed a giant circle of a hole - exposing a clear blue sky- in the clouds.  My first thought was that it was not normal.  I looked at it for several minutes, but the clouds never moved or closed over the hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned indoors, completed my preparations for work and departed the house at approximately 8:45AM.  I could still see that the huge hole in the clouds had not moved or grown any smaller.  I took the north entrance ramp to I57 at Burr Oak Avenue that kept the unusual sky to my immediate right at all times.  Traffic was moderately heavy for a Tuesday morning rush hour, but not slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to observe the sky constantly northeast or east of me for the twenty minutes it takes for me to drive from my home to my job on the southeast side of Chicago in the South Shore community.  The formation remained unchanged for the forty-five to sixty minutes that I observed it.  I recall that it was mentioned on the evening news during the weather report because people had called or e-mailed about it.  It was explained away as a cloud occurrence that may have been caused by jet fuel or engine fuel exhaust from a plane.  I thought, &#34;No Way!&#34;  I think a picture of it was sent to the Daily Southtown newspaper as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing about it because of the sighting that took place at O’Hare Airport occurred on November 7, 2006, and the disk that was observed hovering over the airport hanger was said to have created the exact type of hole which I observed in the eastern sky over the far south side of Chicago a week prior to this event at the airport.  I believe we had a visitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stared at it for a moment to watch it twinkle and noticed it changed colour. It distinctly changed from red to blue to bright yellow and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and told my spouse about it and ask him to come see it. They recommended I get the binoculars. So we looked through the binoculars, taking turns and were amazed and baffled by what we saw. It was an object suspended in the air that seemed to have at least three lights on it, maybe more, that I could see. The lights covering this object change colours constantly, from red to blue to bright yellow to green to blue to red again, all in the matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for a while so, I took what photos my camera would take and downloaded them. While looking at it with the naked eye I could see no other light near this object, but when I downlaoded the photo, there seemed to be two bright lights in the same vacinity as the one I saw with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I saw the same thing.

Sky was clear with many stars.  The craft was traveling north/south and was a triangular shape, somewhat like the stealth bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only noticed the craft because it was blocking out the stars behind and the craft seemed to reflect the glow of the city below it.  The flight was straight despite the high winds.  It never veered or moved from its path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When they were almost out of view one veered directly south and they disappeard from our view. Approx. 5 minutes later we saw seven more flying in the same direction but made a big left bank heading south until out of view. After 5-6 minutes we saw five more of the same things flying in a near perfect straight line north to south until out of our view. The objects looked like satellites, no blinking light, very distant, no sound or trails but moved faster and not in the straight line across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw to circular objects very high in the sky. I could not determine their speed and at first I thought it was a satilite. The objects were very clost together almost connected and as they traveled west north west they simply dissapered. At first I thought that they had moved behind a high cloud, but along the track that the object was going I could still see stars. I knew the object did not disapear into clouds but I still waited for about 10 minutes to see if it would re-apear. It never did. As I thought about it I thought that it could have been  an air craft heading for the local airforce base with its landing lights on. But the object that I saw was not projecting light, it look like it was reflecting light just as a satilite would, but it was not at that altitude. Were I to guess the altitude I would say it was at between 8 to 10,000 feet. And with the aircraft heading for the local airforce base you can hear they as they pass. This object made no sound at all. As it dissapeared it faded dimmed once,then again and then was gone<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Object moving toward Orlando International Airport, but opposite the other traffic flow observed from aircraft taking off/landing. Sky conditions were basically clear with some haze seen at higher altitudes. What made me finally decide to make a report was the fact that as the object moved from my left (North) and eventually departed from view to my extreme right (South), was that there was NO change in the aspect of the lights as one would expect if said lights were those of an aircraft&#39;s landing lights...even when the object was travelling AWAY from me the lights were the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was doing a 4pm-12am shift that night. It got pretty slow so i decided to take a walk and smoke a cigerette. It was very clear outside, you could see planes everywhere. I was standing in the parking lot facing east when i caught sight of a pair of very bright lights in the sky. I stood there looking at them for about 5 mins. I dropped me cigerette and ran back down the road to the main lobby. One of the security staff was sitting at the desk. I told him that i had seen a few bright lights in the sky and that i was going to the top of the 700 wing to get a better view.( that wing has 6 floors and the roof there is the highest part of the building.) I asked if he would come with me up there and he agreed. We took the elevator up then walked the 2 flights of stairs to get to the roof. We stepped out onto the roof and i immediatly saw the 2 lights right away. i pointed them out to the gaurd. We watched both lights for about 5 mins. One of the lights blacked out and was no longer visable but the one that was became even brighter. It began to move across the horizen towards the south. It then stopped and started to pulsate. When this began to happen i noticed there was a plane off behind and below the light. This is how we know that it was just hovering there. After a few more minutes i noticed the light had a black ring around the center of it. I turned to say something to the gaurd and when i turned back the light was gone. We looed around but couldn&#39;t see anything but then another light appaere and it looked just like the other. That light blinkked out as well after 30 seconds. After a a few minutes a dimmly lit object started to move towards the south, then what i thought was a plane started to follow the dim light. The 2 got very close, travelling almost parellel to each. Then the one i thought was a plane suddenly stopped following the other light and beganto get as bright as the previous object. It then dimmed out and was not visable.We didn&#39;t see any! thing el se the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home and told my brotherwhat i had seen and he looked at me in amazment and told me that he was driving down the road from the country club and saw a similar bright light in the sky that moved to the south and blinked out just like the lights the gaurd and i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They hover and shine bright when hovering (brighter than a star)and rise up (still shine bright when rising) and then move NE (towards Mansfield Lahm perhaps)  when flying, the crafts arent bright at all and have a blinking red light on one side of it and a blinking white light on the other side. was enuff dusk light to make out a Triangle Shape, with the back end indented. the 1st night i seen 2 of them 1 hovering over the other. both light brightly. each night i see at least 1 craft perform the same sequence in the sky, Fly SW, just to the SW side of Crestline then hover for around 5 mins or so (shining brightly) and then rise high in altitude (still shining brightly) and then fly NE out of sight. They do not make any noise at all. I have not seen them move from side to side, just forward, hovering or rising.  my impression is they are Government aircrafts..but what amazes me is...they have simular characteristics and impressions that have been described by astonishing UFO sightings that hover and shine bright. do we have some of this advanced technology tamed?  wow<n>

It started at MP(milepost)504. Our tracks are adjacent to Lake Michigan. I was going about 15 or 20 mph preparing to stop at a signal when I looked out on the lake. I say what I thought at the time was a boat. I was wondering what a boat so brightly lighted was doing out in the lake at 4:15am. It was so evenly lit I thought it had about 6 portholes evenly light that were reflecting off the water. Before I actually got stoped I got a signal to proceed. I started picking up speed and proceeding. The lake and the boat then disapeared behind a refinery that is on the lake. I didn&#39;t think much more of it until I got on the other side of the refinery. I looked over towards the lake I saw the same thing I had seen before but It was obviously not on the because there is brush and trees so you actually cant see the lake. It was a little closer and moving as fast as I was about 25 mph. I realized that what I thought was a reflection was actually some sort of underlighting. Not very bright but noticable. This object followed me until MP 509 a period of 5 or 6 minutes. Thats when it becomes populated and you get away from the water. It flew behind a power plant and 2 Marinas.

10/29/06 22:20|Spearfish|SD|Chevron|4 - 5 seconds|The object first appeared in the north sky.  My attention was drawn to what initially appeared to be a shooting star.  The first thing|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53225.html|28|ndxe200610| The object first appeared in the north sky.  My attention was drawn to what initially appeared to be a shooting star.  The first thing I saw was a flare of light moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  I was essentially facing directly north when I first sighted it.  The object was traveling downward and to my right (east).  As I watched the object it appeared to change course slightly - flaring to a more horizontal trajectory that was now headed generally southeast.  As the object changed course, I could clearly see a dimly lighted boomerang shaped object.  The delta shape was covered with soft, orange colored lights.  The fact that I was on a lighted residential street, along with the speed of the object and relatively soft lights eminating from it, made it hard to distinguish more detail.  While it was not possible to see in great detail, there was no question of its perimeter form.  From the time the object changed course until it vanished from sight was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  It was traveling at approximately the same speed one might associate with a shooting star - extremely fast.  It was a fairly clear night with gusty winds.  As the object receded out of sight, I listened intently for any indication of noise.  There was none.  Given the incredible speed it was traveling, I would have expected a sonic boom.  There was only silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was by myself, walking the dog at the time of the sighting.  While the initial flare of light may have caused others to look up, the remainder of the sight time happened so fast and with such minimal illumination, that it would have taken someone in nearly the same circumstances I was in, to see the same thing.  It happened so fast and was obscure enough that it was one of those instances where you had to be at the right place and right time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place approximately 45 miles northwest of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, SD.  I am accustomed to seeing both commercial and military air trafiic in the area at all hours of the day and night.  So, it seemed logical that there was a military connection given a flying object and proximity of an air base.  However, to travel across 1/4 of the night sky in 4 to 5 seconds is simply impossible by conventional standards.  The speed at which it left my sight was so great, it&#39;s difficult to effectively describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance away and size of the object are difficult to quantify.  Given that it started out appearing as a shooting star the perception was that it was near the edge of the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  However, as it corrected its course and leveled out, it appeared to be within 3 to 5 miles and roughly the same size, or slightly larger than that of a commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to call the control tower at the air base but was not able to find anyone willing to look into this.  I&#39;m not surprised.  I would guess that UFO sightings are almost always met with a high level of suspicion and doubt.  I have tried to logically explain what I saw and am left with nothing that makes any sense at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college graduate and active, local businessman.  My practical nature begs for an explanation that meets with some earthly criteria.  While I am intrigued at the prospect of extra terrestial life, I would best be described as an interested skeptic.  Although much of what happened defies explanation, I do know this - I clearly saw an object appear and disappear within 4 to 5 seconds.  During that time, I clearly saw a boomerang or delta shape that was covered with soft glowing orange lights.  What I saw was moving at a speed that so far exceeds what we are familiar with that it simply was not an aircraft as we know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/29/06 22:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Other|7- 10 seconds|Transucent/transparent, crescent, uni-wing shaped object viewed through binoculars filling field of view|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56551.html|29|ndxe200610| Transucent/transparent, crescent, uni-wing shaped object viewed through binoculars filling field of view<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must preface this report by saying that it is a secondhand account of this event.  It was observed and reported to me by my brother and his wife. I am 57, male, my brother is 55.  I am college educated at the master’s level. My brother works in technical design.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this sighting occurred on 10-28 or 10-29-2006 near 10 PM. in a suburb of Pittsburgh about ten miles from the center of town. A few weeks prior to this night my brother and wife went to a small observatory to view a comet. A couple of weeks later the comet had become bright enough to view with binoculars and on the evening  mentioned they were in their yard with binoculars, 7x35 and 10x50. The sky was dark and crystal clear without any cloud cover .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they were both looking through binoculars trying to locate the comet at a position bout 45 degrees above the horizon, my brother suddenly sighted something for which he has no explanation. He told me that he immediately realized that he would probably only have a brief  time to view what he was seeing and became intense in an effort to observe and remember details. This is where his report gets kind of weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main characteristic of  the object was, well, he said the best way he could describe it was,&#34;“It looked like the Romulan vessel (from the TV series Star Trek) when it would become cloaked (turning invisible).&#34;  He observed it for about seven to ten seconds.  During that time it was moving and changed direction twice.  The motion did not appear to be fast (unless this was much farther away than he realizes in which case the object would also be extremely large).  The first change in direction was about ninety degrees to the original motion and then ninety degrees back to the original path and then he lost sight of it. During this movement it moved toward him and overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked him about it’s altitude, he was uncertain since there were no clouds,only stars, but said if he had to guess it was probably cloud level or lower. Later he calculated size and distance by measuring the field of  view in his binoculars at a known distance on land. The image he saw that night filled the entire view of his binoculars. He concluded if it was 200 - 300 feet it must have been about two to three thousand feet high or about one half mile. Closer and it would have been smaller. He heard no noise. Fartheraway and it would have to be larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, he asked his wife if she had just seen anything. Her response after a moment of hesitation was, &#34;Well, it was kind of invisible.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told her not to say another word, not wanting to bias his memory of the observation.  He asked her to come into  the house.  He got two pieces of paper and they went into separate rooms to draw what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He showed me the drawings.  They were simple outlines.  Remember that it was invisible. Also remember that they were both looking through binoculars and the object filled the entire field of view in his 10x50.  One thing that I noticed between their drawings was that the overall proportion of width to length were quite the same.  The overall shape and proportion resembled a crescent moon but not as curved, more elongated.  And rounded, not pointed at the tips.  The leading edge was curved and smooth, however, the back edge was less curved and both curves bowed forward in the direction of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional detail noticed by my brother (looking through more powerful binoculars) but not his wife is as follows:  The back edge was serrated like a steak knife with seven points.  Along the entire front edge were what appeared to him as markings.  Each was a mirror image of the next and he described them as ornate curls as on a wrought iron railing or perhaps a curled animal’s horn.  This whole image appeared as translucent or transparent except for the details mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother could not come up with any possible explanation for what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He definitely ruled out clouds, vapor trails, etc.  It was moving, changed direction and maintained the definite shape as described.  He was glad his wife was with him in that their mutual observation verified the reality of the sighting.  Otherwise, he feels that he would question and have a hard time believing that he really saw this (?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was noiseless.  That is all I have to say - it was noiseless and flyng low with very very low lights and relatively quickly...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tell me what it was and I will buy you a brand new dinner... thanks folks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I think about it there was a strange noise - but there are train tracks nearby.  It sounded like a faint whisper - as if one wasn&#39;t picking up the correct radio station... but very very faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, and found him to be exceptionally credible.  He expressed bafflement over the sighting, particularly because of the absence of sound emanating from the object.  We may post his illustration.

Sorry if this is not good.  This object was quite prominent - like a triangle in the sky for actually (contrary to what I initially reported) roughly 90 degrees offset on the sky.  My apt. is backed in by a large concret wall.  But the object was in plain view from over the roogtops of the underlying apts. to the rooftops of the apts. beyong my place. It moved swiftly but seemingly slowly - I believe as a result of the non-sound and it distance from me.  Again it seemed actually fairly close - like I told the director on the phone - the size of a regular ish 727 - but now it seemed larger and further away.  Why didn&#39;t it make sound?  Was I hallucinating off of a vodka Diet Coke?  What the hell?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing - Orion was directly in the background of the sight.  I was actually atempting to see Orion and this thing interupted my observation.  Thanks very much  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #3))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry to write so many e-mails but I think I have a few more questions to answer...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was slightly larger than a full moon.  The lights were very faint and flew almost directly through the middle of what I think was Orion.  This is a notoriously smoggy area - but what I saw was really different from what I&#39;ve seen in the last twelve years of amueterish study of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I live under a flight path, so am usually looking up in the sky.  Something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye and I happened to look at the roof of our house facing east.  About 2 inches (to the naked eye) above my roof traveling north to south in a perfectly straight line was a bluish orb/sphere followed by a trail of white light (about an inch in perspective).  It moved quickly - faster than any plane I&#39;ve seen flying over (in a few seconds it traveled the length of my house and beyond), and was much larger than any of the planes that have passed overhead without also hearing them.  This was silent.  After a few seconds it faded quickly &amp; disappeared like it had passed into clouds.  However, Sunday night was a perfectly clear evening, and I watched for some time afterward to see if I caught it again.  I am reporting this because it was truly inexplicable, and unlike anything else I&#39;ve seen.  And I&#39;ve been going out there every night for the last three years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think those were all the colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had a circular shape in general with pointed ends around it at each different colored light. I estimate that it was close to 17-25 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to hover for about a half-second, then moved seemingly parallel to the ground over towards me, over my car and then onto the other side of the road above another house, all the time I could see the circle of very big bright lights, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it went over my car, it made no noise.

She lived with her sister at that point &amp; a new subdivision was being built about 500 yards down from their house.  Over this new sub we regularly saw lights and strange shapes darting about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking down the street (Benson rd) we saw a disc shaped object approximately a quarter mile ahead of us and probably around 10,000 feet up  It seemed to spin, and white lights shining from it began to blur as it spun around.  We kept walking and it appeared to follow us as we walked.  This all tripped me out due to the fact i was a new believer in UFOs, but she wasn&#39;t intimidated by the craft. she decided to blink her flashlight at it to see what would happen. after flashing the light at it, the craft fired off blue, green, and red flares in the same pattern as the light blinked.  We continued our walk, occasionally shining the light skyward with the same results as before.  The craft would also follow the light if we moved the light around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we headed back to the house, we shone the lights skyward again, illuminating the craft once more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the lights died, and it was not batteries dying.  Both light had freshly charged batteries before we left the house.  As we walked back, we kept looking  back to see the craft following us.  I cannot remember what the neighbors dogs were doing, but it was likely not their typical come out and challenge us behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had followed us all the way back and as it was over the neighbors house, my fiance  felt as if she was shaking or having a seizure.  As we got into the front yard, she suddenly collapsed to the ground.  I helped her to her feet and we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A final look out the front door showed the craft hovering above the front porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I ignored them, thought they were birds (maybe they were). Then I started noticing streams of light going over the road, at first they looked like falling stars and kept going from left to right. Then they starting sort of going back and forth, like two of them swirling, but I rationalized it as the reflection of our headlights against power lines. They also kept changing colour, the ones we noticed were purple, green, orange, blue, yellow, and white. I should also say they started out very thin, and slowly swelled up into the size of large ovals. The further we got to Cranberry Flats, the brighter they got, two white ovals slowly circling each other. At this point I was trying to rationalize it as spotlights. Neither my friend or I were saying anything to each other, I didn&#39;t want to say something in case I was totally hallucinating, and I didn&#39;t mind it if I was hallucinating. Anyway, the further out of town we get the brighter it is. Total silence, we miss the turn off to Cranberry Flats and she pulls into a side road to turn around to go back to the Flats. At this point I notice that the lights hovering and swirling in the sky are staying in one place. I think at this point I said to her &#34;What are those?&#34;  &#34;You noticed them too.&#34;  We turn around and start driving back into town, neither of us wants to look back. This time back into town I realize: There are no power lines going across the road. They are all along the side of the road. We&#39;re starting to compare notes and realizing we&#39;ve seen exactly the same thing. Both of us are terrified. Then my friend stops along the roadside to get out and see if they&#39;re still there, and they are, so she freaks out and jumps into the car. We keep driving until the turn off going east, and we look back and they are still there, still glowing white ovals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re finally in town, I&#39;m still freaked out, and we go to Diefenbaker to see if we can see them from there. Sure enough, there&#39;s those two swirling lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She drives me home and then after much debate convinces me to go out there with her again. And so I do, after MUCH reluctance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we get back to Diefenbaker by about 11:30 and they&#39;ve changed. They&#39;re still swirling, but this time they&#39;re green and acting somewhat like northern lights, just the way you see energy ripple off them. Some other people in the park seemed to be seeing them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drive to a couple other places in the city to see if we can see them from there, nada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we get some binoculars and go back out to look at them. This is about three hours after they first appeared, about 1 in the morning. This time, they&#39;re more like green ovally lights, without the nerthern-light type ripple, but they&#39;re moving COMPLETELY differently. Sometimes they swirl, sometimes they flash on and off. Sometimes they just speed past each other. Sometimes they change direction, sometimes they drive bomb, and just as we were driving away I also noticed them leap frogging and chasing each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also twice during our sightings they went from just a glow to a solid light.

10/28/06 20:00|Sedona|AZ|Other|30 minutes|At approximately 20:00 on the night of 10/28/06 my girl friend and I observed an object in the sky from our home in Sedona Arizona. The|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53184.html|41|ndxe200610| At approximately 20:00 on the night of 10/28/06 my girl friend and I observed an object in the sky from our home in Sedona Arizona. The object appeared to be at flight level somewhere between 30,000 AND 50,000 feet, located above a point midway between Kayenta and Flagstaff Arizona. At first we noticed a tight triangle of lights  with one of the lights brighter than the other. At first glance I thought it was an aircraft but then because the lights were not strobing and because it maintained a fixed position I realised it was not a conventional fixed wing aircraft. Then a &#34;V&#34; type of extension of lights began to light up extending upward and back from the central lights. These were amber colored changing to orange and then later almost a bluish color , then the lights receded back to the nucleus. I considered the possibility that this was a blimp and we were seeing it an angle when the craft abruptly gained altitude in a straight verticle motion. No blimp could have executed such a maneuver . It was an almost instantaneouss gain in altitude of what I would estimate to be 500 to 1000 feet. It remained in that fixed position, occassionally gaining and losing altitude in a similar fashion for almost 30 minutes. I got a pair of binoculars and observed that there were indeed three lights in a tight triangle but that around those lights was a kind of glow of an almost milky quality. Then the craft disappeared. I was looking at it through the binnoculars and told my girl friend &#34;I&#39;ve lost it&#34; . Putting the binnoculars down I saw points of light that appeared one after another in a large triangle  pattern progressing to the northwest across the sky in what could only be desctribed as &#34; great leaps&#34;. At first I thought that perhaps these were  four or five air craft with strobes on flying at different altitudes , creating a triangular pattern. However if that had been the case they would have continued across the sky. Instead they vanished. I believe it was the craft we observed making its way ac! ross the sky  and then vanishing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was completely clear. There was a crescent moon and none of our view of the object, either when it was in a fixed position or when it &#34;leaped&#34; across the sky was obscured by mountains. Sedona is a low light community so the visibility was excellent that night. I am a former private pilot and flew a twin engine Senecca over this part of the country  for several years. The object did not conform to any type of civilian or military aircraft with which I am familiar. If the  lights streaking across the sky in a triangular pattern was indeed this craft then there is nothing currently being flown which can remotely approach the speed at which this craft traversed the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was very far away up in the sky and stayed positioned in one spot all evening and until it could not be seen any longer after daybreak.  It changed or emitted colors bluish/green and orangish/red in flashes.  We could not make out the shape as the object was very far away and we were looking through binoculars.  The binoculars brought the colors into focus, otherwise it looked like a bright object.  What caught our attention was the brightness of the object and the fact that the object did not move from the same position and when we looked at it through binoculars we noted the color patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast forward three weeks until 10/28.  We noticed the same sentinel object in the northeastern sky as night fell.  This time my husband saw it go into position.  Also two other craft lined up in a triangle position and alternatively had a blinking pattern with the colors described above.  One or the other of the three objects would be brighter and exhibiting the colors.  At about the same time 19:30 in the northwestern sky we noticed 4 other bright objects in the sky with three of them making a triangular formation and the 4th object set back from one of the other three objects.  These four objects alternatively blinked brighter with the described colors.  We had dinner about 20:00 and at 20:30 went back outside to discover all but one object remained in the northeastern sky, the sentinel craft, in that one particular location in the northeastern sky that we noticed three weeks prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sightng of Sirius, we suspect.

Their change in positions seemed far too quick for airplanes, fighter jets or helicoptors.  No pinpoint lights or blinking lights.  No audible sound.

Now these were a visual I cannot get out of my head.  They flew over my house approx. at 10:15pm with 2 witnesses. You could see the moon and clouds reflecting in each one of the spheres as they passed under and toward the (full-ish) moon, which gave off a pinkish/white color.  They had scattered lines all around each of them (like a ball of yarn) and no sounds.  I watched these fly away from us and then vanish as soon as they flew out from under the low cloud formation.  Size and distance I judged with...if you took a quarter and held it up above your head.  Very thought provoking sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting was on Tuesday 10/23/06 where on my same back deck around 8:30 pm, I viewed a light in the sky the was stationary, blinked bright white for three seconds, then went dark for 5 seconds, and then repeated this three times.  On the third time it went dark, it seemed to fade out.  Now I know what I saw wasn&#39;t a plane, or helocopter, star blinking, meteor, flare....etc.  It was interesting enough to watch for it again, but never saw it repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my third, which happened on Friday night/Saturday morning at 12:40am made my heart jump into my throat, and beat five time faster.  I viewed a single craft of the triangle nature slicing through the low clouds, right over my head. This craft was in what I would call &#39;stealth-mode&#39; because you could not see the craft, but I could see the clouds rolling past the sides, and stearing the clouds behind it.  It traveled from the North, heading South very slowly, then banked toward the West after it passed over. I could not see it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I was frozen with fear for about 20 seconds before I went inside.  It took me 2 hours to fall asleep that night, and I can still see it in my head.  I really believe I live in a &#39;pathway&#39; or &#39;hot-spot&#39; for these things and will keep on watching for them.  I have no pics or vids of any of these, wish I did.<n>

I&#39;m wanting to know if it was going to get onto the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very scary moment for me, and really wanted others to read it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At aprrox. 12:40 AM on Saturday 10/28/06, I stepped out for a smoke on my back deck of my townhome. It was very dark, with none of the neighbor&#39;s back porch lights on, so I really could see the stars in the night sky. There was some very large broken patches of clouds high in the sky,(I&#39;m not too clear on elevations to judge them.) Sitting and leaning against my sliding glass window, facing South-South East, I noticed movement right above my head as I was looking toward the East (about 60 degrees up) at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw scared me numb and froze me still for about 30 seconds. I saw a very large &#39;triangle&#39; shaped craft slicing through the bottom clouds, heading to the South just over my head, then bank toward the West as it was just going out of view from me due to the building&#39;s roof line next door to me. Now the wierdest part about &#39;this&#39; sighting (this is my third at this location) was the fact that I really didn&#39;t see the craft, but viewed the clouds rolling past the front two sides of the &#39;invisible triangle-shape&#39;, and stir or roll the clouds behind it. There was no sound, no lights, and what I would describe as a &#39;stealth mode&#39; or being invisible. I could actually see right through the shape, and a few stars on the other side. This was very frightening to see, and I wish there had been other witnesses. After I remained there &#39;frozen&#39; for about 30 seconds, I ran rushed inside and went to my wife for her to feel my heart thumping in my chest, which it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband stood up quickly to try and follow it with his eyes but lost location.  The phenomena lasted 6 to 7 seconds.  The craft looked as if the lights were turned off or dimmed very dark although, I could see the v-shape and the circle shapes on each side about 8-9 lights or windows.  I definately know this was not a bird migration sighting it was something I&#39;ve never seen before.  It was large or could have been closer than I thought.  There was no sound from the craft. I felt like the pilot of the craft and maybe the occupants were checking us out then, when I noticed it started moving all of a sudden unless it was moving toward us at a very slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be a seemingly exceptional witness.

One large (yellowish) flash caught my attention and I continued watching the specific spot in the sky. Coincidentally, it was one of the clearest nights in recent memory without a cloud in the sky. It almost seemed like a lighthouse beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 12 seconds later the same flash occurred in the same exact spot.  As clear as it was, no craft could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the same time interval, there was another flash and at that point<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alerted the other two men to direct their attention at that specific point in the sky and just watch.  The younger man, self-admittedly has bad eyesight and his glasses were in the house.  The older gentleman witnessed the flash occur again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Together, we watched this same flash in the sky in the same exact position (5) more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The older gentleman, an admitted skeptic was fairly amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the last flash was witnessed, it just dissappeared (stopped flashing) entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t seem to be too high or far away. (A total guess would be 1000&#39; high and perhaps 1 mile away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights seen. The object had not moved laterally, closer or further during the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not to make any crazy assertions, but the next morning, I scratched the top of my head and there seemed to be a small fresh wound that started bleeding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us commented or were aware of any missing time from the night before.<n>

I happen to see something that would resemble an airplane, except for the speed and the color of the lights. The lights were amberish and the speed that this object flew across the sky was faster than any airplane that I have seen. I often to see airplanes in the same area, but they are more distant and distinctly airplanes. This seemed almost close, and the speed of it was quite fast. It went into the western sky, towards what I would guess the Rome area. It was quite odd, enough to where I got up to see what it was and where it was heading to.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 2100 hrs and the night was dark. She had just arrived from visiting our son who lives closer to town. Minutes prior, as she was driving home toward our house, she had observed a craft that had her mentally shaken, even today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was 1 ½ miles from our home when 3, evenly spaced, bright lights, descended toward the road in front of her. Her first thought, when she saw the horizontal lights, was an airplane about to crash or land on the roadway ahead. The lights didn’t seem to illuminate the ground, but were more like round window lights.  As she drove forward, the lights continued to float downward toward the road surface. She became concerned the craft might actually hit her car. At the brim of the hill before the little valley ahead, she stopped the car, thinking the aircraft would likely land in front of her. A pick up truck, had been following my wife, also stopped. Then both she and the pick up truck edged over to the side of the road., attempting to give as much room as possible to the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights dropped down to the level of telephone wires, they continued their approach directly toward the front of my wife’s car. “At that point“, my wife explained; “I gunned the car downhill figuring I would be able to get under the plane. I didn’t want to “stay put” because, the lights were heading directly for me. I felt I would certainly get hit if I didn’t drive under the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife drives a convertible, the top was up, but she had the windows down. She was listening for the plane’s motor but heard nothing. The lights then turned 90 degrees to the east and immediately disappeared. A giant shadow passed between her car and the trees beyond.  Since the shadow and the lights then completely disappeared, without noise, my wife realized she had seen something she had heard about, but never wanted to see and was terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove my wife back to the site immediately. She answered questions and showed me right where everything occurred, in sequence. I could find no evidence of a place where an airplane would have crashed or flown and nothing appeared out of the normal. We could not identify anything that could have been misidentified as she described.<n>

I am guessing 10 to 15 feet behind or above or both, there was more flickering which appeard! to be a bove the ground and not against the cliffs edge, kinda like the flickering was an outline of some sort, in fact I could not figure out how this could be possible, no spot flickered at the same time, and none the same, it very much reminded me of morris code of some sort with mirrors, but the suspended flickering was just unexplainable, no lights  or noise of any kind, no pictures taken, anyway aprox. 1 hour has passed no other siting made, the flickering remained, and I got up and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I swear, at the same exact time I stepped outside and looked up an EXTREMELY bright and EXTREMELY fast light seemed to soar by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was disorienting because I simply looked up and it caught me completely off-guard.  The sighting literally didn&#39;t last for more than a second or two.  It was extremely fast and then seemed to fade out similar to a meteor.  However, even being a bit disoriented, I could tell the light was low.  It was very low and very very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen an aircraft move so fast, and especially at such a low flight height.  And, I&#39;ve surely never seen a bright ball of light fade out on any type of discernable aircraft.  Not to mention, what I saw was pure ball of light, and not a segment or small light as a part of the craft.  The entire craft was light, and when it faded it seemed like I could almost make out an object still there for a very brief moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it may sound like a meteor, and that&#39;s honestly what I can best relate the sighting too except for the notable differences I mentioned-- imagine a meteor that seems like it&#39;s travelling horizontally at a height of only about 600-1000 ft.  It was so low.  There was also no observable tail like most meteor have.  It was clearly speeding across the sky-- distinctly and insanely quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve gone out before to admire meteor showers and know what even the brightest meteors are like.  This sighting was far different.  The object appeared to be low and zoom directly perpendicular to the ground...  It was also too large to be a meteor.  It was the size of a pea at an arm&#39;s length from your body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no discernable sound.  None at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never before seen a craft move this fast.  I&#39;ve never before heard a craft make no noise at a close range.  I&#39;ve never before seen a pure ball of light.  I&#39;ve never before seen a luminous craft completely fade out and seemingly disappear.  And, I&#39;ve never before seen a craft moving at such a high rate of speed, at such a low height.  It completely defied everything I&#39;ve ever seen in the night&#39;s sky ...  even the most plausible explanation-- a giant and impressive meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 99% certain that what I just saw was NOT a meteor, and I am 0% certain what exactly it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They went right over providence airport and were a dull brown in color and made no noise. Also, there were no lights visible and it was a crystal clear night. The body and the (wings)were proportionally the same size. All 3 parts of each craft were the same color. Almost like if you put 3 pencils on a table and made an arrow shape. The 3rd craft on right rear flank strayed off slightly to right towards the end of the sighting. Also, A collegue of mine spotted 3 lights on the same night around an hour earlier but was driving around 15 miles north of me towards my direction. The 3 lights formed a triangular formation.

I asked them what they saw and they said the same thing big fire ball like a plane was on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They followed it and might have seen more because they were in a better spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it move slowly away from us (south -southeast) it began to vary in brightness with the sparks starting and stopping.  I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked like the object was traveling about the speed of an aircraft but I didn&#39;t see any flashing lights on it other than the sparks.  Really looked like a plane on fire but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other planes were in the air but farther way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near a small airport, its probably a faulty engine but very few jet engine craft fly from the airport and not many at all at this time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police they are coming over to make a report.<n>

From behind a house some 1/4 mile away, 8 spherical objects rose one after the other (slightly smaller than a full moon), all bar one in a perfectly straight line, deep red in colour. Each had a &#34;halo&#34; of mist around each one. They were rising rapidly and got above cloud level, estimated at about 20-30,000 feet whereon they spread out in different directions. At this point they were no bigger than the stars but clearly visable as they separated but apparently still gaining altitude as they dissapeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not identify it&#39;s location due to the surrounding hills. the craft then began slowly zig-zagging accross the sky and then made itself invisible.

I don’t know if anyone else saw this as Toyosu is comparitively sparsely populated compared to rest of Tokyo, but I called my girlfriend straight after as I just could not believe what I had just seen. Glowing disks seemed to move behind a mist that periodically and only for split seconds &#39;failed&#39; showing the lights/disks giving a twinkling effect  - this is what caught my attention, you could see this slightly glowing blob moving slowly across the sky. I watched it for about 2 min until it moved out of sight over the high rise towers here. For me what is so compelling is that  it morphed shape from a random scattering of white lights loosely formed into a circle to a symmetrical V shape as it gently accelerated away. From what I recall there was 7 white lights/small disks .The V shape did not fly flat like a wing but at a slowly rotating angle and rotated about 40 degrees for time I could see it.<n>

The area I was driving through is on the edge of the city.  This incident occurred just as I was driving west and approaching an intersection at which I planned to turn south and head toward the city, which lies to the south east of the intersection.  At this time the sky was covered with clouds but it was still light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I came to the red light, I saw what I initially thought was a large plastic garbage bag about 100 feet from my location blowing in the wind about 30 feet over a field west of the intersection.  The reason I took it to be some kind of bag was that it was changing shape as if it were blowing in the wind.  However, it moved in a perfectly straight line, heading north.  It struck me as strange that this object could simultaneously change shape as if being buffeted by wind and yet not change direction at all.  When the light became green, I turned south, but found my eyes still riveted to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On an impulse I decided to pull over to the side of the road and get out to have a better look at the object.  However, when I stepped out of the car, there was no object to be seen.  I looked at the field (recently harvested, and so bare) to see if a plastic bag had fallen, but I saw none.  Then I looked in the direction where it had last appeared, and I saw a distant spherical object, close to the clouds.  It either did not move or moved very slowly and steadily.  It did not seem to me to be a plane, jet, helicopter, or a balloon.  It disappeared and reappeared over and over again, in and out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this thing for about five minutes.  It was becoming less and less visible, disappearing into the clouds for longer times; and as I was parked in a somewhat unsafe location, I decided to get back in my truck and head towards home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At any rate, what struck me was two things - the height and the pattern of flight.  The height struck me because they definitely were above the cloud level.   I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the could level was at that time, but it gave me the impression that if they were as high as they seemed, then they were pretty large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw them going in a straight line, then the first one curved around the left and came back just a bit, then continued left, then forward, then right back to the original path.  It then sort of seemed to wander in that direction until it disappeared over the clouds.  The second was doing basically the same thing, if not exactly the same thing, but about a second or two delayed after the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my car door open and ran towards them to try and get a cleared look, and shouted out, &#34;UFOs! in the north sky!&#34; a few times.  Frustratingly, no one was around until someone parked about 10 seconds after they went over the clouds.  They got out and I told them about it and they immediately got back in their car and headed to a park on the north side of the island to get a better view of the sky.  I also did this, but we didn&#39;t see anything at that point after about a half hour of looking up.  They must have already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sending a 5 minute MS Paint illustration - sorry, it&#39;s pretty ugly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Illustration requested, but not yet received.

I quickly grabbed my camera and began filming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused on the blinking object it was triangular in shape, with lights on the outer points as well as one in the middle of the craft. I witnessed several of these coming from all directions, traveling relatively slow and making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the half of it!!!!  Several craft were to pass over that night such as various orbs that seemed to &#34;spin&#34;, they would appear out of nowhere.  Some traveled across the sky, and some remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point two red orbs appeared out of the Eastern sky traveling in tandom, this really freaked me out and I called on my wife to come outside and see this.

They flew in a traingular formation, like birds, but were not uniform - the rear 2 lights seemed to flit around a bit, almost playfully.  I watched in amazement as they continued until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I teach science at the local university, and have never witnessed anything like it before - so would apprecaite an explanation of what I might have seen!<n>

I continued to watch the area thinking it was just a plane or possibly the final glint from an Iridium flare, after four or five seconds another flash occurred in exactly the same spot. No other lights were visible near that point of light. After another four to five seconds another flash appeared in exactly the same place, it was clear now that this was coming from a stationary source. I observed three more flashes approximately the same time apart as the previous ones; the last two however were about half the intensity as the first four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes and no activity I decided that it was over and I went inside to get the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back out with the phone and called my father to tell him about what I had just seen all the while keeping my eye on that area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes into the conversation I observed a commercial jet heading from South to North, nothing unusual. At about the same time as I noticed the jet coming from the South a fuzzy, red pulsating light appeared in the SSW slightly lower in the sky than the first event I described above. After a few seconds it was apparent that this red light was moving in my general direction and that it would pass directly overhead and that it would also intersect the path of the northbound jet, although at a much higher altitude. Careful scrutiny of the silent, rapidly approaching red light revealed absolutely no other lights on this craft. The light itself appeared somewhat fuzzy, with the apparent size of a pea held at arms length, it had a central hotspot that seemed very slightly less red than the overall area of red light. It appeared to pulsate between bright and dim about once a second, never actually going black between pulses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was practically silent, no traffic no, ambient noise. The only sounds were the barely discernable engine noise from the faraway jet and the occasional rustling of leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said the red light was headed in my general direction, moving from the SSW to the NNE and from my perspective it appeared that it was going to pass through the very same spot in the sky as the light flashes noted above. At the point when it did reach that spot, and coincidently high above the northbound jet this red light suddenly changed direction. It’s hard to describe, but essentially, one second it’s on a path that will bring it directly overhead and the next it’s moving parallel to the northbound jet, although higher and to the right of the plane. I was able to observe the jet and this object for the next 10 or 15 seconds as they headed North and eventually out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us were looking at the sky, at a pair of contrails that were running north/south parallel to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He jokingly said &#34;Look, UFO trails.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the words came out of his mouth, a faint white light started appearing between the two contrails, looking like it was flickering on kind of like the flicker of a fluorescent bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was the first star of the evening, but was proved wrong when the light grew steadily brighter.  It grew into a bigger, intensely bright white light and shone like that for about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the light flickered again and it was gone.  No trace of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no contrails coming off of it, it was too far away to tell if there was any sound, and there were no blinking lights like on an airplane or helicopter.  It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing East, and I would say that it appeared to be over I-75 or a little farther east of the interstate.  It was really high up in the sky with the contrails, so, I&#39;m guessing it was at airplane altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in the evening, the sun had set behind the building we were in front of.<n>

Read it and believe it.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53055.html|99|ndxe200610| This really happened and I would like an explanation! Read it and believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting into our hot tub out off of our deck. As always I look up and enjoy the stars. I&#39;ve been a star gazer my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE!  The thing was flying across the sky heading due south and off to the east a bit, not directly overhead.  One red light very dim with two sets of two directly behind. the whole thing was very small which I believe to be actually very high in the sky. -Unbelievably- fast and the real thriller is the ((deleted)) thing slowed to almost a stop and took off in another direction. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to write it off as a helicopter but I heard NO SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and friend came out shortly after and we hung out for a while. I told them what I saw and I don&#39;t think they believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway we soaked in the tub for a while and my wife went in the house. Our friend and I sat for a bit longer and intrigued  I kept watching the sky.  A few meteors throughout about an hour and one thing blew my mind.  It started out like a meteor but in the direct opposite path of the first unexplainable object.  It was a light that appeared and faded out like a meteor but it reappeared and faded and appeared again across the entire sky due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I of course yelled for our friend to look but she didn&#39;t see it. This too was going incredibly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O.k. Now I&#39;m starting to freak out a bit.  I&#39;ve always believed in Carl Sagan about being alone. The real clincher is and this just happened one hour ago is that goddamn red thing went back south again in the exact same path. one red light very dim with two sets of two.  if you weren&#39;t looking you wouldn&#39;t see it at the same speed and damn near the same path.  It wasn&#39;t an aircraft of anything conventional. No disc shapes either. it was too high and way too fast for anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always thought there has to be life out there but now i have NO DOUBT. I would appreciate and explanation of what it was I saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duluth has a state of the art airguard base and I bet they know what !  it was or if they don&#39;t they BETTER because if what I saw is hostile we are doomed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the first object was, the the intermittent light, which moved from north to south, may have been a tumbling rocket booster in orbit.

The sun had set and we were about to wrap things up when I mentioned that because of the clear sky and recent climate change that we might be able to see the Northern Lights if we stuck around a bit longer until it was completely dark outside. I was taking in my line and getting my fly rod ready to put it into its case when, out of the corner of my eye, something caught my attention. There was an odd movement in the sky. I redirected my gaze up to my left (Southwest) to see what appeared to be a star of medium brightness making erratic movements in the sky. The spot of light was moving at quite remarkable speeds in an &#39;S&#39; pattern and then shot off across the night sky at a perfectly straight trajectory from southwest to north at about 11 inches (from my perspective) a second. It then faded into obscurity slowly as it sped into the distance of space above the earth. Then more of these spots began speeding across the sky at breakneck speeds, one after another, back and forth. We must have seem at least a dozen of them. At the height of the activity there were three together in a small portion of the horizon. Two of them almost collided as they crossed paths. One of the spots made an instantaneous 30 degree turn as if it were a billiard ball being banked off of a rail. It was quite curious to be sure. Neither of us could decide what we were actually seeing. The Objects moved far too swift and precisely to be any sort of conventional aircraft or even spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

IT WAS A CLEAR SUNNY DAY WITH NO AIR TRAFFIC NOTED. WHILE I WAS WORKING I HEARD A SLIGHT HUMMING NOISE ABOVE AND BEHIND ME TO THE EAST. AT FIRST I DIDN&#39;T PAY ANY ATTENTION AS THE NOISE WAS NOT LOUD. MORE FELT THAN HEARD. THE HUM SEEMED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY WHICH CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. THEN THE HAIRS ON MY ARMS AND HEAD STARTED TO RISE LIKE STATIC CHARGE WHEN YOU RUB A BALLON ON YOUR HEAD. I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE HUM WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY HEAD. WHEN I LOOKED UP I DID NOT SEE A CRAFT OR CLOUD OR ANYTHING. WHAT I DID SEE WAS LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE. THE MORE I LOOKED I COULD MAKE OUT THAT THERE WERE THREE TRIANGULAR SHAPES WHICH SEEMED TO DISPLACE THE AIR. THIS IS HARD TO DESCRIBE. IT SEEMED LIKE THE TRIANGLES WERE REFLECTING OR BENDING THE LIGHT AROUND THEM. IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT THE SKY THROUGH A SOAP BUBBLE. THE ONLY REASON I REFER TO IT LIKE THAT IS BECAUSE THE TRIANGLES WERE DEFINATE BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE SKY AROUND THEM SEEMED TO BE BENT OR DISPLACED. THE TRIANGLES WERE MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION TORWARDS THE GULF. THEY WERE MOVING SLOWLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A VEE FORMATION. AS THEY MOVED AWAY FROM ME THE STATIC FEELING ALSO DECREASED. THE STATIC FEELING SEEMED TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY AS IT GOT CLOSER TO ME AND WAS VERY STRONG WHEN DIRECTLY OVER MY HEAD AND DECREASED GRADUALLY AS THEY MOVED AWAY FROM ME. SO, I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A CRAFT. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT I KNOW OF THAT EXPERIENCED THE SIGHTING. MY ELDERLY MOTHER WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE AND DIDN&#39;T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING. I HAVEN&#39;T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS TO HER OR ANYONE ELSE. I AM REPORTING IT HERE BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WAS NOT ORDINARY. I AM NOT REALLY SURE IF IT WAS A UFO BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were in the shade of the house.  I noticed a small dot moving accross the sky.  It reminded me of a sattelite that you can see at night moving accross the sky.  This one was pulsing and moving in a straight line high in the sky.  It was very hard to tell how high it was, but it was moving in a general southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked a little further ahead in the path it was headed and noticed a second dot.  This one was not pulsing and was moving much more slowly.  All of a sudden, this appeared to be something spectacular.  The first pulsing dot was moving right toward the second dot!  I watched as it approached, and as the 1st dot got closer, it circled 3/4 of the way around the 2nd dot, then they became one dot.  I don&#39;t remember if they pulsed after they merged or not, but they continued at the slower speed of the 2nd dot until I could no longer see them.  The dot moved too far south and I had to get out of the shade of the house, then the sun was too bright to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I didn&#39;t know who to tell.  I wasn&#39;t too good on the web at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a balloon of some sort. It was windy, and cloud shadows were passing over it...then it inclined its front/side? at an 45 degree angle and slide silently up into the clouds and disappeared. I yelled to my wife and another couple,&#34; Did you see that???!!!!Did you see it!!!??&#34; They were enjoying the scenery around our vehicle as we traveled south except where I had been looking/pointing.

After I snapped the picture the top of it turned a bluish color. It freaked us out. We were in awe, but after it turned blue it zoomed off very fast. The weird part is that the object had no sound to like a normal aircraft would.

Attends ((deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2230 hrs this date, I (deleted))) went to the front of my yard to walk towards a neighbor with the intent of checking on their dog since they were away on vacation.  Our house lies in the Foothills (North Central) area of Tucson adjacent the Catalina Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard one of my dogs bark and I turned to look back at the house. Directly above the house I observed the object.  The object was flying South to North.  I would estimate that it was directly above I-10 (I-10 runs north and south) I-10 is approx. 7 miles due West of my House.  It was approx. 25 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate, and its only an estimate that from light to light would make the object at least one mile long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that the object(s) were in fact 3 objects strung out together and flying in formation. I assumed they were helicopters flying North. There is a Marine aviation base due north of us. Holding my hand at arms length in front of me, I would estimate object would have been (from running light to running light) 4-5 fingers in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at its southern point had one non-flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife exited the front door and I yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. This she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and ((name deleted)) came out to join me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing North. I could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. This horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and &#34;line&#34; like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed off the binoculars to both ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)).   We continued to watch the object as it continued North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a North-West flight angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point and through the Binoculars I could now see the rear end of the object. You could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure.  It looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights.  The distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length.  The 3 other lights (red in the center, white and blinking red up from) were also still visible but at more of an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front flashing red light was still visible.  At all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned NorthWest as I believe I-10 makes the same course adjustments.  I believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above I-10, turning as I-10 turned, but Im not completely sure of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but I would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......he didnt elaborate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made a rough sketch of the object, will enhance the sketch and send it off to you in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sketch of the object received.

When I looked up I saw a yellowish non twinkling object and I said it was Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddendly the object started moving quite fasttowards the East.  I realized that it was not Mars and followed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought then that the object was an airplane.  But I looked to the North and I saw the a typical blinking of an airplane passing.  So I realized that my star was not an airplane. The object accelerated and suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of the disappearance, I believed, was in the constellation of Cassiopea.<n>

Then I noticed that the bright star was moving toward&#39;s me very fast. It flew directly over head travelling from west to east and took all of a minute to pass from where i first saw it on the horizon to the distance in the east and fade away. The reason I think it was a UFO because it had no blinking lights, the center of it appeared to be white light with 3 streaks of green light protruding out from it. It was quite bright and made no noise that I could hear. Also when it faded away in the distance it appeared to be a redish color as it got further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the same time I began to notice an object entering my field of view from the left, my friend pointed towards it and said &#34;What is that?&#34;.  I saw a distinct green circular shape moving at an extremely high speed from the Northeast to a Southwest direction.  It appeared the object was descending, but this could have been an illusion.  It appeared it was low, approx. 500-1000 ft.  (If I held a ruler up in front of my eyes the object would have measured about 1/4&#34; in diameter). There was no sound, like a military jet travelling at high speed might make.  I could not be sure if what I was seeing was propulsion from a craft or not.  It was dark and I could not see any shape other than the large green circle. I would estimate it traveled at least 4 miles in about 3 seconds as I had a view of the whole Reno valley.  It was moving much more rapidly than I would expect an civilian or government aircraft (planes or helicopters) to be traveling at.  After about six seconds, with the object heading toward the Sierra Mountain range, it suddenly and abruptly disappeared, like it simply just blipped out.<n>

We were walking from another friends house back to his house. It must have been 11pm to 1am. It was a few months ago, i don&#39;t remember the date. 3 circles of lights flashed through the sky, extremly fast, and low. About 50 feet in the air. They did not go in a triangle pattern. They flew one after another. Then they came back towards us, as we ran into the woods. Then they went back into the other direction. It was the strangest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. We ran back to my friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later the same friend and I were in the same area walking a friend back to her house.

I saw something moving very slowly and it was fairly bright in the North West sky.  I tried to focus on it and see if I could see lights thinking it was a plane. but all I saw was a bluish white glow. and it was moving rather oddly. it changed its path, moving slightly up and down and also in a circular way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time i wasted no time getting my mom who came ready with the binoculars. she also commented on it&#39;s weird movement. it began heading over a tree which was directly in front of me to the north.  I saw a plane come into view just under the object. and it kind of curved it&#39;s path a little upward as if to avoid the plane&#39;s space. once passed it continued a little more odd movement then began to dim then finally disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too slow to be a shooting star and left no trail.  It could have been an asteroid but it looked to close in the sky from other asteroids i have observed.  And coincidentally happened only hours on the same day of something else I saw in the sky in daylight that was strange and also had reported.<n>
10/20/06 19:07|Hanover|MD|Light|3 to 4 minutes|Bright white light moving west to east over central Maryland|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53009.html|133|ndxe200610| Bright white light moving west to east over central Maryland<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 19:05, 20 October 2006, from my backyard I observed a very bright light in the western sky.  I watched it sporadically for about a minute when I realized that it was moving slowly west to east and did not display any of the normal commercial aircraft warning lights.  As we live very close to Baltimore-Washington International Airport we are very familiar with the characteristics of normal commercial aircraft, both during the day and at night.  At that time the light was about two times as bright as Sirus is at it&#39;s brightest.  I grabbed a pair of 10X binoculars and watched it for about two minutes.  It passed almost directly over my house.  During that time the brightness intensified to about three or four times that of Sirus.  I could see none of the normal aircraft warning lights; there were no wing-tip red/green lights and no strobe lights.  The light displayed by the craft was entirely too bright to be the normal aircraft landing lights we are used to seeing at night.  I ran inside, called my wife to follow me, and went out the front door.  We both watched it for another minute or two before it went out of sight behind some trees.  It passed less than a mile south of BWI Airport at about 19:11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of the light intensified as it approached my house and lessened as it moved away.  However, the light was a constant white color, very comparable to the color of Sirus, but without the splashes of color that I often see in Sirus.  The intensity of the light was the only variable I noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As close as I can estimate, the light approached from a bearing of about 250 degrees (true) and departed on a bearing of about 70 degrees (true).  I would further estimate that the light would have passed almost directly over the intersection of routes 100 and 170 at about 19:10.  I could not discern any craft or shape against the sky.  The weather was clear and visiblity was excellent.  The stars were easily seen; there was no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I do not kow what it might have been, it was not a star or a commercial aircraft, and it was much, much brighter than any satellite I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There were also no other lights, no strobes, nothing flashing as I&#39;d normally expect to see.  I could see the setting sun reflecting underneath the metallic wing as it flew away from me in a generally SSW direction. It appeared to be 4-7 miles away from me.  I wondered if it weren&#39;t an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment or two later, my question was answered when it went from flying level to a zero degree climb (straight up!).  It rose approximately 100-200 ft and dissappeared completely from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was cloudless in that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of no aircraft that could make that maneuver without stalling and crashing, much less dissappearing like it did.<n>

It looked to be just floating on the air then it made a small circle and started moving in an unwavering line to the north east. It then looked to me like a small white sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I realized it definitely wasn&#39;t a bird.  And it definitely wasn&#39;t a plane.

Three of my friends and I were out on a second floor balcony, talking and smoking cigarettes.  There is a large tree to your right when you&#39;re standing on this balcony looking out onto the street.  The neighborhood is in a condo complex near the water in Foster City, Ca.   Anyway, we were chatting away, when out of the corner of my eye I saw this orb appear from behind the tree.  It arced out from behind this tree from my right to left.  I was the first to notice it as it silently hovered no more than ten feet away from us at eye level.  It was about 8-10 inches in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I can describe it is that it looked like a ball of plasma, the insides of it seemed to be moving.  It was changing colors also, vivid reds and blues, pinks and orange; it was absolutely beautiful, like &#34;living light&#34;.   It didn&#39;t seen to emit light. It&#39;s hard to describe.  It&#39;s like the light was internal, contained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds my three friends noticed it too.  The conversation fell silent and all four of us just stood there dumbfounded, staring at it.  I remember it seemed difficult to focus on, it&#39;s as if my eyes couldn&#39;t get a sharp look at what exactly it was.  It hovered there for about 20 seconds, then it seemed to notice that we had noticed it (we all got really quiet and were staring at it at this point).   The plasma ball silently floated away to our right and disappeared behind the tree where it had appeared from.   We stood there shocked.  Nobody said a word for a minute that seemed like an eternity.  I asked my friends &#34;Did you guys see that?&#34; and they said, &#34;Yeah&#34;.   None of us could explain what it was.  The funny thing is, none of us ever really talk about what we saw that night.  I&#39;ll ask them from time to time if they remember that night, and they do.  None of us can come up with an explanation of what the hell we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, i can&#39;t shake the feeling that there was some kind of intelligence behind it.  It&#39;s hard to explain.  The way it moved was very precise and deliberate.  At the time, it felt like it was watching us.  I think about it every day and hope to find out what it really is we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This included very quick 90 Deg. turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were out in space and I could not focus on them with the cheap field glasses I have.  All I could see is that the sun was reflecting off of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live out in the country where the houses are very far apart and we have many farms.  The area I live in is a route for commercial aircraft crossing Michigan to places such as Milwaukee, Chicago, Mineapolis, etc....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very common to see as many as eight aircraft crossing at any one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a sky watcher since I was a young kid and have seen many odd things but I have never whitnessed any of the objects do what I saw them do last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of them moved out into a larger perimeter, not symmetrical or anything, but seemed to move out to give the fifth some room.  The fifth UFO really started to cut it up. It moved in a straight line very quickly and them stopped.  Then it moved back to where it started very quickly and stopped.  Then it moved in a downward direction, stopped, then moved in an upward direction and stopped.  It then did a few sharp 90 degree movements as if it were testing the craft to see if it were at peak performance or showing off.  It did some really wide circular and egg shaped manuvers that seemed to be a few miles in diameter.  This looked like only a few inches to me but as far away as they were, I&#39;m sure it was at least a few miles for them.  It then started to do a random mixture of manuvers, accelerating very quickly and just having a ball, playing around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for a good hour with a few rests in between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am obviously not the only one to observe this behavior because all of the commercial air traffic stopped crossing the normal route.  I walked down off of my back porch into the middle of my back yard and could see a few of the aircraft doing a wide circle back in the direction of the Metro Airport and did not see any aircraft in the area of where the UFO was cutting up.  This is very unusual and it is rare not to see at least three aircraft at any one time crossing to the West or coming from the east.  This tells me that the air traffic was well aware of this UFO behavior going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched until I could barely see the UFO&#39;s anymore as they moved off to the West.<n>

It was like each side was communicating with the other. Could not see an object which was producing the lights.  Was high up in sky and appeared to be slowly moving east.

I pulled over and parked my car. The object was in a stationery position at cloud level and was slowly pulsating at about 5 second intervals. After staring at the object for about a minute to ensure it was not a plane or a helicoper I decided to video the event using my mobile phone camcorder. I filmed the object for exactly 21 seconds with my phone which I still have.  I continued to watch the object for a few more minutes before it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After examining the video clip on my phone, the object doesn&#39;t seem to appear on it, I assuming because of the limited zoom on my camera phone. (My phone is a Nokia N70 with a 2 megapixle camera.) I have copied the footage to my PC and have used various enhancing software to try and get the object to show, but with no success. I will gladly email this footage to anyone who can help to enhance the video footage to seen the object. Unfortunalty it was a very dull and cloudy day as you will see in the footage.<n>

There was heavy rush hour traffic and it was just beginning to get daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out my drivers side window at approximately 10 o&#39;clock and about 30 degrees up I saw an oddly shaped black craft traveling directly Southeast.  The instant I spotted it, I leaned down and watched as it traveled in a straight line from NW to SE directly over my roof.  It was in my sight for 2, maybe 3 seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason it caught my eye was due to its low altitude and odd shape.  There was a low ceiling and patchy dense fog in the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from the apparent altitude of 100-150 feet, the craft was clearly visable and appeared to have a very flattened fuselage 15-20 feet in length, 6-8 feet across with short canards 2-3 feet long approximately 5 feet from the aft end.  It was traveling in the range of 125 to 150 knots would be my best guess.  I saw no lights on the craft in the brief time it was in my sight.  There were no visible means of propulsion and my first impression was that it resembled a shortened cruise missle.  I tried to see it as it passed farther to the SE but my view was blocked.  I did have the radio on, but didn&#39;t hear any loud noise I would expect from an aircraft at that altitude.  I continued to look in the general SE direction to see if there were any sudden flashes of light but did not observe any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was approximately 1/4 mile West of the Olive Branch airport and 8 miles SE from the Memphis International Airport.  The craft was traveling at such a low altitude it was very unlikely that it could have been on approach to OLV as the runway is north &amp; south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Mechanical Engineer and have some knowledge of aircraft.<n>

Rd.   I rolled down the window in my car to see if I could hear it, thinking it was a helicopter.  It was completely silent and just hovering in one spot maybe 70-100 feet off the ground.  I was at a red light waiting at that intersection and when the light changed none of the cars went on green because they were all staring at it like me.  I pulled off the road in disbelief and a few seconds later it hovered over M-59, and headed south over some buildings.  I watched it go completely out of sight, and then looked at everyone as they all looked at one another to see if everyone saw it.  It looked about the size of a car from what I could tell. I&#39;m completely weirded out now!<n>

Basically, it was a triangle with no base, just the sides, much like a fixed wing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sides had dim white lights which were symmetrical on both sides of the quasi triangle.  I would say there were 20 lights, 10 on each side, on the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t make out the actual body of the aircraft, so there is the possibility it was several aircraft traveling in tandum.  The general shape reminded me of the F-117 stealth aircraft except there were no blinkers on the craft or other lights of any kind other than the aforementioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited several minutes expecting a sonic boom or other loud noise, there was absolutely no noise.  I would say the object(s) was traveling at an altitude of 2-3000 feet, that would be my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only wish I had a camera or video recorder with me.<n>

No visible craft per se, just the lights.  No strobe light, no red/green wingtip lights, no colors, no flashing.  No turn, bank, pitch up or down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No way to judge size or altitude.  Traversed about 45 degrees of the sky while it was visible, at an elevation angle of about 75 degrees, from west of my location to east of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initial impression was that it was a flock of white birds (e.g., geese) slowly flying in formation perhaps 100 feet above my house&#39;s roof, but then I realized that there were no flapping wings, no relative motion between the white spots whatsoever, and no ground lights capable of illuminating anything like that -- had to be self-illunminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Disappeared rather suddenly, but not instantaneously, as it moved away from me.  I speculate that it might have been a B2 &#34;flying wing&#34; bomber if they had no typical civil aircraft running lights, an array of between 7 to 11 soft-white lights on the leading edge, and were capable of virtually silent motion.  I do live just a few miles NE of Luke AFB, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a spa (hot tub) at the time, so its noise could have been masking quiet sounds from the object, but I routinely easily hear normal propeller, jet and helicopter sounds when they fly nearby while I&#39;m in the spa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could have been a very large object or formation of objects very high up (although there was no discernible relative motion between the lights whatsoever), or something much smaller and much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was something the size of a B2, it could only have been a few hundred feet in altitude.<n>

We were headed West in a dark section of the road with the closest habitation about two miles away. We were in a canyon between two extinct volcanos (Tetas de Cabra ) and the Sea of Cortez was about 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I looked up in the dark sky through the windshield and saw a triangular object leisurely proceeding in the opposite direction (East).  It had multiple small yellow lights on its underside that gave it the triangular shape.  There was no noise and the driver of the van did not see it as he was looking to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude is hard to describe but I would estimate 500 ft. I doubt it was a private plane as VFR flight is illegal after dark in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan to go to that same area and hang out tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing seen last night.<n>

The observations that follow took place while I|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52974.html|162|ndxe200610| At roughly 10:10pm, on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, I went outside to have a cigarette. The observations that follow took place while I was standing approximately 30 feet above the ground, on the back staircase of my apartment in San Francisco, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after walking onto the staircase, I noticed what quickly revealed itself to be a large bird, probably a bird of prey, flying from the Northwest to the Southeast, perhaps 100 feet above me. It was an unusual sight; as far as I know, birds are diurnal creatures. I could see the bird clearly and made a mental note that this was probably a result of the city lights reflecting. I watched it pass above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the bird had passed directly above me when I was distracted by something in the sky traveling in almost precisely the opposite trajectory as the bird. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at an airplane. The object passed directly over the bird I’d been watching, traveling in what looked to be exactly the opposite path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s difficult to reconstruct the order of my impressions of the object. I will do my best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first unusual impression was that I couldn’t identify the sound.  At the time I thought little of it, but in the way that one tries to identify the sound of an aircraft (&#34;Is it a plane?&#34; vs. &#34;Is it a helicopter?&#34;)  I came up empty. The sound was a mechanical, aeronautical sound that (I am trying not to characterize this retrospectively) that was close to that one would expect from a jet airplace than that of a helicopter, but was not the sound of an airplance nevertheless. It was an industrial, aeronautical sound that I could not decisively identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had what I must in fairness describe as a mild sense of confusion driven by the fact that in addition to my inability to precisely identify the sound I was hearing, there was something not familiar about the color and intensity of the lights themselves. Given the volume of the sound (Again, I am describing as best I can thoughts and impressions that occurred in fractions of a second in real time) I had the impression that the aircraft was higher than the bird I’d been watching but low enough to make a strong sound--less than 3000 feet for sure. The lights seemed duller (less bright?) than they should have given the other variables. They were a dark red, or a blurry red--it was like a dulled orangeish red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made dozens of attempts since the event to draw the distribution of the lights I saw on the object. The best description I can come up with: The representation of 5 on a standard die, with an additional light in between the two rightmost dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from e-mail to our database.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> •• • • ••<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pattern of lights moved from Southeast to Northwest for roughly 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part of the experience that was truly extraordinary came after the 4 seconds. As I watched with mild interest, the following happened; what I would call the lead light (the light farthest to the side of the direction in which the object was moving) reversed its postion. It took less than 1 second to do so; in that time, the lead light traveled clockwise until it occupied exactly the oppose position it had before. The object now looked like this:  •• •• ••<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in a fraction of a second and from my point of view, the object seemed to tilt in such a way that the western or leading edge went upward and the eastern or trailing edge downward. I say this not because it was directly visible as such, but because that was impression in the moment: the leading two lights disappeared from view, but I could still see the rear 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately thereafter (much less than 1 second), the entire object vanishedfrom view. Watching, I did not have the impression of something speeding away. It seemed simply to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is what I saw tonight. I have never seen anything remotely like it, and I have never before had a disposition one way or another vis a vis UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if you can explain this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) San Francisco, Calif.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (808) 232-((number deleted))<n>

East of Talent (near Ashland), I saw a large light travel towards the ground. It was a large object White and Green in color. From my point of view I could not see if the object hit the ground or not. I watched the object for almost 2 seconds before it went down behind the hills to the East. This object was too big to be a shooting star, and the green color was nothing I have seen before in the night sky. The object traveled from West to East covering nearly half the night sky in 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I grabbed by digital SLR and drove to their house.  The object appeared to be a sattelite and eventually disappeared behind some trees.  I couldnt capture the object with my camera. We stayed outside for a while (my mom, dad and myself) talking and observing the sky.  Suddenly, a white light with an orb shape came up from behind the trees.  It wasnt flying straight like an airplane, it was more sporatic (imagine a gnat flying through the air).  It made a sharp turn to the right, and during the turn, the light faded from white to red.  I tried to take a picture, but I couldnt get the camera to focus properly.  The object seemed to slow down a bit.  I lowered my lens, and then the object faded back to white.  Then the object seemed to just dissolve in the sky.  Afterwards, there was a lot of aircraft activity in the sky.  This included a very low flying jet and a low flying single engine plane. (At least that is my observation)  It was a very strange experence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking across the ocean, roughly facing the northwest.  This happened several months ago, so times are only approximate, but at one point between 9:00 and 10:00 PM I noticed a strange orange light in the sky.  I estimate that the object must have been somewhere to the north, based on my position.  It was apparently hovering, making slow movements at different angles.  It rose in the air and apparently moved along the coast.  I observed it for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain it was not an airplane. It did not move like an airplane or jet of any kind.  The only earthly vehicle I can think of that would have been there at that time would be a Coast Guard helicopter.  I concede that this object may indeed have been that, but the reason I have doubt is that while many Coast Guard helicopters are orange in color, this was a lighter shade of orange, and it was distinctly an orange light or glow, not a painted craft.  In any case, I was at least one-third to one-half of a mile away.  I am only going by a map of the location over which I thought the object might have hovered – due to perspective, it could have been much further away, over open water.  Given my distance, and due to the fact that this was at night in an area with very little light, I could not have discerned orange paint on a vehicle.  It was hard to tell from my distance, but I think it looked a bit like a funnel or cone pointed down.  The light was not blinking.  I did not see any searchlight either, which might be expected from a Coast Guard helicopter.  I also did not hear any sound coming from that direction, but I concede that I may have been too far away to hear a sound if there was one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, the object seemed to be slowly approaching my direction, which means it was traveling south or southwest.  Not being able to identify it, I began to feel nervous and left the scene immediately.  That is all I know.  It may well have an earthly explanation, but I could not identify it, so I am calling it a UFO.  I am interested in the subject of UFOs, but as far as I can recall, this is the only thing I have seen which might have been one.  However I am fully prepared to accept a mundane explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just passed through Groveland Fl. This was a very dark portion of the road with no buildings and no artificial light (except for our headlights)  At approximately 9:05pm my wife while looking out of the passenger window of our vehicle observed four green lights that appeared to glow  in the NE sky. The shape of the lights was oval. They were moving in a synchronized almost choreographed pattern in the shape of a figure eight that was turned on its side. The lights never appeared to touch or converge into one in the center of the  pattern. When it looked like they would collide they would suddenly veer away from each other and continue the pattern.    I pulled over and exited the vehicle to get a better look. There was absolutely no sound. My wife , daughter and myself watched these lights from the side of the road until 9:15pm, (10 minutes).  We then got back into our car and continued on west on Fl SR 50 into Hernando County FL.My wife and daughter continued to observe these lights almost continually until 9:36 PM (trees would intermittently block their view as I drove) At approximately 9:25 PM as we drove, we   observed two bright white lights that we attributed to helicopters heading toward the  above mentioned green ovals. One was coming from the North and the other from the South.  The weather conditions were partly cloudy and according to weather.com visibility was 10 miles.  We were returning from a three day stay at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be a single flashing strobe, flashing three times, then with about a one second pause.  It was first seen at about a 15 degree angle moving directly East. While I was watching it, it suddenly turned to the North-East.  I couldn&#39;t see this objet with my unaided eye, only with the binoculars.  It appeared to be very high in the sky and moving at a rapid clip, but slower than the many satellites that we see every night.  I witnessed this light travel across the night sky moving North-East until it moved into the Milky Way, then it blinked off and I lost it at approximately 21:20 (9:20 PM MST).  I saw three comercial aircraft to the south of our location at the same time, but highly doubt any of them witnessed this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, as we have done in the past, and we suspect that the report is quite accurate.

It was in a perfect V-shape. There were seven distinctive yellowish-white lights,” he said. “I’ve seen UFO programs where people have drawn this exact same picture.”  Harmon said the lights weren’t flashing or changing colors, and “weren’t moving real fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Unless it was a mile wide, this thing was pretty close to the ground, maybe 1,000-2,000 feet.”  Harmon said he saw the object, which was moving east, for about 4-5 seconds before it disappeared behind a tree. He hurried around the tree but never saw the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I don’t know if you had to be right under it” to see the lights or what, he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Harmon found it especially interesting that whatever the object was did not make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “The thing that got me the most was it was dead silent,” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I was dumbfounded.”  Harmon immediately called TV stations in Lubbock to see if they had heard of any strange object in the skies over Plainview.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I was truly curious if anybody else in the area saw anything.”  Harmon was supposed to call the person at KLBK back after the 10 o’clock newscast, but after telling his two teenage sons and brother-in-law about his encounter, “we got to talking about it and I never called them back.”  And what did his family think about his story?  “My 16-year-old (Dustin) said he had never seen me act this way about anything before,” Harmon said. “My 18-year-old (John) was kind of looking at me like these farmers have been.”  Those farmers were customers at Providence Grain Supply on Tuesday morning when Harmon was telling his story to anyone who would listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I feel like the person on the (TV) program” trying to convince people they saw something. “These farmers are getting a kick out of it, but I know I saw something.”  Harmon did a good enough job convincing his boss, Glen Graves, that he saw something. Graves did some research on the Internet and found a picture taken Oct. 16 in Croatia that Harmon said “was the same-looking deal, just a little fuzzier than what I saw.”  Harmon, who moved here about a year ago from Dallas, was married to the late Lisa Daffron, a Plainview native who died July 26, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “My wife used to be an (astronomy) buff. We had a couple of telescopes.”  Harmon is hoping somebody else in town saw what he witnessed Monday night, if for no other reason to confirm to disbelieving friends that he, in fact, saw something up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “I’m starting to doubt myself a little, but I know I saw something.”<n>

It looked to be over McChord AFB, but I have seen aircraft land and take off from there and they never have looked like that before.

We were on our way to drop one of my daughter&#39;s off at grandmas house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was in the sky, the craft was like going crazy and zigzagging in the air as we were driving slowly trying not to loose it. We saw bright lights in the sky so we went to drop her off and on the way home to our apartment we saw it again but this time it kinda disappear what we thought it did so as I was coming into the complex I just turned over to the left thru some bushes there it was something hovering over these large trees and I told my daughter do you see that. She said yes it was round on the bottom of it was like a dome with a bright light and a circle of lights on the bottom of that. It was grayish-black and we still had the car running and all I could think of to get the camera inside the house.We were surprise and stunned. So we left to get the camera but if was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Oct.19, 2006 we saw another sighting but this time around the same time again but it was above us. This craft was going slow throughout the air there was no sound but the craft was flying slowly and made a kinda of a u turn towards us I was yelling to my daughter to call her brother outside but I stood there looking in the air and the craft was coming towards and we got to see the structure of the craft underneath it.It was triangluar with 3 lights on the corners of it. It look huge above us we were also stunned couldnt believe we were seeing this underneath it.Then all of a sudden it turn around and disappear.<n>
10/16/06 04:30|St. Joseph|MI|Light|30 seconds|Two bright gold light tails moving west toward Lake Michigan in early morning hours.  Moved in formation, very quickly and low in sky.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54602.html|176|ndxe200610| Two bright gold light tails moving west toward Lake Michigan in early morning hours.  Moved in formation, very quickly and low in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of a large window, I saw two gold/orange light trails moving very quickly in formation across the night sky.  The two light &#34;tails&#34; seemed to be flying together, 2,000 - 3,000 ft. above the groud.  I live in an area where jet traffic is rare, and these two light trails acted unlike anything I&#39;ve seen or imagined.  The light trails were moving west, over Lake Michigan.  At that time of day, in this small town, I heard no sound associated with these lights, which stretched for over one hundred feet.  I generally ruled out meteors, because they appeared to be too close to earth, and also appeared to be in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, aircraft are on this path toward O&#39;Hare hundreds of times per day, but these lights were WAY to close to the ground to be on approach, and there were no flashing lights.  In fact, I saw no &#34;craft&#34;, but just the tails, which were very bright and consistant lights.  The tails did not spread out, or get weaker as they moved across the the sky, like I would expect a meteor to do, but rather they extended for a distance, then just quit shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I have been on over 1,000 flights, and enjoy aviation and astronomy, and I&#39;ve never seen anything that created a tail of light like this.  The brightness of the light, the speed at which they moved, and the relative closeness to the ground, made me believe that I was seeing something different than I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It stayed in the same place all of that time.  I didn&#39;t hear any kind of motor sound while I was outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night it returned, but was much higher up &amp; more to the west, over the National Forest.

They lit up for about 3-5 seconds and dissappeared. They were fire orange to yellow color and very big. I heard no noise.

I actually spotted it with my own eyes and then focused in with my camera to get a better look. It appeared to be a black dot or circle in the sky. The object remained basically motionless the whole time I watched it. I ran out of tape after a few minutes, but continued to watch the object through the viewfinder for a few more minutes and it never changed position. I never heard any noise from it and it never seemed to move any closer towards me or move farther away from me. Upon viewing the tape afterwards, it appeared to have a glow around it and occasionaly seemed to blink. Sometimes once, other times it would blink a couple of times. No apparrent pattern or consistency to it. It did seem to be hovering slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Egg shapped saucer, very glossy gun metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say 12 clear lights in a circumference. Other lights not in a particular pattern that&#39;s recognizable, but other lights of different luminescense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of these guide/spotlights were white-yellowish. I think I did notice 1-2 of the same sized lights with red or blue colors. No light was larger then the other. They all had the same base lighting I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home I assume around 6:30 pm, and it was sitting above my home hovering. It moved in its on axis and didn&#39;t seem to be limited by any direction. I could not hear any engine at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got darker it lowered itself, and I thought I was going to make contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for the whole 30 minutes (or until 7:15) when it became dark, and then a light appeared to open from the front like a flash light ahead of itself. It quickly closed, and then it finally had a sound. It sounded like tubes with a myriad of propellers pushing hard against the wind, and then it began to leave the &#34;southern&#34; sky, and move straight towards the north Eastern sky, slowly speeding up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I chased it until it was at a point that it was intersecting traffic at the top of my hill. It had one guiding light as it flew. It flew flat and straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took two pictures when it was evening with my sprint cellphone. There&#39;s one photo where you can barely see the lights on the leftside, and the other picture I have yet to transfer from my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing was around. No one was around. No cars going up and down my street. It was like the perfect day for me to just witness this large craft, and have no reference but my self, and my &#34;unbeleiving&#34; grandmother LOL  I drew a sketch of it how it looked when it hovered, and how it looked in flight. I will draw more detail with how the whole scene looks, if the picture I send cannot be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone has to do some &#34;buffing&#34; to bring the whole craft out because the photo is PITCH black. I know what i took, and only a friend could bring the two &#34;rear&#34; lights to light. I&#39;m sure you have better software that can bring it forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully we can be in some dialogue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My mother and I looked up and saw a teardrop shaped object directly above us.  It looked as though the exterior was chromed, it gleamed in the evening sun.  It was probably 20,000 to 30,000 feet in the air.  It was just hovering in one area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it moved very, very, quickly about 400 yards to our left.  After hovering there for about 2min it dropped to only a couple hundred feet above the ground.  It seemed to be observing somthing on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object moved back up to its original height.  And in the blink of an eye it dissapeared over the mountains.  I was so hyptnotized by it that I couldn&#39;t move.  I was just transfixed on it.  I had never seen anything like that before in my life.<n>

By the time I hobbled back with the camera the round objects had moved higher up about 90 degrees and had moved south and the bright light below them was gone. They moved higher and further south slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take some photos with my Kodak Easy Share C340. The objects stayed in straight east to west line and got higher in the morning sky and moved further south until they were just a small bright white dot in the blue sky until they I could no longer see them.<n>

We were driving in momentary silence along I-70 when my friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed he saw a meteor entering the atmosphere. The light was brighter than the moon and dimmed as it entered the atmosphere. We then saw what looked like 3 objects breaking away from the bright light as it dimmed. As the green, red and blue lights began coming closer to the ground we realized that they were not separate but attached to something spinning; possibly triangular in shape.  The strange thing was thier was no noise, no trail of dust or fire and as the object came closer to the ground, it began slowing over the mountain just ahead of us as if it were landing.  Seeing as we made fun of stories like this, we continued to rationalize that it wasn&#39;t as it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled off of a truck stop about a mile down the highway where several truckers had pulled off as well. We looked over the ridge to see if we could still see the object, but it was further away than we had originally thought. After realizing we had just encountered a UFO, two truckers pulled up next to us and asked if we had seen the &#39;lights&#39;. We talked with them about what we had seen and their story was exactly as we saw it as well.  If anyone has anymore information or saw the &#39;fireball&#39; entering the atomosphere, please report it here as we would also like to compare what others saw that night, thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I decided to go out onto the back deck of my house and enjoy the clear and crisp night air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have been out for no more than 10 minutes or so when I decided to turn around and view the stars that were behind me, toward the southern sky.  As I did, a bright white light caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought nothing of it as I believed it to be nothing more than a flickering star.  However, the more I stared, the more I realized it was much more.  At first, the object was stationary in the sky and began flashing every 5-7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or so of this activity, another object to it&#39;s left flashed once.  Then, the object I initially viewed began moving toward the north.  For whatever reason, it then moved back to it&#39;s orignal location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move back and forth a couple of times and I took this opportunity to run into my house and tell my fiance.  He then came out and he too witnessed the object move and flash, one last brilliant flash and then one final faded flash. It then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw the object again after that, although we did look for it.<n>

I then continued walking another 100 feet to the corner, turned and saw the object again in the same position. It slowly disappeared again. By the way, I had seen another cigar shaped object in daylight in the same location, a few years ago.  I am familiar with the aircraft in holding patterns around Logan Airport.  This light had none of the characteristics typical of those craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No alcohol was involved at the birthday party.  So we decided to go way up into the mountain to play because we thought it would be more fun, But boy were we wrong!  First a blinding light flashed down upon us, amost paralyzing us of all movement for a couple of seconds.  Then two figures came out of the blinding light and spoke in an unknown language.  At this time we were about 50 yards away behind a large rock.  They stood and studied the surrounding for a couple of seconds and then proceded to take some samples.  After samples were taken they began to slowly move back toward the origin of the light before disappearing into it.  the aliens were somewhere around 6 1/2 feet tall to 7 feet. They wore no close but their bodies looked to be armoured from head to toe, almost like they were engineered for war.  They were rather skinny, but had extremely large limbs.  They had a small head with the eyes taking up the majority of the face.  the eyes were completely white and it seemed as though the light was shining through them.  They had a very small mouth and did not appear to possess any ears, but looked as though they had small holes in the sides of their heads.  Now for the craft.  It was very hard to get a clear look at the craft because of the light but it appeared to be a small ball shaped pod with no windows.  It did not have any of the typical flashing lights like you would think but it did have a very bright pulsating glow.  The pod moved very quickly and was very agile, almost as if it teleported from place to place.  I hope that through this information we have helped this web site to conclude that extraterrestrials do in fact visit this planet<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC posted this report in 2007, but it probably is a hoax.

I was driving east on I-84 through Waterbury, CT and in my left peripheral vision I noticed a moving light.  I looked over and it appeared to be a shooting star.  It was actually kind of startling, as it did not burn out and looked like it was coming at me.  Then, it looked like it blew up, similar to the ending of a firework.  It was very brilliant, but startling.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and just settled on the fact that I was tired, had a couple drinks, and it was probably just a firework.  I told some people and they thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently I was looking up the UFO event at the Chicago airport.  I found this site and started looking through some of the reports and noticed someone else had seen the fireball at the same time and date.  Man I am glad someone else saw it, I thought was hallucinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the other report said, it was VERY visually stunning but frightening at the same time.  I really looked like it was coming at me.  I hope to see another one again in my lifetime!<n>

I immediatly looked up to see a bright white and blue fireball, traveling from south to north. Basicly crossing over the road i was on. Nobody else was on break at the time, so i cant say wether any one else saw it. It lasted mabee 10 seconds and looked as if it were burning up. It had a trail or tail at the time i saw it but everything disapeered at the same time. It had a bright white center with blue at the edges and very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/14/06|Harrisburg area|PA|||BLT RESEARCH REPORT:  Unusual wide ring of flattened field-corn found NW of Harrisburg, PA.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53173.html|202|ndxe200610| Unusual wide ring of flattened field-corn found NW of Harrisburg, PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 28, 2006 a local turkey hunter who was working the edges of a remote farm field stumbled upon a large (90 ft. +/- overall diameter) flattened ring in field corn, which abutted one edge of the field.  The flattened ring was subsequently rough-measured to be approximately 30 ft. wide, with a standing center section of about 30 ft.  The 8-9 ft. tall corn plants were all laid in a counter-clockwise swirl around the center section of standing plants.  The hunter further reports a &#34;path&#34; off one side of the ring which appeared to him to be part of the formation.  From the photos provided it appears that some of the plants were not completely flattened to the ground, and some appear to be broken at the 2nd or 3rd stem node from the ground--in spite of the hunter&#39;s assertion that he observed no cut or broken stems.  The &#34;path&#34; was not photographed clearly enough to determine it&#39;s width or length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hunter, who hunts this posted land with permission from the owner, estimated that the ring had occurred some 1-2 weeks previously, although this is really a guess.  He reports no high-power electric lines near the field but notes that there is a creek running along one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are told that the land-owner does not allow access to his remote farm generally, but a MUFON researcher reported no evidence of radiation on his visit to the site.  No compass work was carried out and there is no information regarding the plant stem nodes.  No samples were taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the photos we observe what looks like a fairly typical cropcircle flow to the lay of the plants; we note that a ring in corn is rare (most events in corn are flattened circles) and also point out the relatively large (30 ft.) width of this ring.  These facts, along with the very remote location, suggest that this event is not man-made although, without on-site observation and sampling, it is impossible to be certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Nancy Talbott, President of the BLT Research Team, of Cambridge, MA, for her contribution in investigating this case.<n>

They said it was around 15 to 20,000 feet up in the sky and it sort of glided through the sky. It was slightly iridescent in color and just bright enough to visibly see it, although the witnesses claimed to be able to see through it. They all said that it was really big, but hard to tell how so because it was so high in the sky.It was definitely triangle shaped.One of the witnesses also claimed to have seen the same unidentified object a few hours prior. I was extremely dissapointed not to have seen it, but my brother, best friends, and a few of their friends all seriously swear that they saw this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and I was enjoying the cool weather and had both windows and my sunroof open.  I was with someone else, but they had just exited the car for a moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just looking around, not paying much attention to anything, when what I thought was a low-flying aircraft caught my eye through the open sunroof.  I looked up, and saw what looked like a low-flying equilateral black triangle with bright white lights on each point traveling along at a moderately fast pace directly above me.  It wasn&#39;t going too fast for me to be able to follow it, but at the same time, it was gliding very smoothly and much too quickly for the altitude it looked like it was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it, I got chills.  I knew it was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed its path, which was an estimated northeast to southwest direction until it seemed to either fade away or just go too far away for me to see it (although that did not seem possible because of the clearness of the night).  It made absolutely no noise that was audible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost told my friend when they came back, because I was pretty shaken up, but I thought better of it.  I came home, did some internet research, and was amazed to find out about the &#34;Black Triangle&#34; phenomenon.  I had no prior knowledge of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add that I was completely sober and relaxed, and UFOs were the last thing on my mind at that time.  I believe what I saw was 100% real.  It&#39;s definately made a believer out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to know if anyone else from my area has seen similar things.<n>

He said to look out front. I went outside to see 4 very bright lights to the east. They appeared to be quite some distance away but were as bright as the street lights that were just coming on. 2 of them sat perfectly still while the other 2 darted in and out of some low clouds. The 2 lights appeared to be from the same craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few trips into the clouds, the lights stopped perfectly still. The other 2 lights then took off in a zig zagging pattern. The light streaked behind following the movement pattern. Eventually, all the lights disappeared. The speed of the movement was amazing. During all of this, two of my room mates came home and my neighbors were watching. Everyone saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an Air Show in San Diego that weekend, but it was to the north west of my house. I attended the air show and nothing there made any movements even remotely similar to what we saw the day before.

I glance over to admire the view of the ocean, green hills, accented with swirls of mists and fog only to find a peculiarity within my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A platinum colored saucer gracefully glided along weaving between the mists and fog.

She saw three bright balls of light floating on the sky.  She said that these lights were lined up in a horizontal line.  The ball of light in the middle had a blue-ish color to it, and the other two right next to it were lit up white in color.  My sister thought it was probably a set of flares because they had a bit of a streak/trail right behind in the lights.  Strange thing was that my sister said that these lights started hoovering lower and lower to ground, to the point where it was about even to the height of a roof of a single story house.  After this, she said that these lights started rotating from a lined up horizontal pattern, to a three-point triangular pattern.  She said that if you were to &#34;connect the dots&#34; between these three lights, that you&#39;d connect a triangle.  After she arrived at work, her co-worker had arrived just shortly.  Since her co-worker lives around where we live, my sister had asked her if she had seen anything strange on the way to work.  Her co-worker said that she had only seen a horrible car accident nearby a 76 gas station.  This was the same location where my sister had also seen these strange lights.  We thought that maybe this unfortunate person had seen these strange lights as he/she drove, and was not paying attention to the road.  I used to fuel up aircraft at a local airport, and I&#39;ve seen helicopters, jets, big planes, small planes.  I thought that maybe my sister had seen a helicopter or something, so I asked her to describe it for me.  She didnt mention anything like blinking lights, spotlights, noise, dust picking up or anything like that.  Who knows what it was, maybe it was something that is totally explainable.  It was dark, so she couldnt make out anything that was behind this lights.  If anyone out there saw something at this location, let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights twinkled into different colors and the shape of the light grew to dim and very brillent. The size of the light was 3 times the size of an airplane light. It looked as if it was sitting over downtown Detroit or Windsor Canada. The second light sat  distance in the sky and also change brillance and sat in the sky about a football field apart. Then both grew dim and disappeared. The brillance of the light was most fascination and its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was about 3-4 miles south south east ,maybe 2000 feet. At first  i thought it was a plane .But they usually have a little strobe or a flashing red light. What made this different to me  was the fact that it was so BRIGHT.And   it was blinking{i believe,yes , this is what grabbed my eye,slow blinking ,i recall}.Then  it totally dissappeared. It was not normal . It was gone before my neighbour could see it . I am so mad that i didn&#39;t jump on my binoculars when first saw this. Maybe it was the setting sun doing a number ,but i don&#39;t believe that.  Maybe some one else saw it. On my word ((name deleted))<n>
10/12/06 17:50|Altamonte Springs|FL|Sphere|30 sec. +/-|Sphere shaped UFO Seen in Altamonte Springs, FL by a young girl 10/12/06|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52947.html|219|ndxe200610| Sphere shaped UFO Seen in Altamonte Springs, FL by a young girl 10/12/06<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the second floor stairway of my apartment building, smoking a cigarette and waiting for my roommate to come outside to take him to work.  It was still light out, and i was looking at the sky as i often do, and saw what appeared to be a sphere-shaped silver metal object flying to the north, at an altitude of what couldnt have been more than 200 ft., maybe a quarter mile if that from where i was sitting.  It was traveling fairly slow, at a steady speed, and then I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone but the lighting and distance made it impossible to get a good shot.  It then passed behind a tree branch, and i waited to see it in between the trees, but it just disappeared.  Now i know that it is not a plane.  It was too close and the shape was clearly not of any human flying machines.  I believe it cut a quick 90 degree turn east when it disappeared because i went downstairs to get a better look, and was looking at where it should have been at that point if it was still traveling the same speed and there was nothing.  I told my roommate about it when he came down, i expected him to laugh at me and not take me seriously, but this is something that i would never joke about (no matter how much i wish they would come and take me away.) I later told my boyfriend about it and my uncle, who is a retired scientist.  Everyone i told took me seriously, and i am constantly looking out for my little friend everyday, hoping to get a picture to prove i wasnt just seeing what i wanted to see.  when i first saw it i had to stare for a bit to make sure i wasnt seeing things, but i was staring for at least 30 seconds before i got my camera phone out of my pocket, so im positive of what i saw.  I am and always have been a firm believer in life from other planets visiting us, i just hope next time i see it they come a little closer!  By the way, i am a 24 year old female, i deliver pizzas for a living, and i have a hobby of taking pictures of cloud formations, so i often spend ! alot of time looking up at the sky, as do i spend alot of time researching the UFO sightings.  I am not trying to impress anybody with a made up story-i have nothing to gain for lying. I just hope someone else saw it or knows what that might have been- it looked like a ufo i saw in a picture once.  Well its a silver ball-like object. It was flying. thats all i can tell u for sure. Oh yeah and i didnt hear any noise that might have been made by the craft, but it was a good ways away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seemed to be closer than an airplane would be.  I listened for a sound of an airplane or helicopter but could not hear anything.  They seemed to be so close for not making a sound.  They were moving to the east. They were moving simotaniously.  There were three very bright, clear lights in the shape of a triangle with blinking lights in between.  Both crafts looked the same.  They were very close together yet moving at the same time keeping the same distance apart from each other. Then they slowly moved out of my view.<n>

Anyways, I saw a bright light moving East.  I&#39;ve seen these lights before sitting with ,y parents in the back yard and we were all amazed at its speed but this one was different because it stayed in straight.  The others we saw would sort of wander around in the sky.  As soon as it seemed pretty much directly overhead, it got really bright. At least 3 or 4 times its original brightness, then it dulled back out and continued its path. It never stopped or slowed down. It just faded off into thew distance, I figured after seeing so many I should try to figure out what they are.  The whole thing took about one to one and a half minutes.  Not long. And it was only slightly bigger than a start so it was moving very fast to cover that much distance in that amount of time. Probably not a plane cuz it didn&#39;t flah, but Vance Air Force Base is right across the highway so i cant be sure.  I dont know what they have in the airways. It just didnt seem like a plane could be that high or get that bright.  Also, I heard what sounded like a jet very far off in the distance as it passed and for a short time after, but like i said, we got Vance right here, could have been night training.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I lost view of them as I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twenty minutes later, they appeared again, this time in two clusters.  I called my parents for them to witness it.

It appeared to be very high and far away. The object I could not make out, but the white tail showed up clearly against the blue sky and was perhaps 5 times as long as it was wide. The most notable feature was that the white tail did not trail out into a vapor cloud like a contrail behind a plane. It ended sharply, without a residual mark in the sky. After watching it for a couple of minutes, the white tail disappeared. For a few more seconds, I could see a tiny bright dot with the same path that looked like sunlight reflecting off of metal, then I could not see anything there at all. A student on campus saw it at the same time I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know just what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In profile it appeared disc shaped with three large pulsing lights which changed from white to red during the time it was in my field of vision. The sky was very clear and the object was about thirty degrees above the horizon.The craft I would approximate to be twice the lenghth of a commercial passenger jet and appeared illuminated from within. My impression was the smoothness of the path ,not as if propelled by itself but rather as if being pulled by some force across the sky. The effect was somewhat hypnotic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as at least as big as a 747.  I put down my window and there was no engine noise.  I tried to turned off my radio.  I hit the off button twice and the radio came back on so I turned off my car.  Still no engine noise from the craft which at this point was about 300 ft. to 600 ft. in altitude and approximately 1/4 of a mile from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the craft turned right.  That&#39;s when the outline of a triangle shaped craft was visible because there was a whitish glowing light.  That&#39;s when I knew this was not like any aircraft I have ever seen before.  When the craft turned it didn&#39;t bank like and airplane.  It looked almost like it was sliding.  Then I drove down the Hazel Road to Becker Lake to get a better look at it.  It was almost parallel with me.  I went to the corner and stopped and turned off my engine.  Still there was kn engine noise.  At this point the craft turned left toward Point Mackenzie.  It looked like it was traveling at around 50 mph.  Then it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After debating what the noise could be for a few minutes we went outside to see what it was. We saw about four white lights, equally spaced, rapidly flashing in sequence moving slowly in a diagnal fashion due west.  It was probably about 7-10 miles away but if you put a ruler up to the sky and measure the aircraft would be about 3.5 inches wide.  We called the airport and they said there was a balloon festival in Albequerque, NM and it was probably a balloon.  We know that the lights were all white and flying diagnally and was much larger than a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The window in the vehicle was rolled down. I looked up into the sky at the object as it flew over. There was no sound as past over head. The front of the object had a white light glowing or pulsing from it. The front of the triangle shape looked just like a solid V shape. There were no markings on it. I did not see anything that looked like a cockpit like on a normal Air Craft.  The object increased speed and went higher into the sky and began to shrink in size as it got further away I lost sight of it. The time that had elapsed was about six minutes from the time I first spot! ted the object till it was out of sight. At no time did I hear any sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was streaking with contrails like a jet but downwards and bright red and orange and kind of bluish in color.  I am unsure of what this was and the emergency numbers said they don&#39;t know maybe a shooting star.  I have seen shooting stars and never that bright or sounds that loud.  The sound was extraordinary.  It was much longer and more acute than I have ever heard anything including thunder.  I am just wondering if anyone else out there saw this tonight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything of that nature so I am curious now.<n>

I&#39;m curious, is there someone in my area that would like to talk to me...that would be great...but for now...here it is in brief (if such is possible). Leaving the AMC Hospital...looked up and OH MY GOD!!!  There it was....or there it was traveling....at an extremely high rate of speed...this &#34;Big&#34;...shining...&#34;Big&#34;...craft...(of some nature). I began to zig and zag on the road leaving the hospital...not able to take my eyes from what I was seeing...as I approached the stop sign, I noticed a car had pulled over on the right side of the road...it&#39;s occupants seeing...what I was seeing!!!  I pulled out onto the main road and immediately pulled off the road....head in...head out...glasses up (sunglasses)...glasses down....&#34;what in the @$#@# is that??? I pulled out (as it had moved...quickly) and drove up the side road...and noticed behind me..three other cars...all doing the same!!!  Now...here goes the description...at first when I saw this...I could see no outline of anything...just this &#34;extremely large&#34; white...glowing...and here is where it gets quite difficult...the color...odd as this is sounding...I&#39;ve nothing to compare it to...it was soooooo bright.....not white....not blue....just....nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.....ever....it was traveling at a very fast rate of speed and very, very large...at first I thought...a meteor...cool...than thought...OH My God...if it is..we are in some kind of big trouble down here, then as I moved to the off road site, as it moved...with my sunglasses on...and only then....as it was too bright to look directly upon...I could see a triangle...enlongated, of course, due to my position to it...down went the glasses...up went the glasses....and every time...the same...Wow...as fast as it was traveling....all of a sudden....&#34;it stopped&#34;... It stopped!!!  I cannot begin to tell you what was going through my head!!!  I looked back at the person ! in the c ar behind me (by the way...it was man in a red car...and that is all I can remember about him....) he was standing half way out of his car...looking...gazing...just as I was... then...off it went...and I mean...&#34;off it went&#34;... I could see it &#34;go&#34;.... I know this writing is haphazard and I would love to speak to someone who checks into this sort of event, in my area.... I&#39;ll never be the same...that is all I can...it was the single most exciting thing I&#39;ve ever wittnessed....and feel almost blessed to be one of those to see it.  I&#39;ve nothing to compare it to...it&#39;s color..speed..any of it...I&#39;m so eager to hear if anyone (and I &#34;know&#34; there were others) have reported this... ya know what...it was even stranger that...as it was over...all three of we cars pulled out...not one of us spoke...heheheee  If they were as overwhelmed as I was I do understand....I look forward to hearing from you guys or someone in my area....thanks  Oh...this was in Fishersville, Va...3:15 in the afternoon...and clear as could be...beautiful...blue autumn sky....not a cloud in the sky...and I&#39;ve not been able to look down to the ground since... :) I&#39;ve actually felt very small and vulnerable since seeing this...and felt...&#34;I should do something&#34;... but what...tell you guys<n>

It lasted about two seconds and once the triangle passed the lighted moon surface, I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It looked, from what I could see, to be just a dark black surface- no lights on the object but with clear lines defining its triangle shape against the lighted surface of the moon.  About 5 minutes later another black triangle moved over the moon&#39;s surface from bottom to top.  This second black triangle moved much quicker, about a second or less, with the same black surface and clear lines.  Approximately 3 minutes later, another black object moved diagonally across the upper left hand side of moon&#39;s surface from left to right, very quickly, faster than the first two objects.  The third object was moving so fast that it looked to be more like a sphere, but with the same deep black color.  It was the color that I could clearly see against the moons surface.  All three objects had clear lines against the backdrop of the moon and dissapeared once they had passed the moons surface.  The first two objects had a clear delineated shape of a triangle against the moon&#39;s surface.  The third object was more of a definate color, a deep black against the moon, but not having as clear of a shape as the first two, due to its&#39; was moving so fast.  The first two objects were the same size, the third looked a little smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a graduate student in psychology.  I couldn&#39;t sleep that night-but I was awake and lucid. I had been up around that time for the past three days writing papers.  I had gotten used to being up and awake around that time, so I wasn&#39;t surprised that I was awake.  It takes me a couple of days to get back to sleeping normally after I finish a big project.  Since I was up, I decided to take out my telescope and enjoy the full moon.  I had been looking at the moon, trying different lenses, trying to find different landmarks for about 10 minutes or so when I saw the first black triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(It probably caught my attention because I had been outside about an hour earlier, it still being night, and I couldn’t recall seeing the light in that general part of the sky then.)  The light was about as bright as Jupiter, about 70 degrees above the horizon, and perfectly stationary in the constellation Cassiopeia.  The light was stationary for about 20 seconds, almost appearing as part of Cassiopeia.  Then, for a period of 2-3 seconds, it appeared to steadily ascend upwards into the sky across a very short distance (about 2 arc degrees), moving in a southerly direction, until diminishing in brightness and no longer visible.  I did not observe any lights, sounds, or movements from the light that would be commonly associated with common types of terrestrial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Now this could have been between my location and say redding, ca, 100 miles away. Or it could have been way up north past oregon or even wash.

He said it appeared to lift over the buildings along the street toward and in front of the nearly full moon and was gone very suddenly in a flash again as if a light switch was turned on and off.  We circled around and looked for any other evidence or any other explanation for what he saw and found nothing.  My other son and I did hear a sort of whoosh sound almost like when a fuse blows right before he saw the object but our attention was on the road in front of us and we did not see the object. We arrived home shortly after that and I noticed aircraft in the area.  Also, my dogs were behaving somewhat unusually and were more on edge than normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

After paying closer attention to it, we realized these beautiful colors all over the object. I then retrieved my binoculars for a closer look and what we saw was just amazing, and so vivid. There was no haze, no aura, and it just remained in the same spot for about a half hour until it slowly(at least slow to the naked eye) began moving south. Also to clarify the location, it was east of where we were and we were looking to about a 45 degree angle. The sphere then paused again and seemed to remain in its new location, for the remainder of the sighting. I had viewed it through the telescope also which made it that much more clear, only to reveal a spherical shape just completely covered in this constant changing, almost electrical light. It was blue,purple,red,yellow, green, and it just kept cycling through these colors over and over again. To be more precise on the shape, it looked exactly like the big Epcot center ball(with the same outer texture or paneling,whatever) in Disney World, just bigger and luminescent. I also found it pretty peculiar that at no time during this sighting was there even a trace of any other aircraft in the sky, and the air traffic is usually constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Road travels due west.  I looked eastward over my shoulder, hoping to catch the moonrise.  My eye was caught by an extremely bright, pure white object, almost directly overhead.  For several seconds as I reached for my binocs, the object continued to brighten.  It now appeared to have rays emanating from it--sort of like a really close helicopter searchlight.  I was actually squinting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it was by far the brightest object I&#39;d ever seen in the night sky.  Probably 3-5 times brighter than Venus at it&#39;s best.  By the time I&#39;d acquired it with binocs, the object had already begun to rapidly fade, and in a few seconds all I could see was what appeared to be an ordinary satellite--traveling from slightly NW to the SE.  Fastest satellite I&#39;ve ever seen, and as I watched, it kept going faster!  Lost it in 4-6 seconds.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s acceleration was due to that effect you see as an orbital object approaches the horizon and appears to speed up before winking out. This was quite different. And I&#39;m very sure that the initial blaze was NOT reflected sunlight.  That effect wouldn&#39;t account for 10% of the light emitted. Besides, sunset was 1.5 hours before sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the Space Station several times; twice I saw the shuttle streak over CA before sunrise.

She immediately saw the same thing and saw 3 or 4 more lights moving in the sky.

I observed the object for around 10 min, it didn&#39;t appear to move but it was really hard to tell at that time. I was in my way to a grocery store when I spotted the object in the sky. The object does appear to be moving at a very slow rate. I arrived home and pulled out my binoculars, I found the object and was able to gather more of a detailed picture. The object appeared to have a goldish,bright light emitting from it and a haze surrounding it. The object appeared to be very large, and just above the clouds. At times it looked liked two lights moving in a slow rotation, never completeing a full turn. When I first noticed the object it looked cylinder in shape, after 30 or so minutes, It changed to a circle like shape. I live around 10-15 miles from DFW and the object appears to be hoovering in that general direction. I&#39;m not sure if what I observed was a weather ballon, I doubt that though. I&#39;ve lived near the airport for nearly 7 years and I&#39;ve never seen a weather ballon in that area before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Upon further inspection, we noticed that the &#34;planes&#34; were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. The best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. It moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. It was able to turn very sharply. The larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  After aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. At this point, my friends and I were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. My emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what I had just seen. After the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. After flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. At this point, we stopped the car and I was able to get a better look at the object. The &#34;light beam&#34; connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. I glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. After it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. We immediatley tried to drive to where ! it had l anded, but could not find anything. The object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. We searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. Three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting. Throughout the entire sighting I never felt afraid, I just felt amazed beyond belief and lucky to have seen this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticing that the clouds appeared to be much brighter than usual,I walked into the yard to look at the Harvest moon.  Unfortunately, that is not the only thing I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above my house, there were several (over 100), star-like objects extrememly high in the atmosphere. The objects were moving much slower than conventional aircraft. This information is based on observations of comercial crafts in the PHX flight path. The objects were of varying sizes or at different altitudes making their size appear to be ether larger of smaller. The objects did not appear to change their formation. There were several clusters or groups with the balance seameing to be at predetermined distances. The objects moved from the North heading South over Luke airforce then turned sligtly South/East. If their flight path remained consistant they eventually would have overflown Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to be the only one who saw these objects, I ran into the house and woke my roommate.  Together, we observed these objects for over a half hour. I got disheartened when after calling 911 they acted like I was some sort of retardo or drunk... I instructed them to go outside and to take a look for themselves. The  objects movement with relationship to the stars was impossible to miss!  Shortly, therefore, I called &#34;Channel 12 Breaking News.&#34;  The only question they asked me was did I get any film of them.  No, I said: &#34;I don&#39;t usually go out for a smoke or at any other time with a video camera in my hand!&#34;  Almost immediately after my call to 911 at least two military aircraft were scrambled.  Where as the military always denies these scrambles or flying that late at night . . . you can take it from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate and myself are college graduates and our ages are 58 and 60 respectively.  We are both professionals living and working in the Phoenix area. Neither of us drink or use drugs.  We don&#39;t need attention . . . we seek answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 10:30 at night.  I thought it was a plane, but then realized it was much too low, and also moving too slow.  It was only 10-20 feet above some houses.  It had green blinking lights on it, but I couldn&#39;t identify the shape.  There were maybe a dozen small lights, and also one larger white/yellow light. As I drove past, it lowered behind the trees and possibly landed.  It was in sight for about 15 seconds.  I wish I had gone to look closer at it but frankly I was little freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a UFO, in that I couldn&#39;t identify what it was.  My first impression was that it was one of those flight for life helicopters.  I&#39;m not positive that isn&#39;t what it was.  But it just seemed too big and didn&#39;t look right.  I&#39;m sure the people in that area had to have seen it.  I am about 50% sure it was a flight-for-life, because that&#39;s my only explanation, but it just didn&#39;t seem like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very bright round objects in a group of 10, then 2 very different shapes,and 1 stationary object,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seen in the skies of Centerville, Ohio on Oct. 6, 2006.  It was around 6pm, the weather was beautiful, completely blue, clear skies.  My 2 sons, ages 10 and almost 12 came running inside to tell me (their mom) to come outside and see these strange objects in the sky. The objects made no sound. My sons told me they saw a group of 10 very bright circular shapes, then 5 of them darted off. My 10 yr old was visibly shaking and very scared.  When I came outside I kept saying, &#34;where boys&#34;?  I looked up above my apt. and I saw 2 very different BRIGHT objects!  These 2 objects were very CLOSE!  It was not like a jet in the sky, this was CLOSE. On the left was a bright pulsating round object, on the right was a completely different shape.  The second had a circle shape on top, in the middle was oval shaped and the bottom was triangular. Both shapes were pulsating a VERY bright light. It lasted maybe 10 seconds.  Then they vanished.  I was so astonished and amazed, that I called the non-emergency number at our local police station.  They took my information and had an officer come out.  The officer came and briefly talked to me about what me and my kids saw.  She said there were no other reports.  Then, maybe a few minutes later, my friend came over.  She is around 40 yrs of age, like me.  I told her what happened and maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, there was ANOTHER strange, very bright shape off in the distance,in the sky.  Now, this object was stationary, not moving.  But, we noticed there were 5 aircraft circling the skies, obviously checking this object out!  This was NOT normal to have planes just circling around a object.  WE then walked over to 3 other neighbors who also witnessed this!  They made jokes, but could not explain what it was.  Then, my friend, her son, and my 2 sons (we ALL saw this), got into her car and drove at least 1 to 2 miles down the road.  This object was heading west.  The entire time she was driving, I could see this stationary object, while airplanes were obviously ! circling around.  At one time, I believe it looked like a straight line,and also like a crescent shape.  As it got darker, the object seemed to be getting lower and lower and we could no longer see it.  Also, the stationary object had a red tint to it, but we think it was because of the sunset. Before it was just like a star, but obviously NOT a star. When I returned home, I even called the TV station.  But, they too said no calls were made about any such sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids are very honest people, as I am.  We saw something that was not ordinary or easily explained.  I have no idea what it was, but the 3 objects I personally saw have me astonished.  The 2 objects that I initially saw (above my apt.) were the most amazing to me. Especially because of the pulsating light and shape of the 2nd object.  My kids were the only ones to see the group of 10 bright objects, and I saw the 2 different shaped objects vanish before my eyes. I can not explain what it could be, but I have been feeling very frustrated because I want to know the explanation. I want to know why there were at least 5 US aircraft circling the skies around this stationary object!! I will probably never find out why. This experience has me totally in awe of our universe, even more so now. One last bit of information.  My youngest son told me that when he got off the school bus, he saw 1 bright circular object, but it vanished.  He said he didn&#39;t say anything at the time, because he thought his mind was playing tricks on him.  This happened 3 hours before we began seeing these objects.  Very strange indeed.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to move very slowly and left no smoke trail behind it.  I also seemed to be moving sideways.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and disappeared in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and I have no background having anything to do with UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What caught my eye was that it seemed to hover, then dive, then bounce back upand make quick, abrupt changes in direction.  The object stayed in the same general air space for approximately 1.5 hours.  I attempted to take some photographs, but could not zoom in enough to get a clear shot.  We tried to get a video camera from neighbors but could only find a pair of binouculars.  When we viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared to be dark in color and somewhat amorphous in shape.  At times, depending on the angle, it looked like a black blob with a tail, like a tadpole.  Later, it appeared to look almost like the silouette of a bat, like something you would see at Halloween.  It also appeared to have something smaller trailing it.  I am not sure, but they may have been connected.  My neighbors and I watched the object until the sun went down, at which time we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared in the north and proceeded south until out of view.  All that could be seen was the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out and observed this stationary red light in the western sky. i watched it for about 5 minutes, it very slowly flashed but did not move. Then it shot straight up into the heavy cloud cover and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on Oct 5th I was out on my back deck.. about 11pm, I noticed again a &#34;red light&#34; I called for both my daughter and her friend to come out and see it.  All three of us watched this light over the course of twenty minutes. At one point it dropped something out of it,  looked like sparks, this seemed to fall about a mile west of my house. The light was identical to the earlier observation. The red light very slowly flashed off and on for about twenty minutes. It very slowly scroosed the sky from west to east as we watched. I went in to the house to get a flashlight and blinked the flashlight off and on in a pattern, it seemed to respond the pattern back to us. Then it sharply went up.. till it was  barely seen, then came back down and traced off to the east, where we no longer could see it. We took a digital picture of the object, it is not very clear, but distinctly shows the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said &#34;Hurry out&#34;. I came out and looked up at the sky. There were 4 balls of light/translucent kind of, coming together and separating. They all had their own specific circle and then they all met at the center, coming together, to separate and do the process again. Like a dance. On the right handed side of the sky, to this event, there were 2 other circles of light, not in this pattern, but just circling in their own pattern, near each other. THere were clouds in the sky, but these weren&#39;t clouds dancing!!

It became more solid white and then something lowered through it. The shape of the object was spherical and very massive, about 2000 ft. up.  The sides of the sphere were tall, it was not a flat sphere.  My son was present with me and he became frightened and ran inside. Then as the sphere lowered more over the Ala Wai canal, just a little west of Diamond Head Crater, a green channel of light was extended down from the craft and that channel of light did not touch any of the apartment buildings or the street below. I called son back to see the channel of light and he described the same thing that I saw, that the green channel of light did not touch all the way down.  The object we saw lasted only one minute in the sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were two Aliens that looked like they were working on something because they looked to have tools in thier hands.  Then we got back our regular t.v. show and it happened again. The same two Aliens at a table with tools. It lasted about 10-15 seconds again. But this time they looked up and it seemed like they knew they were on t.v. or something because the picture cut out fast. I looked at every channel I have and there was nothing even close to what we seen. Is it posible that they are useing our own satilites to communicate? It was very strange to say the lest. But we did see it. The Aliens looked just like they say. Big heads, big eyes, small mouth, no ears that we could see. They wore something that covered them like a doctors smock.

It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car.  I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds.  It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis.  I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve.  When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was.  At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane.  Its pale green light was steady, not blinking.  And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line.  I have never seen any plane do like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO.  He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west.  He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds.  But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead.  And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane.  And the craft was perfectly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My first thought was a plane on fire, but there was no engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A little larger than what Venus used to look like with the naked eye. In the middle of the northwestern sky. It looked like what a close airplane might look like if it were hovering and flashing the lights rapidly. It wasn&#39;t necessarily low or close...but very noticeable in the middle of a clear sky.  It flashed/twinkled/sparkled for about 10 mins before I got my daughter. She saw the same thing. We watched it for another 10-15 minutes before some low clouds of a nearing front covered up the view. I spend a lot of time outside at this time of the evening, am very knowledgable about astronomy and weather and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.

I say north to south but it could very well have been descending.  It was to the right of the moon.  I told my brother and my friends to look up and see what that was.  When I was preparing to take video of it, the sphere started to fade away.  At first we thought it was moving behind a cloud, but we realized that the whole time we could see it through the clouds.  It was more as if it took off away from us, at high speed and all you could see was a small dot then nothing.  This is my second time reporting about objects like these in the same area(2 miles east of downtown) except this time, the object was much closer than before.  Almost every night you can see balls like these moving across the sky.  Like before, airplanes nor helicopters, or even satellites look or act the way these spheres do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dropped the ball immediatly and yelled &#34;look!&#34; All my friends were amazed to see there was a circle shaped object in the sky. It looked like a dark color but had a green glow to it. It was just floating right above the hill. We watched it maybe 20 seconds before it slowly dropped to the tre line atop the hill. the quickly shot across the trees and was out of our site in less than 3 seconds. It was maybe 50-100 foot long. I told my mom about it the next day and she said there were 3 people from around the area call into to WYMT, the local news station and tell the weatherman what had happen. He said he would research it and get back to us. The night after the sighting the weatherman had said it had nothing to do with weather he don&#39;t know what is was. Now I am 15 years old and take stuff like this serious. I used to not believe in Ufos because the bible says nothing about it. But the bible doesn&#39;t say there are none either.

I scanned the sky a few times and then looked straight ahead and noticed a strange craft that was glowing orange that was situated just above the trees moving a slow rate of speed. I raced to the room next door to the lounge and grabbed my video camera. I made my way back to the lounge as swiftly as possible as I reached the window I turned the camera on and was able to get a short 15 second recording of the orange craft that was no longer glowing. When I further analysed the video I noticed that the craft seems to be two circles attached together which startled me. I am positive that this was not a plane because the object has no wings also it is definitely not a helicopter and to add to that I am sure this object is not a balloon, satellite or flare. I have no idea what I have videotaped but I can say for sure that at this time it is a UFO. What I really find odd is the fact this object looks like two circular shaped UFO&#39;s combined together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The footage can be viewed at my website - www.alienationsam.com<n>

The room was also lit with two lamps and the light was still bright enough for me to notice it.

It had a long thin trail, but the curious thing was that it dropped debris as it flew by. This debris was a constant curtain of burning material that decreased to the rear of the ball. There was no sound. It appeared that the object was a low-mass object..it&#39;s speed did not seem right for the size etc. After a 5 sec. period, it simply blinked out..and the falling material actually continued for less than a second after it blinked out<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the correct date for the event is October 04th, 2006.

I was facing South/West when I noticed in the distance above the tree line (about 45 degrees) double tiered lights (angled) of red, orange, yellow, almost like the sun setting in the clouds. I did not have camera but did not want to leave to get it because I was curious as to what I was looking at. The top tier seemed to move over the bottom tier and vanish. Then the bottom tier seemed to shrink into a star-like ball. Then it vanished. The whole incident seemed to have lasted about two minutes.  I am curious if anyone else saw this and reported it. And, also want to know if it could have been gas pocket of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Happened about one hour later, now I thought it was lightning related a severe weather was predicted, checked local rader but no imminent weather was near.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 2AM the lights were back but much brighter, looked outside and noticed what lloked light multiple moving bright lights through the dense trees. They seem to be on top of a small hill or even the top of the trees. Gusty winds make the trees move and made it hard to have a clear shot at the event, they seem to brighten and dim and have little color (red) in them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was  a forestfire with severe weather daily prior to this. I quickly dismissed this as a fire does not produce flashlight like beams to reach my window several hundred feet away. ext I though hunters setting up in the trees but this is all private propertie with no hunting activity in years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my wife and went outside on the deck to take a better look but moving trees prevented this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light disappeared about 15 minutes later and occurred again about 30 min later for no more than 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These bright white flashes were continual and only appeared in the early hours of morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the third day of this going on we had contacted our neighbor and asked him if he had seen any unusual white flashes in the early morning hours and he looked at us like we were insane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife including our three children ended up sleeping together until we found out what these white flashes were, only problem is other things started happening. Around two and three in the early morning hours we started hearing a low hum similar to a vibration, so I took my ladder out and climbed up on our roof and seen no cable interruption. In my line of work I work for an electrical company but I will not mention which one out of the fear of possible retaliation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife as well as my eldest child felt our home was haunted but something kept telling me differently, for example one evening we heard such a loud noise like a jet blast but throughout the entire sky and to this day I have never heard such a loud noise and hopefully we never will again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These white flashes seemed to subside to only then be replaced by what appeared to be a red laser type of beam. This beam for a better word would spell out threats on our bedroom wall as well as through our house, again emphasizing that my wife said our home was haunted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it happened, one evening the threats started getting worse and we started to see a few circular objects in the Southern sky and after contacting more than just a few local officials, for the most part each one felt we had lost our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They and by they I am referring to whoever or whatever was using these red beams started writing on our walls information that no one had any access to and it started to cause a very prominent divide in our family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the words that to this day still standout were such words as die, filthy, leave,  you cannot make us leave, Norma [my wife felt maybe a correlation to Marilyn Monroe?], they whoever they are mentioned they still are visiting others who they have talked to before and they wanted me to go public which I refused and that seemed to anger them worse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This red beam went as far as naming each member of our family and each evening it grown worse. The writing started lasting later into the morning and longer, personally I started losing more sleep as each day passed until finally we had enough and we now are staying with friends until we move back to Missouri where my wife has family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this red beam was writing, it would also make direct contact to my wife on her body including myself and we could feel heat from it. After it started leaving marks on my wife in the form of small burns around her head, neck, ears, and along her legs. That is when we moved to a friends home that I met after moving to Sarpy county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to tell anyone who may be reading this that I am an electrician by trade and in no way shape or form have I in my entire life ever have dealt with anything like this and to those others who these things refer to, my family who are dealing with this, our heart goes out to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To all the officials we contacted I would like to end this by saying thank you for nothing.<n>

I was out on my porch watching the stars when one of them moved. The object was brighter than most of the stars, but the light pulsed unlike other stars I had seen. The movement of this particular object was that it moved much like how an eel would through water. As I stared at it it even looked like it had a tail that slithered through the air. I watched if for about 45 minutes until it moved out of my line of site. I also heard a constant high pitched sound, the amount of time, but that could have been from anywhere...I do live in the middle of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was either light in color or appeared so against the dark sky.  We thought of a mickey mouse balloon because it seemed to have bulges coming from it and seemed to be tumbling, so that the bulges alternated sides of the object.  It was odd, though, because it didn&#39;t seem to be moving in any sort of wind as you would expect a balloon to do.  If it was a balloon, it would have had to be only a few hundred feet up considering the apparent size to us.  Eventually, we started seeing some light coming from it.  The light was red and intermittent.  At the same time the object started to appear to move upward, as it seemed smaller and smaller.  Soon it headed north and moved more like a conventionaly plane.  It still had some light coming from it, but it didn&#39;t look regular like you would expect for running lights of an airplane.  My eyes may have been playing tricks on me, but I thought I saw some &#34;shimmering&#34; intermittent lights, possibly blue, which appeared to surround the object on one side for very brief flashes.  As we watched the object move off to the north (by this time it was simply a light), it appeared to possibly interact with another light of similar intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to burn with a bright white color.  The object moved in a left to right (south to very slightly northeast) direction and seemed to hold a relatively flat trajectory across the sky.  The sighting lasted approximately 60 to 90 seconds.  As the object moved away to the north, it separated into at least 5 individual, small orange objects that trailed it in a straight line.  The small objects diminished in size with the largest directly behind and the smallest at the end of the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had the sunroof open that night just to enjoy the night. While driving I looked up through the sunroof and noticed a fairly large orange, redish, yellow ball in the night sky. It caught my attention because it was too large to be a star. When I realized that it wasnt a star or plane I was stunned. I pulled over without taking my eyes off this thing and before I could park it began to drip like a candle. I almost crashed! I got out tripping over my own foot and stood still looking at this crazy site. It dripped again and again!! The drips burned as they fell from this object. What was this ball of light dripping like a candle. It began to change colors (orange/yellow/red) and flickered. Suddenly it flickered out!! Amazing!! All of a sudden it comes back on!!  Flickers for a minute and goes out like it was never there. I was stunned. This light was very large to be a star and very hard to miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The first witness saw the object from the south east and claims that it was in several parts glowing or burning in a bright greenish light. The centre of the falling object was black and looked to be sqaure in shape, rolling out of control. The second witness viewed it from the east and agrees that the object was squarish in shape but it was glowing or burning in a bright blue light and it was only one object rather than several. This witness saw the object for only a second or too though wheras the first witness saw it for a longer time with a clearer view. It looked to be about a mile away, falling in an area  known as Milton of Campsie.  It was thought to be a piece of falling aircraft but there was no aircraft in the skies at that time. It is possible that it was a meteroite of some sort but the shape of the object suggested machinery and it was rolling around so the shape was clearly defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be burning up or something, headed down at an angle cutting across the sky.  Similar to a shooting star but much larger and far closer.  Definitely NOT an airplane!  The shape was square-like, but it appeared to be flaming (whitish, some pale orange light) so it masked some of the definition.  As it reached the NNW, it seemed to just suddenly disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking out over a field in rural oregon every night i am well aware of the distance of landmarks  in sight and how fast and far planes, helicopters, and satellites etc. move in relation to them. these 3lights moved way too fast to be any of the aforementioned in my opinion and stayed at perfect equal distances from each other while moving rapidly across the sky at about 45 degrees from the horizon. it appeared to me they were holding together a massive disc shaped object. sort of like the way you can see the dark side of the moon just a bit because you know it is there.  by the tiome i grabbed my girlfriend and dad, about one minute had passed and the lights were just beginning to duck behind a hill. gone a few seconds later. by this point they had traveled one quarter of the horizon in less than two minutes . this takes jets more than ten several times a day. all while remaining perfectly equal distances in relation to each other. i am a 26 year old male who plays music and doesnt care one way or another about what is in the sky, except that this REALLY freaked me out. On a side note my dad expressed a in intense felling of DE JA VU.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(now i cant be sure but i think it changed direction while passing between my telescope and the moons surface.) i watched for this again and saw it three more times. i then went into the house and told my wife what i had seen. &#34;oh my god, your an idiot&#34; she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i talked her into watching for the same thing. 5 mins i told her. just 5 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> she agreed and actually saw it after about 5 mins of moon gazing. she thinks it was a bug crossing the glass of the telescope, so i waved my finger in front of it while she looked through and could not see my finger. so i asked her how could she see a bug? she thinks im crazy but i think this is a craft of somekind and that it had to be extremely large to see from my puny telescope. anyone one else see this?<n>

They were actually at 2 different times. Also I need to point out that I live close to an air force base. There are times when I&#39;ve seen obvious unknown military planes and one would suspect these as being &#34;UFOs&#34;. As we all know, not everything seen can be said to be from another planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object i saw was in the middle of a large amount of air traffic. I was in the backyard taking my dog out and happened to noticed how much air traffic was flying over. There are several distinctive paths where the airlines fly and over the years I&#39;ve come to know where in they sky they usually are. There was plane after plane. Probably about 5 minutes apart in sightings. All of a sudden there was this one object that came across the sky in a totally odd flight path. It had lighting like what you see when several windows of a commercial plane is glowing. There was probably 8 double windows down the side. It sort of had a banana shape to it actually. There were no other lights. No red blinking light underneath. No landing geat lights either. Just these lights. It seemed to hold some reflection from the ground as there was a slight glow. Not a glow as if it were from the object, but just reflected up from the ground. It didn&#39;t really have a feel that it was flying straight either. I got a sense of a &#34;tumbling&#34; while watching it. It went over in an &#34;S&#34; shape too. It came from the north flying southwest, then southeast, then back southwest. It was wide curves and not sudden direction changes. I couldn&#39;t say there was no sound either as there was still many other planes flying over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object came a few hours later. I decided to go back out to see if I could see something else. Just something you do I guess when you see an object like that. Sort of a hope that you see it again I guess. As I was looking up I noticed a &#34;star&#34; out of place straight over head. I know the constellations pretty well so I knew this light shouldn&#39;t be there. About that time I noticed it was actually moving. It was really slow. Iwas traveling from the west heading East. It&#39;s the path that I generally see satellites when they are illuminated by the sun. I had thought that&#39;s what this was too, but it was moving so slow I felt that was worth ruling out. It kept travling the same path and became dimmer and dimmer as it move toward the Earth&#39;s shadow. It was just like a satellite in everyway, just extremely slow. The complete time of seeing this object would be around 12 - 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these object could easily have other explainations rather than &#34;UFO&#34;. They are UFOs though in the sense that I had no clue what they were. I don&#39;t think any other regular average person could have said either. But I thought this was worth reporting. I would have sent info in sooner but I had teken pictures of the first object and was trying to get something to show up. I used a digital camera and had the settings wrong. All I got was a blurry dim light in one photo and nothing in the others. I tried to increase the brightness and played with the contrast but was unable to get a shape. There wasn&#39;t anything worth sending with this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed out the corner of my eye out the window these 2 lights hovering over the mountains. I went to look out the window figuring it was planes, and I was thinking, what are those planes doing so close to each other? Then I relized they werent moving at all. I went to get some binoculars for a better look and then I notced that each one had three diff. lights on the sides and infact were not moving. after watching them for about 10-15 minutes, they started to slowly follow eachother north and then quickly disseapeared., strange, I didnt know what to think of it!<n>

I leaned my head back to look at the sky, bored, while we were waiting for the light to change. The sky was clear blue, but my eyes immediately fixed onto an object. It was very high in the sky. I couldn&#39;t make out a shape, but it was reflecting light. It appeared stationary in the sky. I tried to determine if there was any movement at all. The light turned green and we rolled forward to the next cross street, Frazee Road. The light was green there so we rolled right on through. I never looked away. I could tell where we were because the road goes uphill from there and turns slightly to the left. I removed my ballcap and tried to keep an eye on the object. I didn&#39;t say anything to my friends because at this point, I was believing this to be one of those food store balloons you usually see at the register. I thought maybe a kid had lost one. Then I saw the object appear to reflect light in two spots, like maybe there was not one but two objects. Still, I thought, maybe they were two balloons tied together. The strange thing was, I couldn&#39;t really tell if the object drifted any. I wasn&#39;t in the best circumstance for viewing them, I realize, and they may have been just balloons, maybe even a weather balloon, but the thing that seemed off to me was that they did seem perfectly still in the sky. *shrugs* Posting it here just in case it was something more and someone else got a better view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seem to be stationed all around and so easily visible. They around. I would imagine a gunmetal color with lights of some kind all around their middles...like a belt. The lights alternate colors, not quite blinking but moving in a rythm the way the signs at movie theaters and similar places do. They alternate colors, similar to the way a projector does, like at the movie theater. They are somewhat stationary, moving usually only in one direction (up) and very slowly. They are visible on clear nights. I have watched many airplanes fly around in the sky and also have watched many many stars. They are not either and that is what I am positive about. The difference between these and a twinkling star is drastic. I have not seen any other accounts of these things, so I&#39;m guessing they are fairly new. They&#39;re so obvious that there should be others. I know that I am not the only one that has seen them. My significant other has seen them before too. Both times i have seen them there&#39;s one that is low and then two more adjacent to it higher up. The last time I watched them I could see more than three. They are odd and intriguing. What purpose do they serve.. they&#39;re not there for nothing. : (<n>

I thought it was a bright star because it looked very far away and it was twinkling.  It must have been far out over the Atlantic, and high enough to be in orbit.  However, the object drifted, and then immediately corrected its position by moving very rapidly in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal fashion.  It did this several times, at times getting much brighter.  Then there appeared to be sparks flashing around/emitting from it in different spaces and at irregular intervals.  It made no noise at all at any time.  I woke my wife (who at first thought I was crazy) and she came outside with me to watch.  She noticed three other objects (one each to our northeast, southwest, and another in the southeast) that were similar and behaved in similar ways, but that were not as bright. We watched the objects for 45 minutes and tried to video-tape the brightest one.  It looks like a star on the tape, however.  We went back inside and re-awoke at 5:00AM (about 45 minutes later while it was still dark out) to find the objects gone.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.  These objects definitely weren&#39;t known aircraft, satelites, or heavenly bodies.  The experience was quite extrordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed approximately 15-20 yellow lights in a u formation flying above. I was facing West, downtown New York City was to my left. The Empire State building was to my right. The formation continued above me and slowly changed formation. It was the top half of a heart formation. There were many airplanes circling the city. The formation of lights was approximately 4 times the width of the aircrafts that I saw around the city. The formation continued southward towards the moon. I ran downstairs one flight to grab a friend. By the time I got back up to the roof the lights had disappeared. We could only see the normal aircrafts in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Even more peculiar is that this object was being tracked by a police helicopter, which kept circling the object and shining a high intensity beam of light on it. The object did not move like any sort of aircraft we have even seen, and appeared almost stationery for five minutes before it gradually started moving downward until it eventually disappeared from view below the horizon. The helicopter began to fly at rapid speed in what appeared to be an attempt to track the object as it continued to move just below the tree lines for several more minutes. We were able to view the object while it was still high over our house with a pair of very good binoculars. Upon closer examination, one could clearly make out two very bright red lights that were close together. Its overall size appeared to be almost the same as the police helicopter&#39;s. Anything more than that would be pure speculation. However, as a person who frequently watches planes and similar craft flying over my house, I can positively state that these lights were not coming from any type of airplane advertisement, helicopter, remote controlled toy craft, or weather balloon, due to the extremely peculiar way it was able to just hover without really moving for several minutes and then take off very quickly. Also, if it made any noise from an engine, we couldn&#39;t hear it, but that may have been due to the loudness of the helicopter nearby. I don&#39;t expect the police to actually own up to chasing this thing, which is why I am reporting it here. However, I will attempt to follow up on this tomorrow by checking the local news reports and the Huntington Beach police blotter. I will submit another entry if I find anything else out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They lasted about 10-15 seconds, then just disappeared. There weren&#39;t any clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind, it was just gone. We continued to search the sky for it, but were unable to find it again. Then at 7:53, 3 lights, perfectly aligned in a crescent shape lit up again, maybe for 3 seconds, then a forth one lit up, in alignment. They stayed there for probably 10 seconds ( long enough for me to stop in the middle of the highway). Then as fast as they were there, they disappeared. Again, for the next 10 minutes, we searched the sky, but couldn&#39;t find anything. I am sure that the first object was a single one, because of the way the lights moved together, but I am unsure if the second one was one complete, or four seperate ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This experience gave me the knowledge and encouragement to become a leader in the aerospace science and international airline spaceline operations. By the grace of God I currently lead the industry as the developer of a spaceship that competed successfully in the 2004 X-Prize race to space for civilian operators. My sisters possessed this same general background in aviation to confirm that what she saw flying object just below the clouds headed directly south as if head toward Colorado Springs Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking up into the local airspace of an extremely located south east Denver neighborhood she observed  a new type of flying ship that was shaped like a open &#34;V&#34; apexes first configuration and moving very fast while making no sound emissions at about 5:30 pm. Because of its smaller size, as compared to a major airliner, she believes that the object, which flew directly over her head at about a 90 degrees zenith point could have possible been a large UVA, CUVA or single piloted craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What captured  her attention was the fact that  the flying machine was following an  unconventional flight route that deviated from the normal east/west ATC regulated  traffic patterns class D airspace  routing support for both DIA and our Buckley AFB  flight patterns. She observed white lights illuminate near the outer section of both delta wing tip leading edges and possessed no power-plant thrust production smoke or vapors trailing it as it few at a low altitude. She does not remember the exact day but it was seen early last week around the 2ed of October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final note in relation to this strange sighting its interesting to note that the sighting was made just before the North Korea nuclear boom test firing event schedule which place America’s spying activities on full alert. My sister know her airplane and I believe what she saw was something new.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

While taking the photos I noticed a strange craft hovering and slowly moving over Manhattan.  I have been involved in aircraft all my life and upon noticing this craft I was immediately shocked.  It was a cloud shape form very obscure yet with a flat and roating movement to it.  It was not a cloud it was in front of the clouds at sun set.  It began to change shape and move all the while changing in color due to the sun.  We took 9 photographs of the object and it changed shape moved across the city.  Turned at amazing angles.  Then conformed into a ball and shot straight up into the sky.  Going from a low altitutde to the outreach of space in a matter of seconds.  6minutes after the sighting while it was still in the sky a strange large black aircraft began to move in the general direction of the craft.  The photos are very strange and show an amazing object.  Thanks for listening!<n>

I saw at about three in the morning this bright gold light emerge over the Jemez mountains heading east.  At first it looked like it was an approaching helicopter with alternate gold and red blinking lights.  Then it just kind of sat in the sky and looked like a star, but really close.  I observed it move at a rate much faster than the surrouding stars, until it was out of sight range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the person I was house-sitting for came in and reported seeing three of the same thing in Dixon, NM, along with 12 other people - without me prompting.  I thought no one would believe me or care even - as I didn&#39;t, but they saw it as well, so I decided to report it.<n>

Over a span of the hour and a half these objects moved left, right, up and down while gradually moving NE without breaking their original space in between. After watching them for that span of time, they moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice that when planes or helicopters were in the sky, they stayed perfectly still, but moved as soon as they were a good distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We checked the news to see what it was but all they said it was possibly a meteor or part of the spacestation.  We want an explanation as to what we saw, so if there is any information about this sighting and what it was we would like to know.

As a matter of fact, that was the first thing I noticed when I turned onto Boyero Road, the moon was really beautiful and the clouds were kind of flowing over it.  As I was coming off my road and heading west on Boyero, I noticed five bright, whitish, orange lights moving from south to north, towards Colorado Springs, Colorado.  They were about the size of big headlights.  I stopped my vehicle right away and got out, as they were coming directly at me.  There was one out in front, two others above and below, and then another behind the two middle ones with 3-4 smaller redish, orange lights directly behind. I thought it was a meteor, but it was not moving towards the earth, it was moving in a perfectly straight line about 100 feet or so above me at a very, very, high rate of speed.  What made it really creepy was there was no sound, no sound at all, it was dead silent outside.  The area is very rural and you usually at least hear crickets, but it was dead silent outside, no crickets, no dogs barking, no breeze or wind, absolutely nothing at all.  It was dead still.  The one light right after the main first light would move up and down slightly and then would speed up slightly to almost catch the first light but then it would back off and go back to formation so to speak.  They seemed to appear out of nowhere and right after they passed by me, they were heading north-east and just simply disappeared.  It was that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound.  At first, three objects appeared traveling from southwest moving northeast; they were evenly spaced apart, traveling in a straight line, one behind the other.  Then, at a greater interval, the fourth appeared, traveling at the same speed, direction, path/route, directly behind the first three.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking towards the moon, which was mostly covered by clouds at the time, when I saw a bright yellowish light which disappeared almost immediately upon my sighting it, my first instinct was that it was a meteor or very large &#34;falling star&#34; and remember saying WOW and then when it disappeared (into a cloud probably?), was starting to ask &#34;did you see that?&#34; when it reappeared followed by 4 additional, equally spaced, equally sized lights moving extremely fast from the Northwest towards the Southeast.  My friend also saw the lights after they reappeared and we watched until they disappeared over the Rampart Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did disagree about 2 things when we compared remembered details.  I thought the lights were in a sort of chevron pattern with 4 lights making up one leg and 1 light down from the point making up the other, he thought it was a straight line.  I remember joking at the time that maybe &#34;our&#34; geese had headlights cause I didn&#39;t know what we really did see.  The other detail we differed on was that I thought the lights were yellowish to white and steady, while he thought they were more yellowish red also steady.  We commented on the total silence during the entire event, and both noticed there were no other planes visable until approximately 10 minutes after the lights were out of our view.  We were in a valley where any type of jet or plane can be heard long before it is visable.  We also agreed that there was no visable craft, we merely saw lights, far below the normal jet space and moving far too rapidly to be small planes or helicopters-that we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;s an unrelated coincidence, but approximately 40 seconds after we lost sight of the lights, we heard 2 rather muffled rumbles, maybe 2 seconds apart.  It was probably thunder, but if so it was the only thunder we heard.  That, too, is not terribly unusual in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were traveling northeast one behind the other in a straight line.  They looked like huge stars, whitish in color, smaller than what the moon looks like.  We ran out on our deck to watch them.  We watched for about 10 seconds.  They were close - between us and the mountain range on the other side of the highway.  We didn&#39;t hear anything.  One by one, from the furthest south, they each disappeared.  The first object, which was the last one left, was almost directly east of our house, near the mountain range, turned red, and disappeared.  At the time it disappeared, it was the size of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter and I were outside having a smoke break when she said, &#34;Look!&#34;  I turned around and noticed a bright light in the west, moving NE.  My first thought was &#34;meteor,&#34; although I&#39;ve never seen a meteor that size.  As I watched, the light that appeared as a huge, gold star split into 3, then into 7 smaller &#34;stars.&#34;  They moved quickly and without sound, travelling in a straight line.  We watched them until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my local police department, but no one had reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I live in the mountains, away from city lights, I am able to see meteorites very regularly. This object was considerably larger, and slower, than any meteorite that I have seen. It appeared to be burning,as something would entering the atmosphere,with a whitish, and briefly green &#34;light&#34; as it progressed through its trajectory. Roughly 5 to 10 seconds after it appeared, it seemed to be break up and shed burning pieces of itself,&#34;dropping&#34; them along its flight path. I was able to observe this object&#39;s trajectory until it disappeared from view behind the upper story of my house. I ran to the other end of the deck, but it was no longer visible. At no time did I hear any sound. The object seemed to be at a relatively low altitude ( though it is difficult for me to guess it&#39;s altitude with any real accuracy, I would guess it was less than 20,000 feet, and perhaps much lower ) had a very flat trajectory, and did not appear to be descending . My object size estimate relative to the moon, given each objects respective distance to me, would be that the object was 1/15th to 1/20th of the moon size.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned and saw 7 bright lights gliding silently in a northeastly direction.  There was no blinking lights, no tails like meteors. Just bright yellow lights that were bigger than stars and closer to earth.  I watched them for about 30 seconds and they faded away into the clouds.  They were travelling in a straight line.  I have seen some strange objects over the years, but none as spectular as this.  I felt that this was something I should report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to maybe be comets but I cannot be sure. When they first came into view there were about 8-10 of them and they were orange and left trails or orange as well. After about 5 seconds they went behind a cloud and then 2 of them came out on the other side. They kept flying for about another 5 seconds until they were out of view. About 10 seconds after they were gone, I had not taken my eyes off of the sky, an airkplane came into view and flew behind the same cloud and then came out and left view. All of the objects were behind the cloud for approximately 5 seconds. I see many airplanes fly by my house, but have never seen any other flying objects. I am a strong believer in extra-terrestrials and immediately knew I would have to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were out the window shades were open. I noticed a  white movement out the window. I jumped out of bed saying &#34;What it that?&#34; &#34;What isss that?&#34; My husband stirred. It looked like 4-5 very large thin oval shapes, directly in a line, low in the sky heading east, I was looking south. The movement was just slightly south/east. There were long thing clouds in the sky, it was clear. It seemed bright- mostly from the not full moon but also from the light. There was no sound. I said, &#34;look, oh wait you missed it&#34; (the items had just disappeared behind the siloette of a tree. &#34;Wait, look to the left of the tree you will see it come out&#34;...nothing did.  I couldn&#39;t believe it. I descibed this to my husband. The next few days I could not let it go. I went to a UFO sightings website (something I had never done before)and looked for sightings. Several people descibed seeing something similar at about the same time and day. I did not report my sighting. But then, Saturday, I read the Friday Colorady Daily newspaper, where there was an article about a man who is a meteor hunter. It stated he searched for marble-size rocks in a 50-mile strip of Colorado.There was a picture of him holding a piece of the meteorite that occured on Oct. 1, 2006. One of the brightest meteors reported in recent years slow-danced across Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Apparantly landing south of Colorado Springs. And he was holding a piece of it that looked about the size of a coconut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

October 2, 2006  At approximately 11:15 p.m., Sunday, October 1, 2006, I woke to go to the bathroom and noticed slowly moving lights on the wall in my bedroom as if from car headlights. I looked out the North facing window out of curiosity and began to question myself because there are no nearby driveways behind and to the North of our 2 and ½  acre property. There appeared to be a low flying object of horizontal white light moving about 5 or 10 mph just 100 ft. or a little higher above the ground,heading South. As I watched and tried to figure out what it was, the white light turned a beautiful shade of bright blue and began to move faster and seemed to turn to the North east before vanishing from my sight. All in all only about 30 to 45 seconds passed from the moment I saw that it was in the air to the moment it turned away and seemed to vanish. No noise was heard by me. The strip of light might have been about 20 ft. long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My thought then was that it would streak across the sky to the north and that would  be it. But, instead as I was driving I didn&#39;t see it streak and instead looked back to the left and saw that this object seemed to slow down to a really slow speed, and as it was night time I couldn&#39;t get a good feel for what altitude that it was at. As I&#39;ve said I was driving and on my way home which is outside of the town limits towards the Taos Pueblo. I slowed down considerably due to me trying to keep this object in my eyesight. At this time I was able to get a good look at it and could see that it was what appeared to be a segmented string of objects which was the center mass and around and leading this, were what appeared to be smaller disk shaped lights which were space evenly around in a &#34;v&#34; shaped formation. These where what I thought at first to be sparks or flares, but as mentioned, since it had &#34;slowed&#34; down and I also had been able to travel the half mile down the road at a 15mph speed or so, and had left the town area where the overhead lights diminished the clarity of the night sky, the details stood out quite a bit. I by now had pulled over on the side of the road and could see that this object was moving by now with faster speed and seemed to be &#34;banking&#34; directly towards an opening between the Taos Mountain/Wheeler peak area and the El Salto peaks area. The object moved in a smooth, almost liquid motion with all of it&#39;s &#34;satellites&#34; moving in unision, and when it approached the opening between these two landmasses, it sort of &#34;flowed&#34; through the opening, with again, a smooth banking motion. At that point, I could see that on the top of this object were what looked to be a series of flashing lights running from front to back, twinkling in series and at the &#34;end&#34; of it were three flashing li! ghts, in a triangle shape. At that point, it seemed to just speed up and travel through that area very fast and apparently head northeast where it disappeared behind the Taos Mtn.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had napped previously, so was not drowsy.  I happened to look up at the bright stars in the clear sky and noticed what looked like a group of shooting stars coming down from the extreme upper right cornerof my field of vision (traveling fast, from SW to NE).  I expected them to fizzle out, but, instead, they halted and a globular formation of probably five to seven bright, white balls appeared, perfectly spaced.  They hovered high above the highway, to the south of it,  each ball appearing much larger than an aircraft, smaller than the moon, not blinking but shimmering somewhat. I pulled the car over and watched as they hovered there, appearing to be at about the height of a helicoptor, with no apparent change in color and no sound.  Suddenly, the group of lights disappeared, then reappeared very quickly to the north side of the highway--as if they had just shifted in unison, apparently not changing configuration at all.  After a few seconds longer, they just shot off abruptly to the NE, rising at about a 45 angle--just as they had appeared, but reversing the pattern and looking again like shooting stars.  It left me awe-stricken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this on another site, but never heard back from them, then finally contacted a group headquartered in Denver and have just been told to check your site for the many other sightings of similar ball-shaped lights which occured over Colorado at just about this same time.  I was stunned to read all of these reports, but also gratified to have some confirmation that others may have seen the same thing. I have never seen a UFO before, but I firmly believe that to be the only possible explanation for what I know I saw.  I am a high school teacher who works in Denver but I commute on weekends to my family home in Montrose; I know the route well.  This area is agricultural, with few buildings around but is near the Eagle River and about 10 miles from the airport in that county.  (The other site asked about such proximities).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound.  It made a turn to the north and then transfigured into a transparent swirling hovering mass over the valley with what looked like clear egg shaped objects swirling inside.  Seconds later five or six tiny orange lights like sparks ejected in a line out the back and all evaporated into the darkness without ever getting near the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten seconds later we noticed an airplane flying northwest, over the Santa Fe mountains.

My husband saw them through our window while we were watching TV.  He jumped up to look and called for me to look.  I saw them as well.  We ran outside to see them, but they were gone. They flew faster than a jet but slower than a meteor. There were jet planes in the sky much higher that we could hear, but there was no sound from the four lights which were much lower.  They did not move in a straight line, which ruled out meteors in our mind.  In 1997 I was outside and witnessed the same thing about the same time of night in this same place but only one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to look up in the sky  and saw 5 or 6 bright spheres  in a line formation  racing from one cloud  to  another.    I  couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and  shouted to my husband to stop, telling him what I was seeing.  He was driving and couldn&#39;t  see above the car but  when he stopped, I jumped out and saw the spheres disappear behind a cloud.   There were no sounds  at the time I saw  the spheres, and they were too large to be airplanes.   They were travelling at a very fast speed, nothing like I have ever seen in the sky before.   There were no blinking lights and I do not believe it was an aircraft of this world. They were travelling so fast there was a glow  behind them.  I think they were travelling faster than light.    by the time we reached our driveway,  my husband heard 5 loud explosions,  which we later learned  were heard by our neighbors (the sounds woke them up).    This is my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was just east of Denver at what seemed to be 40 to 50 thousand feet and was moving north to northeast.  4 to 5 smaller lights appeard behind the main object at even spacing, and maintained the same altitude and speed as the lead object.  I asked Denver Center (Air Traffic Control) if they had traffic at my 9 o&#39;clock high. They replied negative. I said &#34;maybe it&#39;s space junk burning up&#34; but another airliner on frequency said no, it was moving too horizontal and did not have a trail of burning debris.  I agreed. The lights went out as they moved off to the north and east.  I&#39;ve seen many meteors while flying and this was not a meteor.  It was not a conventional aircraft as it had no positon, strobe, or anti-colllision lights.  I have 17,000+ hours of flying time over 40 years.  I&#39;m a Captain at a major airline and a retired USAFR Lt Col fighter pilot.

I knew that it was too late (11:15pm MDT) for Venus to be above the horizon.  I started watching the white light because it got larger and brighter; it seemed to be traveling from SW to NE across the sky.  I could not judge the speed because I could not judge the height from the ground but it was not close to the ground.  As it got closer the bright, round light in the center appeared much larger than any planet but smaller than the moon.  At that point it had a halo or aura around it, the width of one side of the halo approximately the width of the bright light at the center.  I also noticed at this point what looked like white &#34;fireworks&#34; shooting up (?) from the circular object.  Then as the object got closer it appeared to evolve into 5 or 6 bright lights, more or less in a straight line, which continued on the SW to NE path through the sky.  I was still driving and lost sight of the lights as they appeared to go overhead.  The entire sighting lasted about two minutes.  I should also note that, just to be sure that I was not seeing some strange reflection in my side car window, I rolled the window completely down as I was driving, and still saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------------  NOTES RECORDED LATER FROM MEMORY, ON OCTOBER 16, 2006:  When I drove that stretch of Hwy 50 again on Oct 14th, I decided that the timeframe was more likely one and one-quarter minutes to one and one-half minutes, not two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the physical description of the phenomenon is best related as five distinct appearances during the one and one-half minutes I saw it:  (1) Bright light on the horizon, just above the foothills to the southwest, when I first saw it; larger and brighter than a planet;  (2) Bright light with aura or halo around it;  (3) Bright light with aura, plus white streaks appearing to shoot out the top of it;  (4) As object continued to get closer, the white streaks (trails of light) in the sky then appeared in SW to NE lines rather than appearing to “shoot out the top of it;”  (5)  When the phenomenon was nearly overhead, it appeared as 4, 5 or 6 distinct, bright white lights, continuing on the SW to NE pathway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we consider her to be an excellent witness.  If her estimate of the duration of the event is accurate, the object, almost certainly, was not a meteor.  PD))<n>

She called me to quickly come out on the deck to see them. I did so. (Our home sits on a hill facing to the southeast, overlooking the South Park region of the central Colorado Rockies.)  There were six yellowish orange (light orange) lights visible at roughly equal intervals, positioned fairly closely together in a &#39;follow-the-leader&#39; fashion, moving from South to North, at an estimated distance of roughly one mile away from our observation point, low in the sky- (likely less than half a mile above the ground) They were moving at a constant speed and altitude, and no sound was able to be heard. The single light on each object appeared to be emitted form the front of each, relative to the direction of their travel; as they passed and were moving away, the lights began to be blocked progressively by the bulk of each object, so that they were obstructed progeessively until they were no longer visible when they were past us by 45 to 50 degrees. The lights were visible for less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning, my brother-in-law, who was visiting &amp; staying in their RV on our property, reported that he was also outside at the same time, and also saw these lights pass by from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> M&#39;s added report: When I saw the lights I knew instantly they were like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a strange color- sort of an orange glow where a cockpit would be, however, the glow did not come out in a beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though we could hear other night sounds and traffic noises three miles away, the lights were utterly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an impression that the craft( If that is what they were) had an elongated shape, but I cannot be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was in the south and they were flying away from it so we were not catching reflections from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had no wing or tail lights of any kind and were only visable for about 30 seconds. There were 6 of them in a straight line maybe a half mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not appear to be abnormaly large (but bgigger than the stars). The night was lit with moon light and a few light wispy clouds were out. There was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I am a naturalist and very used to picking out details in the natural world.)<n>

It disappeared over the horizon.  The object seem to be traveling from the south direction and disappeared into the northeast direction between Wide Ruins School and Window Rock, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It must have landed somewhere to the north. We could clearly see the object was well below the surrounding mountain ranges.  Nothing ever took off.  The great Gila Wilderness lies to the north.  Silver City sets in a valley.  DEFINTELY NOT A METEOR, SPACE JUNK, OR AIRCRAFT THAT WE KNOW OF.  It flew fast in and slowed down as it passed low over the city and then appeared to land somewhere to the north, which is rugged country.

I was completely taken by surprise and got so excited that I may not have all the particulars of the event correct. On Sunday night, Oct. 1, 2006 around 11:00 p.m (probably after) through the sliding glass door of a hill top house in Cuchara Colorado, I noticed around six balls of light which appeared to be traveling horizontally above the town of Cuchara (I believe the direction was some variation of an west to east movement). Due to the darkness of the night I couldn&#39;t tell if they were above or below the mountains on the other side of the valley (I assumed they were slightly above). I did have time to jump up and open the sliding glass door to watch the objects and make sure I was not seeing a reflection of some sort. There was no sound at all. The objects where traveling in a straight line and about the speed that orbiting satellites travel. There appeared to be about six very very bright glowing white ball shaped objects. The next to the last one appeared to have a tail, like it was frizzling out. I have no idea how large they really were, but if one extended their hand and made a fist, that would be about the size they appeared in my view. I had assumed it was some space junk on it&#39;s last leg of re-entry (or weather ballons). I&#39;m glad to know other people saw it, I was beginning to wonder. Once again, I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have better info for you. I failed to make good mental notes (I&#39;m not even totally sure the number was six), it was late and I was tired. I&#39;ve seen alot of meteors on my visits to Cuchara, but I&#39;ve never seen objects move in a line like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My immediate, knee-jerk response was that it was a shooting star, but the object was good-sized (round, white though not overly bright, shaped something like a small but distant moon) and didn&#39;t disintegrate, but kept moving intact across the window.  I was sitting on the sofa with a friend, saw the object at first out of the corner of my eye, and ran immediately to the deck on the west side to try to see more of it.  I live in the mountains in the Santa Fe Nat&#39;l Forest and so what I saw on the deck was through several trees.  The object was moving north, into the forest, and by the time I reached my deck it was no longer a pale round object but was something bright, elongated (rectangular like a train with segmented/lighted windows), and it seemed quite close.  My friend also saw this (though she did not see the round object through the window because she was sitting with her back to it).  I want to add that I am one of the most rational people on the planet, have never given much creedence to UFO stories or sightings (though I contingently acknowledge that given the size of the universe, there cannot but be intelligent life somewhere other than here--that&#39;s if you take the current situation on this planet as created by &#34;intelligent&#34; life--so I tried to explain the light I saw from my deck: a plane (flying that close and headed directly into a forest? not likely)? a helicoptor (there was absolutely no sound)?  So I was and am left totally mytified by what this was.  I was so curious, in fact, that I convinced my friend to come with me and drive out into the forest in the direction it was headed.  We drove for probably ten miles or so on the forest road but saw nothing at all.  The next morning I saw on the morning news that other people had reported seeing something which the Los Alamos Lab said was probably a meteor, though it had not registered on their radar (the person interviewed! said th at this might be due to the fact that there was not enough light radiating for the radar to pick up the object--this couldn&#39;t possibly be the cause since this oject was quite large for a meteor).  No one reported seeing anything elongated, such as the object I saw from my deck.  I&#39;ve been watching for more reports about this but have seen nothing else.  I&#39;m very curious about any other sightings on that night.  Just a note, re. the Colorado sightings on Oct 1--I did not see numerous colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was seen as far as Washington state.&#34; advertisement  Kip and Valerie Wachter saw the fireball pass over their heads about 10:15 Sunday evening as they walked north of Pinetop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The colors were a bright green, red, white. The size was about three times wider than its length. It seemed to emanate a low, soft swishing sound as it passed overhead,&#34; the Wachters wrote in an e-mail to The Republic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Steve Kates, a Chandler resident and science journalist known as &#34;Dr. Sky,&#34; said that description, particularly the noise, was consistent with meteoric activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most meteors visible on earth occur high in the atmosphere and these &#34;shooting stars&#34; are about the size of a grain of dust, said Jeffrey Hall, associate director at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The great majority are these tiny particles moving through the atmosphere at a high rate of speed,&#34; Hall said. &#34;Larger ones tend to be moving more slowly and produce a much larger trail through the sky.&#34;  Between 10 and 50 meteor events occur over the Earth each day, according to the American Meteor Society, with the vast majority happening over oceans and out of eyesight. Meteors lose mass and decelerate as they enter the atmosphere, with only the largest slamming into the Earth and forming a crater. Scientists think the Barringer Crater, near Winslow, was formed by an iron meteor about 50,000 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kates said a meteorite the size of a human fist could have created the light show West Coast residents witnessed Sunday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rural/Metro responded to the north side of Saguaro Lake but found no sign of damage or destruction from a plane crash, Cooper said. Witnesses reported seeing the meteor travel from southwest to northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hall said the meteor likely never made it to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;This is not like a mountain coming into the atmosphere. It&#39;s more like the size of a softball,&#34; Hall said. &#34;Even something this bright probably burned up completely in the atmosphere.&#34;  If you saw the meteor or have photos of it, call reporter JJ Hensley at (602) 444-7964 or e-mail him at jj.hensley@arizonarepublic.com<n>

They were so brilliant that we first saw them from inside, and had time to walk outside and watch as they continued Eastward, until they either faded away or passed behind the mountain range(Las Truchas).  They moved much more slowly than meteors, and were flaring brighter then dimmer.  At first we saw between eight and ten, then less and less.  They were about thirty degrees above the horizon, and were seen to the North of the Santa Fe area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I judged it to be a clump of 4 tightly spaced objects glowing green moving about 150 mph west to east at elevation 10,500&#39;about 1/4 mile away. Our cabin elevation is 10,300&#34;. After calling attention to her and watching it then thru the cabin window I rushed out to the deck to see it passing behind a large tree. At that time (within the approx. two seconds while changing positions and it being out of my sight) it had changed to four separate pieces spaced equally apart. The distance between each being about 1.5 times the length of the single stick formation. Each piece was about the size of an oil drum; my original impression was that the &#34;stick&#34; was about half the length and diameter of a small aircraft making a landing approach. The group disappeared behind trees and I waited for over 30 seconds to see or hear an impact. Unless they had made a right angle upward turn they had to have collided with the steep terrain within seconds of passing out of sight. There was no noise, smoke or small particles trailing behind during the entire sighting. My cabin location: N38 45.376,W106 28.599<n>

We stopped the car and the 4 of us got out of the car and watched in the darkness. We took about 20 pictures but none came out. The objects at first seemed to be attached to each other round and bright white.They began floating along like balloons in the wind. Then they started moving against the wind toward the Sierra Nevada changing their formation ,elevation and gaining speed. They formed a line and then a square then a line again. It took off behind some clouds then came back out. We watched for about 10 minutes and none of us could really come up with an explanation of what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I WAS OBSERVING THE SKY AS WALKED FROM MY YARD TOWARD MY HOME WHEN I NOTICED A COUPLE OF BLINKING REDLIGHTS SEVERAL MILES NOTH OF WHERE THE PLANES USUALLY FLY. I THOUGHT THEY WERE PLANES AT FIRST, BUT MORE AND MORE KEPT APPEARING AND NONE WERE LEAVING THE EREA. THEY WERE RED LIGHTS THAT OCCASIONALLY TURNED WHITE MOMENTERALLY. I DECIDED THEY WERE PROBALLY MILITARY HELICOPTERS, BECAUSE THEY GATHERED IN ONE ERA. BUT WHEN THEY GROUPED TOGETHER IN A SMALL HALF SQUARE AND THEN AGAIN BRANCHED OFF I REALLY BECAME PUZZLED. I WENT INSIDE AND GOT MY YOUNGEST SON AGE 10,WHEN WE RETURNED  I POINTED IN THE DIRECTION I SAW THE LIGHTS, THER WERE SEVERAL IN BTHE SKY NOW, IN THE SAME LOCATION. MY SON SAW THEM IMMEDIATELY, WE WERE BOTH AMAZED WHEN ALMOST INSTANTLY THEY FORMED A LARGE HALF CIRCLE, SCATTERED, AND THEN LATER GROUPED IN THE HALF SQUARE PATTERN AGAIN. WE CALLED MY WIFE AND OLDEST SON OUTSIDE JUST BEFORE THE LIGHTS BROKEAWAYFROM EACH OTHER. THEY REMAINED IN THE EREA FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, VERY HIGH IN THE SKY BEFORE GOING OFF IN TWO DIRECTIONS. IT WAS ABOUT45MIN AFTER DARK WHEN I HAD FIRST NOTICED THEM, THE SKY WAS CLEAR, THE OBJECTS WERE TOO HIGH TO MAKE OUT ANY SHAPE. THEY STAYED RED MOST OF THE TIME BUT OCCASIONALLY BLINKED WHITE, AND REMAINED STATIONARY MOST OF THE TIME AFTER THEY WOULD BRANCH OFF.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/06 21:00|Orchard Park|NY|Unknown|approx. 1 1/2 hours|Spotted again as before........|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52809.html|374|ndxe200610| Spotted again as before........<n> <n><n> <n><n> I too saw &#34;something: on Sunday night. I walked to my back door to look outside to see if this object was around again because I have seen this numerous times, and guess what? It was and it was in almost the same spot as it has been every time. **************************************** I was facing to the West and this object was about at a 45 degree angle. ( It is always to my Westerly direction), anyway it just hung there for a good solid 30 minutes with its colored lights flashing but on this night I noticed that to the North of my house there was also another star like object that had colored flashing lights too just like the other one. There was also lots of plane and jet activity in the area and these lights were NOT one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ******************************************* So this West light after hanging there slowing moved away toward the West North direction. As it moved away it still appeared the same. It had the same lights flashing. Either it was rotating or it was backing up. And as I have said before. This can NOT be a helicopter because it does not make any noise and it has been about a 1000 feet away from the house. Now the other light to the North of the house just dissapeared. You can hear a helicopter coming a mile away especially where I live. I live in a farm area with few houses around. So this is why I know that these lights are NOT helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ********************************************* Then on Monday around 01:00 I saw this yellow light coming at an extremly fast pace from the West and it just stopped like on a dime at the same location at the end of the field as it has been doing. This time it was tree level and it briefly hung there and did that power up thing like it did before because the light goes brighter for a moment, maybe it was taking a scan or something, and then it took off to the North so fast that you would have thought that it was being chased by something. Then it was behind the trees so I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *********************************************** Also on one of my previous sightings, I didn&#39;t mention that I also had seen a strange star constellation.........or so I thought. Now that I have thought it over,and I have tried to find that same star constellation, I think that it might have been something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *********************************************** It sort of looked like a paddle of very large bright stars then it had a huge mass of other stars around it and there were small shooting stars that kept going through this mass of stars. It was HUGE. Maybe it was just that, a constellation but I just thought that I would mention it in case someone else has seen some strange star thing too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ****************************************** Well that is about it for now. The reason I am putting * between the pps. is because double enter doesn&#39;t work to separate them like it did before. It is massing the lines together so I thought that this would make it a little better to read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ******************************************* Later blu :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

P.D.T.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object: Possibly a Meteor coming down to Earth, teardrop shaped (round with short pointed tail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coloration: very bright yellow (with duller yellow blotches).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size: nearly the size of the Moon (which was in the Southern sky), possibly 3/4 to the size of a full Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Azimuth: Using North as zero (0°), to South (180°), and therefore East (90°), the object was at first spotted at nearly 100° and by the time it disappeared over the horizon, it was perhaps 95° azimuth (Left to Right, it was just slightly more to our Right from straight ahead).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Angle of Elevation: closer to 35° than 30 when first spotted, and dropping to about 25° or 20° behind the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration: It was a couple of seconds before I discounted it as not being a reflected glare, and then close to 12 seconds of active watching (while driving, as there was no place to pull over and it was easy to watch while driving as it was so low now and just right of straight ahead). The distance was impossible to tell, but it had the illusion of dropping out toward North Bend or Lake Sammamish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After: As it disappeared from sight, I called a friend who lives on the West shore of Lake Sammamish to see if they were ok, and to see if they had seen it.  They had there back to the east deck window and had seen it get very bright and then turned to see it glowing over the East horizon.  As they went outside, they heard neighbors talking on their docks asking each other, &#34;What the heck was that?&#34;  Reporting: I called information for ideas of who to report this to ... I left a message at a Meteor organization in Kent, and then called and left a message at the University of Washington Astronomy Department in Seattle, and then called and spoke with Jennifer at KIRO Radio (710AM) in Seattle, who suggested I also report the event to the folks here at UFOCenter.com (and thank you for your kind call!) even if it was a meteor or such, as it had not yet been identified as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> POV: My point of view was driving Easterly on the Evergreen Bridge (Hwy 520) from Seattle, Washington toward Lake Sammamish just East of the center of the bridge when I noticed one very large yellow circular shape appearing to drop from the sky slightly to the East-Southeast side of the bridge, but still almost as high as the moon which was in the Southern sky.  I moved my head around a bit to be sure it was not simply a glare on the windshield, but it kept its path in spite of my dramatic movements. My passenger was also astonished at what we were seeing; as it was so large and not shooting &#34;across&#34; the sky as stars sometimes do (my passenger is an adult female, about my age).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal Info:  My name is Tim Oldfield, I&#39;m 51 years of age ... back in college to work toward my Masters Degree ... just got my eyes checked at the optometrist 3 weeks ago and they are fine and unchanged (and I have fresh contacts on).   My email is TimO@WayneResearch.com and my mobile phone number is 505 650 0223 (New Mexico number, but I live back in the Seattle area). Too bad cellular phone cameras give such poor results and are so slow to access ... too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the West (compass used) at about a 45 degree angle of vision, a bright blue circular object suddenly came into view with an explosion that light up the entire sky with whitish blue light. It flew at no more than a 10 - 15 degree angle relative to a VERTICAL line (down from left to right). It was almost flying straight down. It was only in view for about one full second before dissapearing again with no sound at all. The explosion of light only lasted a fraction of a second, but the movement and visual of the object itself carried on for a full second as it shot across the sky. Behind the object was a bright bue and white tail that spanned across its entire path of flight and was as thick as the object was wide. I would describe the size of the object as being that of a full moon or even a little bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The fireball was traveling from west to east. There was a large trail and what looked like debris tumbling from it as it fell.  It was a clear night with a half moon visible.  I had just watched 2 satellites pass overhead within the previous 10 minutes.  There was a small private airplane in the immediate area as the object passed through. Total time of the observation was approx 2 seconds.  The object made no noise. I have seen fireballs in the past but never one that left a trail like this one.  The trail was so unique that my first thought when I saw the object was that an airplane was on fire and that pieces were falling from it.

We saw a white light shining in between our home and the home in back of us.  The immediate impression was of a solid light and then movement to the right.  The light swept (you could see the movement) to the west-northwest across our backyard at very rapid speed.  It moved quickly, but not as if it were a flashlight.  There was no sound at all.  We both reacted immediately with &#34;Did you see that light?&#34;  I then got up went outside but could see nothing.  There were no helicopters or other aircraft in the area.  There were no neighbors outside in the adjoining backyards.  The waxing moon was out, with a few small fast moving cumulus clouds in the area.  It is doubtful that it was a reflection from a car or anything similar because under equal circumstances (time of day, amount of sunlight etc.) we have never seen anything like this.  We are both sure that the source of the light was above the trees but it was impossible to say how high.  The time is accurate because I looked at my watch immdediately when I got up to go outside.  The light was definitely unusual in nature.  We would be very interested in knowing if there were other reports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared pretty far away.  I would guess from where I was they must have been between 5 to 10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I studied them carefully and determined that they were not any type of man made aircraft I am aware of.  I work for the airlines and I am familiar with aircraft of many kinds in various types of weather and lighting conditions and have never seen anything like this before.  They literally looked like balls of fire floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this sighting the fireballs would fly in formation left and right at low speed, then separate and fly apart from one another then all come together and form one ball of fire.

The lights were Red or Orange, Blue, White, Yellow, and Green. The manner in which they flashed resembeled the rotator lights on most fire engines, not really a flash, but almost as if the light was spinning. The lights would also change position. They were lower to the ground then a plane would be. Low enough to be able to make out the outline of the object. As it was moving it started to decline slowly and went behind a tree. I waited for it to re-appear on the other side for about 2 minutes and it never re-appeared. When I turned around there were 7-8 other identical objects in other nearby areas of the sky. One of them also went behind a tree for about 2 seconds and did not come out the other side, instead it came out the same side it came in. Others, changed speed, although not drastically. I also did not notice any noise, it was almost completely silent. Relatives in Harford County also reported seeing a strange object in the sky about 30-40 minutes after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two additional helicopters showed up and they were shining their lights on the ground, while the first helicopter cirlced above, this went on for about 4 hours.  Then I saw a disk come through the trees.  It went up and down about 40 ft from where I was standing and it was hovering and kind of slanted.  Then the disk went back into the woods.  A fourth helicopter showed up (a military type) and landed.  It was there about two hours and then it took off and the disc was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When then watched it go up and down and kind of in a loop as lights on it flashed red, white and green.  We watched this for about 10 minutes when my finace looked to the west to let his eyes adjust and saw that there was one in approximately in the same position but in the western sky.  We each watched an object for about 10 more minutes then I called his brother who was with a friend so they could come see it.  In the meantime, the objects continued their patterns of zig zagging and going up and down.  Soon, too other friends showed up from doing farm work and saw them.  At this point we had been watching for about a half an hour.  Then my fiance&#39;s brother and friend showed up and saw what was happening as well.  We all watched for close to another 20 minutes, at which point the western object seemed to be getting farther away to the west and the eastern object was lessening it&#39;s movements.  We are all &#34;farm people.&#34;  None of us were drunk or doing drugs of any kind.  As of 20:06 they were still visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However you could never find the jet when you looked up. This continued all day. Then later, I was walking my dog on our 44 acres before dinner and then heard the Jet sound following a thunder sound. So, I looked up awaiting the jet or jets to fly by. Then all of the sudden, I saw what looked to be a 8-10&#34; black bird chasing another just like it. However they were flying very fast like just under the sound barrier! The first one looked as though it was being pursued by the second. They moved around each other in a dog fight,like dog fighting jet planes! Then I noticed the second one had what looked like a &#34;blue like&#34; triangle over it, and when it seemed to accelerate up to catch the first one, seemed to let outr a little puff of steam or smoke! Then as they streaked out of sight making a LOUD JET NOISE OF A FIGHTER JET, I looked to see a triangle flock of these &#34;JET BIRDS&#34;! They flew in a triangle formation after the first 2 and went off up lone mountain towards the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is real and scary! It frightened my dog and wife so much!  I had to report this! PS- They seemed to look like &#34;dead birds&#34; shot out of a gun or? i.e. the birds never moved their wings!  PSS- We were affraid to report this! We feel the government or UFO (ET&#39;s) may not want us to have seen this!<n>

I am skeptical in me contacting you in reference to several sightings of UFOs in our area.  I consider myself a rational man, and I try not to assume anything.  I have taken photographs of the objects in our area, and I have shown them to my professor at the college that I attend.  I know that I am not crazy because my wife and I saw glowing green lights in the sky at night and 5 objects in the sky during sunset.  We also saw a silver / white colored object, with no wings flying overhead while we were driving down State Road FF near our home. Three of our sons saw 5 of the objects in the sky during sunset at the same time my wife and I saw them.  There were also several military aircraft in the area as well.  The time frame was between October 1, 2006 and November 10, 2006, but I feel that we will be seeing more of them. Time was between 1505 hour! s and 1630 hours, duration 20 minutes to an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I contacted the witness but he had little to add.  He had photos but we were never able to meet due to his schedule.

I was going for a walk around my neighborhood today, and as I was revelling at the beautiful clear blue sky, I noticed an object appear in the distance.  I gazed at the object in the direction of north at roughly a 60 degree angle.  The object appeared to be a white circular mass, perhaps a white ball of light, and it was hovering in the clear sky.  It moved very slowly for about 2 minutes, and then it vanished for about ten seconds, then appeared again.  Over the course of the next two minutes, the object vanished and reappeared 2 more times before vanishing for good.  After approximately 4 minutes of hovering, the object was out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approx 12:30pm, (I remember looking at my watch as soon as I saw this object) and I was walking up my driveway.  As I got to the end of the drive I happened to look up and stopped dead in my tracks.  There was a matte black glider type “craft”, above the houses across the street from me.  No lights, no sound, and it was shaped as if folded (like a square paper airplane almost).  There was a dark oval dome near the front, on top, but it was black and stood out because it was a bit shinier, like glass.   I was surprised at how low it seemed,  like only 20-25 feet above the houses, although it could have been more, but it was definitely low.  I watched it for maybe minute, possibly less, and when I looked up and down the street to see if anyone else was seeing it, and I looked up again ! it was gone.  I was surprised how heavy it looked although it was very silent and gliding lightly.  The area I live was residential and houses were 2-3 stories high, and I lived near the Hutchinson River Parkway, an odd area for someone to be gliding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was shaped like an oragami bird.  The back of the &#34;plane&#34; had a tale that bent down and the wings bent down and out as well.  The front was like a normal plane but more curved than pointed.  It was silver and had a yellow emblum in the bottom corner in the back of the plane.  The emblum did not have words it was more of a scribbling.  It had no windows.  It was about 100ft off the ground and it was flying at that level for a long time.  There are no close  It did not go higher.  I am not sure of the length or height of the plane but it was very close to the ground so what i saw was big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

I slowed down and thought I was looking at a police helicopter with a light they use to shine down onto the ground, but it was not shining onto the ground. Then I realized that the light was not contained in a spot light, it was more like a yellow hued flood light that shined really brightly then got smaller, but still as bright, then back to very large and bright then down to nothing. The Object is best described as an elongated helicopter or airplane but it lacked the little flashing red and blue lights that I&#39;ve seen on every aircraft. This object did however have small windows that would have been similar to a plane, but weren&#39;t lit up the whole time.  I rolled down my window to hear the engine thinking that would help me figure out what it was and there was no sound of any engine, but the object was close enough and low enough that an engine should have been heard. The object was flying very low off the ground so I doubt it was a plane. The object stayed stationary for about a minute, continued towards downtown LA, then paused again and continued without any visible lights. Then the object eventually faded into the distance and was no long visible. This sighting was not a crazy light show of any sorts or like any other sightings I&#39;ve read about in the past half hour. What I saw just out of the ordinary, but not extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to me to be about 8 inches to a foot in length, moving in a smooth arch and just glowing orange.  I wasn&#39;t going to say anything but my friend yelled &#34;did you see that? WTF?&#34;.  Then I knew it was there.  According to him it had steam coming off it (it was cold last night) so we knew it was giving off heat.  He also said he could actually make out the shape.  I only had a couple second glimpse and it looked like an oval to me.  First thought in my head is what bird glows in the dark?  It was just really really odd.  This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen one of these but it is the first time I&#39;ve had someone with me to back up my claim.  Also of note, there was no noise.  My window was partially down and the radio was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we filled our catch, we walked out of the woods and set along the road and waited for a ride that had dropped us off earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was now getting close to midnight, when all of a sudden, the wind picked up to about twenty miles an hour or so.  When this happened, we all looked up through the mature hardwood trees.  When all of a sudden, four sets of spot lights came into our field of view. Two side by side, with the other two directly below the others.  They moved very slowly, just barely above the tree tops, maybe a mile or two an hour tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise except the wind which put us all on edge, because the chance of it being a helicopter were out, due to the lack of engine or blade noise. Then it got worse, in a triangle formation the size of a 747 airplane, were two huge glowing orange balls trailing behind the spot lights giving the object shape and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing balls were at least thirty feet across or so. We sat there in a dumfounded stare, until it past out of sight, then the wind calmed down snapping us back to reality to discuss what just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later are ride came and we all excitedly told him what happened as we made the four mile drive back to town. On the last mile stretch running parallel with us was a helicopter, obvious by the blade sounds, but at first sight sent a chill through us. The helicopter kept pace with us into town and then fizzled off some where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told a few people about what we saw and of course we got the &#34;You&#39;re Crazy&#34; look a lot. Then about two weeks later my cousin was sitting on his balcony late at night having a drink, when he saw exactly what we had described, going across the woods line outside of town. We never saw this thing again, but there&#39;s lots of swamp land and woods that give good cover. Which leaves only a couple of questions, what the heck was it and why was it in the middle of B.F.E. Michigan<n>
