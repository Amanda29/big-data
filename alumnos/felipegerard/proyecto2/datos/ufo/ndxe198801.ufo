1/26/88 23:00|Sydney (NSW, Australia)||Cigar|3 minutes|UFO Encounter Close 26th January 1988  Pre Olympic Site Sydney 2000 .|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36428.html|1|ndxe198801| UFO Encounter Close 26th January 1988  Pre Olympic Site Sydney 2000 .<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 26th jan 1988 around 11pm or a bit later my friend and i were driving along the highway next to the now Sydney 2000 Olympic site. We were alone and one car was about 1 kilometer in front. A bright light approached us and veered to the right. It was a huge craft 400-500 meters away and 200 ft off the ground estimate size 200 ft long. It was cigar shaped and pulsated from the centre outwards every 3-4 seconds a golden yellowish glow. We slowed down I was driving and observed it for several minutes before it vanished over a disused factory quarry sites..I reported this to 2 researchers in 1993 after a series of dreams of people in robes telling me they would appear at the time of a great games in Sydney. When this was reported in 1993 as yet we were not awarded the Olympic games the site was not even chosen. In 1995 onreported to this day I have been emitting from the pores of my facial skin shiny metalic particles that shine like the sunwhen hit by light.It is not glitter as they are much smaller and different to anything I have ever seen. I have never worked in a metal industry . I am a nursing carer and musician. In 1995 I suggetsed to my brother to release the story in a dial up 1900 tele site. Evidence of this is in the papers of Sydney Telegraph Mirror. Late on that year we were awarded the Olympic games and the site where my friend and i witnessed this gigantic craft was commenced to be built. I have just recently this month decided to keep all the shiny metalic things coming out of my face .I have 2 samples which I need to have examined for my peace of mind as I have no explanation for what is happening to me. My family ,wife and friends have also commented on these things coming out of my face. This occurs almost everymonth and i do feel weak and ill for the past 10 years nearly. I need answers desperately. The 2 samples I have this month are on clear tape the stuck to white paper. I do not wish to be treated like a test pig but am now at the stage wjere I need help in this! phenome nah. At the time of the 2000 Olympics the East Coast Of Australia was inundated with reports of UFO&#39;s...I am totally sane . I need to have someone examine these samples under an Electron Microscope or something.. I am a Christian and telling the truth in Jesus Holy name ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to attempt to document the part about the metallic fragments, and try to put him in touch with someone who can assess what they may be.  PD))<n>

It was very hard to distinguish the border around the object, even though it was very low, and large. There were lights on each corner, or what looked to be the corners. and it was a bigger light like the color of the moon, and there was another light within the light that moved in a circle inside the big light. The friend with the paper route was the only one that didn&#39;t see it. becasue he was doing his route, but the other five of us saw it, and were very traumatized... and immediately ran back to the house.<n>

There on the horizon (high enough that it wasn&#39;t anything land based) was a large (larger and lower than the stars) whitish-amber light, &#34;sitting&#34; perfectly still.  I had lived at this location all my life then, and had never seen anything like this light before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about a minute or more, the light was perfectly still, and then it started moving slowly eastward.  Over the course of probably two minutes it moved from the southwestern sky to the southeastern quadrant of the sky.  Then it stopped and remained stationary for perhaps two or three more minutes, whereupon it simply went out, as if someone had flipped a switch and turned it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the period of perhaps the next three years, I saw something similar to this sighting perhaps three more times.  Once my mother (now deceased) witnessed it with me, and another time my brother did.  Neither of them had any idea of what it was, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked like a large bird soaring over refractory palnt with lights on it. As it got closer it was a large, black triangle.Against the sky it was black, darker than the sky and looked see through as though it were glass. It had stars in it but not quite the same as the sky. Made no noise headed straight north over a corn feild. Moved very slow. It looked over 200 feet wide. as it went noth it seemed to look more solid and not see through again. Saw no flashing lights or any other markings just looked dark at a distance and see through from below.  Back then I thought it was a Stealth Bomber but since then I have seen a Stealth bomber, they are not squared off like what I saw and are very noisey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Something about the light did not seem righ|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23976.html|6|ndxe198801| On this evening I saw what I thought was a halogen search light from a hovering helicopter. Something about the light did not seem right so I pulled over to the side of the road. I was headed north towards Springfield, MO and was very close to the MO border. The sun was setting and the craft was in shadow at the northern edge of a field below me. The beam of light turned into the visible exhaust of an engine. As the craft ascended vertically the rocket-shaped object turned north-northeast so that I could see that the engine emitting exhaust was a central engine surrounded by five or six other engines that were firing intermittently. The craft seemed to be a mat black in that as it got to tree top level (and was flying horizontally by this time) the sun did not reflect on it at all--even though the sun was SW of me and the rocket was north. It had been standing upright at the edge of the field and as it rose it turned on it&#39;s side and also rotated slowly. I could see, as it turned, that it had no FAA regulation lights or markings of any kind. The only lights on it were small white non-strobe placed at various points so I could determine the shape of the whole object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over the trees and disappeared beyond them traveling very slowly--between 20 and 40 mph it seemed--moving in a NE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the time--it was between 5 and 6 pm. I did not &#34;lose&#34; any time. There was no traffic on this stretch of the road even though there was before and after the sighting. There were houses up on a ridge to the right of me and I saw no one observing from any of the houses. I checked my engine--it was on--but everything was quiet enough to realize the craft had made no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove on to Springfield, hoping to stop in time for the 10 o&#39;clock news, there was one &#34;report&#34; on the radio when I heard a woman call in to a sports talk show on AM and ask for advice to reporting the sighting of the craft. She was agitated and confused and the host and guest on the show (talking about the Houston Atsrodome) did not know what to say. After some silence, the host reminded her that she had called in to a sports talk show and asked if she had a question about the dome. When she said &#39;no&#39; he put her off the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived in my motel room at 10 pm and watched the news [I don&#39;t recall the station Id. any longer] and the very last piece was a video a farmer had sent in that evening that showed the craft flying over his field. While the anchors laughed and joked about the video, they relayed that the farmer has said that he was doing some night plowing and he jumped off his tractor when it seemed the craft was so low it might fly into the tractor. The video showed the same object I saw still flying slowly and horizantally in an east-north east direction. The anchors reported that the object had been seen along the Arkansas and Missouri border that evening [and a few other states that I no longer recall]. However, when the station checked with the nearest military base they were told that radar had detected nothing and that what people were probably seeing was lights from the burning debris of a Soviet satellite that was re-entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite obvious from my observation and the video that what we saw was not any kind of satellite and that no satellite [that looked like a rocket?] would have been able to fly above treetop level, below radar, maintain a constant speed and not crash anywhere. The debris from the actual satellite burned up upon entering the atmoshpere, was miles up in the night sky and looked momentarily like a falling star--as reported by other news sources.<n>
1/12/88 03:30|Cambridge|MA|Oval|15 seconds|8 gliding craft in formation with a 9th "quantum jump" scout craft|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66040.html|7|ndxe198801| 8 gliding craft in formation with a 9th &#34;quantum jump&#34; scout craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is documented for the public. The full description is posted here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.whatiwanttoknow.org/wordpress/2008/10/01/my-ufo-story/<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am contributing this because I would like to know if anyone in that area observed similar phenomena or craft. The fact that people can determine my identity is of no concern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that 8 of 9 of observed craft were &#34;ordinary UFOs&#34; but the 9th one was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ==  Contact with an investigator: that is up to you. I&#39;ll be glad to talk to someone, primarily as I said my reason for posting this information is to find if anyone in that area in that general time frame (or later, I suppose) had seen similar things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is easiest to reach me by email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COPY OF TEXT FOUND ON WEBSITE INDICATED ABOVE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO story<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I myself saw UFOs, I had no strong opinion whether they existed - I assumed they could exist, but then we’re used to hard and incontrovertible evidence, and the lack of that - as experience available to other people, people who hadn’t already seen such evidence - makes it “hard to swallow” in many cases. So, if some group of people in some metropolitan area reported the same phenomenon and the “reason for the illusion” was not convincing, those people have seen UFOs, but that’s about as far as it goes. There’s nothing to do with the information but spread it to people willing to believe it. You wish you, the original observer, could replay the event for an audience and then they would agree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember any specific events I’ve seen on TV, but I remember the number of them and their variation. It struck me that what seemed likely was that we do have ET visitors, and not just a few. What rules they follow to stay so relatively unobserved, I have no idea. Perhaps they have a Visitor’s Association, some compact as to how to deal with Terra of Sol. Ground rules. I’m sorry, I’m teasing. But maybe they do have a Prime Directive of non-interference. Perhaps our over-steroided secret military is playing gags on us and having fun inventing variations on the “craft” theme for chuckles. In what I observed, I don’t think the human race, in any secret laboratory, has yet produced any technology that could make an object move as I observed a particular UFO move. I only saw actual UFOs once (a total of nine craft), but may have had an earlier sighting at Crane Beach, which I’ll describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell you flatly that what I saw was no illusion and no trick of nature. It was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at roughly 3:30 AM, 12 January 1988*. I lived at the end of Dudley Street at the time, near the Arlington border and an eight-block hike from the end of the Red Line. It was the dead of night in Winter, absolutely, perfectly still and silent, with a thick covering of snow over everything. The sky was clear and dark as it could be being near Boston, the streetlights did little to interfere. The stars were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unemployed at the time so being up at 3:30 AM was usual. Even by January 12th I had not shut the storm windows and didn’t want the extra cold draft anymore, so I opened the inner window - I have to guess and am probably wrong but I think the window faced away from Boston, so a map should show the direction of my view. I couldn’t get the storm window to close from the inside, so I leaned out of the (third floor) window so that I could rotate to face the window to start closing it from the outside. I managed to face the window, but not at the angle I wanted to so I tried to “unrotate” and try again, and in that moment something caught my attention, and I turned my head to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw “phosphorescent orange” things for a moment but had some impression of sparks to one side of my view, so I quickly looked for them to my left (remember I am looking upward at about a 45-degree angle - looking left was looking up at about 60-degrees.) By the time my gaze had shifted, the sky there was black, so I looked back for the orange impression and now I saw eight craft. It took me about 150 milliseconds to quit worrying that I was seeing UFOs and just look at them, because of course I had never seen them before and I wanted to see everything I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The eight craft were in a perfect formation, a sort of octagonal oval. Imagine a square, the four points of the square are four craft, and then at equal distances fore and aft the lead and tail pairs of craft are inset somewhat, making an “oval”. They were, I’m guessing, roughly 150 feet off the ground and at first sight about one or two city blocks away. They were gliding absolutely smoothly and noiselessly - no sound reached me. I would estimate their air speed as about 20 mph - not fast. At first sight I was able to see them in some relief (their sides as well as their bottoms.) I’m sorry to disappoint you, but they in fact looked like a classical Hollywood flying saucer**, more or less. I recall a dome shape atop; I don’t recall whether there were or weren’t seams between the dome portion and the rest. Dome-to-side came down curving, and it seemed there was the classical “skirt” flange along the bottom edge of the craft, that “foil” at the bottom edge familiar from movies. The craft themselves (their undersides) were of a similar oval shape (the phrase “horseshoe crab” wishes I would use it.) They appeared to have flat bottoms with a particular lighting; the spectacular thing about these craft was their color and light; they ‘glowed’ softly, as if luminescent/phosphorescent, a particular color which I describe as “salmon orange”. The light came from every part of the craft, but there was no apparent “reason” they should seem bathed in the light that I could see. The bottom sides of the craft had a thick annulus of a darker orange color meeting the outer edge, and spaced at intervals within the annulus all around were dark squares. For some reason I assumed those had to do with levitation and propulsion. In the center of the bottom, enclosed by the annulus, the color was again as bright as on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the time it took to observe these details, the craft had closed the distance to my house by half and I could only observe the undersides of the craft. Then something again caught my attention “out of the corner of my eye” to my left, and I turned quickly to see what it was. This time it took a moment to see what was happening, and my jaw dropped. An object - smaller than the other craft, more spherically symmetrical, almost cubic but impossible to tell, lit more strongly than the others with the same color light, was making short excursions in free space that appeared to violate the laws of conservation of momentum. It zipped. I could follow its movements but it was exceedingly fast. It appeared to be even closer to me at one point, perhaps 80 feet above, but it zipped off - always in straight lines - at crazy and acute angles from its previous direction - instantaneously. And it did this at a rate of two to three times per second. I’ll estimate that the straight-line paths were 50 to 100 feet in length. This thing moved as if it were a bullet ricocheting inside a steel-walled chamber, but it was doing this in free space, in three dimensions. I had the chance to observe about 7-10 such cycles before it passed out of view over my house, and still astonished I wheeled back to catch the others but they passed overhead and out of view in a few more seconds. I wasted several seconds fussing with the window to get it closed, and then I raced to the front of the house to the veranda but there was no sign of them on what I thought might be their path. Chickenshit that I was (how many people get to see UFOs?), and living on the third floor with no shoes or socks on in the dead of Winter, I regret that I did not just run downstairs and outdoors, snow be damned and look for them. I think I rationalized at the time that I had seen them in any case, so not seeing more of them was not going to erase that I had now seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the “sparks” I first thought I saw was this ninth craft, that when I tried to see the “sparks” the craft had simply been blocked from view by the house. I remember the sense of confusion in my visual cortex as to what to look at, and I think this craft was what actually drew my attention to begin with, even though it initially passed out of view almost immediately. I got the impression that this ninth craft was some sort of scout for the other craft, a lookout. I wondered that they came at all, coming when they did means everyone’s asleep - and not a soul was stirring that night (in that neighborhood) but me. I wondered if they detected my presence or observation - if it mattered to them, whether they had taken notice and made any changes to escape observation. It seemed to me they deviated their course because they did not emerge on the other side of the house where I thought they should (see Figure 1.) They would have to have changed course 15 or more degrees, based on where I didn’t see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh well, that one time. Except for Crane Beach. A few weeks before this sighting, in my Noir mood being depressed and unemployed, I went to Crane Beach - I’d gone once before. I always took binoculars, I had a spectacular 7×50 that I could see the moons of Jupiter with (try that! It’ll rock your world.) Again it was the dead, dead of night (probably in the same time frame, between 0315 and 0400), nobody around, nice and spooky, at the water’s edge, the Atlantic. I was there for a while looking at stars. The sky was very clear. Finally I got a little restless to get going, watched a few jets, and then saw another “jet” - but this one was interesting. It was brighter than the other planes but it was colored, whereas the other jets all used white lights, this one was - slightly reddish orange. The same color as the later UFOs. I thought that was curious and I followed it, and then another thing struck me: this thing appeared to be miles and miles out to sea, yet it was traveling really fast across the horizon proceeding South, which meant that its objective speed had to be even faster. It was much faster than the lazy jets nearing Boston. There is a spit of land (Rockport) ’south’ of Crane Beach (Figure 2.) Against the 2D backdrop of the coastline with the spit in the “upper right” (Figure 3), the object seemed to near the spit and then made a change of path - which astonished me because it was almost exactly orthogonal to its original path. It didn’t bat an eyelash or change its speed in any way but it executed a 90-degree turn instantaneously (like the cars hitting corners in “Tron”) and proceeded in a direction that now took it away from the spit and out to sea. I remember thinking about it at the time, if I had really seen that object do what it had seemed to do. I gave up, and chalked it to memory. That memory was awakened shortly after the direct UFO sighting; if these UFOs could do it, so could that thing, whatever it was. Whatever it was at Crane Beach was much larger than what I saw in Cambridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * I made certain to memorize the date. The time may be off a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ** There are “two kinds” of hollywood flying saucer. One has a hemispherical dome atop in the center of a wide circular disk, whose surface is mostly parallel to the ground - a plate. This is probably the more “modern” idea once designers got into it. The other kind has more superstructure or “cabin” above, whose sides are more upright. My kind was the second kind. I am reminded of the CSS Virginia (aka the Merrimack), with the beveled sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Figure 1: location of direct sighting. I walked home from Alewife station. The red line shows their path, however once they crossed the black dot representing my house, I lost sight of them. You can see why I thought I should be able to see them from the front side of the house. The number “one” or what looks like an exclamation point on the red line is where the craft were when I first saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Figure 2. Crane Beach, the location of the first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Figure 3. My attempt to depict the view from Crane Beach as seen by an observer on the shore. Bad job, but you see the “spit” at the “upper right”. The orange line shows the path of the craft, including the 90-degree turn, but I’m too poor with The Gimp to give a correct impression how far out to sea the “orange path” is or how much distance on the horizon the craft covered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END TEXT))<n>
1/10/88 22:10|Williamsfield|IL|Unknown|27 minutes|A dull yellow light, low off the ground and no noise in January 1988|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82609.html|8|ndxe198801| A dull yellow light, low off the ground and no noise in January 1988<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 10, 1988, my (then) boyfriend and I were in the backyard of his family’s rental property.  There were nothing but cornfields around the house and the county road next to the house had streetlights leading into town.  He had gone into the barn to put a piece of equipment up after fixing the well pump.  It was 10 degrees and a windless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving the barn, he got back into the car, nodded his head forward, as if pointing and said, &#34;We get a lot of those out here.&#34;   I said, &#34;A lot of what?&#34;   He again nodded his head forward.  That’s when I looked out into the cornfield.   What I saw (or more pointedly ...didn’t see) will stay with me for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally saw the object to which he was referring.   My first thought was: &#34;Oh, so what?  It’s a tall tractor in the field.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized it was January.  I got out of the car and walked to the edge of the field with the hood of my coat over my head because it was such a cold, crisp night.  The county road lights shone bright white next to the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I was seeing  was a dull yellow light, as if a car battery was run down.  It was about 30 feet off of the ground and moving at approximately 10 miles an hour.  The shape of the light was almost &#34;eyeball&#34; shape, but a little more rounded on the left and right side.  It was moving directly toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind went into hyper-drive trying to figure out what this was.  Everything familiar was not matching,  tractor, airplane, etc. and then I realized something and took my coat hood off of my head.  The object I was watching made NO NOISE.  I was probably 25 yards away from this light when I took my hood down.  NO NOISE!  It got closer and came to the corner of the field and turned to its right to follow the edge of the field in front of me.  I believe I was only 10 yards away from it at that point.  I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the light on the front of the UFO until it got directly in front of me and it seemed the whole thing vanished.  I realized one thing at that point.  I NEVER SAW A SHAPE BEHIND THE LIGHT.  It was 30 feet away, and I didn’t see a shape!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting a few minutes to see if anything else would happen, I got back in the car.  I asked my boyfriend what it was and he replied, &#34;I don’t know.&#34;  We then left the property and broke up 6 months later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I saw my former boyfriend was 9 years later.  We were at a restaurant with a mutual friend and my Dad.  I asked him (in front of one of one of our friends and my Dad, who was a State Trooper) to describe what we saw that night.  We both remembered the whole experience in detail and told my Dad and his friend.   My Dad then told me the stories of UFO sightings he had witnessed as a Navy pilot and State Trooper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my own experience, I have come to believe that there is another intelligent life form out there.  They could have hurt me that night and didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has proof that the US military had this kind of technology in 1988, I would be happy to read it.  Otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

As we passed a pond locally known as &#34;Stinky Pond&#34; due to stagnant water in mid-summer we pulled over ((deleted)) when one of us (I don&#39;t remember who) notiticed an enormous craft immediatly above us in the sky.  It was approximately 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and moving west at a very slow speed (2-3mph?).  In any case, I stood outside of the care, and Adam was still in it behind the drivers wheel as the craft moved directly over us.  The UFO was apprximately 200 to 300 feet across (absolutely enormous), and made virtualy no sound as it basically just sat above us (it was big enough that I could barely notice it moving when it was diriectly overhead).  As I remember, it had a number of white lights toward the out parimeter, and one or more colored lights (I was too in awe to remeber exact details but I think it was one redish light in the center).  In either case I suddenly realized I was looking at something extrordinary, and had a definite feeling that whoever or whatever was above me was looking at me as I was looking at the ship (perhaps a conditioned feeling from various UFO stuff I had seen in the past). I had  a definite impulse to get out of there.  ((name deleted)) was of the same mind , and regretably we left as a result of some instinctual fear.  The rest of the way home we spoke little except to try to figure out whether what we just saw was a bonified UFO or possible a high level military project with technology way-way beyond anything we previously would have considered possible.  We both agreed the white lights gave it a man made quality, but then we also agreed that regardless of how advanced something may be, if there was a need or desire to put any kind of lighting on a craft then why not white.  The bottom line is that me and my friend witnessed a craft approximatelly 200 to 300 feet wide from node to node (I can&#39;t give a more accurate estimate as it just completely engulfed ! the sky above me), and the thing was moving at a barely perceptable speed, and made little or no sound.  I say little or no sound because I kind of remeber a really low hum like that of an air conditioner, but it&#39;s been so long that I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, I personally would not be sharing this (as I do not care whether it was military or extraterestial as I believe the first is probably far more advanced than I would imagine, and the second is a given when considering the likelihood), but I am sharing as I plan on being hyptnotized so as I can remember it better as time has made the memory less clear, and it was just absolutely too cool to let the details become blurred.  In addition, I also want to get hyptnotized so that I can compare my description under hypnosis to those of a recent show I saw on the Discovery Channel which descibed a very similiar craft.  Before I get hyptnotized I am willing to take a lie detector test and recount the sighting in as much detail as I can remember for those who feel that it is important to prove to the world what most of us just know makes sense anyhow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would like to contact me about this please do so in the next couple of months before I get Hypnotized as hypnotism will diminish the the validity of any lie detector test.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, Bryan Addicott<n>

With it being crisp you can hear every sound. I saw a large triangle with orange lights approaching fast from the south, but it made no sound. It was much higher than the planes but not by much or it was just so big it appeared closer. I stared at it as it stopped suddenly overhead. It just stopped and was still. The orange lights were lit around the perimeter of the triangle. I was gripped with fear waiting for a beam to come down. But then it moved slowly south across my neigborhood but was still silent. I ran after it as my sight was getting hampered by trees. Then it sped off towards the south east at a high rate of speed and was out of sight. It never made a sound. As soon as it was gone I could hear another incoming plane. The sound of the plane comes much before I can actually see it. I waqs standing there staring at the sky mesmorized by what I just saw. I have not told this story to many people and never reported it, until now due that I saw the same traingle in a UFO story on tv and it sent chills up my spine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
