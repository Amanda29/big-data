Winn, Winn Me.).  3 years later, while in Tucson i witnessed another smaller green sphere<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving from Lee to Winn, I noticed on the western horizon a small red constant sphere. It glided slowly and steadily towards the north east and passed over the road ahead of me (north, about 25-30 deg. from horizon) As it passed directly in front of me it became emorpheous (rather shapless) then immediatly to the right of me it become spherical again (it crossed the roadway 4 times, from w-e, e-w, w-e, e-w in long sweeping motions). It was easy to look at, taking a rather ruddy solid color with a yellow center. but if you looked away it seemed very bright. No shadows cast. The object changed size, color and it seemed the material it was &#34;Made&#34; out of. On the last e-w pass it lost it&#39;s redness, then in an instant it increased its size 10x larger, transparent blue and then to a solid highly reflective silver ball.  which raced back to the direction it came from and climed high into the night sky. The ground and recent sunset reflected off from it clearly. (an easy nocturnal camoflage at high altitudes!!) Behind me i then notice a car which had driven off the road and i think that person must have seen it.  I did not stop, startled i drove home in 1995, while it Tucson, i witnessed a small metallic, coppery-green, sphere appear from the western mountains towards &#34;Old Tucson&#34; (about 10 am in the spring someetime) and gracfully track two airforce aircraft on a training mission of some sorts.  I watch it for about 8 sec as all the aircraft disappeared over the mountains.  This sphere was considerably smaller...about 25-35 ft.<n>

WHEN IN DAYTON I STAYED AT MY FATHER&#39;S FARM ON PREBLE COUNT LINE RD. WHEN RETURNING TO THE FARM FROM DAYTON ONE NIGHT A BRIGHT LIGHT PACED ME TO THE SOUTH OF LITTLE RICHMOND RD. THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND CLEAR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AIRPLANES AND THE FAA REQUIRED LIGHTS, AND THIS WAS ONE BRIGHT YELLOW/WHITE LIGHT, WITHOUT THE USUAL RED/GREEN WING LIGHTS, MOVING TOO SLOWLY TO BE AN AIRPLANE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPON ARRIVING AT THE FARM I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND LOOKED FOR THE LIGHT AND SAW A STIRING OF MAYBE SIX REDDISH LIGHTS COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST DIRECTLY OVER MY FATHER&#39;S FARM, AS THEY CAME CLOSER THE LIGHTS CHANGED FROM REDDISH TO WHITE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ASKED MY FATHER FOR HIS VIDEO CAMERA, BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT IT OUTSIDE IT WOULDN&#39;T OPERATE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE CRAFT MOVED SLOWLY OVER THE FARM, AND ONE OF THEM WAS SO LOW I COULD SEE A FEATURELESS TRIANGULAR STRUCTURE RIMMED WITH SEVERAL LIGHTS (MUCH LIKE THE ONE ON YOUR SITE).

A very bright beam of light shone on me from behind, and thinking it was a car coming, moved to the side. But a car didn&#39;t pass me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought nothing of it since I had passed a house not far back (opposite the cliff) and maybe the car had stopped there (didn&#39;t look back). A minute later again a light from behind, throwing my shadow directly in front of me, and again moved the side so a car could pass, the light went out and no car passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another minute or so later it happens again and I noticed my shadow moving in an odd way, turned around to see what was going on and saw a bright light, maybe twice the apparent size of a full moon in the treetops high up on the cliff.  Just as I looked at the light it went off, fading out and seeming to turn as it did so. I stood there puzzling on what was going on, knowing that there were no trails on this cliffside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on my way another few yards and the light came on again. It did seem to be a beam of light, shining directly at me, since it only illuminated the area right around me.  And just as before, when I looked up at the light, it faded out and seemed to turn as it did so.  I saw some diagonal movement of the light before and during it&#39;s fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued into Pana for a much needed beer, but unable to tell anyone for several days of the events of that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later saw two men on an afternoon talk show telling of there experience while in a small boat on a lake at night. Their description of the light, turning or swiveling as it faded out, seems almost identical to my event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also read in a book about a couple hiking an area well known to them after dark, and seeing a similar light shining at them from across a valley, moving through the treetops on a cliffside too steep for any trails.<n>

While at the microwave a very bright light (hard to describe) shined in the apt.  At first I thought it was a 4x4&#39;er with every thing he had on high beam? But I heard no truck or any noise at all, I had my back to the window but the whole apt. lite up very bright? A very strange penertating bright white light. The apt. lit eup maybe 10-15 seconds then it went off.  About 10 mins. later my mother ran in and yells &#34;come out here, you have to see this&#34;.  In the fright and excitement I didn&#39;t hear &#34;you have to see this&#34; and all I heard was &#34;come out here&#34;. I thought something had happened to dad? I ran out front and saw my dad just standing next to his car, door still open and just looking up. I watched him wondering then mom said &#34;don&#39;t you see it?&#34;  I looked around and there was a huge &#34;CIGAR&#34; shaped object just siting there above the tree line.  Not moving, in town, large cigar shaped object close enough to hit with a rock.  It disapeared, then reapeared on and off?  It was grey in color, it had port holes along the side kind of like egg shaped but you couldn&#39;t see in.  You got a very strong feeling that they were watching us.  Two other adults ran out as well over the noise that was made when mom first came in, everyone was quiet, speechless, just watching.  It tilted, it looked like sparks fell from the back (which is back?)It was visible then it would not be visible, this went on probably 10 mins. or so, just staring in awe and speechless.  Then it started to move, slowly toward the main st and toward Mazzio&#39;s Pizza across the street.  It tilted again, went invisible again, lit up and &#34;POOF&#34; it wss gone in a SE direction, so fast it just vanished when it left, or took off, no sounds or noise? Hard to believe, it was right out side just siting there and I didn&#39;t even know it.  The next day the front page of the Shawnee News Star stated...&#34;5,000 phone calls to Shawnee Police Dept. as Russian Space craft re-enters...&#34;  Right..!  That was no Russian Space Craft...period..!  How ever the rest of the news the next day was as well &#34;Cigar shape craft spoted over FL by hundereds of witness...&#34; The same reports that happened to us in Okla.  The light that came on also shined on my parents when they stoped the car and got out to check the craft out.  It shined on them as I was at the microwave and that&#39;s what I witnessed.  It changed both of them, they acted different and it had a &#34;peace affect&#34; on both of them.  They wanted to see another one, it changed them, they went looking for it and they wanted to go?  Dad said later..&#34;if that was a RUSSIAN SPACE CRAFT, I HAVE BEEN BLESSED&#34;.  With all of that, no one even thought of getting a camera.  That was not on any ones mind at the time. Now I know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Unfortunately, it was too large, being about three stories tall and 100 feet in length.   It was also 1,000 feet from the ground (not an airplane unless it was landing) and was not making any noise (unlike an airplane landing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The husband got out of the car to watch but the other two stayed put.  It got within 2,000 feet of them.  A shape could not be determined since the lights along its bottom were too bright to allow them to make something out clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Said object however clearly did have three parallel, separate, long, narrow, pink colored lights which ran the length of the object, there being about ten feet between each pink line.   They watched the UFO until it moved slowly from west to east--like a hot air balloon.  It crossed in front of them on Highway 79.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFON investigators had difficulty getting the rattled family to talk about what they saw.<n>

I looked out and i saw three very bright white lights arranged in a triangle shape.  It flew over my house silently and then 30 secs later another three lights flew over again being completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i first saw them i thought they looked like the light arrangement on a 737 that had just lifted off.  this most certainly could not be because i lived in a small residential area with no roads long enough for a huge aircraft to take off from.  Also if a 737 flew over my house i am pretty sure i would hear some kind of engine noise which i did not.<n>

There were several beings in my room.  I felt their presence and &#39;heard&#39; a male-type voice telling the other begins, &#39;She&#39;s awake.&#39;  I could NOT open my eyes.  I could NOT move my body.  It was as if an electrical shock wave was keeping me bound tightly together.  I could hear everything going on around me.  My clothing was being pulled out of my closet as I could hear the hangers scraping the clothes hanging pole; my dresser drawers were being opened and closed and my books on my shelves were being pulled out one, by one, as if &#34;they&#34; were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then felt a small &#39;head&#39; by my head as I was lying on my pillow and I kept telling myself to &#39;open your eyes!&#39;   I could not.  The presence said &#34;She will not remember this.&#34;  But I still do to this day.  I also felt something implanted in my uterus that was a triangular shape.  I have since had my uterus removed last year.  I got horrible cramps for three days after the visitation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had a visit from these same beings when I was a little girl in Texas back in 1958 or 59, if you are interested.  I know I have been chosen as a &#39;study project&#39; of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a plane.  It stopped all of a sudden and just stayed there.  All of a sudden it turned bright red and appeared to be on fire.  It started dripping like plastic would if heated.  I ran in and called 911 because I still thought it was an airplane.  The operator thought I was a crank call.  She put me on hold for about 2 minutes and got back online and asked me to tell her exactly what I was seeing.  I explained it to her and she told me that she had about 50 other calls coming in on the same thing.  My husband at the time was out video-taping it.  She asked me if she could have the fire department come over to look at the tape.  The fire chief arrived and watched the tape and shook his head and asked what we thought of ufo&#39;s.<n>

My cousin went out side to see what was wrong&#39; and I ran to the window&#39; to see what the problem was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked out the window&#39; I saw a big fireball shaped like an egg &#39;  It&#39;s color was bright red&#39; like lava&#39; from a volcano.  The object flew out into a cow pasture field&#39; which faced the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the object&#39; I noticed that it had a fin on the back of it&#39;and&#39; what looked like a tentecle sticking up out of the top of it. There was beams of white lite&#39; shooting out of the tentecle&#39; and hitting the ground&#39; as the object flew back and forth&#39; in the pasture field.  The object flew closer to the house&#39; that&#39;s when I noticed that it was some sort of strange craft. It had rows of lites underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did hear it make any sound&#39; but the tree&#39;s and grass were moving rapidly&#39; as if a helicopter was landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more to my report&#39; but to sum it up the craft hooverd about two foot from the ground.
