4/17/70 19:00|Hamburg|NY|Teardrop|5 minutes|Orange glowing orb with 2 beings in craft low flightpath 40-60 feet above me.|3/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117591.html|2|ndxe197004| orange glowing orb with 2 beings in craft low flightpath 40-60 feet above me<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 years old at the time and while I have reported this before, I feel it deserves more attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in April 1970 and I was 11 at the time.  It was a warm clear spring night, time was around 19:00. I lived in Hamburg, NY, a suburb of Buffalo, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside, shooting baskets at the hoop mounted to our garage (10ft).  Facing the basket to my right stood a cherry tree approximately 12-15 feet tall.  Our property in the back was 250 feet from the street behind us.  That street was lined with Maple trees, approximately 40-60 ft. tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shooting basketball, as I stated earlier, when I noticed an orange colored light in the distance above the tree line.  The houses on my street were pretty much out in front allowing a backyards view of anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, “That’s not a plane or a helicopter, it’s too low.”  The dot I was observing was about a ¼ inch big and about a mile away.  It was now I could see it was getting larger and still no noise was heard.  I then thought “it’s not a plane, or a helicopter, I don’t hear anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds It got to be about 3” ball of orange light and I could tell it was just above the tree line.  Now within a half mile it became obvious it was a UFO.  Within seconds the ball of light was almost above me and was approximately 30ft wide.  My jaw dropped as it came apparent as it was within 500 feet that two individuals were in the craft, they were silhouetted by the cabin orange glow of the craft.  Both were humanoid, one was sitting down and the other standing up.  The heads were bulbish as in wearing helmets and not the grey type heads as reported today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my sister to come out of the garage but as in this took place a couple seconds it was gone.  I could not view it after about 200 feet past me as a house and trees on the corner blocked me.<n>
4/15/70 21:30|East Aurora|NY|Egg|5min|low eggshaped ufo two silhouttes in craft 50 feet over me|11/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40456.html|3|ndxe197004| low eggshaped ufo two silhouttes in craft 50 feet over me<n> <n><n> <n><n> i know this event happened some 34 years ago and i had reported once before but riomur had it the scientific org. was a front for the govt., i know paranoia but then again you could be too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> well here goes,  i was 11 at the time and playing hoops in my backyard, my sister and mother were in the garage playing/doing ironing. i stopped after shooting a basket when i saw approximately 1/2 mile away a small egg shaped light aproaching , me from the nw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i thought wow thats a low airplane!. after another basket or two it had came within a 1000ft and i was alarmed to see it so low and yet no noise. i gathered it was low due to a cherry tree in our backyard being 10feet tall as the basketball hoop was 9ft. i started to get scared as i heard no noise and squinted to see it about 500 feet away and saw two silhouettes in the yellow lit background. i then froze as i watched this approx 25 feet actross craft glide over the tree about 50feet above the cherry tree and i saw one being standing as if its arms were leaning on a control board and the other being was sitting down. as it glided over and passed i gathered my senses and yelled to my sister to come quickly, but to no avail it had passed . she said she didnt see it but i was rather excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very late at night and I was traveling through Arizona...I believe it would have been highway 40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing a bright circular light in my rearview mirror..it followed me steadily for a very short while.  When I took my eyes off the mirror to look at the highway ahead...I glanced to my right and noticed the same size/intensity white light..facing me...at about the same speed I was traveling.  I could not determine the light&#39;s distance from my car...but it traveled in a very smooth/steady manner...and the light faced me for a short time (as I repeatedly looked out the passenger window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later...as I looked up in my rearview mirror...it appeared once again, behind me.  I remember being quite tired that night, as I was trying to drive non-stop from Colorado to California.  I distinctly remember thinking that something was observing me during that stretch of the highway.  I don&#39;t clearly remember how long after I saw this light that I experienced an electrical failure, but I remember driving into a small town and parking next to a gas station (it was closed for the night).  I got as comfortable as I could in the front seat...and pretty much slept sitting up in my car (as I had personal belongings surrounding me...to include items in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning, I had either my generator or alternator replaced.  (I was driving a 67-Chevelle..and don&#39;t remember if it was the alternator or generator).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
