5/31/07 23:00|St. Louis|MO||10 Minutes|Dear Mr. Davenport, 	Every now and then I like to check in on your website.....that I thank you very much for by the way. Back in May t|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57478.html|2|ndxe200705| Dear Mr. Davenport, 	Every now and then I like to check in on your website.....that I thank you very much for by the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in May there was a lot of hype about the BLUE MOON &amp; JUPITER coming from SpaceWeather.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:50 (May 31st, 2007) I went out to view the BLUE MOON &amp; JUPITER.  I was standing on my deck facing the East and slightly South when I saw what looked like a vertical column/vapor/cloud to the left of Jupiter.  There was a something that looked like a star rising up and out of it but then disappeared the higher it went.  To the right of the moon I could see a dim star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the city of St. Louis and most stars are lost in the night sky for us. This just felt a little weird but I am sure there is a probable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about twenty minutes I went back out on the deck to look at the BLUE MOON &amp; JUPITER again. When I looked up I saw a small airplane with what I will call a vapor coming out of the back.  It was really up high and very small.....in the daylight it would look like smoke coming out of the back of it like when we were kids......could this have been a crop duster and do they do that at night?  It was flying like an airplane NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW EARLIER. That STAR LIKE object seemed to be rising up and out of the vertical column of cloud.  I know the difference.  I have gone over this incident a hundred times in my mind and yes, I do realize that very often we don’t always see what we think we see but I wanted to tell you about it anyway.  I am 66 years of age but this is one of the strangest things that I have ever encountered.  By the way I did check the news on the computer the next day to see if anyone else reported it but could not not find anything.  Then I rationalized that there were certainly enough people viewing the BLUE MOON that night and surely someone other then myself would have seen it.  So now I am left with the dilemma of what was it if anything?????  Carol  From SpaceWeather.com…..<n> <n><n> <n><n> BLUE MOON &amp; JUPITER:  Tonight&#39;s Blue Moon has a companion: Jupiter.  All night long, the giant planet will be located right beside the Moon.  You can see them with the naked eye or, for a real treat, scan the pair with a backyard telescope.  Behold the moons of Jupiter, lunar mountains and craters, and maybe even the Great Red Spot: sky map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

5/31/07 21:00|Ashtabula|OH|Circle|15 Minutes|a bright light floating and then disappearing when noticed|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69185.html|5|ndxe200705| a bright light floating and then disappearing when noticed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well for starters I never wanted to believe in any of this stuff!!!  Not that I do not think there are other intelligent life forms out there, I just do not want anything messing with me! I was a skeptic and still am a skeptic, and want to forget all of this, but I cannot hold this in any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 31, 2007 I graduated from high school. My friend and I decided to go to my favorite spot in town, the point. It is a place in our harbor that kids go to at night to make out. My friend and I are both girls, and for one do not drink. We were just chatting about life down at the point as there is a really nice view of the Ashtabula river and the river leading into Lake Erie. There is also a very shitty view of the train yard and coal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As evening turned into night and we continued to be amazed at how we had just got out of 12 years of torture we sat on a brick ledge looking out on the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember around 8 or 9 p.m. I was looking at my friend and she had her back to the south of the river. I remember seeing a light out over the river and marina behind her and thought that it could possibly just be a helicopter going to the local hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later we were still sitting on the brick ledge looking directly at the river when suddenly there was a bright light passing in front of our vantage point. It was clearly following the river. It was probably a football field or less away from us and maybe 100 feet above the river. At that point I think I said what is that light, and at the very minute the light dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it could have been a helicopter or some kind of military aircraft, which I hope it is. The fact that the light went out as soon as we spotted it, makes me feel like it knew we could see it. The other strange things though that make me believe it was from out of this world are: 1.)	It was heading north out toward the lake and Canada 2.)	It was flying low to the ground 3.)	It made no sound 4.)	It had to fly under/ between sides of a coal bridge because it was so low to the ground The last fact really makes me believe it was from out of this world. If it were a plane or helicopter it would have to have maneuvered through that bridge or gone higher up in the sky to pass it and quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok I feel a lot better, but I still do not want to believe this crap, but it was amazing to see, I guess.<n>

It come back out of the cloud went in 3 or 4 tight small circles moving very very fast while doing the circles and then went up while fading in and out 2 or 3 time then disappeared. I called my cousin on the phone to tell him what I had seen and he said his girlfriend thought she seen something come out of the water in a small lake where they were fishing about an hour befoe I seen what I did.

I originally took a picture of a plane leaving a smoke trail behind it and then of a cloud (one of two clouds in the sky) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later I saw two fast moving white objects but I wasn&#39;t quick enough with the camera. I waited another 10 minutes and saw another object and took the pictures.  The object seemed realy small as it was a pretty high altitude<n>

A couple minutes later, a light came back on, then below it and towards the left a light came on also, and then all the way to the right of both objects, a light came on, but began to turn sideways and we saw mutiple lights on it in the shape of a circle. a couple seconds later the lights faded and that was the last we saw<n>

I noticed this bright orange/amberish orb to my right, the west, in a field on the ground. I watched it as I drove by it for about a minute or two. It was about 15 feet in diameter. There were no apparent doors or windows seen. No blinking lights of any kind. I didn&#39;t hear any sound, but I believe I had my window rolled up. I didn&#39;t see any movement around it as I was watching for people or something to clarify what I was seeing. There was no one else on the road; it was very dark. For the next several mornings I watched the same area, but it did not reappear. If it was an aircraft I would have known as I grew up by Camp Ripley and used to watch the military jets and helicopters fly over day and night. I am also a private pilot and an A &amp; P mechanic so I am quite familiar with the majority of  aircraft and their lighting.<n>

5/30/07 22:00|Albuquerque|NM|Disk|45 minutes|Multi colored object(s) and one object emitting white light only in the Far West Mesa area|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56883.html|15|ndxe200705| Multi colored object(s) and one object emitting white light only in the Far West Mesa area<n> <n><n> <n><n> A full moon on this particular night, it was in the SE to my location.  I live on the very western edge of the city and further off to the west is where I observed the object(s).  If I had to give a point of reference, I’d say it/they were over the Rio Puerco (so 7-10 miles west of my location?) area and heading west, but very slowly. About 9:45 I was in my side yard which faces west.  I looked up to see an object with several flashing colors of light (red, blue, yellow, green).  It wasn’t moving.  I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculaurs.  Through them I could see the colors better and a faint outline of the object (disk/circular).  It wasn’t a helicopter, no noise, either.  The sunlight was very very faint on the western horizon, and the full moon light on the opposite side of the sky almost ‘helped’ it stay undetected, if it were not for the flashing colors.  I stayed there watching it for about twenty minutes as it just stayed in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my partnere came home and I walked inside to tell him what I had seen.  He came outside with me and looked into the sky.  Now there were two of those objects, a bit farther away now, but in close proximity to each other.  It looked like one was going towards the other.  Now, I looked NW and close to the horizon and saw a white light in the sky, not moving.  It could have been a weather balloon, but they usually are seen because the sunlight is reflected off them.  About 5 minutes later, there appeared another of these multi-colored lights N/NW of the white light (the other two are due S of these, still hovering, though they appeared to have moved further west).  This was looked like it was farther/smaller but moving towards the white light.  At one point it looked like it was going to meet up with the white light, but then we saw what could have been an aircraft with identifiable red blinking light trying to &#39;catch up&#39; to it (jet fighter?) but then this multi-colored object began to retrace it’s path (no wide turning as would an airplan! e), stra ight line towards the white light object, straight line back. The (jet?) aircraft moved away from both. By this time I realized that there were no commercial airplanes coming in from the west, like we usually see.  The white light object went over the horizon and disappeared.  The 3rd multi colored object kept going N/NE until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The original two objects moved slowly west, but I couldn’t determine if they were moving up in altitude or just further away.  After about 40 minutes, we saw several planes begin to emerge from the north (not their usual flight path, especially, not directly over our part of the city).  Through the binoculaurs we could see that they were commercial aircraft.<n>

He didn&#39;t  know but he said he saw it the night before.  It appeared to be stationary and it had several sattelites positioned around it.   We lost sight of it as we drove into town, so we planned to look at it with telescope when we got home.  When we got home an hour later it was gone.  But we did notice another one  by the moon(at about 10 oclock position) and we did look at it through the scope.  What we saw was a sort of transparent looking sphere with strange circles in it and to the left of the sphere at 8 o&#39;clock was a much smaller light and to its right were three smaller lights in perfect alignment to 2 o&#39;clock.  Every night since then I can see the one by the moon and I have not seen it move at all,  however, the first one I saw appears after dark  and moves at different times and rates of speed.  Tonight it started moving away at about 9:30pm and had disappeared from view within 1 hour.  What are they?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Dogs barking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two unknown lights sighted South, Southeast in Hubert, N.C. on 30 May 07 at 2100 hours. Both objects appeared slightly smaller than the moon with a reddish orange light in the center surrounded by a white glow, and with a thin line circling the white glow. Objects were positioned horizonally to the right of the moon. Object on the left seemed about 5 moons over to the right of the moon. Objects were diagonally to each other with the object on the right about 4 moons away from the object on the left and down about 15 to 20 degrees. You could put the moon 4 times over between them. (Definition of moon about the size of a dime when looking out at sky). Light on left stayed solid for about 20 seconds, then flashed off and then back on for another 20 seconds and then went out. The light on the right did the exact same thing for the same length of time and then went out. No further sightings. No noise. We noticed that the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Conditions were clear with a full moon. Temperature was around 75 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My coworker saw it as she stood beside me.As soon as the fireball disappeared it looked like there were many many plane lights blinking on and off around the same area the &#34;fireballs had converged to&#34; We didn&#39;t think there was any possible way that many planes should be in that small an airspace.

5/30/07 19:45|Portland|OR|Sphere|30 minutes|2 very small white spheres hovered in same general area for 30 minutes|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57322.html|20|ndxe200705| 2 very small white spheres hovered in same general area for 30 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 23rd, 2007, I ran across this report on your web site:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56872.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it sounded very similar to what I saw here in SE Portland, Oregon. I&#39;ve decided to come forth about what I saw (and tried to video tape) because of this specific report. The similarities between our sightings seem very close  However, my sighting was on May 30 2007 and first seen at 19:45 to 20:15 - I observed these for around 30 minutes!  When I first saw this object, I saw only one - then later I saw two. To the naked eye it looked like a very small white sphere that did not move - sort of like a planet. But it looked very different when viewed through the binoculars. At one point while viewing it with binoculars, the center of it suddenly flashed a strange metalic gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video tape this object from inside my home while my camcorder was on the tripod - I could see this object in the East directly above the neighboring trees nearby around 7:45 pm. I started video taping around 7:49 pm. After a few tries (only caught a few bits of it on video), I ran outside to have a closer look at this with my 10X50 binoculars.  After observing it more closely for several minutes, getting a good look at what it was (see drawing ) I then decided to run back in the house and try to tape this again. I grab the camcorder and ran back outside and started to video tape again at 7:57 pm. Again, I was only able to get a few quick shots of this object on video. It was VERY hard to find this in the camera viewer lens of my JVC 25X optical camcorder - and its much to hard to find it on the LCD screen during daylight - and it was too small to pinpoint and focus on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to try off and on attempts at capturing it on video - not easy to do in clear blue skies. I had to use the trees and far distant planes with contrails to help reference about where they were above in the blue sky . The video overall is about 9 minutes (because I would pause for a bit, then try to record through out the video). These objects were observed from  around 7:45 pm to 8:15 pm. The last part of my video records a few frames of both objects at 8:15 pm just before they head up a bit higher above the one huge fir tree then they head NORTH against the 7 MPH winds that were coming FROM the WNW!. I gave up trying to record them, and ran inside to see if I could still see them.. but could not. I immediately checked the weather conditions and it confirmed to me that these were not balloons because they headed away to the NORTH against the winds that night. I also took a screen shot of the weather report at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video is not very good at all, and I cuss up a storm and at the time of recording these, I could not see them in the viewer lens, and was not sure I even caught them on the video.  After reviewing the MiniDV tape over, I did indeed catch several frames of them as I would zoom in and out where I was guessing they were in the blue sky. I used Exsate DV Capture software to be able to show the date &amp; time embedded on the MiniDV tape. I then compiled image shots from the video in the order shown on the tape and put them together as a swf and posted them online for viewing  - Select from the drop down box 800 to see this in LARGER VIEW:  http://media.putfile.com/PDX-UFOs-May-30-2007  Note regarding some of the images: I also included various shots that shows the trees - or planes in the far background. These are what I was using as a reference point -  I would then try to zoom from those areas to where I estimated they were hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought of these were balloons.  But when I went outside with my binoculars, I could see these were NOT balloons. And did not act like balloons. But even then, I thought they MIGHT be. But after trying to tape them and observing them for around 30 minutes, while they hovered above in the same general area not being affected by the wind, I realized they were probably not balloons - especially after watching them head away NORTH against the wind. Even after I looked at the weather report and the tape I really did not think it was enough to report this -- that is up until I found the report on your site and decided to come forth about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just so relieved to read that SOMEONE else in Portland, Oregon saw something similar to what I saw!<n>

It was an object in the sky.... pretty high up, higher than the planes for sure... I saw a dark spot... and it got a little bigger as if it was coming closer to the earth.. and the dark spot stopped. and then I saw a light. and it was BRIGHT, like a star, but brighter, it was pulsating a little. then it was a steady whitish bluish glow in the sky. I could see that it was a solid object. it moved over to the right slowly. then it just stood there, for about 30 seconds. then it went in a south westerly direction. then it stopped again. then i did not see it. i looked in the sky to see anything, and it re appeared to my right again. this time seeming to go away from the earth.. i still saw light, a very bright light. i was something... i was in awe...and i really dont know who to tell about something like this....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was holding my cell phone and glanced down to check the time because I&#39;ve noticed satellites pass by at the same times every night. I checked once, time was 22:26, I check again and it changed to 22:27. I look up and see a craft hover above me passing over a large tree across the street, it was flying on an angle and the craft looked like a tongue ring barbell including the balls on both ends. I watched it mentally for no more than ten seconds, but when I immediately glanced at my cell again the time had changed to 22:30. I had roughly lost three minutes in a span of ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two nights ago I checked this website and came across the report from March 30 2007 from Maryland. Roughly two months later I witnessed the same craft in Toronto. Through out the years I have seen many strange lights in the sky do spectacular things, but when I was able to connect my sighting to the previous one in Maryland it completely blew me away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I&#39;d share my experience.<n>

The CHP was investigating an apparent truck accident across the road when I saw three very bright white lights in triangle formation fly at a 180 degree angle which was flying sideways fly over the accident at about twenty miles an hour silently.  There was no noise and the craft was flying at a very low altitude perhaps twenty feet above the ground and came right at me and straighted out and flew right over the hood of my car and it picked up speed and disappeared over the reservoir.  At first I thought it may have been a life flight helicopter but this craft made no noise and my car window was open.  I had the feeling the craft was friendly and was concerned about the accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was massive, at least 150&#39; wide. As it flew right over my head i was unable to define it, as if it were &#39;cloaked&#39; in some way, and was a moving mass of &#39;darkness&#39; against the clear night sky. It was definitley a triangular shape. The engine was like nothing i have ever heard before, like the sound of giant blowers or fans. It had a flashing red beacon in the front and two very bright clear lights, one on each side., however they did not illuminate the ground at all. It flew right over my roof and then began to gain alltitude,  As i watched it fly away from me it&#39;s two bright clear lights were dog tracking back and forth across the sky.<n>

We reached the Orchidland Drive intersection and all the power went out, street lights, homes, etc. Then the lights came back on, we were still driving as we observed this and reached the turn off at Paradise Drive in Hawaiian Paradise Park when the transformer blew to our upper right and we saw sparks fall to the ground. At that same moment I looked toward the ocean, looking East and witnessed an enormous bright illuminating green flash which scared my brother and I and we continued to drive down Paradise drive toward the ocean and saw 2 more green flashes that illuminated the sky. The weather was clear with stars visible. There was no noise that accompanied the 3 green illuminating flashes. We both called 911 to first report the sparks on the power line and then to report the 3 green flashes. H.P.P Fire Department was dispatched to the top of Paradise drive to the power pole. The feelings and reactions that I got was &#34;we are under attack&#34; it appeared as though a missile had struck the ocean and then detonated. We also thought it could have been space debris or a meteorite that entered the atmosphere and flew so low as to cause electrical interference, but we are not sure. All of the power was out down Paradise Drive and the cable was out too. We still have no idea what the green flashes were that lit up with sky and why it was simultaneous with the power outage and transformer blowing up. What chemicals burn green? I&#39;m not a scientist but I figured if the 3 flashes were other transformers then why did the one at the highway spark in white and orange color? I know there were other witnesses, the brightness of the night sky was so lit up by the green illuminating flash I would be surprised if it didn&#39;t make our local news in the next few days. We also thought it could have been some sort of craft that crashed into the ocean and when it was flying over the neighborhood it&#39;s magnetic field disrupted our electricity. Friends and m! yself ha d reported earlier in the daytime the tv acting funny and popping and cracking sounds coming from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The power came back on just as we were approaching an intersection, and a transformer on a power pole blew out, sending sparks all over the road.  At the same time, my brother shouted &#34;Wow, Look!&#34;, pointing his attention to a series of extremely bright green flashes that filled the entire sky.  We couldn&#39;t see exactly where it was coming from, but it seemed like it was somewhere off the coast of the island.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft had 3 lights, one on each corner of the triangle and very dim white in color.  The craft made no sound and there was a stillness in the air.  The craft was very large approx. 500 feet across and approx. 500 feet from front to back.  It was about 600 to 800 feed in the sky.  The color was a dark gray color.  That night the sky was clear with stars very visible in the sky as the craft moved across the sky it darkened out the stars in the background.  The Orlando Int. Airport had planes coming in and going out, but this thing was too low in their flight path.  Living in Fl. you get to know those strange planes, the sounds they make, the way they move, etc.  But this thing made no sounds and was moving too slow to be any plane that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was still at least an hour or so from setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they might be satellites, but they were not moving in the fast, straight orbit pattern of satellites.  They were fairly bright (white light, like metal reflecting sun), and I realized they must be craft of some sort in the high earth atmosphere realm, either going out to space or returning.  Definitely not airplanes, they appeared to be flying above aircraft altitude and were not blinking or moving in the straight pattern as airplanes.  They were circular in shape and exactly the size of stars/planets to my relative view.  They were about 20 degrees up from the horizon in the S/SE section of sky over SE Portland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were six to seven of them covering about a 10 - 15 degree area across the sky in roughly the same plane/area across the sky just above and to the right of the moon, but they were not moving in formation nor were they evenly spaced.  The three on the left side were in a triangular/Cassiopeia-like space and formation, and the others to the right were in more horizontal formation, but not exactly a straight line.  They all moved as if they were flying, but slow, not like a plane.  It was regular/straight-ish movement, as human/craft (plane, car, ship, people) would move.  It didn&#39;t in any way seem alien or weird.  They simply looked like six human craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained in roughly the same area in the sky, although they were moving a little bit in relation to each other, like if you&#39;re watching 7 people or animals in a group walking or hanging out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first had looked up, I saw three bright ones and then the few fainter ones to the right became brighter.  A seventh moved in from faint to bright into the same realm and then back faint again.  They were visible in the sky for about 10 or 20 or more minutes, and then gradually they all became fainter and fainter and disappeared into the sky as they came, like craft flying out to space from the earth atmosphere.  My friend returned but only as they were disappearing - he saw 2 or three of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially I saw it about 1500 feet. It was constantly alternating between flat to a three dimenisional x shape. (the shape changing appeared to give it lift).  As it flew away from me it gained in altitude, never going over 2500 ft.  As it got further away, it was impossible to see when it was in the 3-d x configuration.  The object was grey/black. There was no sound to the object. I have worked in the aviation field for years, definitely not a kite, weather balloon, or any other mis. item.  This gave me an ingenious idea to create lift, I will try to reproduce.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were traveling North on FM 1081 and noticed a bright object in the North West portion of the sky (which seemed north of Lubbock). We then turned the vehicle West on FM 261 and proceeded West bound until we reached FM 651 to go home to Crosbyton (located in Crosby county). The object appeared to be stationary and did not change in intensity or color. We witnessed the object  become obscured by clouds and clouds pass behind it within our time of travel. When we returned home the object was still visible and we were able to determine that it was North-North West of the city of Lubbock. The weather condition was stormy to the south of Kent, Dickens, and Crosby counties. We concluded that this object might have been a weather balloon reflecting light from the setting sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting?  PD))<n>

I had just finished watching a movie on the second floor of my home at about 12:45pm. In that room is a 4x5 window facing south south west. The view extends clearly down the valley to the Lumberton Moyie area. I had turn the TV off, leaving the room in darkness before hauling myself off to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the window and saw a bright &#39;star&#39;. &#34;I&#39;d wish on you but you&#39;re probably just a satalite or an airplane&#34; I thought to myself, since there is an airport between Kimbeley and Cranbrook. The light was very bright and so I watched it for a moment. Before long I noticed some faint spark-like spray coming from the bottom of the light, like the way a boat cuts through water in a triange behind a boat. Slightly alarmed, I thought I might be witnessing a plane in trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light didn&#39;t behave like a plane, it just hovered, then moved in a slight circular formation. I almost felt like it was looking back at me! My heart pounding, I moved behind the window frame out of view. When I looked back I estimated the distance between the light and the top of my neighbour&#39;s house to confirm that it was really moving strangely. It had moved from the origional place I had seen it, but was still emitting the faint spark flare underneath. I watched for some time, barely blinking continuing to estimate it&#39;s distance from unmoving objects, a telephone pole, another house, to confirm again that I wasn&#39;t just moving myself, the light&#39;s movement was so small. Finally my heart calmed, and I thought &#34;I hope that you&#39;re not like us, at least not the worst of us,&#34; thinking about war etc. Then, and I know that this is the craziest part, I thought &#34;thank you. thank you for showing yourself to me.&#34; And just after that it faded or turned away, and was gone. Just then, I saw bright light down infront of my house, and that was a car arriving for the neighbours. Glad it wasn&#39;t the light coming to pick me up!<n>

As it passed, it made a &#34;whizzing&#34; sound, but really seemed to be cutting through the air.  It almost looked like a meteor, but it was traveling at an extremely slow speed, very low to the ground.  Indian Lake is not that large of a lake and the ball took about 60 seconds to cross the sky.  It was in the air so long that I had time to unpack my camera, remove the lense and snap a shot.  It did not fade out of before going beyond the horizon and my line of sight. I would say it was 400 feet off the ground and that it traveled in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was saucer – like in appearance and had lights along the edge blinking one after the other. In relation to a normal sized star the UFO was about ten times the size; the size of a dime if held furthest from your face, only looking at the side view. The UFO traveled at about the speed of an airplane, maybe a little slower and lower to the ground than an aircraft would travel. The distance was about a foot in the sky, in relation to the dime.  After I would say a minute the UFO disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (MOTHER)At approximately 9:40pm on May 26th, 2007 I was driving West on Orange drive in Vacaville California, when I saw something moving up in the sky.  It was saucer shaped/cylinder and it had rotating blinking lights.  My daughter was in the passenger side of my car and I noticed after a few seconds, she was watching the same thing as me. It was moving West, probably Northwest.  It was the size of quarter, If I was holding a quarter arm length from my face, that would be the approx size.  The quarter being sideways in position. My guess would be it was not flying as high as an airplane, but closer to where an airplane would be if getting ready to head in towards a runway to land.  I continued to drive west on Orange Drive, and my daughter was trying to use her cell phone to video tape this object.  I pulled into the parking lot of Staples and stopped the car so she could aim her cell phone, about this time the object appeared to vanished from where it was traveling, It sort of looked like it in hyper speed turned North , I remember seeing it off in the distance , but I can not be 100 percent sure that is where it went. All this happened in approximately one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I yelled to my 12 year old step son to come quickly! We watched it change into a diamond shape back to a sphere for about 20 seconds. At that time I told him to go grab the video camera!. He didn&#39;t know where it was so I quickly went and grabbed it and plugged it in the outside outlet. By the time I captured it on camera it had started to move north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught 10 seconds of it before it flew over behind my house. It was changing colors of green, blue, white and red. It darted so fast that I yanked the cord out of the outlet and tossed the video camera to see the rest. I ran around to the side of my house and continued to watch the object move north. The fireball dimmed and I was able to see four to five smaller red lights around it. I was also able to see a gray shadow around them with what looked like a blackhole in the center. Then as quickly as it came it disappeared over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was close to setting but was still light out. We live 2 miles from ILM airport, and our house seems to be right below a regular eastern seaboard flight track. This means we see aircraft daily very high up in the sky going north and south. While looking up in the sky, I noticed an oval, orange tinted object very high in the sky. It was about the same hight as the planes we see, but it was not moving. Then is slowly drifted south, about as slow as the rotation of the earth. I initially thought it was a satillite, and the orange color was the relfection of the sun. After thinking about it...it would have had to have been a really big satillite for us to see it that far away. We checked the papers to see if anyone else had seen it, but haven&#39;t found anything out about it.<n>

At between around 6:45 to 7:15 in the morning I observed a metallic cigar or cylindar shaped object moving from south to north.  It was quite high up about one third the way up from the horizen looking west.  I had binoculars in my with me as I&#39;m a bird watcher.  I was able to watch it for around 30 seconds after I originally observed it with the naked eye.  I seemed to be traveling in a straight line.  No wings observed, no sound, no flashing lights.  The morning sun reflected off of it.  It looked something like a skinny blimb but was too high for a blimp and no sound.  I think it was traveling around the speed of a jet aircraft but no con trail.  Other jet aircraft were in the general area but they produced con trails.  I have never seen any object like this before and I am not a believer in UFO&#39;s. I may have changed my mind after this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful, clear warm night.  The stars were out in full effect and I was looking up to gaze a bit when I caught glimpse of what I immediately thought to be a UFO flying north directly over my house (1 block east of Lake City Way).  It&#39;s very difficult for me to describe it&#39;s size because there was nothing for me to compare it to in the air.  I believe it was from 1000-2000 feet away from me, moving slow enough for me to watch it for 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had three circular lights underneath it with smaller lights around the 3 big ones.  The lights where a dim yellow / white hue, they weren&#39;t shining down, they were just merely on.  There was nothing at all blocking my view from it, but after 15-20 seconds it simply vanished.  It didn&#39;t vanish into the horizon, or disappear behind a cloud, nor did it do any cool star wars tricks, it just faded away in front of my eyes.   I should also note that there was no cars on the road near me, no airplanes or helicopters above me and this thing made ZERO sound whatsoever.  It should have been loud as hell the distance it was from me, so it was very confusing to my senses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood outside for another 20 minutes trying to see if it would come again, and in that course of time I saw 2 shooting stars and a satellite way above earth, so I am 100% positive it was neither of those things.  I have always semi-believed in alien life forms, but maybe it&#39;s the kind of thing you will never fully believe until you see it with your own eyes.  I know what I saw.  The moment I saw it I knew I was looking at a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed three bright lights off in the distance. We thought it was 747 but I noticed that the lights were spread out one in front and two in the back.  The lights got brighter and came closer as we thought that the plane would crash because it was flying so low. As it got near it was no plane. It looked like a HUGE black triangle one blinding light in the front and two in the back, they also seemed to change color, red to green to red. It was so huge it blocked out the moon for a few seconds. The most strange thing was it had a red blinking lights in the middle. They looked like landing lights on a plane. It made no sound and scared the hell out of us. We called the police to report it, they said they had received numerous calls about it, but had no explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I called a friend who was an air force pilot and a old high school buddy of mine. He told me that most likely I had seen the TR-B3, a spy military craft that was about 400 to 600ft long ( the largest aircraft ever created )and something about a top secret propulsion system something like a nuclear reactor. He told me that they are 3 billion dollars each and that the govt. is finally testing them all over the world. He also told me its really not top secret anymore, since its common knowledge among the military and info about it is all over the internet. After talking to him I really think that it was not a UFO but a TR-3B. The majority of sightings are either the TR-B3 or the XT-33 they both look like UFOs ......sorry people but its the truth look them up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking up in the sky at the half moon when I noticed a bright green light in the shape of a soft ball sail across the sky from south to north, at first I thought it may be an asteroid, but at a second glance, it streaked across the sky in perfect intervals of two second dashes and absolutely no sound,leaving no sign of a trail, until it went so far north that I couldn’t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

During a 20 minute duration, my eldest son and I observed three round craft that illuminated a dull greenish color hovering silently left to right up the coast.

At first glance, I saw a blinking light in non-stop motion.  I thought of it being a low-altitude plane, yet the light was too small (giving the appearance of a high-altitude one), plus at the given time, it was twilight, and I could not see the silhouette of the aircraft, which you would be able to normally.  After witnessing the flash, I thought of the object being a meteorite.  I looked back in curiosity, and I saw another quick streak of light shoot off in a different direction, near the point where the first light disappeared.  I aroused suspicion, and watched the sky longer.  The streak moved again, this time, heading westward, the opposite direction from which the first shot of light advanced.  And about a second later, another flash ensued, going in the direction making a complete box if the light were to move continuously, without an intermission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibilities I assumed to which the lights could be were:  A helicopter Fireworks Or meteorites falling coincidentally to form four 90 degree angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking your time in reading this report, NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else in the Dakota County area has witnessed this event, please post a report as well.

It was positioned above a contrail.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and could see it was definitely NOT an airplane, helicoptor, hot air balloon, parachutist or other typical aircraft.  I could see it was colored orange and white, was rectangular and was in an upright position, with the narrow sides of the rectangle being the top and bottom of the thing. I could also see it slowly rotating to my right.  After that I ran inside to get my binoculars and was frantically calling my other two sons to come outside and see this thing with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the front yard and observed it for quite some time- maybe 15 minutes, both with the naked eye and the binoculars.  The object had begun to move slowly to the west.  I told my 12 year-old son to go get his telescope.   He brought it out quickly and I fiddled with trying to get the thing to focus on the object but it had gotten so high in the sky while traveling westward it was impossible to get the telescope balanced that high although I did get it in view several times only it lose it.  However while I was busy focusing I did see what I thought were white things shooting out of it or something shooting out that disturbed the atmosphere.  I passed it off as my eyes were playing tricks on me while I was trying to focus.  I had seen 4 or 5 of the things shoot out - toward the south.  It looked like white things of various sizes followed by streaks of heatwaves or that clear mirage type of thing.  Then my 12 year-old son said:  &#34;Mom, I see things shooting out of it!&#34;   I asked him to tell me what they looked like, he said they were white things.  I asked him what direction he saw them go and he said to his right which was the south. I then knew I had indeed seen things shooting out of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave up on the telescope and used the binoculars while the object then moved south.  We watched this thing for a relatively long time, about 45 mintues total.  Then it just disappeared, vanished.  It had been in full view the whole time, there were no clouds in the sky at the time,  just the contrail that had moved northeast and was nowhere near the object.  But it simply vanished instantly before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept my eye on it and as I focused on it, it appeared almost “M” or “E” shaped, but rounded - hard to explain.  It then seemed to stop “falling” and seemed to hover in place for a bit, which made me think maybe it was some sort of balloon or some sort of toy or something.  Almost like when you’re at the beach and watching people flying kites in the distance – how they just seem to hover and rock in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it moved again, and came more towards the northeast – that’s when I noticed blinking lights.  I also noticed a plane seem to fly right over it.  (We live near several airports here.)  This is when I decided to run inside and get my video camera.  When I ran back outside, I had trouble spotting it again, but I did manage to catch something on video as it lowered out of sight behind my neighbors rooftop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to add - the little bit that the video did pick up did not look the same as what I had seen with the naked eye.  On video, it appeared sporadic and quick, as a silver object, round in shape, seemingly jumping around until it disappeared.  And it’s hard to catch on the video at all unless you go frame by frame.  I’d say the whole “sighting” lasted about 5 minutes from the time I first noticed it to the time I ran outside with my camera and captured a few seconds of it on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was right at dusk. Not quite dark yet. We was backing out of a field near a wooded area as I looked out my opened window towards the back of the truck I saw 6 lights in a row in this clouded area near us.  The lights were compared to a car head light but was a yellow-gold color.  They did not move, they were just there for maybe 5 to 6 sec then they faded away from left to right one at a time.  As we backed onto the road I would not take my eyes off of the very spot that I saw them. I saw a very dim outline of a rectangle with the same lights but very dim to the eye. I just saw that for a few sec and it just faded away.  I was relieved to hear my husband say that he saw the lights too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting on the patio of the restaurant and I happened to look up at the sky and see what initially looked like a commercial jet&#39;s landing lights turn out. As it got closer it all of the sudden got very bright and increased in size dramatically. I would guess that the object was about 15,000 feet in altitude when I first saw it, but it&#39;s hard to tell when you don&#39;t know the size of the object. Anyway, after about 5 seconds at its brightest and biggest point, it immediately shot straight into the sky at an incredible rate of speed until it was merely a pinpoint of light about the size of a very distant star. It continued to move slowly at that point until it was out of view completely. I barely had time to mention it to my friends before it was too small to see, so as far as I know there were no other witnesses near me. I did not notice any other lights on the object and am quite certain that it was not an airplane, and it certainly moved faster and in a way that I&#39;ve never seen a traditional aircraft move. All I had available to me was a camera phone and knew that it would not capture anything useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no doubt that I saw something amazing and beyond the norm. Truly remarkable.<n>
5/24/07 11:19|Henderson/Las Vegas|NV|Cigar|10 minutes|Recently retired airline pilot from Northwest Airlines. Saw the craft from my shower window and noticed it was not moving very fast. It|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56791.html|72|ndxe200705| Recently retired airline pilot from Northwest Airlines. Saw the craft from my shower window and noticed it was not moving very fast. It was drifting westerly at no more than 20 knots. It appeared to be a cylinder but I thought it changed to have swept wings similar to a DC-9 for 5 or 10 seconds. However, it never gained any speed other than the 20 knots I mentioned. It was in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25,000 feet as it would be obscured by the cirrus deck directly above it for as much as 30 seconds at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched a eastbound airliner go nearly over the top of it (separated by the cirrus deck) so I doubt that crew would see it. The east bound flight (I used to fly that airway a lot) should have been at FL 330 to 370 and moving at a normal speed and cutting a contrail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife verified what I was seeing though her eyes are not as good as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had her retrieve our digital camera, but the craft disappeared into the cirrus and never reappeared where I could photograph it. I have seen a number of craft over the years but have not previously reported them. This was definitely a UFO and no aircraft, balloon. To skeptics I would ask why it would drift against the prevailing wind if it was a balloon?<n>

Of course, aliens being one of these things.  Ever since young age, these potential entities have perplexed my mind.  There were points in my life where I was almost literally addicted to the investigation of these phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ACCOUNT:  I witnessed, for the first time, a UFO at approximately 4:00 AM on the date of May 24, 2007 in the city of Chandler, Arizona.  Not being able to sleep, I decided to do some stargazing in the front of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, which first appeared to resemble a star, moved at a steady rate.  The pulsating of light (which appeared to be spontaneous), was one of my determining factors that this was some form of advanced technology.  The UFO seemed to move at an almost constant rate of speed toward the southern hemisphere.  Then, in abrupt fashion, the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after I lost track of the UFO, a helicopter passed by overhead.  Do these two have any correlation to each other?  I’m not sure, but I think it is definitely worth mentioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the northwest, a dim steady light point was moving in an easterly direction.  I assumed it was a satellite and followed the light in hopes it was an Iridium flare, a satellite that brightens quickly when it reflects sunlight.  I have seen dozens of these Iridium flares over the past few years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling for a few seconds, the light gradually turned north and headed for the horizon.  This struck me as very strange, because the curve was too steep for typical plane and the fact that the light had no resemblance to a plane.  The light soon died out, much like satellites commonly do.  I then heard a jet sound emanating from the direction of the light, but saw no jet.  This could be a coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I saw a bright reddish flash closer to the horizon, but where the light’s trajectory should have placed it.  This flash was like a sudden brightening, similar to a meteor, but slower and more controlled.  I then saw two simultaneous flashes and for the next few minutes I saw two flickering lights travel in many directions, usually fading away and then reappearing in a new location, always in the northern sky.  The flickers were at first somewhat rhythmic with a double flicker followed by a single, but soon became more irregular.  Every so often the lights would simultaneously flash reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights next appeared in the north-northeast and traveled westward, one slightly ahead of the other, flashing irregularly the entire time.  The front light faded, but as the second light continued westward, the other appeared at the original starting location.  This time it traveled eastward, and both were traveling on the same horizontal line.  Finally, after a short time (appx. 1 min) of nothing, I saw the reddish double flash occur.  This time the flashes were very close together (less than a degree probably) and hooked from left to down to right in a tight arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been an amateur astronomer for years and have never seen anything like this.  I am also college-educated with a science and engineering background.  Several reports of near identical situations have been reported out of Lafayette in the past few days.  Perhaps this is something military related, but all I know is that I have no current explanation of what could possibly make this light display.<n>

We normally get the usual aviation traffic flying south to the airport in Austin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was opening the door to my car, I looked toward the east and I saw a set up red lights moving in a circular pattern with a red light in the center at the bottom.  The clouds were very low and the object was below the cloud deck.  I heard no sound from the object and I could see planes above the clouds to the west and the sound of their engines.  Anything that low would have been easy to hear.  My daughter saw the same thing and described it to me as I had seen it.

Today though was a little different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around an 80 degree angle over head I saw what I first though was a jetliner flying over like they do regularly here. Instead of a jetliner though I spotted an white/silver orb like object in the sky at around 30,000 feet and probably the size of a 747 (I say that size due to my having seen 747’s at that altitude in the past flying over).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering in place and not moving in any direction. It was spinning or moving in some way in place however as the refection of sunlight off of it continued to change. It remained there in that same spot not moving for a full 15 minutes. It wasn’t a star or planet (there’s nothing there today), couldn’t have been a plane because it wasn’t moving and clouds in the sky were moving relative to it. I took a shot of it with my camera phone but the resolution is no good enough to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also checked FlightAware.com when I came back in and there were no commercial aircraft showing in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just got on as my father(who was driving) Noticed something in the sky. He pulled over and jumped out, ordering us to come out and see. As I got out I noticed two other cars had already pulled over. Suddenly my little brother pointed to the sky and i looked up. I saw a disk shaped object fairly close to the bridge with approximately eleven lights on the bottom, one giant light in the middle. The object seemed to be a metallic blue, containing a 3-d outer trim on the edges. A I stand in awe, It slowly ascends and and quickly zooms away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in line to enter the Berkeley dumps, when I saw a plastic bag, that the wind had picked up and was floating in the air. With nothing else to do , I watched this bag floating for approx. one minute. This was in a Easternly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed a small metallic object quite a distance away, moving very fast. I have no idea of it&#39;s distance. At first I thought it was a satellite, because it seemed very small compaired to an airplane. It also appeared to be shinny, as if the sun was reflecting off of it. I watched it for about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it appeared to stop for about 5 seconds. That&#39;s when it really got my attention. Then it made a 35 degree right hand turn, and seemed to have slowed down. I reached for my digital camera and snapped a photo in the general area. This is photo # 440. I could not see the object in this first photo. When I looked again for the object, I lost sight of it. After about 30 seconds, I saw it again, and snapped another photo. Bingo...This would be photo # 441. That&#39;s when the dump guy signaled me to drive ahead onto the weigh-in scale, and my encounter was over. I have never witnessed any sightings before and have no idea, of what I saw.<n>

Usually there are other commuters, but this morning the road was strangely empty.  I was talking with my sister on the phone and our connection became static.  I asked if she heard the static, but she replied no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two sharp curves on the road and there are some street lights only on this section of road.  As I approached I could see above the normal street lights two very bright spotlights in the sky.  I told my sister about the odd lights and continued to drive up to the curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took the first sharp curve I could see I was beneath a hovering saucer shaped craft.  Other dim colored lights became clear on the underside of the object.  Once I realized what I was seeing, the craft zipped off to the west over the hills, along Columbia River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the craft was out of sight the static cleared on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve always been interested in the possibility of UFO’s, but never thought I would see something so up close and personal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lets put it this way In the 21 years that I have been a live I havent seen anything move nearly that quick and that smooth. Also it was fairly close and it didnt make a sound. Seen on 5/22/07<n>

All the specific details we are able to disclose are that it was darker on the bottom and it contained marks which may have been something like windows.  It is a secluded area and we personally did not see any other people looking at the vessel.  However there most certainly would have been others who noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After much exploration after the object had vanished, we couldn’t again locate the object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the western sky and at about 40-45 degrees (above the treetops) saw a dark object that at first looked like a boomerang and I thought was a flock of birds flying in close formation.  I could not estimate distance from us, altitude or size, but was at least as large as a quarter held out at arm’s length. The sun was down below the tree line and the sky was mostly clear with high cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away, I noticed that the object was changing shape, almost like it was rotating or tumbling.   It looked like a dark tube or rod that was bending and reshaping itself.   I pointed it out to my wife and she observed it also.   While we were watching it move from South to North-Northwest (with the direction of the wind), our neighbors came out on their front steps and saw it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20-30 seconds it had moved out of our sight behind trees to the North West of our location.   All 4 of us stood around for a minute trying to figure out what it was and making jokes about it being the beginning of the alien invasion.  We thought it probably was a kite or a banner or something that had broken loose, since it was traveling with the strong South wind. At no time did we notice a sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I then walked into our back yard and heard jets accelerating.  When we looked up in the eastern sky, we saw two F-16’s from the Iowa Air National Guard wing at the Des Moines Airport turning to the northwest and heading in the same direction that the object was moving.  We remarked that it was odd, since the National Guard usually flies on the weekends, not on Tuesday nights.  My wife immediately remarked that they must be going after the thing, since it looked very solid and they must have spotted it on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t  think much of the object and was willing to dismiss it as flying debris until we saw the F-16&#39;s heading in the same direction.   It may be a coincidence, but it just seemed odd that we saw the fighters right after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I viewed a silver cone shape craft near or above larger power lines on the right but far ahead, at first I thought a silver hot air balloon, but there was no basket underneath. I looked at it 5-8 seconds until I lost sight due to trees as I was driving. As the highway turned I looked to the right to see if it was still there, but realized the power lines were actually on my left, I was a bit confused but the curve of the highway gave the impression the power lines and object was on my right. As I was driving I looked back a bit and further up ahead where the power lines ran, but the object was gone. I noted 0 number for witnesses, but the traffic flow was medium, early rush hour traffic so I do not know if any other drivers spotted this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second note from witness:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silver cone shaped object spotted off RT 146 N highway over/near power lines<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do not release my name due to previous report.

(Padre Islands)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my family on vacation down on the Padre Islands in the south of Texas. This long, skinny island is fairly close to the Mexican border. We were staying at the Holiday Inn on the southern part of the island. I decided to go out and take some pictures to see if I could get any cool shots. I fiddled around a bit with some settings and took a few pictures, most of which weren&#39;t very good. As I was aiming a picture of the waves, I noticed a light shooting accross the sky. It was rather sudden and at first I thought it was a shooting star. I continued to look, expecting the light and tail to disintegrate as a shooting star/meteorite would, however it didn&#39;t. I came to the realization at that point that it was something that either entered the atmosphere, or was already in the atmosphere. It had a trail that dissapeared as it got closer to over my head. I continued to watch this spectacle as it shot across the sky at a VERY fast pace. As it flew I thought it was a bird, something simply mistaken for something else. My human curiosity kept me watching this object. I felt my heart drop when the object flew accross the moon. I will never forget the statling image I saw then. A disk shaped object, clearly a disk, shot across the moon, it&#39;s color a light amber, glowing as it were, (possibly from entering the atmosphere.) The image continued it&#39;s east-to-west flight across the sky. As it flew away I could only think of the possible explanations for the object. All my compiled theories shattered when the vessel banked hard left about a thumbs legnth from where I was standing above my hotel. The vessel nearly stopped when it banked left, and it continued it&#39;s path west. I didn&#39;t hear any audible engine sounds, only the slight roar of the ocean. The event occured at exactly 9:00 pm and I was only one of a few people on the beach, but when I asked them about it, they said they hadn&#39;t seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it traveled north east, You could clearly see 3 lights in a triangle. They had a slight gold tint to them. After the 3 of us compared notes, we all came up with a rough altitude of 5000&#39; and it only was going between 100 to 300 mph...kinda slow but in a deliberate and straight line.

I am too freaked out to tell anyone else, especially since no one would believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out smoking a cigarette on my patio when I saw it.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed, but a group of people in the grocery store parking lot across the street from my apartment started honking their horns at one another.  I saw them get out of their cars and point up at the sky.  DIA airport faces in the same direction, so always see when planes when they are coming and landing… but this was most definitely no plane.  I saw a light that would have looked like a twinkling star, except for a triangular shaped bright-aura surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering above ground a couple hundred feet for a few seconds, and then shot up higher into the sky faster than any aircraft I’ve ever seen. Then it slowed down, did a zigzag up higher while going north, then disappeared.  I went inside immediately and sat down, a little disturbed by what I saw to make sense of anything.  I went back outside after a few minutes to see if the people who had also spotted it were still there, but they had left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was way, WAY too fast to be a helicopter, and there is no plane I’ve seen that could do such maneuvering.

I faced East, toward SF Bay, just north of the San Rafael/Richmond bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scrambled off the recliner to the patio door and saw the circular beam of light slowly, steadily climb (like an airplane) in the sky; it was not on the ground.  There is a small airfield near here and I just thought it was an airplane with a really, really big beam.  There was no way it could be reflected light of any kind.  I watched it rise for about 2 minutes; it was really slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, of a sudden, it converted from a large circular beam of light and became what looked like the lights of a regular aircraft.  It moved slowly, then disappeared for a second or two and reappeared lower and three feet away for 2 seconds, then appeared where it had been.  It did this three times, then broke into another set of plane lights which, slowly, steadily flew to the northeast.  The original light slowly gained in altitude and disappeared to the south, toward the SR/Richmond Bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third incident, much less spectacular than the first, I have witnessed, all in the same place.  So, I decided to report it (and the other incidents, as well).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then all of a sudden the light turned off and re-appeared moments later in the same position where it originally disappeared and started to move again. That&#39;s when another light appeared even brighter heading towards the faint object,We thought they were going to collide with each other, when both stopped and flickered off, and that was it.

5/20/07 08:45|Beecher|IL|Disk|20 minutes|Round Disc Flying With Us While Driving|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56909.html|111|ndxe200705| Description:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 5/20/07 around 8:45am, my father, grandmother and myself were driving in our vehicle headed west about 60 mph headed to church. After a couple of minutes I noticed from the passenger seat out of the corner of my eye this gray &#34;flat&#34; object zooming along with us. I thought it was a bird it was relatively close and then when the object didn&#39;t swoop down or up like a normal bird would - I began paying attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this thing in broad daylight against a blue sky and white puffy clouds fly as fast as we were driving (I don&#39;t know the distance ratio in relation to us or how fast it was flying - only that it was keeping up with our vehicle). I naturally assumed it was a plane (we have a small airport relatively close nearby) then noticed it had no wings and was round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately drew my grandmother&#39;s and father&#39;s attention towards it and they both saw it and acknowledged it but thought it was a plane in the distance. My dad, however, kept watching it out of the corner of his eye while he was driving watching it along with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road we were on has big trees periodically as you&#39;re traveling along. For the duration of about 2-3 minutes this thing was driving along what seemed to be next to us (we were driving about 60mph) and then it flew behind this big group of trees and disappeared. So strange!!  I just figured that the &#34;plane&#34; turned a different direction that we were unable to see??<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to a stop sign in that particular road and headed north on an intersecting road and this object all of a sudden appeared on my father&#39;s side (who was driving) and I noticed it. If this was a regular plane, we would have seen it continue to fly with us and end up crossing our path (since it was originally flying parallel to us) but it had disappeared behind the trees and then re-appeared on the opposite side of the road. It then continued to drive (seemingly) along with us again!! We were of course paying attention to the road driving and we took our attention away and it disappeared yet again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all decided this was very odd but dismissed it anyway. THEN ... we made it to our exit onto I-57 headed north (within about 5-6 minutes from last seeing it) and it re-appeared again only this time bigger than it was before. It was flying on the west side of the interstate and was flying much higher this time and faster. It began to speed ahead of us like a shot out of a cannon. Then it suddenly stopped. It was hovering!! Any doubt that I had that this truly was an airplane that I had simply  misunderstood ... vanished when WE ALL saw that thing hovering. There was a semitruck and a couple of cars that were pulled over on the side of the road pointing up at this thing!  We continued to our destination and it was still in the air hovering. I looked back one last time and could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest thing I ever saw!!! I would never tell anyone for fear of being called a lunatic. I consider myself a reliable source and was not alone in my sighting of this thing. Seeing it on a Sunday morning in broad daylight was also very odd. I always hear of people seeing these things at night with lights but this was in the morning!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

His room overlooked the back yard (west) and my room overlooked the front yard.(east)  All of a sudden my husband runs into my room and jerks open the front door and freezes in a stance blocking the open door looking up.  By that time I have chased after him to the door and see a black triangle craft slowly clearing my roof line (I have a roof overhang) into the open part of my front yard. (1/2 acre) I could see the bottom of the  craft and saw lights at the points of the triangle but there was no sound.  Our pine trees were 29 yrs old at that time and the craft was just above them moving very very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get out into the front yard but my husband was rigid in the doorway and blocked me from leaving the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it moved east crossing the street over a heavily wooded 4 acres of land until we could not see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband tells me that he could see an object moving toward our house from way off and watched it til it moved over our roof and ran for the front door.  We were so stunned by this event that all I remember was that he went back to his tv room and we never discuss this again.  I wanted to but he did not!  The sky was clear and not black like there was some moon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived next to the Ford truck plant property line and thats where it had to fly next.<n>

The light was almost dazzerling my eyes like the sun the longer I looked at it.  I got up from the table and walked to the window at which time I saw another.  The lights were moving in a diaginal line up towards the sky, they were in sight a very long time,as they were moving in a diaginal way they to were going around each other.  I just can not explain it, it was very very strange (I&#39;ve never seen anything move in that way before and I am thirty five.  Just to clarifie that I had not been drinking,nor have I ever taken drugs.  No flight carrier could move in that way!  I straight away called my partner and he to see the lights only he said there must be an explanation for it, then all of a sudden around six more appeared at least a minuet after.  I must say I am taken backby it all.  I could not make out any shape what so ever as the lights were so bright you had to look away for a second at a time.  I wanted to run and get a camera only I did not want to miss a thing.  Then I thought you would only see bright lights you coulc not catch how they were moving.  I called my father who only lives an eight minuet walk away or so and he could of seen it as well, only by then they all vanished into the sky(I think there were probabley clouds but the lights never dimmered they were just gone I hung around for a couple of hours but I never saw anything else. I noticed there were a few people in the street walking to their car and one lady seemed to be looking up into the sky in the same direction only Iam not sure If she could make out what was going on.  she may of thought she had one too many drinks. her and the other people came out of a close by resturant.  I tried to send this last night only I was having problems with the internet, it would not connect.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am an amateur astronomer so I looked through my telescope (20x magnification) towards the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I was looking at Venus but then I realized that the sky was cloudy. There was no star, planet or some other extraterrestrial object visible! I looked through my telescope again (now at 250x magnification) and the object was not moving at all. Now I was convinced that I was not looking at anything natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering 1500m from the ground (or so) for 8 minutes. After that 8 minutes it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This caught my eye because it looked exactly like the light I witnessed and reported last month in the same area but much slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my wife to come outside so she could witness it. It was moving very slow with several large passenger jets passing over it.  I asked my wife to retrieve my binoculars from the house, as she was inside it stopped and hovered without moving.  As looked through the binoculars, I witnessed a slight aura around the object, neither blinking strobes nor lights. It was a very bright orange, unknown structure, and had no apparent noise coming from it.  We stood and observed it for about 3-4 minutes. The orange light blinked off and on several times and then it disappeared from its stationary position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was freaked out by the whole experience.  I know many people witnessed this for the weather was very clear and the light was very bright. I am curious if Ontario International Airport was aware of this?<n>

I used the moon as a vantage point for the object and it did altar its stationary spot, but only slightly. I was having a conversation while watching and when i looked away and looked back there was a dark line passing ever so cleverly inbetween the moon and this object, you must understand how close the object appeared to the moon;anything inbetween the two was odd. i ask my sister to come and look and when i looked back again, 2 secs later that dark line had jumped over to fall on the outer side of this bright object..it lasted there for aprrox. 2-3 min. and the dark line was gone.  i went inside and came back out 45min. later the object was still there....we were leaving to go downtown twenty min. trip roughly when we got out of the car..there was nothing but the crescent moon in the sky...i mean nothing that even faintly looked like this object...at the nightclub i asked several people if they had seen the object...everyone i ask had indeed seen it...it was just too damn obvious to miss<n>

I ws driving along at 8.30pm in down-town Brunswick/Melbourne/Victoria/Australia on my delivery run for the local pizza restaurant when I caught myself gazing at a very luminous, violet coloured, oval shaped ball in the night sky - about 45 degrees from the horizon and noticably travelling along at an odd sort of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked to see if my vision was being influenced by anything thru my windscreen by popping my head out of my driver&#39;s side window - and sure enough it looked just the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving away from my field of vision at a steady rate, but it would have been close to about 30 seconds - (the same time it took for me to drive a distance of about 500 metres at 40 kilometres per hour) that after watching it gliding along in a generally static eastward direction, I then saw it ultimately disappear from my view on the eastern city horizon (Mt. Dandenong) - but only after seemingly seeing it split  into two parts - with a much smaller (similarly shaped) part splintering off and making a sharp downward trajectory which is where I ultimately lost vision of it as well as the original (larger) object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought that it was some sort of laser-type light show being staged at a nearby sporting ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There weren&#39;t any reports in the media that night or the next day so I really am lost for words as to what the object really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely wasn&#39;t moving in a familiar aircraft-type manner - way too fast for something so high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of it was comparable to the biggest star that you can normally see -multiplied by about five; but it wasn&#39;t that far up in the heavens - it looked like it was hovering over our side of the world - amazing visuals!!<n>

I have seen many helicopters and planes, living here in Las Vegas but this isn&#39;t one of them. The white light around it is so bright that even at it&#39;s altitude it is lighting up the sky. I can&#39;t make out the shape with the binoculars because they are not powerful enough and the light seems to be hiding the shape. I have taken pictures.

It was flying very fast and crossed the sky until it was out of sight in maybe 20 seconds.

I noticed a very bright light just above the tree line to the west. I grabbed my camera and ran out to get a closer look and get beyond the trees in my yard. The light was hovering in one spot. I took a few photos and observed it a while longer and it began to wiggle back and forth slightly. It “wiggled” maybe 30 seconds and blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first downloaded the photos I couldn’t really see anything, I took them into Microsoft Picture It and slightly lightened them and the orange glowing ball was clearly evident. There was no moon and it was very dark otherwise as I live outside of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In June close to the 8th, I witnessed a very similar &#34;object&#34; again in the western sky. Once again I took my camera and got a few shots in before it disappeared. This time when I downloaded them, the light had a very odd shape that I don’t even know how to describe, except as organic with tubular extrusions with ball shaped ends and was a silver metallic color.<n>

There was also a set of 3 or 4 that went about 2 times faster then all the other ones..that was very scary  then they stoped for about 40 min then as we walked home we saw them 2 more times heading over the east end of the city of london Ont. My friend called her mom who lives about a 4 min drive away in the direction these lights were going...she said she saw them but with a few seconds delay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> these were NOT airplane or star looking lights..they where like dim-shadowy sillouets coming from nowhere. This is no joke...it rattled me and her and we are 100% confident it was nothing man made. It looked nothing like a plane, weather thingy,satelite or anything like that..this is scary cause they all went north from all diferent directions and they sometimes changed formation or crossed over eachother and or converged togtether...one I noticed was oscilating almost (shaking).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out, there were white dots in the sky, 3 of them in a triangle formation, then there were 4 of them in a square formation. Then, they disappeared, only to come back one at a time, and take off. I went back inside, and he called me out again, as he sits next to a large window. There in the sky, I don&#39;t know how high up were 2 groups of a LOT of UFO&#39;s. The first group in sight had to have over 50 saucer shaped flying objects, close together, moving as a group, to the left and to the right. The second group had about 20 objects together, moving as a group. Eventually, they melded together, and then separated again. These were not bobbing up and down, not bouncing, but staying close together. Every so often, they would be lit up, and then they would disappear, this happened for about 10 minutes total, and then they just were gone. Unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly migratory birds?  PD))<n>

Dark grey not black and was clearly reflective (eastern side appeared glossy as a consequence of sun). The color was reminiscent to that of a gun metal grey. Approximate altitude was 2000 ft. and as a guess ½ mile south of 75th street and appeared stationary over the course of the observation. Clearly not a balloon. Another vehicle next to me with two men were looking at it as well. The car behind me tooted its horn as a consequence of both my and the other vehicle not moving when the light changed. Upon looking up to the light and in the rear view mirror at the tooting car (app 3 sec) the object vanished. The vehicle next to me must have noticed its disappearance as well because the driver lifted his hands and shrugged his shoulders.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light immediately zig-zagged about 4 times before disappearing in a south east direction (going towards Seguin, Texas) Its worth noting that I live very close to a municiple airport, although in my 20 or so years of living here, I have never seen a light this close move so quickly and in such an irregular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

5/17/07 22:30|Converse|IN|Light||Orange lights in a line appear from right to left as first goes out another to the left lights up|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57585.html|131|ndxe200705| Orange lights in a line appear from right to left as first goes out another to the left lights up<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:30pm on May 17th, 2007. I was outside on our upstairs deck looking to the West. I noticed a white light about the same size as the planet Venus moving from South to North. The light was as bright as Venus and did not have any other flashing lights around it. From my point of view the light was moving from South to North at a steady pace. After it passed by Venus the light split into two lights, now flashing. They each went away from one another at about 45 degrees. They then disappeared. This lasted about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes later my husband came outside to join me and I told him what I saw.  After waiting a few minutes three orange lights appeared in the Western sky in about the same area, to the left of Venus and just above the treetops. These lights were bright round lights, orange in color and the same size as Venus. They appeared one at a time from right to left. As one would come on to the left the right one would go out. The lights would fade in intensity as if a blowing tree was blocking your view. Then the lights just turned off. This lasted about one minute.  We both noticed after the lights went out there were about 20 to 30 airplanes in the sky circling the area where the lights had been. These airplanes appeared very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited about 10 to 15 more minutes and saw more orange lights appear in the Western sky just to the left of the previous ones. This time the lights appeared one at a time from right to left, about 3 or 4 in a row. They faded and brightened again and then just before going out a line of 3 smaller lights appeared at a 45-degree angle up from the original lights in this formation. Then they turned off too. This lasted just 30 to 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were about the size of a pea from arms length and about an inch apart in the sky. They did not move when illuminated. They did not appear in the exact spot as the times before. These lights were not flares being shot up from neither the ground nor flares shot from an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a police officer and I called the station to see if anyone else had reported the lights. I was told that a woman that lives about 20 miles to the Northwest of my home called and reported the orange lights in the sky. From her point of view they were also to the West of her home.<n>

I would just like to know if anyone else saw what I saw.  I would also like to see if there is a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 17, at approximately 10:30 p.m. Out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 or 3 red/orange colored lights in a row, horizontally in the sky.  When I actually looked directly at the lights I saw two.  They appeared to be slightly larger than Venus.  The approximate distance between them would be about an inch if you measured at an arms length.  The one on the left faded out(it looked like it just slowly went out), then the one on the right.  They were in the western sky approximately to the 5 o’clock of Venus(I&#39;m guessing it was Venus), about halfway between the horizon and Venus.  The entire “sighting” took approximately 5 seconds.  I didn’t hear anything out of the ordinary at the time.  I continued to watch the same area of the sky for a few minutes but didn’t see anything else.  There are no towers in that direction that I could have mistaken for the lights.  I was located approximately 1 mile east of Atlanta, Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather  according to weather.com: 	Clear 	48 deg. F 	Visibility 10 mile<n>

I happened to look in the driver’s side mirror, at the traffic backing up behind me, and noticed something in the distance in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, as the area isn’t far from O’Hare Airport, but I noticed that it had a sort of orangish-white glow to it, and as it very slowly horizontally moved along across the clear blue sky, I could see it had a shape that reminded me of a thimble. The size of it was from where I was sitting in my car about the size of my pinky-finger nail from about an arm and a half-length’s away. When the traffic began moving again, I pulled forward a few feet in my car, and when I looked again, couldn’t see the object again. The whole experience was no more than a minute or so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking up in the sky I caught a black circular object.  It was high in the sky and moving smoothly south. I pointed it out two my two co-workers who also clearly saw the object. We tracked it with our eyes for about two minutes. It was clear to the three of us this was neither a bird nor a plane.  As luck would have it, a flock of Canadian geese AND a passenger jet flew by while the object was still in sight. (We are about 15 miles west of O&#39;Hare International Airport and we have a lot of geese this time of year).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the comparison of the geese flight and the airliner, it looked to be considerably higher than the airliner.  The airliner was 15 miles west of O&#39;Hare and continuing west and looked to be about 10,000 feet and climbing.  The object crossed paths with it, so we had a great angle to judge this by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the object&#39;s appearance, it was pitch black with no reflective surface on this very sunny, clear day.  The airliner by contrast was very reflective and bright. Because of this matte, black appearance we would only be guessing at the object&#39;s real shape.  Because of the distance, our eyes condensed it to &#34;circular&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Great Lakes Regional FAA Center in DesPlaines, IL.  They passed me to their operations center and took my name and phone number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We as a group are certain this was no normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *It was higher than 10,000 feet, ruling out birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Because of this height, the size had to be considerably large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *It was matte black and non-reflective, ruling out weather balloons or commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *It was clearly odd-shaped, not conforming to normal silhouettes.  We could make out neither wings nor fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *It left no contrail. (Neither did the passenger jet)<n>

First I thought it must be Jupiter or Venus, but then I saw that it was drifting slowly northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A big, bright light moving to the north: this could not have been a planet or a bright star.  Some might suggest that I saw an airplane; I can only say that all of the airplanes I’ve seen flying at night typically have flickering lights spaced apart from one another on each wing, whereas the object last night was one solid, extremely luminous ball of light.  Others might suggest that it was a satellite, but all of the satellites I have seen in my life have not been nearly so luminous as this object.  Most importantly, neither hypothesis can explain the sudden disappearance of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been curious about UFOs all of my life, but this was only the second time I’ve ever seen anything anomalous (the first time was insignificant: probably just a balloon).  For a while I stared out my window, hoping it would come back again.  But (alas!) it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.  Perhaps someone else in the Portland area saw it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to go to McMinnville this weekend to hear you speak, but I don’t have any way to get there.  Greyhound doesn’t go out there on weekends.  Perhaps next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all.  Thank you for your time and the fine work you do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about that time I looked up to see Saturn.  All of a sudden to the south almost straight up, I saw an object light up as bright as Venus and about the same white color.  This was very bright and seemed very high in the sky.  I told my wife, what is that?   At that moment it reduced the bright white glow to almost nothing.  I could however still see it.  I didn&#39;t see any flashing lights nor did it change colors.  It was like a hot amber color that was very dim and slowly traveled south east.  I wondered if it was a satellite but I have never in all my years saw a satellite that lit up like that. Also it must be generating some large energy source to be that bright at that altitude. Very strange..<n>

HYW 157 proceeds up curving hill and off my left shoulder I saw a very large stationary triangular shaped object over a large field near the SIUE college campus. I slowed my car down and looked at the object for several seconds and then turned off the road at the top of the hill at a hotel parking lot. I got out of the car and could see the object clearly motionless over a field at an altitude of approximately 200 to 300 feet about 250 yards away from me. The object started to move tward me at an estimated 30 MPH heading toward HYW 157 moving south. The craft climbed to approximately 500 to 700 feet and followed HWY 157 heading in the direction of the next town Collinsville.  I returned to the car and follow the craft for about 5 to 10 minutes as it traveled down HWY 157 untill it stopped following the road and disappeared over a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft Description: Large triangular shaped object at an estimated 100x150 feet Black in color Traveled at an estimated 30 to 40 MPH, no sound was herd Craft had many bright white lights at various locations along edges; the white lights were not blinking and no other colored lights were observed When I followed the craft from behind no visible propulsion just the white lights along the perimeter edges The craft was approximately 20 to 30 feet thick  Weather: It was dusk on a clear 65-degree evening with no clouds in the sky; the sky had a red hue as the sun was near the horizon  Observations: The craft was so large and moving so slowly I realized immediately that wings could not provide enough lift to keep an object of this size aloft at that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

5/15/07 00:15|Seattle|WA|Circle|3 seconds|Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56674.html|157|ndxe200705| Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, shortly after midnight I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO. The area I live is in the very northwest corner of Seattle. In the immediate vicinity there are many lights at play fields, schools, and all along the Highway 99 and I-5 corridors. The light pollution is intense, plus add to that the very bright street lights along most of the streets allow for very few stars to be seen, even on the clearest nights. It was mostly clear last night, with some light cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was windy and fairly chaotic with much traffic noise. At approximately 12:15 AM an object traveling northbound in the sky caught my attention very quickly. There was no noise emitted that I could hear over the wind and traffic, but it seemed close enough that it should have given some report. Initially, I was not paying attention, but caught the movement in my peripheral. I generally pay attention to air traffic, which usually goes from the north to south (Sea-Tac), or east/north east to the south west (Renton?). This object was heading what appeared to be directly north, which usually only occurs when a Coast Guard helicopter is flying along the I-5 corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was it must be a shooting star.. an enormous shooting star. But the light intensity stayed exactly the same and the path it traveled appeared perfectly straight never varying or arching in the slightest. The reason I thought it was a meteor was because the velocity - it traveled very fast. My view of the east sky is limited on the south and north by large trees and houses. The clear area in which the object was visible runs a good length between the trees, I guess maybe twenty to thirty degrees of unbroken sky. It traveled almost the entire length - from when I took notice and raised my head - to the tree on the north end in a couple seconds. I attempted to follow the path beyond the tree to see if it continued but lost sight, perhaps because my contacts were so dry it forced me to blink repeatedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was a bright light, light yellow in color. I thought it was white at first, but I think there was some yellow in it. It was a circle, maybe a bit oval in shape. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was my dry contacts, but it appeared to have left a short tail behind it, like a comet. Like previously stated, I could not hear any sounds emitted from the object. The size of the light was much larger than any airplane lights, helicopter light, or shooting star that I have ever witnessed. The entire incident lasted about 3 seconds. I saw no deviation from a straight path heading due north, maybe north and slightly east. It appeared to be descending, although that may have been it traveling away from my position. If I had to venture a guess based on size where it was flying over I would say somewhere over the north end of Lake Washington, maybe farther east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was clear so I was looking up at the stars.  Looking to the north of where I was standing  what I had thought to be a bright star, flashed very brightly and then disappeared.  Less then a second or two later another very bright flash took place and disappeared. this time it was to the left of where I saw the original flash.  At first I thought it may have been very bright lights from a plane, but I could not follow the lights beings it only flashed 2 times.  The flashes of light seemed much brighter than typical airplane lights.<n>

It was a silver ball and there were lots of chemtrails around. I was on 23rd and 6th ave in new york city.  I watched it float for about ten seconds until i lost it behind a building.  There was no chemtrail activity for a week, but then today there was a ton.  And today I had my camera.  I was taking pictures pretty much all day from my apartment living room.  The first out of the ordinary thing I saw was a black plane, flying right to left, along the path of an already laid chemtrail.  This trail then became twisted like a dna strand.  I then moved and went into my bedroom and sat on the window sill with my computer.  About 5 or ten minutes later I saw a bright light hovering in the middle of the &#39;X&#39; of two trails.  I had to run to my living room to get my camera and then pointed it at the light asap.  I don&#39;t know what happened, but my camera didn&#39;t pick up the light, but it did get the plane &#34;appearing&#34; out of nothing.  I think it was &#34;cloaked&#34; because there are very faint geometric distortions, like in the predator movies.  Frame by frame the object moves very oddly.  The camera is shaky becasue i was trying to step out onto the fire escape.  Once i was out the object had already started flying to my right, so i ran inside to my living to get another angle.  I got a few seconds of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next sighting was the same sort of thing, but this time the light was MUCH more intense.  I say on camera that it looks like a flashlight.  I couldn&#39;t figure out if it was star or not.  It was soo bright though and it looked like it had an aura around it.  And it didn&#39;t flicker at all. My camera had trouble focusing on it and at times and it look very much like a disc shaped ufo when it lost focus. It hovered there for about 30 minutes, but it slowly drifted lower and to the right and finally behind a building so i couldnt see it anymore. I had almost decided that it was jsut a star until this same bright light emerged from behind the building and started over my head to the right. It wasnt traveling very fast and it had no blinking lights at all. in fact it was just one light. I could make out all the airplanes, and in fact one flies right by the orb light and you can clearly tell the difference. When it was going over my head it took on sort of a bird like shape but still was just a light... this one didn&#39;t turn into an airplane like the fisrt one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on Orchard and Stanton streets in New York City. My living room faces north and my bedroom to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jamie Maussan talks about these and the exact same thing can be found on orbwars.com.<n>

I watched the object as it crossed the sky, and realized that it was on a straight trajectory to the North, at a very high rate of speed. The thought came into my head that it must be a Military Fighter Jet, however as I lost sight of it, I realized that given the speed it was traveling, I should have heard some type of sound....there was none. One of my co-workers was also on break at the time, and noticed me looking to the sky. She looked up and saw the object as I did, and wondered if it was a jet. I told her that I wasn&#39;t sure, given that there was no noise. I may not be an aerospace engineer, but I have been to every Muskegon Air Fair since the age of 5, and I know that you can still hear the jet engines of a Military Fighter Jet as far up as 25-30,000 feet. I&#39;m not sure what it was that we saw, but whatever it was, sure was trying to get somewhere in a hurry. I hope it&#39;s good on gas mileage!<n>

I&#39;ve seen formations of big orange lights before, flying stars and recently 3 orbs flying in triangle formation; but this one last year was special to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting occurred on May 14 2007 between 01:00 AM and 01:50 AM local time  Me and a buddy saw a boomerang shaped flying object in the clear night sky; which was flying very low over my yard. My buddy saw it first. It first appeared to be a very fast moving cloud. It kinda uncloaked itself and first appeared to be transparent. Then he was able to see the small lights on the bottom (which by that time were turned on) and then was able to see whole ship, it appeared to be of a silverish color with a strong reflecting effect...like a mirror...like it was heavily polished. For a blink of an eye it recloaked and turned into a &#34;cloud&#34; again, but then instantly reappeared. By that time my buddy informed me what was going on; since I was looking in a different direction. The ship then reappeared near the Great Dipper. There was not a single cloud that night; so this thing caught our attention. There was a church tower near by so we figured that the object flew quite low (approx. 82 feet/25 meters). The boomerang kinda uncloaked in front of our eyes, and as soon as it had passed the Great Dipper it cloaked again and disappeared. It had a orange glow at the front, some sort of dome at the rear and some sort of lights (which were turned off) and the bottom. We were able to see it in full detail. The ship&#39;s color was silverish and the dome as well as the big lights at the bottom were appeared to be tinted (the small lights described above, where not visible any longer [turned off] ). I&#39;d estimate the craft&#39;s wingspan was the size of at least 3 or 4 Airbus A380 Airplanes put together. The sighting didn&#39;t last long, maybe 2 minutes and a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to stay completely anonym for now; but if there are any questions or the like, please let me know by sending me an e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/13/07 21:40|Chennai (India)||Formation|betweet 5-10 minutes|A moving array of tiny lights past the sky centre line south to north, sighted four times with 2-3 minutes interval.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56655.html|167|ndxe200705| A moving array of tiny lights past the sky centre line south to north, sighted four times with 2-3 minutes interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Description: During Casual gazing at the stars on 13th May 2007 night (Time  around 9:40pm) (while lying on the flat terrace (third floor) and looking at the sky upwards), i suddenly noticed a set of faint light moving uniformly in one direction, from south direction to north direction. The view was pretty faint, and had i observed it alone, i would have definitely ignored it as my illusion. However, i immediately asked my wife to look at by pointing the direction, and she too spotted it. We both agreed it cannot be a illusion, but however slightly differed in its description: I felt it was two lights moving side-by-side in that direction and with the gaps between narrowing down while my wife&#39;s described it rather as an v-shaped line (of lights!). We were wondering about it for some time, and then ignored it and were talking on some other topic. After maybe 2-3 minutes, we once again noticed a similar movement of lights, in the same direction. This time, we noticed at the fag end of its transition across the sky, and atleast i could not remember clearly its features, felt it to be haphazard collection of moving lights. Again, we had a disagreement on its features: i noted it be a haphazard set of may be 10 white tiny lights (like a star constellation) while my wife once again described it as an V-line formation. Actually, its movement was steady, going straight from south direction passing very nearly to the sky centre line and towards north direction. The entire crossing, i guess would have happened in 3-4 seconds. The object, or the thing could be sighted only over the center portion of the sky, and seems to be fading in the background over the horizon, as the sky was brighter (probably due to city lights) at (about less than 30 degree) horizon compared to the centre. I was casually mentioning what we are seeing could be similar to the many mysterious UFO&#39;s reported but not proven kind of stuff discussed in the science/science fiction TV programmes and other media. Once again, we! spotted for third time after maybe about 2-3 minutes, a similar moving object (by now, it become befitting to be called an object!), again moving in the same direction and in a similar way. After the 3rd sighting, we become alert and probed for the sky for any more such sighting. i was wondering whether it is the same object passing through the sky again and again, or if these were separate objects travelling one after the other. i told myself that i would be alert enough to focus on the movement and get a good glimpse of its features, if i see it next time. And yes, we witnessed the flying object for the fourth time, again may be after 2-3 minutes, a similar moving set of steady lights. This time, i agreed with my wife on its features. It was a V-formation of lights. My rough estimate for the angle between lines of the V would be 140 degrees!. The V-pattern was moving with its centre pivot at the front and V arrow itself pointing towards the direction of its movement. The angular distance of the object, i would put it to be around 3 degrees. We were thrilled at these sightings and hoped would to see fee more. I stargazed for another 30 minutes before giving up and we left to go to sleep. I was conviced that it was indeed an unusual event and said to myself to mark this day as memorable day of my life, lest i ignore and forget it just like those fading movement of light objects. I decided to check websites on UFO&#39;s and report my sightings, for a general benefit. As a responsible person, i thought i should inform and record this event, so that if any/more persons sighted this like us, it would become befitting enough to do investigation and get some meaningful explanation. But, onething is for sure: If somebody else observed it and tells me what he/she saw, i would not have taken it seriously and most definitely ignored it, thinking that person has made somehow misjudged a simple plane as an UFO; And that people have enough personal problems to worry about, than these bizarre movements in the sky. That&#39;s why i d! id not w ant to make a big fuss about what i saw to all the people i meet, and getting branded as an paranoid/cracknut. Instead, i have just put down all my (sincere) observations on the event in this UFO observation site, due to my own curiosity to know what i saw, and probably aid the concerned person/investigator/other UFO viewers, to make sense of these UFO&#39;s. I sincerely hope that myself and my wife were not the only one who witnessed this, and somehow a good number of people have also watched this particular event, so that it is not discounted as an not-strong enough, isolated, ignorable event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a big advocator of UFO sightings or theories on it. I am not a person who collects information about UFO&#39;s reproted by people, but rather know it as only among one of the many interesting news/documentary reported in the TV channel like discovery. Infact, i never got curious enough to know about it by searching/browing the websites. I do not know if what i saw is qualified to be called as an UFO. But all the same, i am listing down, what is so unusual about what i saw that makes it un-ignorable (atleast to me) and curious:  * The object could not be a Plane: I have never seen a plane to be shaped like array of lights lined a arrow shape. But, for my fourth sighting, i would not even consider as and line of lights, but rather a haphazard collection of of lights, in which case would definitely not fit as the lights from the some human-plane. There was no sound heard, but still flew past pretty swiftly. Thus, it could not be just an conventional plane travelling too on ground making it seem to be flying fast(as in which case some sound should have been definitely heard for such low heights). I believe that it could not be a high flying plane (whose sound could not be heard), as i intuitively feel the plane would have to travel at indeed a unbelievably high speed for it transcend the sky in 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * It could not be a meteorite: My first observation as two tiny lights moving together could have probably taken as just a meteorite or shooting stars. Okay, even my second view as a collection of lights like a star constellation, again could have discounted simply as travelling of multiple number of meteorite rocks. But, i cannot definitelty take my final sighting of an well arranged V-array of lights simply as falling meteorites. And also, will meteorites travel in such a periodic manner (every 2-3 minutes) and also in exactly same direction and followint the same path int he sky!!? And also, the lights were not accelerating, were tending to move straight with a steady speed, and no brightening or burning out kind of movement. And the lights were uniformly light (can it be parallel set of uniformlly lit shooting stars??, very unlikely.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> * Array Movement: Based on the pattern of lights alone, the closest thing that i can associate it is an beautiful V-shaped arrangement formed by a  flock of migratory birds. But again, what is disturbing with this description is: The pattern was too geometrically spaced and uniformly moving for it be considered as an natural phenomena; and how come these birds are flying so fast, and why are they carrying tiny lights with them?  My only logical deduction of what i observed based on my own personal experience (ignoring all about UFO reported by others), would be, that it is either a specially designed human made flying object, possibly a secretive (military or otherwise) vehicle, concealed from the purview of general public. Or, it is an mysterious flying object unproved and unknown to humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Or it could be just chance of a chance of a chance occurence of simultaneous hallucination of myself and my wife, and that too for concurrently 4 times, and sharing more or less the similar hallucination of moving lights in the same path!!!  And now thinking about it, may be it possible to give a even simpler explanation. It is simply an low flying kids plane toy or similar such stuff, moving with no sound, with its faint tiny lights. Or, could it by flying light emitting insect, but then again flying so uniformly arranged, hmmmm hard to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this is an sighting whose origin is not known to me now, and possibly i may never be able to know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I saw in the sky looked like two cones, solid gray in color, with a clear section between the upper and lower sections.  The craft move at a constant speed, altitude and direction across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft didn’t emit any light but the bottom section was rotating fairly fast.  It seemed to have something offset at about fifteen degrees so as it rotated, the bottom seemed to wobble.  Although the bottom was spinning, the top section was clearly stationary.  It never changed speed or direction and just few out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were taking pictures of the castle and decided to take pictures of the village that was below the castle.   Looking in the view finder the pictures looked great!  Once home we were so busy looking at the village we never noticed what we think are UFO’S. .  Neither one of us ever saw the images in the sky or we would have taken more pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was more then a week later that I was doing a final look at all the pictures as a slideshow  that I noticed the objects  in the sky.  Upon enlarging the images they appear to be UFO’S.  Having never seen any and not sure what the criteria is I have decided to send them to you.   	 	Picture # 1 is of a few UFO’S in the upper right hand corner of the photo.  There is no glass  to cause a reflection from a flash .   Nor, do I believe that a flash would make that type of shape.  It appears as it the objects in question are in motion and have two tube like bright base and a faint top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Picture # 2 is of the formation in the center of the picture were it appears to be two groups of UFO’s or vessels that are making a type of form that could be seen in the crop formation found in many farms.  Again, they seem to be in motion.  Same area, seconds apart,  we were trying to take a shot of the entire village.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Picture # 3 is of what appears to be two black or dark discs in the center of the picture.  One in plane view and the other behind a cloud.  Again, same area, few seconds apart on pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a photo expert and can not alter images or add anything to a photo.

The object was a blue spherical haze. We initially thought it was a meteor or something. But as I thought about it I remembered it left no trail and I have never seen a meteor that close to the ground, that large, that color or that bright. The object did appear to break up and disappear into splinters. So maybe it was a meteor. I don’t know just thought I should put it out there and see if any one else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/12/07 23:50|Portsmouth|OH|Light|1.5 Minutes|Observation of unusual lights.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56646.html|174|ndxe200705| Observation of unusual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of May 12, 2007 at approximately 23:50 hours, my wife and I were sitting on the front stoop of our house smoking a cigarette. Our house faces a westerly direction and is in a residential area of a small town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frequently look into the night sky to watch the jets as they travel overhead. This night was a particularly clear, cloudless night with many stars visible. As I looked upward and towards the western horizon, I noted in my peripheral vision, two (2) lights moving from the south towards the north. As they passed behind a treetop, I thought to myself that this was a particularly long plane with a different type of lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the objects passed into clear vision, past the treetop, I noticed that the coloration of the light was a bluish or greenish, fluorescence, unlike the color of a star or airplane light. The objects had a very smooth movement and a much quicker speed than that of an airplane. There was no audible sound associated with the appearance or movement of the lights. They appeared to be irregular in shape and were comparable in size to that of a large star, i.e. with their distance away being unknown; their size rivaled that of a large star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the lights move in a straight line in a northerly direction past the treetop, the one in front suddenly moved to a position overtop of the other, i.e. they assumed a vertical position to one another. The one in front flew backwards over the one in the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this action took place both objects then began a wobbly pattern of movement. The wobbling was in an upward/downward pattern and was in unison. These lights then abruptly stopped the wobbling and proceeded onward in their northerly direction. They passed beyond my vision behind the canopy of a larger tree which blocked their visibility and I watched for several minutes to see if they emerged from this position, however, they never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this display was over, my wife said to me, “did you see those lights?”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do note that several minutes after this appearance and disappearance, I was still looking upwards about the sky and I observed what appeared to be a “shooting star” which moved in an east to west direction across the sky and disappeared while halfway to the horizon. It’s color and shape were normal for a shooting star, however, it seemed like it was larger than the average. Another thing which seemed unusual was that we do not normally see shooting stars in the middle of May.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n>

I will try to articulate what I saw but honestly, I don’t know if I can find the right words to describe exactly what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened south of Hernando, MS around 23:22 and the object moved in a northern direction across the sky, slightly west of Hernando towards the eastern Tunica, MS area, then very likely on to west of West Memphis, then to the southern part of Arkansas. This was a light, bright as a star but it did have a strange rhythmic flash that corresponded with its bazaar flight path. This object was moving so fast that I lost sight of it after about 3 seconds. It was very high in the sky and seemed to rapidly drop altitude multiple times before disappearing in a lateral direction. The light would stay on then, as it would disappear. The next thing I would see was the light again at a different altitude and in a different place in the sky…a flight path incompatible with any aircraft. It was like the object was stair stepping across the sky and on the downward movements, the light would disappear. While moving laterally, the light would disappear again and then come back on…only to reappear in a position that would totally exclude any aircraft movement. I can’t articulate how fast this thing was going!  What I saw tonight was neither an aircraft nor a meteorite. This was not space junk falling from the sky. I am not sure of what it was exactly, but I do know that it moved rapidly and in a fashion that was deliberate. This object was so fast that I can see how it would be missed on radar. I can only say that I got the feeling that whatever this was, it did not want to be spotted or observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Of course, by the time I got the camera set up they had disappeared, but I did get a look at them through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to one of my friends there was originally 6 objects in the northern sky which slowly moved and faded away. I did not see these six. Not long after they returned in the south western sky, this time there was only three. They were distinctly orange in colour, about magnitude 0 in brightness. First of all they were in a line but then they slowly moved into a sort of L formation and then disappeared one at a time. Through the binoculars all that could be seen were three orange lights. Akin to the colour of a flame. The three lights covered an area of sky of about the width of the W of Cassiopeia. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life, truly strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Bangor coastguard even reported it, it was seen by many people in the area!

She said that its a plane, and I was very doubtfull that was the case due to the brightness of the light and the elvation. The only light on a plane that is that bright is the taxi light, and the elvation was not coducive to a landing pattern. This object was not mooving as fast as a plane would if it was landing, flying towards or away from us. My reference was the fact that this object&#39;s light was equally intense through the whole sighting, the light did dissapear then returned several times while keeping the same position in the night sky. It was just hanging in the skly several hudred feet above and few miles southwest of the dane county airport. My girlfriend and I were watching the light and I&#39;d begun to think that this was just A low flying plne traveling away from us at an angle that made it appear to not move at all. I was in the navy for a while in the late 90&#39;s as an A.E. stationed in Lemoore Ca., and have seen alot of aircraft flying at night. This was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen. The object would dim out then come back just as bright as before, when looking at it through my girlfriend&#39;s digital camera &#34; the stillframe side and magnified it appeared to change color as aposed to the white light shutting off, it would change to deep red, blue, and green. The object would also shoot multi colored beams of light out of the top of the object. The &#34;beams&#34; gave me the impression that ther was more to the object than we could see in the night. The object started to move lower in elevation not losing any brilliance to the light, and it would move side to side, we went outside to see more, watching for about 1 half of an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no shape to any of the light - too small and too high up. They looked like they were very high up. There was no noise. All the lights were flickering. Gradually each of the points flared up slightly and sputtered out, the leading-most light going out first. The lights kept their formation until they went out. Angular distance between the two extreme-most lights was quite large - at least 10 moon widths. The lights looked very like a formation of very high flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is that it was a satellite breaking up, and the orange glows were reflections from the sun that had just recently set.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It pulsed like this several times, but at no discernable frequency (number of times per second).  Everyone on the car noticed it after I pointed it out and there was much speculation as to what it was.  It then faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took notice of it because I happened to be looking in that direction and it seemed to be   a strange shape to be able to fly. It had no wings, yet it moved like an airplane. It made no noise and seemed to be followed by a single engine aircraft. I was able to take two photos of the object and two photos of the aircraft. The &#34;UFO&#34;, if it was one, suddenly took off toward the NNE with a sudden increase in speed which the airplane could not match. The color of the object was dark and did not change and it never made a sound. The engine of the aircraft was barely audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter joked that perhaps we would see a UFO since I had spotted some unknown object(s) in the sky at the same place, roughly two years ago, when we&#39;d been flying kites. It, unfortunately, has become a family joke.  As we sat under the trees, she joked about some flying insects being UFOs and pointed to a passing jet or two. After a minute or so, she pointed and said, &#34;What is that white ball following that jet?&#34; I looked at the commercial jet that was flying overhead, and there was what appeared to be a ball of white vapor alongside the jet&#39;s vapor trail.  This ball of what appeared to be white smoke or vapor was about the same width as the jet itself, or perhaps a little wider.  The odd thing was that this ball appeared to be following the jet. It did not stay stationary in the sky as if it were just part of the vapor trail. Instead, it followed alongside the vapor trail behind the jet, traveling at what appeared to be the same speed as the jet, maintaining a constant distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood up and walked out from under the trees to watch this object follow the jet until they both disappeared into the distance and out of view in the western sky. We were facing east when the jet and object were approaching, heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a highly educated individual with a Masters degree, married with 2 daughters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I, nor the two passengers in the aircraftm noticed the object.  I noticed it will editing the video recorded by the rear passenger.  Aircraft was pointing West at an altitude of 1700 ft, airspeed 90kts.  Aircraft is equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System - and it did not report any aircraft at the time of filming, plus, there were no ofther aircraft reporting in the area the time the video was taken.  When I noticed the object in the film I first thought it was a beacon, but it moves and there are no beacons I know of in that area.  Analyzing the video, it is apparent that the object changes color from white to blue to red and back and forth.  The stills I made from the video appear to show a shape of a childs spinning top.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After cruising for a few hundred yards we decided that it was to dark to go any farther safely so I came to a stop and killed the engine. We sat there and talked for about ten minutes when one of my friends butted in to the conversations with an emphatic, &amp;#8220;Look at that&amp;#8221;, and then he pointed. I looked at the object and immediately come to the conclusion that it was the planet Jupiter and stated my opinion then continued my conversation. Then he and the person I was talking to said in unison, &amp;#8220;No its moving&amp;#8221; so I looked again, thinking I could explain the illusion to them, and then I also saw it move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed for 5 or so minutes changing direction and hovering many times but staying in the general area of the constellation scorpio the whole time. One of the others in the boat had been playing with the flare gun earlier and decided it would be a good idea to shoot it at the object, he did so and the object faded away in a period of about 15 seconds and was gone. The object never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was relatively clear, but with occasional thunderstorms having occurred earlier that day. There was no other aircraft around at the time and no noise was associated with it. It was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. Jupiter was spotted and ruled out. Ball lighting was ruled out. Total of 5 witnesses all sober and all concluded that it was not any sort of known aircraft. I personally am a private pilot with an instrument rating and have over 250 hours flight time. I personally believe it was of terrestrial origin, but otherwise am unsure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I know this sounds sorta hoaxy but it looked like a half moon shape with a elongated triangle protruding from the middle out between the arms; the best way I can describe it is to say it looked similar to the Klingon (spl?) ship style in the Star Trek movies I saw as a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

((1st report from witness))|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56619.html|194|ndxe200705| Large gray cylinder seen over James River near Williamsburg, Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my bicycle south on Treasure Island Road at 15:50 when I noticed a large cylindicral craft in the sky somewhat ahead of me. From my angle of view I estimate it was over the James River and aligned towards the SSE. Visibility was a little hazy, but otherwise conditions were very good ( I was wearing prescription,  polarized sunglasses and they allow me to see through haze quite well). There were a few high, scattered clouds and I could tell the craft was below the clouds. At first I thought it was a jet airliner. This is a common enough sight in our area, so I really didn&#39;t give it much thought at first. But the longer I looked at it, the more I realized that it wasn&#39;t behaving the way an airliner would. For one thing, it was barely moving. An airliner would have traversed a good piece of sky in the time I watched it. The other odd thing is that I didn&#39;t see any wings or a tail section. It was a long cylineder, dull gray color and the body seemed to be marked by four, equidistant black lines. I stopped my bike to get a better look at it. Because this is the 400th anniversary of the Jamestowne settlement my next thought was that it was some kind of military aircraft (the POTUS is due to be here on Sunday and security is very high). But it was not a fighter craft, or a helicopter, or a dirigible, or anything else I could recognize. Off to my right I did see a low-flying miliatry helicopter near Jamestown Island, but it was moving away from my position. It was probably part of the security arrangements for the weekend&#39;s festivities. I kept my eye on the cylinder for another minute or so and then it just vanished! One moment it was there and the next it was gone. I scanned the sky for another couple of minutes, but there was nothing there.  I don&#39;t know if it moved off faster than my eyes could track it, or whether it had indeed disappeared. It was quite extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled my truck over to get a better view, it allowed me to watch maybe for a minute tops.  At which time it zoomed off in a northeastern direction at a very high rate of speed.  I have seen UFO&#39;s before but never one like this.  It was the traditional Disk, but it was glowing green.  I was on a rural road and there was no noise what so ever.  It zoomed off at such a high rate of speed that all I could see what a blur.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/10/07 23:00|Greenfield|IL|Triangle|15 minutes|Sightings in Greenfield, IL|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56892.html|198|ndxe200705| Sightings in Greenfield, IL<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 1, 2007  I have seen a UFO on three different occasions in the last 6 months here in Greenfield, IL. The first incident was the same day in November 2006 when the sightings were reported at O’Hare airport in Chicago, IL, although I didn’t realize this at the time. It was approximately 9:30 pm. I went outside to bring my dogs in for the night and saw an extremely bright yellow/orange light in the Southern sky over a corn field behind our property. We live in a rural area and there are very few lights at night, so it is very, very dark. Any light at all will stand out in our area. I had never seen a light in the sky like this before and thought for a minute that it might be a new street light that had been installed. However, it was too high in the sky to be a street light. I stared at the light for a minute or two and realized that it was moving closer to me and getting larger as it moved. I then realized that this was some sort of UFO. I actually could not tell what shape this object was, it just appeared to be the brightest light I had ever witnessed. It stopped moving and hovered approximately 200 feet in the air, maybe 100 yards from me. I had the distinct feeling that whatever this was, it knew that I was looking at it, and I felt it was looking at me. This object made no noise whatsoever. I kept listening for some sort of sound, thinking maybe it was a helicopter or something, but no sound at all. It hovered at this point for approximately 4-5 minutes then just disappeared into thin air. It did not move up, down, sideways or back. It just disappeared completely. Two days later I heard about the sightings at the Chicago airport and wondered if this could have been one of the objects that were seen there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was in April, 2007. I saw the same bright yellow/orange light at approximately 10:00 pm. It moved from West to Northeast. Again, I could not discern any detail of this object, only that it was very similar to the light I had witnessed in November, 2006. It moved at a very high rate of speed. This time, it did not hover but just continually moved across the sky. I have no other detail for this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sighting was approximately May 10, 2007. I was lying in bed looking out the window at 11:15 pm. I suddenly noticed the same bright, yellow/orange light in the Southern sky, again at the same spot I spotted the light in November. It hovered at approximately 100 feet or so for approximately 5 minutes. I then called my boyfriend into the room and he witnessed the same object. It hovered at the same spot for a while and we could see that the lights would dim to almost nothing, and then get bright again. From the angle I was seeing the object; it appeared to have 3 lights across the front. It appeared at this time to be round or cylinder shaped and I was seeing the front arc of the object. The object continued from bright to dim for approximately 5 minutes then began to move to the Northeast. When it reached the point that it was over the tree in our backyard, we could see that it wasn’t round at all, but triangular in shape. It didn’t seem to be moving all that fast and we ran to our front door and went out on the porch to watch the object continue moving to the Northeast. Up to this point, we heard nothing from this object. It made no sound at all. But, once it passed us to the Northeast we did hear a noise coming from the object. Something like the sound that comes from an airplane in the sky, however it wasn’t that loud. It was almost a swishing sound, not a rumbling sound. It continued to blink off and on and disappeared into the Northeast sky. The entire incident lasted maybe 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this last object, I began to think about the first sighting I had. I wondered if the object I first encountered didn’t actually disappear into thin air, but simply turned its lights off as the last object had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have asked at our local gas station if anyone has ever reported seeing UFO’s in this area. I was told that occasionally people do report sightings. I have only lived in this area less than a year and do not know anyone personally to ask about sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was with my fiancée at the sight of a train derailment as he is a reporter for the town newspaper.  I was sitting in the car waiting for him to finish the interviews and take the pictures. I was staring at the sky and while doing so noticed an extremely bright light compared to the surrounding stars. We both decided that the light looked to be about 10,000 feet from the ground. This is merely an approximation and could be completely skewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the light I noticed that it didn’t appear to be moving, and for how close it seemed to be, this was unusual to me. I watched it with growing interest and saw it slightly waver side to side, but only very slightly. It just looked like it was hovering. It was very bright, almost appearing to be a flood light. It then started to dim, and almost looked like it disappeared. I looked longer and realized that it was illuminating a cloud. I therefore decided that a cloud had passed in front of it. After about two minutes the object started to reappear, only it was a brick red color and very dull. It appeared to be the same size of the stars when it was not so brightly illuminated. Within thirty seconds the light had turned from red back to the previous white bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancée had  returned to the car at this point and I told him about the object I had been looking at. We then decided to watch it longer, and moved locations to a darker parking lot. The object was in the North-west part of the sky towards the lower half. We watched it for another five minutes or so. I decided to call my mom in hope that she could find it and attempt to look at it with binoculars. Less than a minute after I called her and told her to go outside the light dimmed and then disappeared. It was 10:39 when the light disappeared. We watched it a little longer to see if it would reappear as it had done previously, but it didn’t appear to be doing anything. Then as I was watching I noticed the same brick red color as before and very small again. I continued to watch and noticed that it seemed to be flickering, much like a star from red to blue. Finally we decided to go home and that was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/10/07 21:30|Corona del Mar|CA|Circle|15 minutes|Flying disk over Corona del Mar / Newport Beach, California|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56914.html|200|ndxe200705| Flying disk over Corona del Mar / Newport Beach, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> On several occasions since last fall I have witnessed a small flying disk maneuvering in the night sky above a section of the Pacific Coast Highway between Jamboree Road and MacArthur Blvd in the California coastal city of Corona del Mar (Newport Beach).  The disk appears to be approximately 5 feet in diameter, and has the shape of a classic 1950’s style flying saucer.   The upper portion of the craft is outlined with a row of very bright and highly visible (white) LED lights. The disk appears to be powered by some form of electrically generated propulsion system, as it emits a steady and distinct “humming “ sound as it passes overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk is able to ascend and descend vertically with startling speed, and is very agile and maneuverable in flight, performing banks and maneuvers not associated with conventional craft. For these reasons (and of course, due to the small size of the object) it is clear that the disk is unoccupied, operating under the remote control of an individual, or individuals located nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite shocking and disturbing to witness this object in flight.  It resembles neither aircraft nor helicopter in appearance or operation, and clearly demonstrates its superiority to both in terms of maneuverability and its prowess in rapid acceleration and deceleration.  One is not accustomed to seeing such an unusual object passing above what is otherwise a typical California beach town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I most recently witnessed the object hovering in the sky just west of Newport Center (an outdoor shopping plaza flanked by a ring of office parks) on the 10th of May at approximately 9:30 in the evening.  I grabbed my Mini DV video camera from the house and drove over to a neighborhood park to get some footage of the object before it left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot several minutes of the object in flight, and then watched it land on an expanse of grass adjacent to the Newport Center signage pylons.   Soon after the craft landed, its lights were powered down and its operator (presumably) retrieved it in the dark.  I quickly left my discreet vantage point in the nearby park, returned home, and began viewing the footage – highlights of which I am forwarding to your organization via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think you will find the resulting video to be very interesting, as the camera’s 40x zoom lens allowed me to zoom in close on the disk at times, and also to pull back far enough to include recognizable objects such as buildings, traffic lights, and the signage pylons in the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw something very strange today and I thought that I should report it as we don’t see or hear such reportings from India.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home with my wife and my 8yr old son from my clinic when I saw a very bright light at my left up in the sky.I jokingly told my wife that it is a UFO. She also saw the light.It was still and very low,so much that she commented it that it is a tower light ! We came a bit ahead and the light was still there but by now we could see it more clearly.There were three lights, a yellow bright,big light at centre with a blue and red light at sides and we could see that they are in a line and it looked as if we are seeing the side of a plate shaped object. It was very low and absolutely still [ low and still enough to make my wife mistake it for a tower light] ,it looked like the side of a plate, it was not revolving or anything and it was tilted at 135 degree from the horizontal plane [45 degree from left].<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then suddenly it started moving,  it accelerated at a great speed and crossed over our head and came to our right side and sped away and within seconds ,it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it was crossing over our head, it was then we noticed that the object had a round shape with not 3 but 4 lights,one at each point which corresponds to each direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.The points which are not in favour of it being any kind of aircraft I know are- 1.It was very still for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.It was very low .[There were few aircrafts I saw later hovering around a nearby airport waiting for clearance but they were high up.].<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.It was tilted at an angle when stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.The lights were not blinking,they were just on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.It suddenly accelerated at great speeds which ,at least in my knowledge is not possible in a human aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.It was round in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I report it in India,1st  ,we don’t have a website like this ,and 2ndly, Nobody would take me seriously, but I know what I saw,WE know what we saw and we thought we should report it somewhere so here am I.<n>

I had called my family outside to see if they had an explaination and they too were stumped...i said wheres the moon? i looked throught a big maple tree and thought that bright white light coming trough the tree was the moon...when i walked around the tree to get a better look, it was not the moon at all, but an extremely bright light in the shape of a cresent, i never did see the moon at all that night, though it was clear night. neither object moved, the round one just changed colors and the cresent one just got narrow and wide again, by midnight when i checked back, they were gone... i did manage to get a picture of the cresent light on my camera phone...the other light just didnt show up on my phone,,,i guess it wasnt bright enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

5/10/07 21:00|Surprise|AZ|Light|11 minutes|Three lights tracing peculiar flight patterns across the sky|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56617.html|203|ndxe200705| Three lights tracing peculiar flight patterns across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> In short, what was observed: Three nondescript lights proceeding along erratic flight patterns in the low Southwest sky of Arizona. By erratic I mean they were tracing lines back and forth linearly as well as parabolically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently purchased a BMW M3 and, as a matter of driving pleasure, wanted to stretch its legs a bit in an area devoid of traffic hazards. I pointed my car’s compass point directly west along Bell Rd and drove until I converged with 219th avenue, at which time I stopped and played with my satellite radio module.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What captured my attention was a ‘star’ like object that jerked from left to right (south to north, from my vantage point) instantaneously. It covered a distance 8-10 thumb widths at arm’s length and stopped immediately. I cannot articulate the geometry of its flight for the 11 minutes I watched it, though I will say it completed this manuever a few times in addition to sinuous ascents/descents interposed by intervals of no perceptible lateral/superior/inferior movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another ‘star’ like object appeared in the black of the sky accompanied theretofore by no flight trajectory; it simply appeared as if it just materialized into the temporal sequence. It too moved linearly quite fast stopping on a dime and remaining in a fixed position for a little while.  Moreover, I perceived splashes of light emanating from this second light to an area both above and below it. These splashes were dimmer in luminosity than the object, by comparison. Then it traced circuitous patterns in a small area of the sky gradually departing behind White Tank Mountain, as did the third object (It is called a mountain but is really a large hill).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if there are military bases in that direction. Luke Air Force Base is near but in the opposite direction. Yet, even if these objects were borne of man, how could they move in the fashion I observed? The night sky is apt to deceive; therefore I make no conclusions and offer only my perceptions of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am just curious to see if someone would be able to clarify what it can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First i thought it might have been a spotlight...but it was not in the shape or lit as much as a spotlight and there was not a beam coming from below. It was like a flying cloud of light circling the sky. It was VERY eerie, almost like an angel or somthing. I look up at the sky many times at night, and this almost hypnotised me but spooked me at the smae time. It was NOT a spot light, and it&#39;s circle like distance it flew was not vast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was Fireworks due to them falling but, shortly after the lights started moving straight up, then side ways then back down at a rate of speed not known to us. We were approx. 15miles east of boulder and were watching this from Saw Hill Ponds at 1:00am. Shortly after the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was over but, then to the north sky about 65degrees above earth horizon by the north star, the formation started again. With extremely bright lights, making very strange formations and then disappearing.

The lights suddenly disappeared and reappeared over the foothills again but at 65degree incline from us as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: Clear night, no clouds, no wind.<n>

They appear to be stars, but they move around. They fly straight at times and other times in lurching motions. They can be dim in light or very bright--brighter than the stars. We saw 30 in an hour on the first night. I tried to video tape them, but my video camera wouldn&#39;t pick them up. On the second night, we counted 40 in two hours and they didn&#39;t seem to stop, they just kept on coming across the sky. We did notice an anomaly with the sightings. We could almost predict when one was coming because it became very still, there would be no breeze, then we would hear a slight &#34;whoosh&#34; sound and a falling star would fall. Then a few more would come across the sky. The secound night I caught a split second of one on my video camera because it was so bright that it was blinding if you looked at it. We even saw one change course to chase a plane in the sky. This was a very strange thing for us to witness, we felt like we where being invaded and will probably see more tonight. Maybe these are just sattelites, but we dont think that is the case. We also see 2-3 white cigar shaped objects during the day, that appear to be incorperated into the seeding programs in our area. We don&#39;t know what they are, but hopfully others are seeing them in kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

All were stationary!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 9, 2007, I witnessed 5 objects flashing/strobing/oscillating a red light, with steady green and white lights while the object was being quite stationary.  I could not make out the shapes of the objects due to distance (or maybe because they may not have been very large), but through binoculars I could defintely see the activity of the described lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, there was only one object (as described above.) That was at 21:45.  By 0100 a.m. on May 10, there had appeared four more objects, each quite stationary and flashing/strobing red, with steady green and white lights while the objects were collectively quite stationary.  All five objects were in a triangulated pattern covering about a 5-mile area in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were defintely NOT aircraft of any known type.  Even though there was air traffic coming and going from Charoltte-Douglas Airport (some 30 miles away; I live under an existing flight pattern), it was impossible to mistake these five objects as being normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main aspect of these objects was that they did not move!  At whatever altitude they were at, they did not move!!  But, again, there was no mistaking these objects for normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, with minimal interference from earlier rain clouds that had passed through.  Normal air traffic was discernable from these objects.  Stars were clearly visible.  Temperature was about 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (As an aside - while I was looking at the first red/green/white object, at around 22:15 through binoculars, I distinctly saw and visually tracked [for about 5 seconds] a greyish rectangular object passing through the heavens. I say &#34;the heavens&#34; because that object was definitely outside our atmosphere and passing at maybe 200 miles up. I have seen the space shuttle three times [and even once when it was connected to the space station] as it passed over my area and I knew that the altitude of the shuttle was 200+ miles above me.  When watching this sixth object [just by chance] I had the disctinct feeling that it was at least as high as the shuttle would have been. And that means that this sixth object, to have been visible to me even through binoculars, had to have been a VERY large object.  Rate of speed of this sixth object was half again faster than that of what the shuttle&#39;s speed normally is when in orbit (meaning, this sixth object was moving at 17,500++ mph.) There was NO mistaking this sixth object for space junk, a satellite, the space station or anything other than a VERY large rectangular machine moving from West-to-East at a high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, it was quite a night.  Thanks!<n>

My friend remarked how clear the Big Dipper was.  A few minutes later a bright white light almost directly overhead caught my eye.  It may have flashed just as it grabbed my attention.  Initially it resembled a star or bright planet.  It was stationary at first and faded to a pinpoint of light, after which it began to move south at about the speed of a commercial airliner.  I watched it until my house blocked the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in the Shenandoah Valley which is the path of flights out of Dulles and National Airport in Washington DC.  Every evening there are dozens of commercial aircraft that fly over my house.  I can hear a jet right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light that I saw did not come from the eastern sky over the mountains.  It just appeared, faded and flew south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that the initial light was similar to that of a helicopter spotlight.  This light appeared to be at least 30,000 feet in the sky, not low like a helicopter.  There was no sound except the sound of the commercial airliners coming across the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not resemble a meteor at all.  The meteors we see cross the sky from east to west generally and are a split second flash.  This light had no characteristics of a meteor other than being a white light.

At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but as it fell, the image grew larger and brighter, and changed to orange on one side and yellow on the other. My next thought was a small craft like a Cessna was diving downward. I thought it was descending too fast to be a small aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the glowing colors disappeared, leaving what I thought was a faint trail of smoke. I then thought it must have been a meteor, so close its point of contact would be somewhere on the foothills above, near my home. As I drove 4 miles up my hill, I was looking for smoke or any evidence of impact. I saw none, but was positive what I had seen was too vivid to have been a shooting star or a reflection from my car windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving home my first question to my family was if they had felt anything like an earthquake or sensation of an impact. They had not. Convinced what I had seen was something of unusual significance I went out to my deck to look for a glow in the sky or smoke rising from the horizon. Through a few trees across part of our homes lakefront, I saw a burning pile of embers on the ground. Rationalizing it as burning pile of timber, a coincidence, I was unable to dismiss the possibility that I was observing the site of a meteor landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up your phone number and called to ask if you had received other reports of this sighting. The contact informed that there was one other dramatic report from West Seattle. I called a neighbor who agreed to search the area, and they excitedly told me that a Canadian radio station they were listening to reported a call from Vancouver of a Green glowing mass seen shooting across the sky. To my embarrassment, our search resulted in the discovery of the smoldering embers of a neighbors timber burn pile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a disappointing coincidence, but did not change the impression that what I saw was of greater significance that for now would remain unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a homeowner and Father of two sons. I have mid level college education, a Manager with 20 years of experience in my field, no history of  mental illness or indications of instability, respected by family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and have never experienced nor reported any event of this type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not have been the only person in this area to have seen this, and expect to learn of other witnesses in time. This was not a UFO, but I believe I what I saw was probably a meteor, and possibly further away from my proximity than it appeared to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope others will confirm my experience with reports of their own.<n>

The planes looked like they were from the navy. The planes were red, white, and blue. I ran downstairs to tell my mother what I saw. She then ran upstairs to see. Once she went back downstairs a bright yellow light filled up the sky from my backyard! The next day I told people what I saw. No one believed me accept my friend and my mom.

However, my wife pointed out that the object was rapidly cycling through at least three colors: white, red, and green. The color cycle was not like that of an airplane or helicopter as it did not blink;  it was a fast swirling cycle that appeared to rotate clockwise over and over again.  Also, the object did not move at all in any direction, so it could not be an airplane. The chances of it being a hovering helicopter seemed slim since it did not move up or down or side to side for over an hour of observing it. The object was too high in the sky and too far away to be a light tower of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to get a better look, but the quality of the pair I was using was poor and all the best I could really make out was a bit of a closer look at the cycling of colors. They were moving very fast as I said, and I believe I could see some blue in addition to the red, green and white. I know nothing of UFOs – only what I&#39;ve seen on the Discovery channel, but this is certainly the first time I’ve ever seen anything in the sky that I did not immediately recognize. I hope I’m not the only one who has reported seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star?? PD))<n>

Using 205 to 84 west. I was driving east to west. I saw two strange things happen. As I was driving on 205 i looked out my driver&#39;s window and saw a bright blue ball flash across the sky, like a shooting star. The stars in the sky were like grains of sand compared to this blue ball. The ball left a white light trail as it moved. I only saw it for a second, and it vanished. i know it wasn&#39;t a shooting star because i have seen many of those, in fact one of my friends thinks i&#39;m good luck because i see them so often. Because I was so surprised at what i saw, i called my girlfriend to tell her. she didn&#39;t believe me. i looked towards pdx airport to see if i could have possibly mistaken a plane as the blue flash of light with a white light trail. I saw a plane landing and new that it couldn&#39;t have been a plane. the blue ball that flew across the sky was WAY to fast to be a plane that we know about and it was way to close and huge to be a shooting star. the second object was totally different from the first, it was a large white sphere. I saw it when I looked towards the airport. my first reaction was &#34;okay now that&#39;s a plane,&#34; because the light was white, not blue. I looked over again and it was just hovering over near mt. tabor. I told my girlfriend on the phone about it, but she told me that i should ignore it and it isn&#39;t any of my business, which i actually thought was a weird thing for someone to say to me. i told her &#34;it is my business, it&#39;s in my sky.&#34; as i continued to drive i kept my eye as much as i could on this white ball... it began moving as i connected to 84 west. the ball moved up, and started going the same direction i was going, it would raise then get lower, then it crossed over 84 to my left side. originally it was on my right. it then flew back to the right side of the freeway and lowered as if it were headed in the direction of grant highschool. I didn&#39;t see it for a about 15 more seconds. eventuall! y it ros e up again and flew at incredible speed towards NW portland, right near montgomerey park. by now my girlfriend was getting angry with me, and kept telling me that it wasn&#39;t my business. that&#39;s when i decided i needed to get off the phone with me. she hung up mad and angry, didn&#39;t say &#34;i love you,&#34; which always means she&#39;s mad. i don&#39;t know what upset her though. well the sphere hovered over NW portland for a while and that was the last i saw of it. i had then driven out of sight of the area and the big white light. i don&#39;t what the heck went on tonight. i don&#39;t know for a fact that these were UFOs, but whatever i saw scared the crap out of me. i was sweating buckets, but my arms still had goosebumps. I am still shaken and honestly feel a little crazy. i know that this seems unbelievable, and it is. I can&#39;t even believe what i saw, but i KNOW what i saw. I was high, drunk or taking any medication. i am a college senior and to see something like this and know that if i tell anyone they will think i&#39;m nuts, makes me feel crazy. i know it sounds crazy, but this really happened. i wish it hadn&#39;t because i can&#39;t understand it. i have no answers as to what i saw. all i know is what i saw. i am not making one part of this story up, i just wish someone else was in my car to see it. hopefully someone will report the same thing, and i won&#39;t feel so crazy. thank you for your time, and i don&#39;t know if this will help in anyway, but hopefully it does.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were standing by the train station platform talking while waiting for the train to come in around 11:15pm to dispatch customers.  Then suddenly my co-worker started looking hard at something in the night sky that caught his eye.  I recognized him looking up at something so I turned around and looked up myself.  We both saw a super bright light above us less than 100 stories high almost skidding to a halt or vibrating back and forth momentarily.  Then as we both looked up very hard together, it took off streaking across the night sky visibly noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my evaluation this was probably a invisible space craft that wanted to exposed a super bight light to the both of us letting us know that they were above us.  The size of this super bright light was like the size of a basketball.  When I looked up it must of been hovering above us for who knows how long.  By this craft exposing their super bright light above us as we were observing, it then took off.  The whole experience was about 20 to 30 seconds long.  The night was 100% visibly clear.  The weather was about 70 degrees.  This super bight light was easily noticable to the naked eye.<n>

I looked up and above me and heading south, very low in the sky, was a brilliant white, cigar-shaped object.   It appeared to be rather thick in size, about an inch to an inch-and-a-half in width and the length of my arm.  On the end of it was a circular ball-like shape that seemed to go from a violet to blue to red and then it just went poof; it disappeared.  It actually looked like a lollipop but the stick would be very thick.  It was very clear out and there were many planes in the area, including orange in color which I have never noticed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we crossed the bridge, we noticed a very bright light, which we first assumed was an aircraft.  We realized it couldn&#39;t have been an airplane due to the fact that it hadn&#39;t moved.  It was a very bright, constant, white light.  The object then turned from white to red, became brighter, and illuminated the sky surrounding it.  The object then appeared to &#34;shoot&#34; off into the horizon, far faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be hovering to the northwest of the Portland Jetport, most likely over Westbrook or Gorham.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Thinking this was just a little odd to be just a plane, I then took a second look.  It was moving slow and I was waiting for a better view (a tree was blocking my view).  I immediately thought this was peculiar because first, the lights were not blinking, as you would expect to view on a plane, second, the lights appeared much larger than lights are seen on a plane.  The lights were white (the same color hue as headlights on a car (not bright white but more whitish-yellow but still very bright), they were in a completely straight horizontal row.  I assume the lights were on one object as I could not be sure due to the night sky.  In addition, I would like to note that there was no apparent noise from the object as you would expect to hear from a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, this is what startled me most.  As I left the parking lot, I was traveling south and noticed the lights were now traveling in the same direction at great speed.  I stopped my car to view and noticed the lights were now traveling vertically but still in the same southern direction as I first noticed and then suddenly out of view.  (out of view perhaps from the intense speed).  I never saw a plane travel that fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home and immediately explained what I saw to my husband.  Whether this was a UFO or just a plane, it was definitely an odd experience and hope it can be explained.  I am wondering if anyone else in the area viewed the same lights.<n>

It don&#39;t believe it was a plane as there were no wings and it was too short.  There were no lights or contrail.  It was also too high to be a helicopter and there was no propeller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to visually follow the path of the disk which had disappeared within seconds.  Strangely, the plane to the left which had previously left a contrail was also gone with no remnants of the contrail.  If there had been any cloud cover whatsoever, I would have just assumed that the plane took off above the clouds and that the disk shaped object was aircraft as it would have been obscured by the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, thought I&#39;d report and see if anyone else saw this that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I reside in the Bronx, New York all my life but I travel often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this afternoon I drove my car to pick up my older brother who was at my mothers house. As I was waiting in front of the building facing a westerly direction I was looking up in the sky before me. It was a beautiful bright sunny day and there were only a few clouds in the sky. As I looked upward I noticed a round object floating high up in the sky. It was far above the the highest planes because where I live Laguardia airport is right over the East River and many planes are taking off and landing. Planes that are just flying through must stay way up there about 30,000 feet. This object must have been as high as 60,000 feet. As I looked at it it appeared as if it had just stopped moving upward. I stared at it. It was light bluish, silverish, whiteish in color. It was two colored in that hew. It seemed to be fading into the background sky. And within a minute it faded away from view. Later that night a friend from the neighborhood told me that he was calling me on the cell phone because he had also spotted it that afternoon. He said it was movuing upward and them stopped. He has seen UFO&#39;s twice before.  Go figure. I believe in them myself. It was amazing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The first time I noticed these lights, there was only one light. At first it appeared to be an ordinary star. The longer I observed it the more I began to notice the irregularities. The first oddity I noticed was that the “star” was blinking. Secondly, it was moving rapidly in the sky, back and forth. I jokingly called it my ufo and continued to try to find it at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, although I had no explanation for its peculiar appearance, I had no reason to believe that it could be anything but a star. After about 5-6 months or observation, I started to notice more of these strange stars. Again I assumed that there was a scientific and rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5-8-2007, I happened to see these blinking lights in the sky again. There were at least three of them. Most significantly, these lights had started to change colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if I believe in aliens and ufos or not. I would however like to know your opinion on the events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

On May 7th, these events seemed to have hit a climax.  There were 20 plus blinkers, all seeming far away, except for one that hung very low in the sky and did not blink, but when a picture was taken with a digital camera, it seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.  To the naked eye, it just looked like a huge white star, just above the treeline.  It&#39;s brightness made it suspect, so that is when we got out the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blinkers flashed blue and white and there were some that flashed with a bit of red.  We noticed several other aircraft (small planes and helicopters) constantly intercepting their path.  The blinkers did not move when confronted.  The blinkers did move somewhat, but almost like they were in their own little orbit.  Several zoomed in pictures of the blinkers appeared to be a circular craft with 6 lights and one in the center. Each consecutive picture of one blinker showed a different light on the craft lit up, as if rotating lights.  I am interested to see what happens next, over the past month, there have been more and more blinkers present, and last night was really unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

They hovered in the same spot for about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband called me outside to at first look at a star that seemed to be rapidly changing colors.  The colors were blue, green, white and red.  The red would flicker or kind of pulsate then change rapidly to different colors.  I looked a little further North, and I saw another one doing the same exact thing.  However, this one looked much further away.  We went in the house and up to the 2nd floor to get a better view.  We could see it for a while, the closer one seemed to slowly drop lower and lower towards the ground.  We watch it get and closer and closer to trees, (could be due to the distance though) After about 5 minutes we could not see it anymore.  Then in the same area where we saw it, a helicopter with a search light flew over the area.  I though about calling 911 to report it, but then I felt silly.  After the helicopter was gone, we looked North again to see the other one...and it was gone too.  I do not know if it disappeared or flew away because I was trying to see what the helicopter was doing. Maybe someone else reported it. But we definitely saw something and it was not a star or an airplane.  Both objects were too far away for us to describe a shape or anything more detailed.  My husband and I own a credit repair agency and are self employed.  We just typed on google where to report a possible UFO sighting, and this website came up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then saw something far more remarkable toward the south, about midway up in the sky from the horizon. It was much smaller and not at all as bright, but it was distinctly flashing. At first, we took it to be a plane, but we quickly realized that it was completely stationary. What on Earth could do that? 	We looked at it through binoculars, and still could not figure it out. The lights were flashing very rapidly, with a blue one on one side and a red one on the other that alternated. Both were backed by a white light that did not seem to flash. Since it was so far away, we could not make out any real shape to it, though it seemed to me to be a bit narrow, like a grain of rice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to photograph it, but my camera is not good enough to pick up stars at all, let alone odd flashing things. At 10:20 PM, it was still out there in the exact same place. At 11:00, we checked again, and saw that it had moved far above and west of its previous position. Its lights were now flashing on a diagonal instead of being horizontally oriented toward the ground. The surrounding stars had not moved as much. It was hard to tell, but it seemed to be moving very gradually continuing in the same direction in which it had moved before. It is probably still out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is highly uncharacteristic for any of us to go staring at the sky here (light pollution makes stargazing unfeasible), and we only did so because Venus was so irresistably bright. My brother in particular is a very pragmatic person and normally scoffs at anything fantastical, yet he stood out there watching this object longest of all. This is absolutely the first time any of us has ever seen anything inexplicable in the night sky, and we are not particularly interested in UFOs. I have never even heard the others mention them. However, we are now very interested in this one! Even if it turns out to be nothing, we hope to somehow find out more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/7/07 20:10|Kansas City|MO|Other|45 minutes|Bright lights seen in Western sky moving very slowly from SW to NE.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56612.html|243|ndxe200705| Bright lights seen in Western sky moving very slowly from SW to NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday night at 20:10 I went out on my deck for a minute and I spotted three bright lights in the Western sky.  There was one light on the left and another slightly lower and to the right and the third was directly right of the second.  At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on.  The object was almost stationary.  I watched it for a total of 45 minutes and in that time it moved extremely slowly from SW to NE and descended at an angle.  The object passed behind a tree and as it was emerging from behind the tree the lights went out and I did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday night I was in the kitchen at approximately 20:10 and looked out my window and saw the same lights.  I got my digital camera and tried taking pictures using the RAW format.  The object moved in an almost identical flight path as the night before but this time the lights did not go out and after an hour it disappeared below the tree line on the horizon.  The light never changed in intensity or position the whole time they were visible.  They did appear to be coming toward to some degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never any sound or apparent turns.  It moved in a straight line path from high left at sighting down at about a 30-45 degree angle until it went below the horizon at lower right.  The pictures I got only show a light and not all three.  A large tree provides a reference point to show angle of travel.  The lights were seen by two other witnesses, my wife and my neighbor who is a local fireman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served 8 years in the US Air Force &amp; US Army and was a police officer for 6 years.  I have not seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/7/07 19:10|Tauranga (New Zealand)|||2 minutes|date: 5th May 2007 time: 7pm  I have just seen a large flying object/ship/??? of some sort.I was driving home across the back road|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56555.html|244|ndxe200705| date: 5th May 2007 time: 7pm  I have just seen a large flying object/ship/??? of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home across the back road between Rotorua and Tauranga, up over the mainly bush clad hills near the summit. This thing dropped down (rapidly) from above (my left-hand side, approx 20 degrees to west of north) and stopped completely still about 1km up (judging from the angle with the ground, I&#39;m still not entirely sure about its distance away from me) . It sat there stopped for about 30 seconds ( it was not getting any closer or moving directly towards or away from me, it just sat there with constant size) then started to move very slowly towards the east (my right hand side) it moved far too slowly to be any aircraft. I stopped the car and turned the lights/radio and everything off, I just did not want to get any closer to it. It was directly in front of me. I thought of reversing but didn&#39;t want to make a sound or any movement to attract attention. It blotted out the stars behind it as it moved (approx 10-20 degrees of my field of vision). It moved in a snake trail path for about a minute and appeared to alter altitude slightly upwards then back down again. It had external red and blue lights and it turned away (swiveled/rotated anticlockwise) to face away from me before moving away.  I am still not sure of its shape as it had red and blue lights/glowing on the bottom and some light around the edge/upper section, the lights on the bottom trailing edge partially disappeared as the upper ones appeared, but the top part blotted out the stars behind as though it had a very large and tall bulge on top, so I am assuming it had a far greater profile width wise than height (ratio wise) as it turned/leaned/sloped slightly in the movement  . When it finally left it flew off very rapidly towards the northeast/north-north east, and appeared to drop down closer to the ground in a hurry.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds, the air was still and cold, town is 30-35 km away, down hill and more to the right of this thing so its not a reflection on warm/cold air as the angles are all wrong. And reflections don&#39;t blot out the stars behind, and then swivel to hide lights underneath and display others up top, while blotting out stars with body structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many 747&#39;s taking off/landing from Auckland airport , and coming in for landing over the suburbs when I go up there to see my sister, I have seen them by both day and night and this thing was definitely MUCH bigger than a 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left I got the heck out of there. On the way further down the road approx 4-5 minutes later an airplane ( turbo prop, passenger carrier, size approx 20-30, seater,  all lights on and blinking away flew overhead, approx 2 km away and  on my right hand side. Going in to land at Tauranga airport) The plane is tiny even as close as it is, compared to the thing   I have just gotten home and think it is actually appropriate for me to now send this to you folk... normally I would never say anything about something like this as I am a complete skeptic, this thing has rattled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will supply a contact through a third party that I know I can trust and whom through I can be reached but I wish to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone tell me what is going on... these things are overwhelming. How can they do that.  I mean this thing was colossal and it just sat there, then left like a fighter on tripple  afterburners with absolutely no sound, or trail or smell or vibration or anything...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was out in my backyard and I happened to look up. Relatively far away, I saw a white object. I dismissed it as a plane, but suddenly realized it was circular. It was moving slowly, and crossed the sky a little bit. It appeared to move down but then went upward. Then it disappeared up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near LaGuardia Airport, and have for a long time. I can tell the difference between a plane and anything else. At the angle in which the object rose, it was opposite the airports, also including JFK. It rose too sharply to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure if the object was a UFO or a balloon. Right after I saw it, I went to my computer. I checked to see where balloons pop. It said they pop at 30,000 feet. http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/howpop.html was my reference website. That seemed too low for where my object was flying. The object also seemed far away, so far that I don’t think I’d be able to it if it was a balloon, due to its sizing.<n>

It was 4:00 am and was awakened by my baby’s cry. I woke up and sat to feed my baby and when I look at my window I saw a very big bright light that looks like a star. I noticed it because it was too big and to near to be a star. The UFO was hovering in a stationary position above a school field, when suddenly the bright light changed to sequential lights and started to move slowly towards my building. It seems like it knew that someone has seen them. Maybe because of my baby’s cry. It didn’t gave any noise and as it move above the bldg. I saw the shape as triangular and there was a red light at the one end of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> managed to take a photo using my handphone but the photo showed only a small white spot on a black background. I was in a hurry to take the photo and forgot to use the zoom lens in my handphone.<n>
5/7/07 00:10|Atlantic Ocean||Light|45 seconds|two orange lights seen over the Atlantic Ocean|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56771.html|249|ndxe200705| two orange lights seen over the Atlantic Ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO SIGHTING   Sighting Date: May 7, 2007 Sighting Time: 00:10 – 00:15 AM (approx) Sighting Location: Atlantic Ocean, Aprox 80 Miles SE of New York City Aboard the Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines “Liberty of the Seas”  I had just left a show which ended about 12:10 AM (00:10).  Knowing it was dark out I stepped out on the starboard side deck just to see what I could (often seeing lights of other ships in the distance in these conditions.)  I presume the sky was hazy or partly cloudy as I could see only a few brighter stars.  The moon was not visible from my vantage point (I do not know its phase or position on the date.)  The horizon was very faintly visible as a just marginally brighter line above the sea.  There were no visible lights on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know the heading of the ship but according to the passenger update log it would probably be somewhere between 110 Degrees and 70 Degrees.  The ship had sailed toward the southeast and then turned towards the north.  The sighting occurred at about the point where the turn was (to be) made.  No land lights were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three stars/lights did slightly stand out as they formed a triangle with two of the lights in a roughly horizontal line with the third lower and to the right.  The separation of the top two lights was roughly 1 degree.  The third light was roughly 2 degrees to the lower right.  I am estimating these distances by mental reference to the size of a full moon – one half subtended degree.  The center of this triangle was about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and about 45 degrees to the rear of the direction of travel of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at these three lights for about 10 seconds, I perceived that the upper left and lower right lights were faintly orange in color while the upper right one was white.  The white one was a clear point, as would be expected when viewing a star, and as other stars visible at the time appeared.  The two orange lights appeared slightly fuzzy.  Focusing my attention to these orange lights I noticed that they actually appeared brighter in the center with areas to the sides that appeared to “flutter” and very rapidly change intensity from dim to almost as bright as the center.  This total width of light was no more than one quarter degree.  This same “fluttering” effect was not visible above or below the center of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first notion was that they appeared to be helicopters, in that you can see a center mass and perceive the rotor as a “fluttering” change in intensity to the sides.  This is a description of the appearance only; there was no sound and there were no navigation or marker lights, and helicopters probably wouldn’t be glowing orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the three lights in position for no more than 10 seconds total, the two orange lights began moving to the left, relative to the white point star which did not move.  The few other white point stars visible did not move either (the ship was not turning.)  Over a total period of around 30 seconds that these orange lights moved, the top one moved roughly horizontally to a position roughly 45 degrees to the front of the ship.  During that movement it did dip slightly in apparent altitude when it was about 90 degrees off the side of the ship.  The other light also moved at the same time as the first but its movement was independent of the first.  It first moved slightly down and to the left, then rose slightly and then continued horizontally to the left.  When it was almost 90 degrees to the side of the ship it dipped slightly and then rose to the same height as the first light.  It “followed” the first light for a second of two and then dropped slightly, all the while moving to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When these lights both reached the position approximately 45 degrees to the front of the ship they both faded out and I lost further sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To reiterate, I could not tell the exact atmospheric conditions during this sighting but there were maybe 25 visible stars in my field of vision.  These were white sharp points of light that did not move relative to the ship or to each other during the time I saw the orange lights, which did move both relative to the visible stars and to each other.  Although they did move together and at the same time, the movement of the orange lights varied in speed and in altitude relative to each other, the other visible stars and to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were stationary for about 10 seconds and moved for about 30 seconds before disappearing.  The lower of the two lights moved a greater distance than the top one and therefore moved faster as they both started moving at the same time and disappeared from view at the same time with about the same distance separation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Age: 67, no health problems Vision acuity: 20/20 corrected with glasses, no colorblindness or astigmatism Physical condition at time of sighting: tired but relaxed Mental condition at time of sighting: no conflicts; finished one drink ½ hour prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside air temperature/humidity: approx 55 degrees/unknown Ship speed/air speed: approx 18 knots/unknown<n>
5/7/07 00:00|Albany|OR|Triangle|4-5 seconds|We saw something unusual and unforgetable along the river in Albany, Oregon|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59339.html|250|ndxe200705| We saw something unusual and unforgetable along the river in Albany, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 5/7/07 somewhere around 12:30 a.m. PST my friend and I were looking at stars down along the Willamette River in Albany, Or across from Bryant Park- we were just S. of Takena Landing and were on the Western side of the river...we both agreed the next falling star would appear directly due S. of us, he thought it would fall from the East and I thought it would fall from the W...I had just turned my head back to look at the S.W. part of the sky after we had both made our predictions when he said, &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we see a U.F.O!  I&#39;ve always wanted to see a u.f.o&#34; and I said, &#34;yea!  me, too!&#34; and all of a sudden, not even a half minute later, he started yelling, &#34;DO YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU SEE THAT?!&#34; so I turned my head to the E. where he was pointing and way up high in the sky I could see what appeared to be a HUGE, rectangular shape that was so wide it encompassed the width of 4 stars which were directly above the shape- I could see it changing from translucence in to a more opaque coloration and as I watched I could see what appeared to be 4 windows or panels take shape on it&#39;s side...it was IMMENSE and practically invisible, it moved like one would think of a balloon moving in a summer breeze late at night...it made absolutely no noise whatsoever and made me think it could have been made of the finest silken threads or polymer fabrics...We saw it for a total of about 5 seconds at most, as it was extremely FAST and out of our view in no time at all; it appeared to follow the course of the river, heading North...My friend said that when he first saw it he saw a triangle shape emerging from the area of sky we had agreed we&#39;d see the next falling star at, but what he saw was a triangle shape so totally translucent he could see stars through it, then he saw it make a turn N.E. and that&#39;s when I saw it...He thinks we saw a stealth bomber that was emerging from &#34;cloak&#34;...he thinks there IS such a thing as a total &#34;cloak&#34; now that goes beyond being hidden from radar, but we also feel t! hat in o rder for the thing to be SO HUGE and SO SILENT and SO FAST!!! it must have been a u.f.o....it was an absolutely amzing phenomenon we will never forget!  I realise now that for us to have thought there would be something special happening from that part of the sky there had to have been a subtle discoloration both our eyes were able to see, but which was so subtle we weren&#39;t aware of it- I think now it was like that part of the sky was lighter, as if a flash from a camera had lightened it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was about 10:30 at night and me and my mother were on our way home from a close relatives house. We neared our house when we noticed a strange rectangular object floating in place. It had an extremely brigght strobing light and it appeared to be silver against the night sky. The strange thing i noticed was that the object had no sound. We stopped for a moment when i noyiced what appeared to be an airforce jet below it. The jet was obviously examining the object. As we pulled into the driveway, I ran to the front of the house just in time to see the object shoot up into the clouds with a streak of red and green light as if in a sci-fi movie and the airforce jet attempt to follow it. The total time the object was in the sky is 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was very high- but so large that I could see the colored paint with the naked eye. Knowing that the flight pattern usually has a few planes in a row, I got out my binoculars so we could see the next one up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we lay in the grass waiting for the next aircraft, we were looking at the clouds, and watching for birds. I raised the binoculars, and within a second or two saw an object much higher than both the previous plane, and the planes I usually see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a silver ball and was either stationary or moving very slowly in a small area of the sky. I strained to see it without the aid of the binoc’s. It was completely unobservable. I put the lenses back up, and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I went next door to my mother’s house, and she came out to see. She could not see it, even with the binoculars. (She is blind in one eye, and has difficulty with lenses) Again, I tried to find it in the sky, and it was STILL there! But it was no longer spherical in appearance; it had changed to a rocket shape. It had what appeared to be tail fins, and was pointing upward. (Still not moving much if at all) I lowered the binoc’s again, for discussion, and when I raised them again a few seconds later the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the evening I noticed that my satellite radio was not receiving as well as usual- with both electronic sounds coming thru (beeps and blips) as well as difficulty receiving the signal.

5/6/07 15:30|New York City (Queens)|NY|Oval|45 mins|Brilliant white orbs, similiar to stars, in the sky over Queens, New York.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56822.html|256|ndxe200705| Brilliant white orbs, similiar to stars, in the sky over Queens, New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened at 2:30 in the afternoon in a brilliant blue sky.  I was walking along Queens blvd.  and noticed a man walking towards me and staring directly upward toward the sky.  This seemed odd to me because the man was transfixed on what he was looking at.  Ofcourse this peeked my interest, so I looked at what he was staring at too.  At first I did not see what he was looking at, but then the object caught my eye.  There was not a cloud in the sky. Im not sure if it was supposed to be a full moon that night, but the moon , atleast 80% full was out at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I just so happened to be wearing sunglasses.  If I hadn&#39;t had them on I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see this oval shaped ufo.  It was a brilliant white &#34;orb&#34; about as high in the sky as a visible planet or north star. Both of which I thought this to be.  Just as I was about to continue my walk and right this off as a star, it moved.  It moved left to right a very short distance.  I couldn&#39;t have been a plane.  It couldn&#39;t have been a helicoper. It couldn&#39;t have been a balloon.  I stood there and tried to convince myself that this was something that I could explain easily.  And then from the Northwest came from nowhere, three more.  Directly north of the first object came two more.  In total there were six.  All the same size color, shape and brightness.  Now I was freaked.  What the hell was I looking at?  It was such a bright, sunny day that I could&#39;t get anyone else to stop and witness what I was looking at.   The man that originally was the reason I stopped in the first place had gone.  The objects that came from the northwest moved slowly towards the first object almost forming a triangle formation.  The two from the north were just slowly downward almost as if they were on strings.  Almost as quickly as they appeared, five of them vanished upward as if pulled straight up on strings.  The original orb never left the sky.  I stood there for about 45 mins and then headed home.  When all six orbs were in ! the sky at the same time, they reminded me of what skydivers falling together to make a formation might look like.  The only problem is that these objects never fell to earth as skydivers must eventually do.   So there you have it, my first ufo sighting.  Its official.  I am the most skeptical person I know.  Im one of those &#34;see it to believe it&#34; people.  Now i&#39;ve seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/6/07 12:35|Kalamazoo|MI|Cone|10 minutes|A slightly conical black UFO hovered for roughly 10 minutes over Kalamazoo, Michigan.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56546.html|257|ndxe200705| A slightly conical black UFO hovered for roughly 10 minutes over Kalamazoo, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The slightly conical, black or dark colored craft was hovering to the east of my house in direct view of the kitchen sky light that faces east. At first I thought it was something on the window so I moved my head from side to side and found that it was actually something in the sky. It hovered for about two minutes and maybe for longer but I ran to yell for my parents to come see it. After they came down I couldn&#39;t find it again until it started moving east at a slow speed, getting smaller and less conical in shape. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t changing shape but because it was farther away it was harder to see it. My parents were able to see it  for a few minutes while it was drifting east. I grabbed a pair of binoculars and ran outside to get a closer look but was unable to find it with the binoculars and focus them to see it clearly. A minute or two later it passed behind my neighbors&#39; trees and I was no longer able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

5/6/07 12:30|Waldorf|MD|Cigar|5 min|Hovering cigar shaped object.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56632.html|258|ndxe200705| Hovering cigar shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work on Sunday 5/6/07 at 12:30 PM.  I was on the back road between Prince Frederick and Waldorf Maryland.  As I entered a new road (Cederville) I saw what appeared to be an airplane coming in for a landing just above the tree tops. (This is what my mind first said it was.)  As I drove towards it I noticed that it was not moving in any way, not forward or backward or even away or closer to me.  At this point I pull off of the road and shut off my trucks engine.  My windows were open and I could hear no sound of engines at all.  I sat there looking at this UFO and could not make sense of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached for the phone and called my friend and was talking to his wife about it.  As I looked at the object closely I could not see any wings and it looked like a cigar shaped sliver metal fuselage.  I could even see some detail on the surface.  I could see the sun sunning on the surface of the silver metal.  It had a darker area at one end that was a little larger then the rest of the lines of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 1 ½ inches long if the ruler was held at arms length.  As I was talking to my friend wife the object started to move off to the North very slowly and started to come lower and lower.  It went below the tree level but I still could see it on and off as it passed throw the trees.  This is one gage as to how far away the object was.  I would say that it was not very far into the tree line because of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I drove around to the other side of the tree line and found nothing.  There are fields on ether side of this tree stand.  I drove next to a church that is in sight of the fields and asked if there is any airfield close to there.  I was told there was none.  I was traveling northwest and the object was seen south of Washington DC. in the Maryland county of Charales.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What is that?”  My eyes followed his pointed finger reaching east above the Hellgate Canyon.  In a joking manner he then asked, “Is that a black hole?  What could that be?”  I saw white lines cutting through the atmosphere in a parabolic shape.  The trail only lasted a few seconds before it completely vanished from the top down.   The trail was about two-thirds longer than the bottom portion and was most interesting to watch as it faded into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing appeared to be a very large object burning up while entering earth’s atmosphere.  We watched it with a few other onlookers until it disappeared behind Mt. Sentinel.   Comments were made in jest about a meteor.  It was too large to be an aircraft, but a meteor would have explained what we all witnessed.  The whole scene could have been extracted from a sci-fi movie with the exception that it was a warm morning and I could feel the sun warm my blood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remembering that I intentionally left my camera at a friend’s house the night before, I telephoned her immediately to see if she had seen the object too.  She didn’t answer.  My other friends and I parted ways noting how odd it was to have seen that occurrence in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the afternoon, I heard a report about an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale just east of Dillon, Montana.  Dillon is east and a bit south east of Missoula right above where the &#39;meteor&#39; was entering the atmosphere.  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007ccay.php  Excited and amazed, I immediately called my fellow observer who directed my attention towards the thing in the sky to learn that he had already heard the report and hesitated to call me for fear of sounding ridiculous.  We both concluded that the Tuesday morning’s earthquake was caused by whatever object we saw falling into our atmosphere and crashing into the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the story of my Tuesday 8 May 2007 morning coffee at Bernice’s Bakery, while watching a meteor be pulled into the earth’s atmosphere and feeling its impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Meteors are not visible for 5 minutes.

I seen an object that looked like either a falling star or a satelite traveling in an eastern direction.

It then dissapered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw the object in a large patch of blue (most of the sky was dark except for the patch I was looking at).  It was not terribly high in the sky.  First saw the object a short distance after entering the freeway from the Walker Boulevard on ramp, southbound.  The object seemed to be just sitting there, seemingly not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down as I drove, to determine whether it might be moving, or whether it appeared to be standing still simply because I was in motion.  Slowing the car down didn’t make a difference.  The object continued to maintain its position. The object looked like a triangle, seen head on (that is, a triangle flat on its belly, with the tip facing front). Very bright lights:  brighter than I’ve seen on any jet. One very bright light in the front, two others forming a V-formation on either side, but rather closer to each other than far apart. Also, another bright light strobing, but I could not tell its exact location. It occurred to me that it could be a delta wing flyer I’ve heard about from time-to-time. As I took the exit ramp onto Denny Blvd., I lost sight of the object. I tried to exit to a high place to keep observing it, but I was no longer facing in the proper direction to see it.<n>

I saw it around 4-5 minutes and then it lower and lower and disappeared. At that time there was sunny sky, the temperature is around 60 F’ and there was so many people in Park. I think the witness is only one Indian guy and I. However the number of witness could be more because there was very clear sky. I don’t understand why not much people talk about it at that time. I thought it was a toy floating around. After it disappeared from my eye sight, I realized that this is not a toy because it is impossible for the toy to goes that height around 60 floors tall. It is black and it shape like circle. The size is small. I think may be 2-3 kids (5-7 years old) can fit in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is a very compelling clip for myself, i have allways belived in UFO&#39;s but not fully until now . I have reviewed the clip many times and it is in NO way shape or form a Airplane , Bird , Ballon , or anythging else you could possible try to call it! I would like some information on who to get this clip out to without having trouble and I would also like to make some money off it.

He shouted very surprisingly,&#34;Oh! What a plane&#34;! But after watching it carefully we doubted that it&#39;s not an aircraft as it was not making any noise. Also, it was not moving. So many peoples of the road gathered. All were shouting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one man from crowd told that it might be a UFO. It was nearly 2 km from us. But though it seemed very big; neraly the size of airbus A380.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it began changing colours from drak metallic brown to metallic blue. As it changed to the blue colour;six cigar shaped objects came very fastly from behind. Then they started moving slowly. And within 10 seconds they produced a harsh humming sound that like an aircraft has blasted. Then they were out of sight,that we could not estimate their speed! I think their speed must be same as the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She was using her cell phone to video tape them. She turned the phone around to videotape herself and that is when she caught the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until that night when she was showing her dad and myself the video that we saw the UFO. She paused the video allowing us to see the short stemmed mushroom shaped object. It was all black. It apparently did not make any noise since they had not noticed it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/5/07 13:00|South Kingstown|RI|Other|5 minutes|Unmarked helicopter|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57767.html|268|ndxe200705| Unmarked helicopter<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this date, while walking on a nature trail in the Great Swamp Management Area, a state wildlife area, my girlfriend and I noticed the loud noise of a helicopter engine.  We looked up to see a UH-1 on a low flight path. As we watched it the helicopter changed its flight course from due south directly toward us, southwest. It flew over the power lines and osprey nesting poles to right over us, about 300ft above us, and hovered.  The noise was disturbing, to us, and to the wildlife there abouts.  I was angry at first, then a bit intimidated, as, upon viewing the craft through my binoculars, getting a very close look, I noticed there were absolutely no markings on this very dark green UH-1, only 3 white strobe lights, one on the top, one on the bottom, and one on the tail rotor.  No other lights or markings were on it. The cockpit windows were closed and blacked out so no one could see the pilots inside.  The doors were all closed.  Since we were alone on this trail with no one else in sight it was a bit intimidating to say the least.  After a couple of minutes where we felt we were being observed, the &#34;huey&#34; flew away in a northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt puzzled as well as angry about this incident, so I contacted my Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI.  I sent him an email on that same day asking him to find out who was piloting this chopper and why there were no markings on it.  On July 19th, 2007, I received a written letter from Sen. Reed informing me that he had contacted Maj.Gen. Bray of the RI National Guard and that the general&#39;s letter to him was enclosed.  Also, that if I had any more questions regarding this incident to contact David Foehr at his RI office.  I read the response letter from Gen. Bray to Sen. Reed.  It was vague, saying that on that weekend three UH-60 (no UH-1s) helicopters were dispatched to Indiantown Gap Military Reservation in PA for training.  He also stated that the Army Aviation Support Facility at Quonset Point in N.Kingstown, the home of the Air wing of the Guard, &#34;did not recieve any inquiries concerning operations conducted during the period of May 4-6, 2007.&#34;  What that meant I have no idea...again, vague.  He went on to state that the RI National Guard conducts flight operations on a routine basis within RI and that the UH-1 and UH-60 helicopters that they use are &#34;affixed with U.S. Army markings.&#34;  Therefore, this rouge unmarked UH-1  was not from the RI Army National Guard.  Then, the question is, where did it come from and why did it fly where and in the manner seen by me and my girlfriend? I called back to Sen. Reed&#39;s office in RI and spoke with one his male office people.  I explained the reason for my call.  He became nervous, and said, please hold on, I am transfering your call to Washinton, D.C.  After several minutes an official sounding man answered the phone without giving his name and wanted to know what I wanted.  I had already given my name and address to the RI office.  I asked who he was and he would only say his name was &#34;Kevin&#34; and did not want to give me his last name.  He said he worked for Sen. Reed.  I explained the reason for my call again to him.  He told, rather non-sensically, to call Maj.Gen. Bray directly and ask him about this UH-1.  I said Sen Reed has already gotten a written response from the General, of which I have a copy, so why am I asked to call the General myself.  Again, he was vague, but said it would be quicker if I called the General myself, assuming the General would even talk to me.  He implied that maybe this time I would get a direct answer since Sen. Reed&#39;s new inquiry would take time.  I laughed to myself, said, &#34;ok&#34; and hung up.  I did not have Gen. Bray&#39;s phone number but the number for a contact person, LTC Habersham of the RI Air National Guard, would be the one to talk to.  Apparently, Gen. Bray and Sen. Reed want to distance themselves from any prying questions.  Why all this secrecy, I ask myself.  I call LTC Habersham yesterday, July 19, 2007.  A message on his machine said he was away on TDY training in PA and would not be back for a week.  He left his cell phone to call him. I did, left a message as to who I was and why I was calling.  A while later, when I did not have my phone near me, he did indeed call me back, saying that he would call me when he got back from TDY as he was very busy at this time.  Fair enough.  That&#39;s where this incident lies at this time.  Whether there is any connection  to the secrecy, as I perceive it, to the silent, gliding UFO I witnessed fly over the Jamestown Bridge and hover over the Nat&#39;l Guard HQ at Quo! nset Poi nt last month (reported to NUFORC) I don&#39;t know.  Thought you might be interested. By the way, I am a Vietnam Army combat vet who has flown on the &#34;hueys&#34; and have never seen one without military or some kind of markings/insignia.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Kind of made a letter &#34;C&#34; shape upwards then disappeared.) It could have been a shooting star, but I have never seen a star shoot up. (And I&#39;ve seen a lot of shooting stars.)

I am a trained weather spotter of 20 years and was atop on of the higher hills in the area watching a front moving through to the south and east of my location. At the moment of this incident there was about 50% cloud cover and a significant storm in progress to the south and east. While looking to the west and south I noticed a bright light which I assumed to be collision lights. After about 2 minutes the light had gained speed and lowered its altitude. Assuming I correctly identified landmarks it flew past it was possibly 4 miles out. The object moved to an alitude of tree level no more than 60 feet off the ground following the contours of the pasture directly west of my position. At this point I gauged the approximate diameter of this object at 50 yards. The object had a fixed but irregular shape, resembling in my mind a fried egg. There was a semblance of a dome atop the object. This object was luminescent; best described as mother of pearl. The object made no noise, neitther in motion or stationary. The object stopped about 100 or so yards short of SW 100th Street. There appeared to be a small unlit object in the creekbed below the object. There was movement, but I could only see movement with the occasional lighting from the southeast. If I had to guess it appeared to be something that looked like a jack in the box toy. A square object with a long curving appendage and what looked like a ice cream scoop atop the appendage. Although the lighting was poor I could discern it  moving about the area, but it was difficult to see if the object was on the ground, on wheels, or otherwise. This event happened in about 5 minutes time. The object then rose up to approx. 200 feet (?) There was a shrill sound from the pasture (sounded like nails on chalkboard) and was an uncomfortble sensation. The object moved away slowly at first and seemed to gain speed as it moved off to the north and then back west again. I was ! admitedl y frightened and left the area immediately. Even crossing washed out roads in flood waters, so as to not turn back towards the area of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Went to get binoculars and a minute later the light was gone.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56531.html|274|ndxe200705| Strange orange light seen south of Madera.  Went to get binoculars and a minute later the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:30 pm I had arrived at my home when I noticed a bright orange light in the eastern part of the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds to see if it was stationary or was moving.  It was not making any noise, but what attracted me to it was the brightness of it.  When I discerned it was stationary I went back to my car (50&#39; from where I noticed the light) to fetch my binoculars to get a better view of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to where I orginally was at the time when I saw the light, it was gone.  I had not notice any flash or hear any sounds that may have been of a departing craft.  I did notice two seperate sets of aircraft lights that were farther in the distance, but they were flying in opposite directions and all I could see of them was a red light (but I could hear their engines).  I doubt the orange light was a star or planet as it was the brighest object in the sky and was at least 75% brighter then the next brighest object (which is either Venus or Jupitor, I&#39;m not sure, which ever is in the western part of the sky at this time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did go back outside about twenty minutes later to see if the light had maybe returned.  At this time the moon had risen and I noticed a star or planet to the upper left of the moon.  This was not the same object, but I felt I should note this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched the light for about 10 minutes when we noticed that it was getting smaller and dimmer. Planes were flying by the object, and it was obvious that no plane could have hovered like that. It was moving but too slowly for the object to have been man-made, seeming to defy the laws of gravity. Occationally the light appeared to change colors, but mainly it was a bright white light. We watched the object for a good hour before it got smaller and smaller, and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

A bright orange glow just hovering in the sky to us it looked to us about the size of a coin. I drive a truck at night and I am fimiliar with chinese laterns, metor falls and such so it was unusual. After the time lapsed it shot off from a hovering position to great speed to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend I was with at the time has a job high up in local government and I broke into conversation about the event only to be told abruptly,  I dont want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some months later the same thing was caught on a mobile camera in the same town it was on the local news (Shirebrook ufo) and it could still be on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If  I could add a few other events around the same time the dates a fuzzy because I wittnessed two other events in the same time, a few months part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the above I was coming home from the local pizza house around 5pm Febuary sunset and as per usual in England it was overcast grey skys I was looking up for some reason don’t know why but there was a break in the clouds in that break was what I can only describe as two missshapen Z very bright glowing pink hovering in a semetrical position I sat on a wall watched them till the clouds covered them, then went home. Never seen anything like it before or after. Could be explained by flares used by the millitary but I think not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the above in the summer I took out the binocillors to look at chem trails in the sky and seen a object with straight edges and ends, high up in the sky at what height Im unsure but I would suggest the same as a plane would travel 30,000ft but if that’s correct the object would have had great length but only the width of a 737 the length would have been x10 of a 737 after watching the object for some time quite some time because my arms started to ache I just shook my head and went in the house and told the wife. For that time in my life it just seemed the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saddly as I mentioned I drive a truck at night my window screen is 7.5ft in length about 4ft high Ive seen nothing in the last 4 years apart from metor showers and shooting stars, chinese laterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53 years old next birthday and quite accomplished in life own properites and comfortable with all aspects of it, My explanation for these events is the state of mind I was researching most of what Alex Jones talks about on his show and it took me down a rabbit hole and to topics which ranges from ancient civilations to secret societies and much more, all I craved for was knowledge I felt enlightened and wanted more like a drug addict would want there next fix. Sceptics would argue that yes it was my state of mind, a over active imagination but saddly its not, I want to be a sceptic but I can not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in Beaver Dam which is just outside Fredericton, NB.   I was looking in the general direction of Oromocto from there.   Just above the tree line I saw what at first glance I thought was just another plane.  The longer I looked at it the more I realized that it was not a plane.  The colored flashing of the lights were completely random.  They had no pattern to them like a normal plane.  The next thing I noticed was that it was barely moving.  During the 10 minutes that it was visable it only moved slightly from my right to left.  Then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called CFB Gagetown in the morning to see if they were doing any exercises or could explain the lights and they said there were no exercises and they had no planes or helicopters out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sighting was also observed by my 26 year old son.  We were standing in a downtown parking lot (near Shea&#39;s Theater) when I spotted the bright star Arcturus in the eastern sky. As I looked at the star I noted a small (smaller than the star) object emitting dim, non-blinking orange light moving toward and somewhat above Arcturus from the south (my right) heading north.  At first I thought it must be a very distant aircraft, but its later behavior negated that assumption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this first object moved past the star, I noticed a second, identical object following behind the first, and moving just below Arcturus.  Once past the star, the top object (first one sighted) seemed to slow while the second object caught up with it.  They moved close to one another – and then completely reversed course, now moving south (toward my right).  As they did so, the bottom object engaged in a rapid up-down zig-zag pattern, which removed all doubt that these things were ordinary aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects then flew off together, maintaining a constant separation, and appeared to circle around the city to the south, west, and then north.  We were passengers in a car with other people so finally had to quit our observations before the objects disappeared.  Again, these were tiny (compared to most visible stars), dim reddish or orange lights.  We could not make out any shapes beyond that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a PhD professor, geologist and planetary scientist.  I teach college astronomy courses and have been avidly observing the skies for over 50 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound was heard other than the helicopter. Im convinced the helicopter was investigating these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were pure white and they seem to be doing some sort of gymnastics or acrobatics in the sky.

I said no and she proceeded to show me an object in the sky. Most would think a star, but this had no sparkle whatsoever and absolutely no flashing lights. Using my finger for a reference I could see the object was indeed in motion heading west at a decent speed. She told me to listen to 640 am, and I made my way home. I went back outside to look again when I saw this object with the same light consistency, but a much slower pace.  It seemed to be in constant motion vertically, but slightly changed back and forth left to right.

5/2/07 22:45|Davis|CA|Circle|25 minutes|Saw a phasing orange/blue circular light , later saw a similar light at a different location in the sky|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56519.html|291|ndxe200705| Saw a phasing orange/blue circular light , later saw a similar light at a different location in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I had plans to go out and use his old telescope to check out the full moon and stars.  After he picked me up, we drove to a spot in west Davis, off of a road surrounded by empty fields, somewhere to get away from the city lights.  We really were not that far out, maybe half a mile to a mile from decently lighted areas, but it was the best we could find on the spot.  We arrived at the scene, just off of a two way road at about 10:30 PM.  After spending about 10-15 minutes setting up the telescope, we quickly were able to find and focus in on the moon.  The view was very clean and clear, filling most of the viewfinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After enjoying the moon for a few minutes, we decided to search for stars.  We turned the telescope the other way, facing north-west.  As my friend tried to focus in on a star at about 10:50 or earlier, I noticed a orange-blue/green light that seemed to be phasing from colored to not visible, or in and out of light, about every 1-2 seconds.  It was brighter than a star, and seemed to be at airplane altitude.  I could not tell how far away it was.  For this reason, I quickly dismissed it as an airplane.  As my friend continued to search for a star for a bit, I tried to figure out the light again.  By this time, the light had not significantly moved in any direction, and appeared stationary to me.  The light was still phasing.  I told my friend to stop bothering with the telescope, and to just look at the light with his naked eye.  We began discussing what it could be.  By now we had both agreed that it was not an airplane because it was not moving significantly, and that it was not a star, because it was a phasing orange blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had him focus in on it with the telescope.  It didn’t take long before we found it, and it appeared to look like a ball of orange with a blue aura around the edges.  Also, it seemed to change colors between orange and blue/green  The image was probably less than half the size of what the moon looked on the same telescope, from the same spot.  The oddest part of the object was that the insides of the ball seemed to have little dots and random patterns in them.  When I first noticed, I was instantly reminded of biology videos you see in school, with the cells being looked at from under a microscope with the little dots inside the cells moving around.  It was all very odd.  We could see the ball seemed to change colors from orange to blue/green and combinations of orange/blue.  Both me, and my friend were very confused and didn’t understand what it could be.  We also noticed with our naked eyes that the light seemed to be moving a bit.  We were pretty sure that it was not an eye trick, but the object seemed to move side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10-15 minutes of watching the object, it began to slowly disappear in a short span of about 10 seconds.  As it continued to phase, it slowly became dimmer, and was gone.  It might have been that the light got further away from us, or that it just stopped being visible.  We did not know what the case was.  This was at 11:06 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:14 PM, we saw another light with similar characteristics to the first one, however, it was much closer to the horizon, and must have been at a much farther distance, because the light was very small compared to the old one.  The light appeared to have a more orange/red color and had much more slight back and forth wavy motions to it.  Even under the telescope, the light was a spec compared to the other light.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 1/8th of the size of the other light that we had through the telescope just minutes before.  We could not see any of the cell type characteristics on the telescope, because the light was just a tiny orange colored dot on it.  We were not sure if this light had any correlation to the previous one, but we did not rule it out, because this one had appeared to us out of nowhere.  At about 11:26, we noticed the light was getting dimmer, until after about 20 seconds we could not see the light anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We might have dismissed these lights as something random, but after seeing the craters on the moon so clearly, then seeing the ball of light behaving so oddly and appearing so different, we knew it was not something wrong with our eyes or the telescope.  Something was definitely different here, but what it was, we don’t know.  Please feel free to contact me, I am very curious as to what this might have been.<n>

I noticed three separate sets of light in the sky and I thought how strange, they looked as if they were converging to what seemed to be the same point in the sky. I just assumed it was airplanes on their flight path to the local airport. I looked away for a few moments paying attention to my Mothers conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back up to the sky I was dumbfounded. The three objects had formed a triangle in the sky and  it was then I noticed that they themselves where triangle shaped. It was then also that I noticed that the lights were red and white. Only a few at the top of the object, but along the bottom of the object it was well lit. I immediately called for my husband to come join me. He looked up at the sky and said, WOW! We watched them standing stable in the sky for a good five minutes. I was telling my Mother what we were seeing . So in a way she was a witness to it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband works in the airline industry  and we were discussing how no aircraft he knew of could do this. Then two of the objects broke off, became perfectly aligned with one another and starting moving off to the west.. The third one hovered for a few more moments and starting moving over to the left of our house. It came back to the same spot it had left and while my husband and I were watching it just disappeared. We just looked at one another and said again, WOW.  I finished my conversation with my Mother. AND I have been looking in the skies ever since!<n>

On May 2, 2007, at 21:35 EST I noticed a star to the northwest sparkling brightly in many colors.  I lined it up in the frame of my screened porch and expected it to move like an aircraft or satellite would do.  It was a third of the way up between the horizon and straight up.  West of the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not the brightest star out but twinkled rapidly.  Not like other stars out that night. It did not move. After five minutes I got two binoculars and my 10X zoom Minolta digital camera and got a clear look outside the screen enclosure. The camera will do digital zoom to 40x.  The videos are .MOV format and good quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few pictures and videos with the camera.  The videos came out good. One photo is great showing the string of red, blue, green and yellow colors clearly.  It is a string as there is a time laps of a second.  Nothing I know of makes color shifts like that all within one second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After fifteen minutes I called my neighbors and they saw it too.   At 22:25 EST it became unviewable as clouds came by.  I checked again at 22:55 and the sky was clear but it was gone. I am an ex military aviator and a good photographer and think this was an unusual long term sighting which lasted almost an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD))<n>

It was solid orange, almost amber, in color, bright in intensity and with no flashing lights.  It did not leave a &#34;tail or trail&#34; like meteors do and I didn&#39;t hear any sound. I can’t approximate the altitude but know for sure that is was flying lower and much faster than a jet or airplane. It was traveling from west to east in a straight path. I tried to follow its path after it passed over my second story roof but by the time I got to a position where I should be able to see it, it was simply gone. The sky was incredibly clear. I am an amateur astronomer and practice nightly observation of the skies. This isn’t the first time I have observed an unusual object. In the last year I have witnessed four objects. Two, including this one, that were the orange/amber color and flying vertically. Two that were silver and cylindrical rather than oval and flying horizontally. All were flying at a low altitude.<n>

It&#39;s around 8pm and I thought, I was looking at a star but, I use a pair of binoculars(20x50)- I&#39;m on the 10th floor. To the northwest, I see an object that looked like a satellite but, the object stopped right above Ground zero right next to the millenium hotel on chambers street. As I looked using my binoculars, there wasn&#39;t any sound or tail section(what helicopters have); it was more rectangular-bottle shaped and there were 4 flashing red lights in sequence on both sides, one blue light on each side &amp; either a reflection of white light(non-blinking) on the rest of the object. The object would go suddenly go straight up, then down as well as fly left to right instantly without tilting. After, 1 hour &amp; 57 minutes the object went northwest again, the lights started to fade. The other objects(non-blinking white lights)being I counted 5 surrouding another object shaped in a perfect triangle with white non-blinking lights on each corner of the object. There was a foggish haze around all the objects except the 1 flashing object near the world trade center. As, I checked again visually &amp; the use of the binoculars around 10pm eastern time, all the objects aren&#39;t there at all.<n>

There was a like humming noise but different, the air was still and place was cold the sky was clear and I could see the stars. I could only see the lights but when it moved a past where I was hiding I could see the back of the object. It looked like a satellite dish used to pick up state-light television with the poles still attached where the lights were and was moving slowly in its sides. The back looked grey/red-brown. The then just moved so fast away is seconds. Was scared out of my pants, still I am. First gighting and I dont go around looking for these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw several flying lights heading from north to south<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 22:00 hrs on May 1, 2007, I saw through the window of a bedroom on the second floor of my house an intense light in the air at a half-mile distance. The light was so intense by far several times the light of any star. The object was also a short distance from the surface of the ground. The light went up straight vertically, diminished its intensity and moved to the left from north to south and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the local fire station is located in that direction and about the same distance I thought that the object might be a helicopter, however I was curious and decided to investigate some more. Immediately I grabbed my car and went to the fire station to see what was going on. My sister was with me in my car. When we reached the fire station, one of the garage doors was open and the truck was in there and nobody around. We passed the fire station when I saw the light again, this time farther out to the right of the road heading from north to south.  I decided to drive in its direction to get closer and make sure it was a helicopter. The light disappeared when I entered one of the streets on the right. We went out of those streets and went back to the road heading east for about two minutes when we saw the light again this time it was to our left like a half mile away and in the air. I don’t think it was the same object since the previous one we saw disappeared to the right of the road and this last one appeared on the left of the road heading from north to south. The flying object crossed in front of us from the left to the right of the road and dissappeared going from north to south. We tried to follow it, making a right in an intersection where was about to the point the object disappeared but we couldn’t see it. Then, we started to head back home going from south to north for about two more minutes when I saw again another light in the air. It looked like an helicopter in the distance because of its movement. It was flying slowly from north to south relatively close to the ground, so I was sure it couldn’t be a plane. Its light was not intense. I reached an intersection and stopped because of a red light of a traffic light, while the object was heading to from North to South while I was facing South to North. The object was coming to my direction in the air. At that moment I remembered I had binoculars in the glove compartment of my car and I grabbed them and give them to my sister, it turns out that! she did n’t know how to use them. Since the car was stopped she pulled down the window and took her head out and looked up and saw the lights of the object and introduced her head back into the car. I immediately took the binoculars out of her and pulled down the window of my side and took my head out of the car completely and used the binoculars to see the object. At that moment the object was right on my head a short distance from the ground, probably a four or five-block distance from the ground. I looked at the object using the binoculars and saw the chasis of a spaceship, the shape was triangular and flat. It had lights on the base, but those lights were not intense at all, but they shined enough to light the base of the chasis and I could saw the frame of the spaceship clearly,  not only the frame but all the flat metal part of the space ship which was lighted by the round light sources on the chasis. Those lights were no intense at all. They were just lighted spots one next to the other one covering almost the total area of the triangular chasis. I had never seen anything like that before in my whole life.  Since I was stopped by the red light I did all these things very quickly and only could see the bottom part or chasis of the flying object for a quick second. But because it was flying slowly close to the ground and I was using binoculars I could see it clearly. Also I realized that it did not make any sound. It was just flying slowly and quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the traffic light changed to green I decided to follow the flying object to see it again, but U-turns were forbidden at that intersection and I had to turn to the left. While driving in the new road I stopped in the middle part of the road between the lanes and made a U turn and in the same interception where I saw the object I made a right turn to head in the same direction the flying object was flying but I could not see it anymore. Then we returned home. I particularly do not think these lights belonged to the same flying object, since all of them were moving from north to  south, I actually see in total four flying lights heading each time from north to south, but only in the last one I could see it using my binoculars and determine that it was not a helicopter or any plane.<n>

A full moon was in the east. A bright kelly green light suddenly appeared in the sky somewhat above my vehicle. It shown brightly for a few seconds, then suddenly a smaller bright white light appeared just for a second, then both lights were out. There were no clouds for the lights to disappear into which left me wondering where it came from or the direction, but nothing else to be seen.  With a full moon, the visibility was very good but saw nothing else except these lights.  A year or two ago, I had reported seeing two very large bright white lights close to this same area.<n>

We sat looking out the window for it to happen again and we noticed a orb of light coming up out of the trees and then it dissappeared, this happened three times.  Later on we watched the news nothing was reported.  We could see a police car and several trucks with spotlights in the area.<n>

A large UFO pushed through the clouds and was slowly going directly over me as my friend ran and hid he was yelling at me to get out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was extremely detailed circle shaped object with lights zipping all over the underneath in patterns and in the center was a bright red circle light that also emitted a faint red glow down in a beam type shape.  The red center beam had a capsule shaped container looking object that slowly descended from the craft, but as it descended it also seemed to fade away out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seem to remember it had a sort of slight rumbling sound to it but my friend thought it was silent.  I just stood there in shock and fixated on the immense size and detail of this craft.  I can&#39;t say how large it was but I just remember it was directly over me and as I looked up it took up all of my vision of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember watching it leave and my friend does not either.  We both don&#39;t understand how we could be so fixated on watching this object then not even bother to watch it go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing we knew we were walking back on the trail and immediately from the woods I heard these loud sounds which sounded like heavy equipment digging and then I heard distinct leaping and landing stomp sounds through the brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly these two red glowing eyes were staring right at us on the edge of the woods in thick brush and we heard a growl that we both have never heard anything like this before.  It was the most terrifying growl I have ever heard (like something from a movie we both described it.) and we both immediately ran down the trail away from this creature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

This ufo was not seen by anyone but was captured by the digital camera. The dates were not set on the camera and ARE incorrect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see any objects in the sky at the time, but in a split-second it was detected by the camera only. It appears that there may be a second object flying next to it, or perhaps in is part of one object as a whole (?)  It could be circular shaped, but due to the angle it appears oval shaped. There are small wavy ridges that make up the shape of the body.  We don&#39;t have much information about it since we could not see it flying in the sky, but it is definitely visible in the photograph and we truly believe it is not an &#34;accident&#34; with the camera. There was no dust in the lense, and no one&#39;s finger was blocking the view. My mother took this picture and had taken a series of photos of the landscape, one after the other in a few moments time, and this strange object was captured immediately after she had been clicking away at the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than that, there was no strange noises in the area. We were the only ones there. There were no planes or other earthly objects in the sky at the time.

Between lightning flashes the trucker said he caught a good look of a dark grey triangular shape. He said the craft was almost right on the hiway that he was shocked by the sight of it so he decided not to stop. The craft was a wide as three telephone poles with the outer edges thinner than the hump of where a cockpit would be in the middle but it looked too strange to him. He also observed a large glowing reddish light underneath the middle of the craft. The trucker says he drives this route to work daily every week and there&#39;s only cattle in those fields. A Missouri Investigator Group (UFOMIG) member investigated this report and located the exact spot where the craft was reported seen using Mapquest.com aerial map its the pasture on the north side of Hwy 54 just west of Hwy 43 intersection and the fourth farmstead west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However I will leave this report in case anyone else in Brooklyn or Northern New Jersey saw something similar early may or late april and have been wondering about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 3 am I saw towards the SW at around 30degree above flat ground a very large stationary moon like object. It was not the moon, and much larger. This was through my living room window. I gawked at this sight for a few seconds, moved a few feet left and right to see if the object was a reflection off my window, It did&#39;nt move. I am certain that this object was real and outside my window.  It was the size of a large Grapefruit held a couple of feet away from my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to get my Binoculars from a closet for 5 second and then when I reentered my living room it was gone--vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most likely explanation was that someone was shining a huge searchlight towards a new building that was located in same direction  1 1/2 blocks away. This flat concrete surface most likely would light up in a circle to resemble this &#34; faux moon&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However in examining this sight in daylight I had the impression that the &#34;faux moon&#34; was higher on the horizon, but perhaps I misjudged this. Also I find it strange that someone would be shining a huge search light which would have needed to cover the surface of old fashion outdoor movie screen at a new building at 3am in the morning. There was no police acitivity like helicopters in the area at the time, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. But this is New York and strange human things do occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Huashan, China, that materialized, turned into rays of light, and disappeared into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occur during a trip to China in may 2007 visiting the sacred taoist mountain Huashan near the city of Xian.  It is said that this place is where more Chinese achieved spiritual mastery than all others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed at the mountain&#39;s peak in the monastery where the monks lived.  I am a somewhat advanced chi energy practitioner although I was less skilled back then.  I woke up at 2 am and walked to the top of the east peak.  Once there i was inspired to shine my flashlight 3 times at the big dipper and Orion&#39;s Belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 3rd flash what appeared to be a shooting star shoot across the sky.  Cool but no big deal sort of interesting timing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, same time, I was up meditating on the same mountain but a different location. I want to add there was Chinese military all around this place I could hear what sounded like explosions in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the conclusion of my practice I looked up and a huge ship surrounded by golden light just appeared from nowhere.  It materialized.  It was very distinct, not a small dot!  It had many spires or fuel salages pointing forward and glided slowly with no sound.  Hard to tell how high (not very though) or big but there where many tips as I said pointing forward and it appeared quite sophisticated.  It was not round or a saucer and it traveled in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was filled with awe and cried out holy _hit!  Suddenly it turned into rays of light of all colors that stretched across the sky and vanished without a sound.  The most amazing thing I have ever seen.  Not dots of light this was a craft of intelligent design period.<n>

I noticed it was shooting little white particles from it to the other white dot. After seeing this shooting event, I basically started having a small panic attack.

I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane because it was just a solid light that was moving incredibly fast, even though it was really far away. The pair of lights slowly moved to the left over time; I watched them for over 2 hours before I became too tired and fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the final moments of me watching the lights, I noticed there were 2 more. The four lights formed a diamond pattern in the sky, and the bottom corner one started moving around at incredible speeds, in strange circles and just left + right. It appeared to be dodging the white lights that were shooting out of the other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that during the 2 hour event, there were two different planes that kept circling the area, over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background info:  I am a 19 year old sophomore in college, my little brother who also saw these UFO&#39;s is 12 years old, and my little sister is 11 years old.  We all saw the lights and were basically terrified at what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking a picture with my cell phone camera but the lights were so dim the camera would not even pick it up on the screen.  The objects were in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was about 10 miles away, although I later realised it was approximately 40 miles from us. At first, I thought it was the size of a [Boeing] 737.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;But it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was. It could have been as much as a mile wide.&#34; Continuing his approach to Guernsey, Bowyer then spied a &#34;second identical object further to the west&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said: &#34;It was exactly the same but looked smaller because it was further away. It was closer to Guernsey. I can&#39;t explain it. This was clearly visual for about nine minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I&#39;m certainly not saying that it was something of another world. All I&#39;m saying is that I have never seen anything like it before in all my years of flying.&#34; The sightings were confirmed by passengers Kate and John Russell. John, 74, said: &#34;I saw an orange light. It was like an elongated oval.&#34; The sightings were also confirmed by an unnamed pilot with the Blue Islands airline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Civil Aviation Authority safety notice states that a Tri-Lander aircraft flying close to Alderney spotted the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Certain parts of the report have not been published. I cannot say why,&#34; said a senior CAA source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this year, however, the MOD declared its intentions to open its UFO files to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
