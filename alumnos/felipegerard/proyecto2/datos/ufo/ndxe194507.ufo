My mother and I were sitting on our back steps in the shade, very hot.  This ball moved all over the sky at many different speeds, some so very fast it would temporarily disappear.  It would hover for a few minutes and then move in straight lines or circles or combinations.  We watched for two or three hours until we tired of it.  We never discussed this with anyone and I thought no more of it until many years later.  At that time we had never heard of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
