Suddenly, the craft stopped abruptly and started in the opposite direction and accelerated about 8-9 the speed of the jet that it was following at the time I first saw it. It reached a point where it just blinked out and disappeared. This was 45-minutes after the space shuttle crossed over simi valley in its path to Edwards. It was not a bird and it was metallic and reflected the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the helicopter flew past I noticed what I thought was a large swept-wing aircraft flying south to north. It was much further away than the helo, at a much higher altitude. It was also moving south to north. As I began to concentrate on it, it became clear it was not a single aircraft. It was a formation of maybe ten to twelve white or shiny objects. The edges of the objects were not clearly defined,but appeared to be round or oval in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the formation moved to the north it began to change shapes. The objects would form a line and then transition to a circular formation and back to a v-type formation. I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but based on the perceived distance from my location(maybe one mile), they were moving too fast. The formation began to move in slightly different directions, even stopping at one point.  The changes of direction were not drastic, but certainly enough for me to notice. The objects moved in a very &#34;mechanical&#34; fashion in that the movements were smooth yet deliberate (if that makes sense).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were clear and sunny except for some faint remnants of morning fog.  I eventually lost sight of the formation in a low-lying cloud north of my home.  I tried to point out the formation to my wife, but she could not see it.  My sixteen year old step-son saw it and referred to it as a &#34;silver line&#34;, but he did not say anything until I mentioned it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a nearly twelve year law enforcement officer and I&#39;ve seen some strange things over the years, but nothing that struck me like this.<n>

Then i zoomed in on it with a camera and found that it was actually flashing blue green and red. This could not have been a plane because of the time it spent in the same spot, only moving slightly in erratic motions.  I then looked through binoculars and saw that it was actually 2 lights very close togather.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just above the clouds and when the clouds passed it couldn&#39;t be seen, returning when the clouds came back over head.  Looks like what could best be described as whitish headlight beams but facing outward at all times as if something was rotating.  I continued to watch for about 10 minutes and it didn&#39;t move at all from the spot where it originally was (like as if rotating towards something) but stayed circling the same exact spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second time seeing something like this, but the first time (about a month or so ago) it was about 15 miles north of here.  Like now, I had stepped out to get a cigarette and it was just circling just above the clouds right next door to the north of my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure on duration, as with both instances the phenomenon had already started when I stepped out and was still continuing when I had to go inside.  I am a star gazer, so I frequently watch the sky and would definitely notice if this occurred more often.<n>

First off it was about 10:15-10:25 on November 29, 2008 when I seen this diamond and or saucer shaped black spacecraft.  It had a green light at one side a red one at the immediate opposite and an amber light on the bottom with a amber an red flashing one on what looked like the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it it was headed south really slow and looked like it was gradually lowering.  Then when I pulled off the road it started to head north but the lights were still where they were at first, as if it didn’t even turn around.  So I went to my parents house down the road where I was headed anyway but when I got them to come outside it wasn’t in sight from there house and that’s where it ended.  But when I saw it moving it was way too slow to be a plane and there was no noise like a helicopter, but way too small to be a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know why either but I feel so terrified when I start to think about the thing I saw but I get a feeling that it was something threatening .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading my report I hope it helps solve what I seen that night.<n>

It was far away, but it seemed to be lowering...I don&#39;t know if this was some kind of toy, but ity looked real, and too large to be a toy...about the size of two cars.<n>

For about two months now we have seen objects in the southern, eastern skies.  These objects would move radically not accustom to known aircraft.  It has been seen that when a plane or jet would be heading in the same direction, the object(light) would go stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the plane or jet had passed the light(object) would continue its radical movements.  It is unknown how far these objects are away, but far enough that there is no way to determine the shape or how big the object is.  The only description is like looking at a star.  Sometimes the lights change colors.   The flight pattern (?) of these objects is from side to side, up and down and diagonally and some times in circles.  If looking in the sky, possibly do to the distance factor, the objects move the approximate length of a foot in the sky.  Also the object is always bright, no flickering as a plane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect stars or planets.  PD))<n>

There was no sound coming from these lights and they were certainly not birds and did not appear to be flares.

Because it was very dark and rainy, I was travelling around 45 mph.  I noticed an extremely bright light that appeared to be emitting from a glass office building on the south side of the highway.  It was so bright that I had to squint, and I assumed it to be some sort of spotlight affixed to one of the lower floors of the building.  The light began to flash arhythmically then stayed illuminated and moved rapidly and diagnonally from the lower left side of the building to the upper right side of the building, then it flew toward the west (the opposite direction I was travelling), zooming very quickly directly over my vehicle, perhaps 8-10 stories above the ground.  Entire sighting lasted only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My radio was turned off because my daughter was asleep in the car, and I heard no sounds coming from the object and saw no propellers or wings.  It was not a large object, perhaps the size of a basketball. Immediately after, a street lamp in front of the building extinguished.<n>

I was sitting near the window (about one foot away) and facing the window.  All of the sudden I saw a rectangular shaped light fly from directly above my head from the roof to a tree in my backyard.  The light was about six inches wide and nearly one foot long.  The roof was about twelve to fifteen feet tall.  The light moved in a straight line from the roof to the tree (about thirty feet).  It moved about sixty feet in about one second.  I looked up in the tree to see if anything was there.  I did not have a clue what it was.  At first I thought it might have been a white owl or bird although there are not many in my part of the town.  This is because I live in a suburban area.  I did not see the light up in the tree after that.  About fifteen minutes later I saw the same exact light from the same spot zoom into the tree.  Then, unlike the first time I saw the light, this time the light went from one branch over to the next parallel to the ground.  A few seconds after that it went from that branch to a lower branch about two feet beneath it.  From there the light seemed to squiggle down to the ground.  When it hit the ground it immediately bounded twice away from my house and towards the road behind my house.  Each bound was about forty-five feet in length.  Once the light had bounded away from my house it seemed to disappear after it hit the ground on the second time.  It landed in a part of our garden where we had rocks as our landscaping.  I never saw the light resting there and I never saw it move from that spot again.  At this point I was pretty sure that it was not any type of animal that I have ever heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was cold and it was a really clear night.  I looked through some trees and a light in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was just a plane, or even a helicopter based on it&#39;s movements, but then I kept watching it because it was moving so sporadically.  I told my friend to look at it as well.  He thought it was odd and noted it didn&#39;t seem to be a regular plane because there were not the typical lights, such as the strobe.  We got the third person with us to come outside and look at it as well and he was just as shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in ways typical planes don&#39;t.  It would travel across the sky slowly, then zip ahead faster and take a nose dive quickly and sharp turns.  There appeared to be two lights on it, one blue, one red. A red color for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to tell just what the shape of it was because it was a few miles away no doubt.  But it appeared to almost be rectangular, or to have some type of wings across similar to a normal plane I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew around for more then five minutes at least, then disappeared for five, then came back for probably five more minutes.   Our buddy did manage to get some video of it and a photo, but it looks like any other UFO footage caught on tape...a blurry little light moving about that&#39;s hard to make out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, we&#39;ve never seen anything like it in our lives.   We jumped in our car to try and find the place it was at, which was over the Grand River in between Grand Haven and Spring Lake.<n>

I was told to point them towards a plane, then I heard my fiance say whats that, just as something flashed across the lenses...  I was able to follow it and with the binoculars I witnessed 5 diamond shape objects flying in unison like a flock of birds, but there was no wings and the shapes were whites grey  almost opaque.  No lights flashing, thats why I&#39;m still hesitant about spreading the word...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been birds??  It was almost as if they were connected because the way they maneuvered, the space between them did not get larger or smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost them through the binoculars and when I put them down they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very weird object indeed!<n>

I watched as this blueish hue of light turned red for a quick moment, then back to blue, changed directions on a dime and took off with a flash. It was moving east from the ocean towards the mountains/city and then it turned 90 degrees and moved out of the sky on a southbound trajectory. Amazing sight.

The object left a &#39;check-mark&#39; shaped light trail, and disappeared in the vicinity of where it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the sighting was only about two to three seconds, but we are both positive of what we saw.

The video was taken with a surveillance camera.  My husband and I were outside at the time and we did not hear any plane or helicopter in the sky.  No clouds were present in the sky at the time the video of the strange object was taken.  The two objects dissappear and move north abruptly in the sky.  They have no tail like a comet or shooting star, but do have sparks that are only present went it moves in the horizontal position.<n>

My girlfriend and I decided to go for a little ride after I picked her up at work.  We first spotted the two lights on Peters Creek Rd. in Jefferson Hills.  I noticed the lights because I frequent the area and had never before seen lights in the area.  The lights first appeared in front of the car, off in the not-so-distant sky.  They were evenly spaced, one on top of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance the two lights looked as if they were on a tower of some type, but there was no tower in the area. I decided to try and get a closer look, so I started heading south on Gill Hall Rd.  As I crossed the Allegheny/Washington County line, we were on top of a high hill.  The two lights were still in the same spot.  I began to notice a slight orange color in the light on the bottom, which was slightly larger than the top light.  The lights appeared to be only a few hundred feet off the ground, just high enough in the sky to be clearly visible from many locations.  I was set on getting a closer look so I kept driving toward the lights.  Before I knew it we were on Rt. 19 in Washington, with the two lights still off in the distance.  Just in front of us a large meteor-like object passed in front of us, giving off a bright green light.  The lights and the shooting star do not appear to be related, because the lights were still there after the shooting star passed.  By this time it had long been ruled out that the lights were stars, since they were much too bright.  We passed through the brightly lit mall area on the north side of Washington and the lights were gone. We never caught sight of them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Venus, we suspect.  PD))<n>

A flashing, blinking light high up in the night sky is a jet.  However, within the five minutes we kept our eyes on it, it barely moved across the sky.  Scale wise, it moved from one side of some tree branches to the trees opposite side in the slow time of approximately 5 minutes.  Too slow to be a jet, yet much too fast to be stars moving across the horizon.  The flashing light was so high up it was about the size of a very tiny star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for the 5 minutes when it suddenly seemed to just disappear or stop blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Being outside in downtown Elk Grove, I saw two illuminate orbs similar to stars, but unusually bright to have been stars. I had observed this strange phenomenon for about almost an hour, and from this observation I had noticed that it had not moved one bit from its original position, which in fact looked to be very close to a large, tall, radio station antenna in Elk Grove, observing it at a vantage point about four miles away. The two orbs of light could have been connected to form one spacecraft or separated as two different spacecraft because it had looked like they were in a straight, diagonal line above the ground. The bottom orb was brighter than the top orb as they both were hovering just above the tip of the 15 story-tall antenna; the illuminate orbs being about 100 feet separated from each other.  At the end of the hour, both orbs had disappeared, as I went outside again from my house to check on it.  It was a really extraordinary thing that I had never seen before in my life, and I would really like to know exactly what I was looking at and if it was indeed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be much appreciated if someone who knew these kinds of phenomenon , and would be kind enough to give an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The sky was perfectly clear, except for the very beginnings of a small wispy cloud. The objects were in no clear formation, but close together in the sky. (an area smaller than the palm of your hand, perhaps two inches square) They looked metallic to me, as they seemed to shimmer. They were about the size of a pencil (softly dulled) point at this time.  They looked to either be white, or red. There was one that was definitely red. While trying to keep track of them, it looked like something was swinging from below them, kinda back and forth. I thought maybe paratroopers, but i dont see how i would be able to see some one that small that high in the sky?  Two of the objects seemed to stay in the same spot. I was looking through wires going across my yard, and they stayed in that same position for approx a min. I got up to look for a better vantage point, trying to see if maybe moving to a different area if i could see them clearer  I lost track of two, couldn&#39;t see them any more. Three of them looked like they were in triangular formation, equal lateral. I watched two of them for a period of time, they remained close to each other and finally were too small for me to see in the bright sky.  I sat back down and caught sight of two of them again, just sitting there in the sky. I would say the total time of my watching them was approx 5-10 minutes.  Again, they drifted, till they were too small for me to see.  About 20 min later, I took notice of a silver tubular object that crossed the sky from west to east. I continued to watch this object watching for wings or something to show it was a plane. Again, nothing was visible. I looked away for a sec, and back up, and it was gone.  It had been above my house, and then it was gone. There was nothing blocking my view of the sky, and it wasnt that high up that i wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it anym! ore.  Th is item looked to be the size of a plane, silver. Clearly visible. I watched this item for about 10sec total. I am not sure what these items were. The first five is what really grabbed my attention, this second item was just odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 37, single mom with a college degree.  I have spotted odd things in the sky before and reported them. I am a believer in UFOs, but am still skeptical of them as until I see one that is beyond a shadow of doubt of alien origin, personally.  My son was also watching the 5 objects with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I followed it with my eyes for several minutes. Later, I went inside to look for the number of the FAA. I called the number I found, and the woman I talked to emphatically denied that is what I saw, and suggested that I was seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I went back outside after talking to her, I looked up and the disc, or whatever it was that was under the 747 was going in reverse direction in a straight line above my neighborhood, where it had originally appeared with the 747 jet, at about 20,000 feet, it was a mostly clear day with a few scattered clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I talked to several others about this event, they suggested that what I saw was a stealth bomber below Air Force One. This seemed to be a very logical explanation.The disc was dark and round shaped and small enough to be noticed below tail of this aircraft. The FAA was never recontacted about this and would possibly deny the presence of a second plane (object) at all, if that is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone else out there sees them too one day, and gets some good pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are helicopter and planes above my area all the time, day and night, and I am just west of Arlington, VA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The figures or entities inside the aircraft were about 3 or perhaps 4 but nor more than 4 and the jet sound came from the aircraft was not making any air waves of any kind as a normal jetliners does I could compare them because just a few seconds after this craft has gone a jetliner approaches my area and I could notice and compare the differences between the previous sight into the regular and normal jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After few seconds of this sight the aircraft disappeared over the near by buildings leaving me kind of shaking due to this one of the kind experience even thought my dog does not known what was it she acts weird before and during the sight and only became a normal dog after the flying thing disappeared thru the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the front I did not noticed anything odd at all beside the strobe lights since I begin to noticed that it was something not normal only after the aircraft was almost flying over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope someone could explain to me what was it of perhaps someone has see something similar before.<n>

My husband and daughter (14) had just left through the front door to go to the store.  My son and I observed two very large bright white lights in the southern sky.  They were about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were larger than any planet that we have ever seen.  One light was located about ‘3 inches’ above the other light.  Both lights were behind the branches of a neighbor’s tree (about 75 yards).  They were stationary and we did not hear any sound coming from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and tried to find some information on the internet about the evening sky, but didn’t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, my son and I went back outside to view the lights.  This time we went out the front door and observed the lights from our front porch.  The lights were no longer behind the tree branches.  This time, the lights were to the right of the tree at the same altitude and intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later my daughter and husband came home from the store.  I asked them if they saw the bright lights outside.  My daughter said she saw the lights as they were walking to the car to go to the store.  She said she tried to tell my husband, but he was talking on the cell phone.  I asked her if the lights were still there, and she said she still saw them as they walked back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back onto the front porch to take another look at the lights.  Both lights were gone!  I called my husband, son, and daughter to see that the lights were gone.  We were baffled.  We went back inside and shared our observations with my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside the front door, but this time I walked about 20 feet out onto the front lawn.  Further away and about 10-20 degrees from the horizon, I saw what I think may be the same two lights.  They were located south-south-west of me.  Their lights were smaller and dimmer.  The bottom light seemed to be rotating as different colored lights were being emitted.  (yellow, orange, green?) I went back inside and called my son and daughter.  They also believe that the two distant lights were the same lights that were previously much closer to our house.  We watched the two lights as they very, very, slowly descended into the horizon.  The lights did not get smaller as they descended.  They seemed to make a vertical descent.  It took about 15 minutes for both the lights to descend out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD))<n>

As we approached the stop sign, my son and I witnessed a round ball shaped object with an orange, glowing, burning, center. (It was  the shape of a basket ball or a beach ball with a flame in the middle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our amazement, we stopped the car at the stop sign and got out of the vehicle; at that time it was low in the sky but not too far away.   We estimate it was only about 500 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife then also got out of the car (she was in the back seat).  At first, she thought we were looking at something in the road, but she saw us looking up at the object.  It traveled slowly, with no noise, and continued on a straight line path and gradually increased in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for 5 minutes until it disappeared.  By the time it disappeared, it was extremely high in the sky.  It traveled from the south to the north.<n>

My father and other family members were standing outside when my father saw the strange orange/red light traveling slowly across the sky coming towards Carson.  He had seen it twice before during the summer so he quickly called the rest of us out to witness it.  We all quickly determined it wasn&#39;t an airplane because there were other planes in the sky at that time and this had no flashing warning lights and no sound like the rest of them as it came above us.  It was just an orange/red super bright object almost like a fireball but with no noticeable flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying higher than the other airplanes but it was larger and brighter than them in the sky.  It traveled across the sky above us and when it reached the refineries about 2 miles away it stopped and it shot down a fireball that left a streaking orange trail like a flame but there was no smoke, just the same orange/red glow like a piece of the larger object just came off.  The smaller fireball shot directly down a couple of seconds and disappeared.  The big object then flashed a few times before it also disappeared.  Some clapped while others freaked out and asked,  what was that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother who was not at this family gathering had told us about this strange light he has seen often in the sky.  He has seen it numerous times since 2005 and it&#39;s always traveling across Carson and always disappearing above the refineries.  He has also seen it shoot white lights and spin then disappear.  My parents and sister have also seen it a few times before.  Now I and about 14 other family members believe!<n>

We went back outside and noticed a strange red/orange light drifting in the sky in an upward motion traveling east to southwest.  The object looked like it was on fire, and my first thought was maybe someone had their fireplace going and it was flaming debris, but the motion of the object was floating upward and there was no wind to carry anything.  That and given the distance of the object to us (at arm&#39;s length it was about 1/4&#34; diameter), the object was too large to be debris.  I ruled out a flare as it wasn’t falling.  It almost looked like it was something suspended from a balloon, but it was traveling to fast and it was traveling too fast to be a balloon.  If it was a balloon, then it would have been visible or at least a reflection of the light would have been on the balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed to my car to grab my digital camera and my sister took hers out of her purse.  I snapped a picture, but it was too dark so I deleted it.  I then decided to change the settings on my camera in hope of maybe getting better luck.  As soon as I looked back up, the object was gone.  Total time of occurrence was five minutes.<n>

A family friend who tends to stare up at the sky while he smokes outside called to our attention to bright lights in the cloudy sky to the south-southwest of highway 5 and 380 in the general direction of Dallas.  One was very bright and was accompanied by a lesser shining light above and to the left of it like (\) this. They both shined white and were the ONLY things visible in the sky. It was too cloudy and too bright out for any stars to be seen. They kept falling out of our view due to passing clouds but did not move in the sky and did not have any tails or trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another important note of this is that the flight path of commercial planes coming down toward DFW airport was smack right in the middle of the two lights. Several planes took the standard flight path but after a while the planes DEVIATED their flight paths to the west of the lights and avoided them completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight we stood outside and looked for anything. The stars have been visible but we DID NOT see anything near where we saw the two lights and the planes that regularly pass are back on the normal flight path. (We saw 4 or 5 planes go straight through the area where they had been flying between the lights yesterday night so we k now that must be their standard flight path.)  Several other people including some other friends and family saw it as well and acknowledged that the lights seemed strange seeing as there were no visible stars yesterday (Nov.27) where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As we watched the objects sputtered and faded out.  We are 99% sure what we observed were flares.  They appeared very similar to the &#34;Arizona Lights&#34; that caused such a stir a few years ago and were subsequently identified as flares dropped from A-10’s during a military exercise.   It is possible that if they were indeed flares they may have been part of some sort of military exercise at the Willow Grove Naval Airbase which lies in the general direction of the observation..but military exercises on Thanksgiving night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are hoping someone else in the area spotted this as well and will submit a collaborating report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THANKS<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My dad, mom, and my 2 brothers and I all seen this object.  I have kep&#39;t this under my hat for about a month now.  We all looked up, and noticed this light moving across the sky.  Can&#39;t really remember the direction it was traveling, but I know it wasn&#39;t going the opposite way from us.  It was just a light moving across the sky at a very moderate speed.  What got me is when we all seen this light it started to dim out, and flicker off.  So at this point of me being a local community ufo investigator I stopped to think of any explanation for this light.  First I eliminated the plane/jet theory.  No way possible that this was of these two.  Next I eliminated the planet suggestion.  This light/craft was moving, and it flickered off.  We was moving in our van about 80mph, but I know this light object was moving.  I look in the sky&#39;s alot I know this stuff.  There was a alot of clouds out.  Almost whole sky was covered.  This object was under cloud level.  So this means that the flickering, and dimming was not due to the excessive amount of clouds in the sky.  There was no way this was a satellite, or shooting star just by examination of the object.  I finally had to come to a conclusion that this object was most likely extraterrestrial.  I mean this object/light would flicker on and off, dim a little then become real bright again.  My mom had the best view, and she said that this was the most bizarre ufo related event that has happened to her.  I agreed right along with her.  I have reported other reports to you guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not to long ago I reported a report to ya&#39;ll about the orange like object that turned into a what looked like a star zooming across the sky. I have had my share of seeing ufo&#39;s, and I have had my share of being able to investigate around my community, and be able to get to hear other witnesses reports of ufo&#39;s. I know what we s! een comi ng home from Midwest City that night, and it wasn&#39;t from this Earth. Soon the world will know the truth of these strange anamolies, but I can&#39;t say when. &#34; There once was a crash that happened in 1947, claims it was a flying saucer then claims it was a weather balloon, why the sudden change of story&#39;s, and why so fast?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my ufo groups quote of the day.

As it flew down towards the earth it was just as white and big at the bottom as at the top.  (As if it was producing a flash that lit up the area it was just in too!)  The funny part was that I sensed that it really was not that far away.  Perhaps a small craft just 1 mile away.  The thing that was most remarkable about it was the tremendous rate of speed.  In just a second it appeared, flew and then disappeared.  What also was remarkable was the brilliant white, milky light surrounding it.  Almost like it has cloak itself to appear as a cloud, and then started to travel. Remarkable.  One more thing, there was light around, the sun was up.<n>

What was witnessed at first looked like a full moon behind trees but was a very bright reddish orange color. At this time I ran inside to get my camera and my wife stayed outside and watched. I was inside for no more than 15 seconds to get the camera. When I returned outside the object had gone from approximately 100 - 200 feet to about 500 feet and had lost it&#39;s glow but was now a bright light about as brighter than Jupiter appears in the sky. The object then moved north and climbed to about 1000 feet. sat there for about 2 minutes then climbed until it winked out. This is the third sighting of the object. First was 8/18/08/. second was 8/29/08. and tonight 11/26/08. The pattern I have noticed if you are to take the first two sightings they were 11 days apart. Counting on a calendar by 11&#39;s, 11/26/08 fell on an 11th day. The craft again made no noise. My son living 3 blocks away on a third floor apartment was out on his balcony and called me to tell me he was seeing the object. I didn&#39;t have my cell phone on me and he left me a voice mail saying what he was seeing. The time the message was left was 8:45pm (CST). He saw it before I did because he was higher up and didn&#39;t have an obstructed view as I did with it behind trees. He described it the same as I saw it.

We had the day off from school since thanksgiving is tomorrow.  I woke up at eight for wrestling practice, came home ate and pretty much laid on the couch the rest of the day.  I took a nap around five and woke up around seven thirty.  I was sitting on my couch watching the movie X-Men Three. The way the room is set up is that you walk in and there is a couch on your right, and a chair to the left.  The television is in the far corner of the room against the wall. So directly in front of the couch is this big window. I don’t know why but I looked out the window and at that moment there was this bright object.  It was circular I think. It was bright yellow kind of golden. It left this beautiful blue trail. The object was going down diagonally like it was crashing but it went behind the trees so I couldn’t see it land. I don’t know how far it was away but it fell to the east of my house pretty close I’d say within 25 miles. It was at 8:55 PM. I know this because I looked at my cell phone right away. I’ve never seen anything like these before. It could have been a meteor or UFO. I don’t know what it was but I’m positive it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought the lights were stars but then I could see other stars in the sky and they were not as bright and big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I waited outside the bar I noticed that the two points of light had moved slightly to the right.  To make sure I planted my back to a tree and used a distant tree branch as a reference point, and the straight edge of my lighter as a guide.  I walk away and waited for my friends-about 5 minutes.  I walked back to the tree, planted myself in the same place and noticed that the lights were not in the same place. Each light had moved as if they were connected, although I couldn&#39;t see any structure connecting them.  Ten minutes later I returned to the same spot and the lights were noticably moved away from my intial reference point.  The streets were mostly empty as most of the people have left town for the holidays.  I also noticed a red blinking dot, like a helicopter flying in the area of the lights.  My friends pulled up and I showed them the lights and they stared for a while but the lights were fixed and outside of there brightness there was nothing spectacular to them-I&#39;m sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One hour or so later we returned to the bar and the lights were gone.  I usually stare at the sky and I have noticed how with time stars change positions in the sky.  Specifically I have observed the constallation Orion change position on many evenings.  The difference is that it usually takes hours for this to happen.  These object were moving very slow, but to fast for stars-due to the Earth moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing is that while I was staring at this thing I felt like something was communicating with me (this sounds nuts, I know).  As my friends husband looked at it I noticed that he was also grabbed by something, almost in a hypnotic state for a brief moment.

Almost as if something had a thruster attached to it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 seconds after the dark object had dissapeared, I saw an object for a brief second much further south than where this object was first seen.  I have to say I&#39;ve seen plenty of aircraft before and shooting stars, but I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like this before.  Slow moving at first then extremely fast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any kind of feedback would be great.<n>

Size estimate is 7 to ten feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be a bunch of black ballons in the sky due to the drifting nature.  The object was oblong but it kept changing shape.  It first appear as a shamrock-likeshape.  It would then change into a &#34;V&#34; shape,  Then the shape of a staple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason why i believe it was not balloons is because it changed into a tube or snake-like shape. it drifted into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was overcast and clouds were abundant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO in 31 years of my life and consider my self a skeptic, but this object bothered me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take a photograph of it with my cellular phone.<n>

Our building is near a rock quarry so I assumed the noise was from an oncoming truck carrying materials to/from the quarry.  I initially ignored the noise thinking it would pass and I could fall back asleep and not worry about the noise awaking my young child.  But the noise did not stop after 5-10 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I went out onto my balcony and looked for the oncoming or idling truck, but there was none.  So I looked up and that&#39;s when I noticed the rectangle shaped object hovering above my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sprinted back into our room to wake my husband and force him to come out into the cold to look into the sky.  He eventually agreed, looked and saw the object and stated its probably a helicopter.  But there are no rectangle shaped helicopters to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He later confessed that after coming back into the apartment he thought to himself &#34;a helicopter would be way more louder than that object&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried calling both the town police department and county department.  The town department told me I was out of their jurisdiction and the county department told me their system was down the day I called (about a week or two after the sighthing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if this matters, but my apartment building is located near the Center for Innovative Technology building about 2 mins from the Dulles Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was moving very fast, faster than any type of plane.  Eventully it flew out of eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside for about 10-15 more minutes, hoping to see it again.  Then all of a sudden a milatary style formation of planes were heading in the direction it went.  There was at least 6 planes in formation, and it was very loud after they flew by.

The light/object did not move 10 minutes and then it started going slowly left and right until it fully stopped in the same spot after about 5 minutes, where the light changed its color from white to red and began to slowly disappear like it was turning on an invisibility cloak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It surely wasn’t a human-made aircraft, it didn’t make a sound and it hardly even moved.

On my view of the night sky there was an object with three lights across a disc like craft, with a red light circling around the other lights.  This object was cruising at a low altitude at a slower than normal speed for a plane, which crosses the air traffic from our local airfield.  Normally you can clearly hear the roaring sound of these planes approaching the airport as the fly around the front side of my house a few hundred feet above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was not a plane, there was no sound from this craft as it sauntered across the night sky in what was a south easterly direction.  Watching this object for ten minutes I came to my conclusion that any plane flying out from the nanaimo airport would have clearly left my site as it faded into the black with the sound still lingering in the distance though the ten minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a second much smaller craft that was higher above which seemed to stay in a perfect parallel in relation to the bigger craft.  With planes you notice the opposite flash of a green then red light on either tip of the wings, two bright landing lights usually are turned on for visual during night landings.  This was not the case in my sighting.<n>

The Blue Ridge Mountains are about 1 ½ mile west and the South Mountains are about ¼ mile east.  The Potomac River is about 1 mile south.  I am a 58 year retired social worker with a masters degree.  This is my first report of an unidentified object seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11-25-08 at about 7:15 p.m., I was shutting my backyard gate in the dark, facing west towards Elk Ridge (in the Blue Ridge Mts., about 1400 ft. elevation) which runs roughly southwest to northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up, I saw a lighted object rapidly descending at about a 45 degree angle below the ridge line at a very rapid rate of speed.  I only saw it for about three seconds before it dropped behind the roof line of a neighbor’s house.  The object’s speed was much faster than planes, helicopters, or fireworks that are occasionally seen in the area.  My estimation is that the lighted object was in the valley, about ½ to 1 mile from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighted object was oblong in shape, wider at the end headed downward, like an elongated teardrop.  In relation to how the moon appears in our sky, the length was about the diameter of the moon, with a tail of more diffused light extending further out.  The width was about a third of the moon’s diameter.  The color reminded me of a Halloween glow-stick, so it had a florescent look.  The only sound I noted was that of distant barking dogs, off to the northeast towards the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.  The lighted object was seen with the mountain range as a back drop.   I am frequently outside, day and night, caring for horses and have a familiarity with the sights and sounds of the area.  This was certainly out of the ordinary and I have no idea what I saw.<n>

We both said &#34;Look&#34; at the same time, then both realized there was no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light just stopped and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, about a second later a little red dot flashed in the sky exactly where the light stopped.  Now, my boyfriend is a small plane pilot, and he said there was NO WAY that what we saw could have been anykind of airplane or jet.  It moved too far too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that he estimated the light to be about 10 miles above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was pitch black and the sky was fairly clear, you could see several stars.<n>

These 2 bright lights were obviously not moving like normal aircraft, but in a stationary position.  Could see aircraft (lights blinking) flying around these 2 bright lights for about 15 minutes like they were keeping their eye on them. Towards the end of the observation, noticed the lights seemed to be more in the distant than before, but still NOT moving.  Said loudly, this WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE, NOT A HELICOPTER, but had a weird sense that this was something abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter currently are prominent in the sw sky.

However, no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching a few jets pass by the area, it was apparent that these objects were not jets.  I focused on these objects for about 10 minutes as they tracked simultaneously across the sky down and to the west.  In about 10 minutes, I would estimate they moved no more than 5 degrees.  Faster than stars move, but much slower than planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be quite far apart but they moved in exactly the same direction and distance in that time.  I kept my head fixed against my car seat and used various fixed objects nearby to gauge the motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a number of photos but they resolve as dots even at high resolution.<n>

It was rectangular, reddish-gray in color and moving slowly North to South about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled out my cell phone to get a picture, while glancing up at the object.  It moved behind the large Westmont water tower on the South side of the road and never came back out.  As I drove further East on 63rd and came even with the water tower, I looked for the object as much as I could without having an accident, but it was gone.

While we were traveling East down HWY 80, my husband noticed several orange lights coming from the South heading North.  As we stopped at a red light at the intersection of Hwy 80 and Hwy 280, my husband finally asked me if I could see the lights too and if I knew what they were.  At first these were seen through the trees and resembled street lights in the distance but as we sat at the red light I noticed these lights were actually moving at a slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued East on Hwy 80 and tried to keep our eye on the lights as they became more in to view. Soon we noticed more and the few lights we were seeing were actually 9 or 10 so we were a little intrigued as to what would be flying over in this number, but then I was able to count about 19 or more. They were appeared large and seemed to be very high in the sky.  They changed direction from going North to moving East in front of us.  This acutally looked as though they just started moving sideways. We tried to keep up but kept getting stopped by red lights.  We then could only watch as they continued to get farther away.  At one point it appeared that there were more appearing from the atmosphere and looked to be almost dropping slowly.  At this time my children  began asking if these were meteors or something else falling from space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they got to the horizon, they seemed to disappear.  We tried to catch up a few minutes after they got away from us, but there was nothing at all in the sky.  By the time we got to the last place we saw them over the sky was very clear and we could see it very well from this new location.  This was on Hwy 85 in Columbus, GA traveling Norteast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near Ft. Benning so we realize this could be explained as something else, but there were just too many and they were maneuvering in ways that I have never seen.   We waited so long because we were trying to see if anyone else that night witnessed the same thing.  The other people in cars around us did not seem to notice but surely someone else saw.  It was very scary and all of us were shaken up for quite awhile that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you can get any other information to explain this phenomenon we would greatly appreciate it.<n>
11/24/08 18:00|Ionia|MI|Cross|~45 seconds|Four pointed star shaped light sighted on 11/24/08 at 6pm, near Ionia, Mi.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67219.html|82|ndxe200811| Four pointed star shaped light sighted on 11/24/08 at 6pm, near Ionia, Mi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6pm on November 24th I was returning to my vehicle after deer hunting.  The vehicle was parked on the north side of Riverside Drive, facing west, in Ionia State Park.  While changing my clothes and exchanging text messages with my father, regarding the days hunt, some motion caught my eye.  In the south west a light the shape of a 4 pointed star was moving toward the north east.  There were 2 quite bright stars in the direct area where I initially noticed the light.  The light proceeded to travel out of sight, past the town rather rapidly.  At first I thought that perhaps I had seen a satellite, or possibly even the space shuttle or space station, as there was no noise, the light was white with no color and seemed to me to be traveling quite rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurred to me as the light faded out of sight past the town that the stars all had halos around them, and the light did as well, but not until it was over the city and almost out of sight.  It did not when it went past me.  I was approximately 3 linear miles from the town of Ionia, and the object appeared to have the halo around it when it was over the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that the object was visible to me for about 45 seconds, and traveled roughly 6 to 7 miles in that time.  The light was bright (it was the brightest object in the sky), clear, and well defined.  The point of the star shape at the leading edge did not appear to necessarily be the front point of any object that it might have been, as it did not always appear to be immediately pointed in the direction that the light was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were either flying further west or were dropping altitude, but both floated down several degrees in vision while seeming to expand and contract, and then finally they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might’ve thought they were jets if it weren’t for the fact that they left no trail of exhaust.  They both simply appeared in the sky and dropped down on the vertical plane of vision while changing shape and floating down, kind of like a feather does.  The first one disappeared outright, just fading out of the sky.  I may have lost sight of the second one only because it flew further west(?) behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after the sighting, a jet with a short stream was seen flying to where the objects were spotted in the sky.

This event was witnessed by many people worldwide, and reported days later by radio broadcast.  The encounter I had on 11-23-08 wasn&#39;t as spectacular as my first sighting by any means.  But I feel it&#39;s worth reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed was a star like object that would seem to rise then drop and go from side to side, hover and then repeat itself.  It did this maneuver for hours. While I was watching this object.  I had a light show event that took place.  I would like to be able to dismiss this as possible aircraft. But cannot, as too the way these lights hovered and then changed direction while producing a strobe like flash and moving very oddly.  The flash was very bright and a blueish white color.  This occurred at tree top level then they would disappeared behind the mountains to the east.  I could not believe what I was seeing once again.  I witnessed some very unexplainable things on this night.<n>

Suddenly my friend claimed he saw three lights that were golden in color fly by our window.  Immediately we checked outside by opening the window as much as it could.  There was no other source of light that would have caused it. We did a laundry list of things it could possibly be, and none would have produced that light that close to our window.  In terms of arrangement he describes them in a line, not a perfect line, but basically one after the other.  Each orb was around 1 to 2 feet across.<n>

The first object was a small non-blinking light that later appeared to be a small cigar shape(in the distance), it was extremely slowly heading East towards New Haven County, Connecticut, later also moving gradually upward while gaining speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was a slightly larger light that looked like it could have been over seaside park or black rock harbor, it was heading West towards Westchester County, New York at again a very slow rate.  It later began again moving at a faster rate yet not moving upward like the first object, as it started moving faster I could see a green light moving back and forth along the bottom of the object.  I am very freaked out right now, I have visited this site before so I knew where to turn to to report this.

I looked up and saw this blinking orange light in the sky at about 8pm.  I know that it wasn’t a light from an airplane because I&#39;ve grown up looking at planes and know what their running and landing lights look like.  This light was a lot bigger than any you&#39;d ever see on a plane and it was blinking at a lot slower pace than that of plane lights.  As a matter of fact at the same time I could see a plane off in the distance and was watching both things at once.  The blinking orange light seemed to be standing still while I could see the plane moving across the sky towards it.  I then ended up driving under where the light was and I could see that it was actually moving straight up.  At this point I thought it may be a rocket launched by NASA or something, but I checked NASA&#39;s launch schedule and their last launch had been on the 14th and wasn’t due back until the 30th.  When we got to her house it was gone, had disappeared<n>

My husband saw it too but was driving.  He kept driving around trying to &#34;chase it.&#34;  It was diamond shape.  It stayed still over two places.  It was large and very low.  It wasn&#39;t a plane and the reason we noticed it was because it wasn&#39;t in the normal plane flyway (we are located near airport and used to where planes fly) and it was standing still both times.  Again, we aren&#39;t sure if it was one or two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:00 dark clear night, in vicinity of RIC airport, but not in normal &#34;plane flyways&#34;:  The object(s) was diamond shaped and the top three lights (at each point) were white, the bottom one was red.  It was the same both times.  We heard no obvious noise and it was first seen low over a subdivision street on one side of Highland Springs&#39; Nine Mile Road, then we saw it on the other side of Nine Mile road.  Again, that is after my husband was trying to follow it around.  We lost sight of it trying to go around the block so it could be one or two objects.  The lights were very bright and larger than what we are used to seeing with planes.  We have seen planes flying low over us over and over so we know what most planes look like in various positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is an engineer and I am a former administrative professional.<n>

I became very familiar with the flight pattern into and back out of the airport, having taken over 15 trips by the date of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving at the airport I would rent a car and travel East on Touhy to my hotel in Skokie.  Each week I enjoyed watching the incoming flight line.  Planes would only be about a few hundred to a couple thousand feet up at that point.  I knew this by listening to the flight deck communications when I would arrive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this Sunday early evening I noticed a particularly large aircraft with the typical front fuselage and side wing lights in a triangle pattern.  Usually the larger aircraft appear to be moving slowly due to their size.  As I traveled east on Touhy, however, I noticed that this large aircraft appeared to be moving too slowly - not what I was used to seeing.  Within a few moments I realized it was hovering, and the motion was mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached Western Ave intersection I noted that it was hovering above buildings to my right.  I turned the corner on Greenwood to make a run around the block to hopefully see it from behind.  Instead I saw it in the same place as I rounded the block - it definitely was hovering, and it was a large dark triangle with a few lights to define its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Touhy again I decided to round the block one more time and stop on a side street to get out to have a look.  By the time I got to a stopping place it was gone.  At no time did I hear any noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a research scientist with trained observation skills, and can say for sure that I saw a hovering triange shaped aircraft that was out of place in this area.  On my return to the airport Wednesday of that week (it was Thanksgiving week) it was daylight, and I noted that there were no towers or any other structures in the area that could have explained this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have permanently located to the Chica go area now and would be happy to review the sighting on site.<n>

When we first noticed them we were in the area of Powell bvld.  They were stationary and very low and no sound that we could detect. We also saw a helicopter that seemed to be pretty close to the light at the triangal tip.  The helicopter left and shortly after we saw an airplane. the third light became invisible to us but the two stayed in exact formation but seemed to be traveling southbound.  When we arrived to our destination, (Oregon City) the two lights were still in what appeared to be exact distance from each other as when we first saw them.  They seemed to be stationary again for some time.  I went outside to look at them a few times for the next fifteen minutes and the last time I checked they appeared to be on the move again but still in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is interesting is that there were other people on the freeway who had to see them.  The helicopter and plane certainly did but no report on news or in the morning paper.

I looked to my left to see a disc that was like reflecting metal or a mirror in the sky. Freaking out slightly I kept it in my head the sun was on the opposite side of the sky starting to set also round. But it sat there and riding down the highway the trees were passing in front of it. Then it was gone. Scanning the sky rationalizing some type of weather anomaly I looked up and there it was.... very close. Helicoptors were coming from all directions at it. Then it disappeared. So at that point I lost it....my bf was driving telling me to calm down it was nothing. I looked back and it was far back in the distance and there were helicoptors upwards of ten surrounding and coming in on it......then it was gone....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting off the highway... I was just contemplating all the thoughts of what it could be in my head....<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at the house to look at a used saab for me and we took a test drive. I was in the back seat. We went down a long road and I saw this huge gated factory. I asked the woman what it was...she said sikorsky airport they manufactur helicoptor engines. So there was my answer...reflection of a test helicoptor. Maybe some type of directional things in the sky for the testing of the helicoptors..... there was my answer....<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we bought the car and left it there untill we obtained the paper work... we drove off in my bf rx7 and missed the highway we saw a small diner and the lights on and in the car were dimming so my bf backed into to look at the car....looking out the front window I saw the biggest brightest circle/disc and it was close really close...and helicoptors were swarming it circling it and more and more were coming across the sky at it....then it was just gone.....blink of an eye...so now I am losing it....and the car is fine so we take off back in the direction we came. Then it happened again the car was bucking lights going off everything..... then it went dead. It was freezing...I pressed my faced up against the window to see what looked like the same ufo (call it that now :) and I literally opened the door falling out from excitment.....It was cold and the ground was frozen and muddy....I was just staring into this disc that looked like it was sitting on the tree tops...no sound....helicoptors flew in all around it and they were coming from all directions the yard I was in went up a hill and it started to move very very slowly unlike before...I saw it move and the helicoptors moved with it....all I could here was them and barking dogs......I couldn&#39;t see cause the street lights were out were we broke down.....I ran looking up crying my eyes out from happiness disbelief some type of spiritual experinece...idk but I ran as fast as possible in my heels sticking throught the ice and mudd and it went up over the hill and disappeared....I could still hear the helicoptors so it was still there....I was disappointed it was gone....I turned around to walk back and in the sky far in the distance was 20 to 30 of the same disc/circles in what looked like a pattern sitting in the sky....but further away cause they were smaller....then they started blinking out or flying away (not visible to the eye) just gone....they were all gone.. The lights helicoptors everything......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so a believer now...it&#39;s not funny. I want to go back and sit around the same area to see if it is something that I can rationalize with that is common to us or something that is so unidentified openly and get the proof.....if anyone would believe me. You know I honestly told two people because I knew that everyone would think I was joking or losing it.....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Though they all had an orange glow, they also had a dark casted circular appearance around the outside of the shape.........<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we zoomed in to see them, one looked more of an egg shape where as another seemed more of a boomerang shape as daft as it sounds, we were zooming in when all of a sudden the light just disappeared, so we ran a little further up the road in order to get closer to the next one as we stood there my daughter spotted another was moving towards us from the far left at the end of the street, at this point we couldnt beleive what we were seeing, having no explanation for this we were obviously quite excited, then another appeared.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all seemed to be following the others ones previous path, they would get so far up the street, only then they stopped and seemed to turn back and upwards a little,before they stopped again, this could not of been planes of that we are all very sure as they werent that far apart from each other and it was like they were hovering in motion, it was a very calm night, yet there was no engine noise or even propeller sounds, no humming etc in fact nothing at all, seriously it was very silent, the air was echoey, yet to look at they seemed so close, they were very bright to look at beautiful even, until eventually one by one the lights just dissapeared as you would expect if a light was simply switched straight off.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now on saying that 3 of them actually appeared to be pulsing lights at one point so im not sure if the others did the same before hand, during this time there were also neighbours that had come out onto the street because of all the fuss to see what on earth we were doing only when we pointed it out they were bewilderedand also stopped dead in there tracks, they stood with us watching and taking pictures, one even climbed up onto a wall to get a better look, everyone was very loud and excited by what they saw because it was so unexpected, I mean you hear about it but as the saying goes, you never expect it to happen to you!!!!  I swear to you all now this is the truth with not a word of deception, none of us have any explanation for what we saw and even after there dissapearence we sat in the freezing cold on the wall just waiting to see if anything else happened, though to our dissapoinment it never did, we have all discussed it and firmly beleive between us, that they had to be a type of U.F.O, as none of us have encountered anything even remarkably similar ever and we are all of different ages ranging between 18-50, we would like an explanation if possible but on saying that it has left us all even my very sceptical husband beleiving that aliens or another life form of some type definately does exist for sure...We will be keeping a close watch from now on!!!!<n>

Given the fact that i live close to the Portland International Airport I thought it could be an airplane but it was moving too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was almost out of my line of sight it seemed to start behaving strangely and moving up and down.  This led me to believe that there could be two craft given the strange motion, i know there was at least one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took maybe 30 seconds before i could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this could be a satellite but given its erratic behavior i do not believe this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time i have ever seen a UFO but my mother saw one in 1972.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have shown interest in UFO&#39;s but I&#39;m not one to make up stories for public attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The backdrop in the sky was the dark sky in Portland but there was an orange hue coming from a street light.<n>

It was not an airplane as the flying area is towards the south. It was not a helicopter either, as there were no other colors of light emitting from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two people in the street (Rose Hill) looking up and pointing at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I collected binnoculars and ran to rear of house.  I had difficulty focusing on object but for a brief 5 seconds or so I could see a ring of orange lights (7-10).  A light aircraft was travelling the opposite direction and must have had a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object faded away within 10-15 seconds.<n>

It moved from west to north-east and suddenly turned red.  Then seemed to accelerate rapidly and vanish from sight.  We live within two miles of Epply Airfield and have seen a lot of airplanes and this was no airplane.  It was a solid white light, silent and moving very rapidly before it turned solid red and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later I was still outside looking for something else to happen when I saw what could only be described as a wave come from the spot that the light disappeared.  It came from one spot and spread out only going both directions horizontally.  It looked almost like a flock of birds but it was going in two different directions and was moving very fast.  There was no sound to it and I lost sight of it over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the 2nd or 3rd weekend in November at the Family Video located in Canton, MI at the intersection of Canton Center and Hanford.  My son and I were waiting in the car while my wife ran into the store to return a movie.  The sun roof was open because it was a clear but brisk day.  I noticed what looked like seagulls flying very high in a Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed there was no movement from the wings, or circular pattern and they appeared to be traveling in threes.  Each group of three formed somewhat of a triangle.  It seemed to be 3-4 groups before I pointed out to my son to look up from the back seat.  He witnessed the last two or three groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reference points would be seagulls flying high in the sky and satellites flying across the sky at night. I would say that it was the height of the high flying seagulls at the satellite pace.  It was between 12pm and 4pm on either a Saturday or Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Considered cloud coverage (minor coverage) and used a tree top silhouette for reference point. Light was defiantly moving in no set pattern. After watching for approximately 5 minutes, light took off at an angle and high rate of speed, disappearing in a few seconds. Within 5 minutes, a large object that was box shaped with slightly tapered ends, red and green lights in the back half of the object passed over my house. I assumed that it was a large helicopter – possibly a “Huey”, but the object appeared to be around  maybe a couple of hundred feet up but there was no noise at all, no vapor trail, no rotor wash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11/23/08  3:45am.

Kind of looked like a giant window pain flying across the sky. Very &#34;Star Wars&#34; animation like with glowing engines instead of flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The panels were vertical to the road, or 90 degrees to the earth, and looked as if I was looking at the propulsion system of something. Do we have plasma drive??? Can&#39;t say how high it was or how big it was because I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get some very shaky video of it through my windshield while I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know my speed was about 75mph and it seemed to be going twice that but I don&#39;t really know because I don&#39;t know how high it was or how big it was. Never seen anything like that ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes on it until it was out of sight in the far west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope its one of ours!<n>

It looked like a faint white ribbon.  As it got closer I could tell that it was several seprate faint white lights shaped like a boomerang with a little bit of a nose on the front of it.  I would estimate at least 12 lights on the front of it.  It flew over my head very fast,no noise what so ever.  This thing was huge,very eerie. If a 747 was flying over my head at 100ft,thats how big this thing was.  I dont know the altitude of it,but it seemed to be very high in the sky.  I could make out the shape of it on the front edge but could se nothing behind it.  As it flew over my head it blocked out the stars, then I could tell it was a gigantic boomerang.  It proceeded to fly south and dissapeared in the southern sky.<n>

But in the distance i could see a set of lights near or on the top of another hill.....i once again assumed it was just a house with the lights on, but as we coasted down the hill i noticed that the position of the lights were moving vertically in comparison to us as we made our way down the hill.....at this point i had stoppd the car and rolled down the window to look more clearly .....what i saw at first was just what appeared to be a disk with a very low intensity orangish light emmiting from the entire craft....but just as soon as i focused in on it the object began to move diagonaly towards the feild below...as it moved the orange glow slowly faded to white and then the light seperated itself int seven seperate light orbs that pulsed..now from the angle i was at i could not see it all to well now.....so i went to drive the car around the corner but the car had turned itself off. the key was still in the ignition and i attempted to restart it but there was no resonse. even the electronics were unresponsive...now at this time i looked back up and saw that the object moved over towards my car......not over top of me but close enough....at this time i realized it was not a disk because even though the lights where in a disk shape formation, when it crossed paths with the moon you could see the moon in the center of all the lights....as the lights began to ascend upwards, the lights slowley turned orange once again........then out of no where my car started........when i looked back up at the object it was a brite violet and it took of.......my radio did not work for weeks after the inccident.............when i went home ! every cl ock had said it was 10:52........but both my car and cellphone clock read 22 minutes faster....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After looking through my gas and food receipts I was able to pin down the actual time of my sighting, at 8PM, just one mile east of XXX S Blake Ranch Rd, Kingman, AZ 86401-XXXX on the I40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what looked like 6 LARGE GLOWING PLASMA ENGINES flying over my car while driving west, just 15 miles east of Kingman AZ, 11.3 miles as the crow flies, to the Kingman airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end, that were glowing blue white, like plasma engines.  It reminded me of  the “Millennium Falcon&#34; from the Star Wars movies.  What first caught my eye was a sparking or flash on the bottom of the craft, as it moved over my car.  Then I saw two rows of 3 large rectangles, of blue white glowing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each rectangle appeared to be house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me. It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, &#34;I hope its one of ours&#34;.  It looked like it was about 2000 feet up above me. I could not see the shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ. I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right.  It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed. You can see the ball in the first few frames of the video, but it might be a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  At the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile. I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 4 or 5 miles. It would have passed over or near the Kingman Airport.  Someone should check with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I played the tape later in Needles at a gas stop, the time code showed I had traveled one mile in 32 seconds!  No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH.  I tested the camera and nothing wrong there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted the video on YouTube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held. I also posted this report before but it must have been taken down!  I no longer work for SAIC so I don’t care who know about this report. Originally I didn’t give my name or contact information because I was a contractor with the Navy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked on my video and tried to stabilize the lights the best I can. I will repost it soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this craft was heading toward Area 51 after researching the angle of the flight and the city lights relative to its direction. I plotted a straight line from my sighting to the base and its direction of travel.<n>

I then ran inside to find a camera,cause my camera/video recorder broke last month,I was inside for about 15 seconds,after finding no camera I ran back outside.As I walked out the front door I seen the light right over my house at about 5-6000 feet,I watched it another 10-15 seconds when the light went out,and I ran in the house.This light was way to bright to be a plane or space station,this is my very first time ever seeing anything,I could not explain.I dont know how the light went from looking about 60 miles to the north west to being right over head in under 30 seconds.I dont know if anyone else seen them,I would think so,they were so bright.  thanks  also it was very clear out<n>

I would also like to preface my report by saying that over the past few months, I have taken more of an active interest in the UFO phenomenon and its associated conspiracy theories. I find myself looking more into the skies as my belief system is changing as more and more reliable sources and disclosers are coming forward. Also in this report, I make no speculation as to what I might have seen; it is simply a report of my observation at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, November 21 at approximately 7:30 pm, I and my wife were driving to Seattle from the Eastside. We were driving east on I-90 across the floating bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The skies were clear that evening and the brightest stars were appearing. On such on occasion, I look more carefully into the skies. I was driving and my wife was riding. I noticed the heavy flight traffic as many airliners were landing with a southerly approach to SeaTac airport over downtown Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the planes come in, I noticed that in the approximate vicinity of the airport, at about 10 o’clock from my perspective somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees in the sky, I noticed a reddish light strobing slowly on and off (at intervals of 1-2 seconds on, 1-2 seconds off).  I could make out no discernible shape, and it seemed very far away, perhaps over the airport, but extremely high in the sky (I noted the object relative to the altitude of incoming aircraft).  It was a static object and reminded me of the red strobes of construction cranes.  However, there are no cranes in that direction and it was impossibly high in the air for a land-based construction.  My impression was that it was unlikely a helicopter, because relative to the air traffic it was higher than any helicopter flight I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive across the bridge, on which I had a great view (traffic was light that evening, allowing me to look around a bit).  I kept watching for the two minutes across the bridge.  Once in Seattle, we made our way (5-7 minutes) to Capitol Hill where we parked and went to a concert.  Once out of the car, I could see at one point along the streets that the red blinking light was still in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not mention it to my wife as I wanted to think through it before blurting out what I saw.  Today, we happened to meet a friend and the topic of UFO’s came up, which brought the memory back.  I decided to report my impressions hoping that others might have seen the same thing.  It was early enough and clear enough skies that there would have been plenty of opportunity for others to see the same thing.  I noticed the light for at least 10-12 minutes from the time I saw it on the bridge to the time we drove into town and parked.<n>

Jets seem to be closing in on two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually I have 3 sightings. One, was in the western sky, very far away, about 9:00 high.  It was rectangular in shape, and was a faint red.  It was moving very slowly across the sky in a southerly direction.  After noticeing that one, I turned around, heading back to the house, when I noticed a very bright red light, flashing, in the eastern sky about 10:00 high, much closer than the one to the west.  I also noticed a couple of planes fliing northbound in front of it.  As I kept watching it, I noticed a couple of Air Force jets to the south of the object.  They seem to have been heading for the light.  I ran in to get my camera, and when I came back out, the light had became very dim red.  The planes were still in the area of the object.  I turned on the video recorder on my camera, and all I could see was a red ball- like object, moving around on the screen.  I will send you a copy of what I recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to come in the house, I noticed another bright light to the south, coming in my direction, slowly.  I kept watching for a few seconds to see what it was, when I noticed another jet approaching that object also.  Then, all the sudden, the object vanished. I am not crazy!!  This happens around here all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance and I have several other witnesses to events we seen occur this past summer.<n>

He would feel like he was getting closer then it would seem to stay the same distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he got home almost 8 miles later he got out to get a better look and noticed that there were airplanes circling passes of the &#34;lights.&#34;  The &#34;light&#34; was an extremely bright light that appeared to fade in and out and move around in small movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Planes 4-6 of them causes much interest since we rarely see aircraft at all.  The Light dropped in its position in the night sky after my son came into the house to get us.  First my husband and then my self, telling us that we could see a UFO and aircraft circling around it.  This continued for over and hour and at this time which is now 21:23 the planes are still circling, but the &#34;light&#34; is gone or we are unable to see it as a result of the trees.<n>

We spotted about 12 blue/green lights in a wide V-formation. They glided slowly in unison across the sky. Then we saw red/orange lights in a similar formation gliding behind them. As we &#34;connected the dots&#34; of these lights we clearly saw that we were looking at a single invisible craft that resembled the Stealth Bomber&#39;s shape but this thing was the size of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not sound like an aircraft; it had a low and constant HUMMMM. It was flying low and slow as if wanting to be noticed. I commented to my family members that maybe it was a government plane of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said, &#34;No way. That thing is huge AND you can see the stars right through it!&#34; I was relieved that four of us witnessed this. The craziest part was the invisibility.

It is very credible because it was seen by entire city, the event was of 2 hours and a person had also shot 15 minutes of its fottage as well as extreme digital close up of it showing it to be revolving from the base that is a classic saucer shaped and for first time i have seen such a detailed image probably from a digital camera. These were broadcast on national tv i am sending you a link to official news, it has a ad in start (usual tv people) and then it has news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In India there is absolutely zero trend of people claiming to see ufos , neither it is such a big thing that people deny , people in India take it casually and do believe that its alien aircraft and unlike USA or other countries where people start claiming hoaxes and make money out of books etc , in India there is no such trend, but events are happening and this city is just 50km from my town, and there are military bases here so i was always looking out for ufos coz once i saw a triangular giant ufo in another town away 60 km but in different direction, but unluckily i could never take a shot .

They would meet in the middle and then spread out into a cross. They repeated this pattern. They moved slowly and gracefully. At first, I thought they may have been some kind of animal but the repeated pattern ruled this out. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. I don&#39;t know what it is.

This was witnessed from Ahwatukee looking south.  It was a very quick viewing and disappeared after a few seconds.  I am very interested who else saw this.  I saw several small planes appear several minutes after the light passed, however they were moving extremely slow compared to the green lights.  The planes travelled in roughly the same direction as the lights, but not the exact path.  The noise from the planes made it extremely noticeable that the lights had no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was looking toward the Southwest and my wife was looking toward the Northwest. It was light enough that the sky still had blue color in it. All of a sudden I saw a single round white-glowing object with a whitish tail going at a very high rate of speed from the East going towards the West. The object looked about the size of a pea at arms length and its tail length was approximately 10 times the size of the object. The tail size was the same as the object at its start and tapered to a point. In other words, the tail was cone shaped. It was just a glowing white object without any other features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was at about a 35 degree angle from where I was sitting. It was traveling at such high rate of speed that by the time I told my wife to look, it was gone. It was traveling in a straight line from East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen a lot of “shooting stars” and satellites in the California Mohave Desert near China Lake and their behavior was entirely different from what I saw yesterday evening.  And, no, this was not Venus or Jupiter in the Southwestern sky. They are stationary and the object was moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can supply a sketch of the object and its tail if needed.<n>

I turned left onto lake rd. &amp; looked in my rear view mirror &amp; noticed this object going straight down like a helicopter, not a plane, &amp; appeared as if it was landing or going over the horizon.  The object was initially traveling at the speed of an airplane &amp; then began landing flat at no angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to have been within (1) or (2) miles or so away.  It was 1:49pm in the afternoon, sunny skies &amp; I don’t recall any clouds in the sky.  It was not a blimp nor a helicopter.  The closest description I can give its maneuver is a b-52 with the landing capabilities of a harrier jump-jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the dyersburg police department &amp; dyer county sheriff’s department on the next day to see if there had been any other reported sightings of this object, but I was told there had not been.

Then I saw 2 rows of 3 large rectangles of blue white glowing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each rectangle could have been house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me.  This reminded me of the Star Wars movie and the engines of &#34;The Millennium Falcon&#34;.

Very bright with a long tail. I have a standard size window facing north and it completely filled the window pane. I watched for a moment then went outside and it was gone...but interestingly as I was watching the sky 2 different planes went across going the same direction, from the west to the east. I&#39;ve watched many a meteor shower and have never seen anything like this!<n>

While all of this had happened there were three planes (clearly planes) that had went through my view also, two in the opposite direction and one went in the direction the blinking lights had went.<n>

Also that night, I myself and two other adults observed in the western sky, a blue-green large object that just came down from the sky and sat in the lower sky for at least 1/2 hour.  It would totally fade out, and then light back up.  It was unexplainable.  I also see lights that  fly around in the clouds that almost look l;ike spot lights, but there is no begining or end to these lights, no place of origin as you would see with spot lights.  Anyone else seen anything like this in Riverside??? thanks all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Soldiers had obviously been drinking, but i decided to humor them and listen to their story.  They claimed to have seen 3 reddish-orange lights appear in a triangular formation and a fourth a little ways off that flew around the (clear, dark)sky, and then faded out of sight.  As I was in the process of listening to them, suddenly one pointed at the sky, where I saw a single light had appeared in the sky, it remained stationary and then faded out after 10 seconds or so.  I tried to dismiss as a flare, but then realized their was no noise or smoke trail, and it was too high.  after another two minutes 4 lights appeared, 3 in a line and one lower to the right.  As i watched the furthest right light in the line faded out, just a 5th light appeared on the left side of the line, almost as if a giant cylindrical object was slowly turning. after 15 secs or so this display faded out completely.  myself, the two initial witnesses, and 2 more soldiers witnessed this.  afterwards at roughly 2 min intervals, the single light would reappear. this happened 3 more times or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of reporter:  22 year old male, intelligence analyst for the US Army, completely sober at time of sighting, (am sipping a beer as i write this report however), highly skeptical about aliens, but willing to admit that this was a flying object I could not identify, and am familiar with most of the worlds aircraft due to my job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  Ft. Gordon is the signal center for the US army, lights looked like they were possibly overhead of the new NSA expansion being constructed on post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: one guy did videotape incident with his phone, however its such poor quality that lights are not visible, all you can see is people pointing at the sky and yelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

11/20/08 22:15|Ft. Myers|FL|||Possible meteor, however light rose then accelerated rapidly across sky flaming then went out.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67093.html|151|ndxe200811| Possible meteor, however light rose then accelerated rapidly across sky flaming then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I get off work at 10:00 pm. As I was driving home this past Thursday evening (November 20, 2008) after work, and at around 10:15 pm I spotted an object that I cannot identify, so I am filing this report. I believe it was probably a meteorite or meteor, but as you will see below it does not fully fit into this category.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in Ft. Myers, Florida, and live in Cape Coral, about a 10 mile drive from work to home. I take a back route most of the way,, which is dark, with very few  street lights. All of a sudden I noticed a bright light going up from my right to high overhead, in front of me. My first thought was that someone was setting off fireworks, and this is indeed what it looked like at first. When fireworks are first ignited and shot off, they can ascend with a bright light and with a little wobbly motion. Then they burst when they reach a certain peak. Well this light started out like that, a bright light ascending, with the little wobbly motion like fireworks. However, when it reached a peak, instead of bursting into a fireworks display, it shot straight across the sky at very high speed flaming or flaring up as it went, as a meteorite would burning up in the atmosphere. Then it went out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it appeared to be going up at first, then across the sky accelerating to a very high speed. I am not a pilot or very familiar with height or speed, but even when it appeared to level out and shoot across the sky, it really didn’t seem to be very high up in the atmosphere at all. This is one of the inconsistencies with the meteor theory. The other inconsistency, of course, is that it appeared to be going up at first, maybe from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In short, I don’t know what this was, but I was looking in the paper and listening to the radio for reports or a meteor or an unidentified flying object in my area for that night. I haven’t heard anything, but I am sure of what I saw. The sky was clear, and anyway it was low enough to be under any clouds that did exist. If anyone else saw anything in this area on that night, I would like to hear about it. Also, and this may be way off base, the next night there were several large helicopters flying around the area at the same time, and in the same general area.<n>

No flashing beacons or white lights were present and no distinction of the vehicle could be identified. I have witnessed these very same lights in previous weeks and never could follow them long til they never lit up again and disappear. Vehicle moves from East to West at the same attitude flying low over residential area, rural area, and dairy farms. The lights appear to flash in a sequence one side slowly energizes and lights up then as it gets its brightest the other side starts to light up as the first side darkens; lights last for roughly 2 seconds. Vehicle covers great distances in seconds, after I think its gone and I can&#39;t spot it anymore it reappears on the other side of town only to flash its lights again and disappear. Lights resemble the yellow orange glow of afterburners.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects then stopped in mid &#39;flight&#39; (flight was somewhat erratic- they would come close to each other, and then separate, but would always stay within a finger-width (from my perspective) apart), and then reversed direction and headed South.  I lost sight of them when they moved past my effective field of vision- they moved very quickly- the whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds from when I first spotted them above my house.  I thought at first they were high flying birds, but the strange flight characteristics (sudden direction changes, and what appeared to be terriffic speed (if they were as high as they appeared to be)) convinced me otherwise- I&#39;m a college educated person who is extremely skeptical- I would not be writing this if I didn&#39;t truly believe that what I witnessed was something very odd indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was approximately 5 miles from spalding when I noticed a strange light in the sky.  Thinking it was just an airplane I watched it wondering what kind of airplane would have that light.  As I was watching it it split into two lights.  The lights disipated within seconds and so I thought it was maybe a flare or a firework.  I glanced back over probably 30 seconds later and noticed three of the lights in a cluster.  These quickly disappeared after about 5-10 seconds.  I then got on the phone with my boyfriend to see if anything special was going on such as a hunting thing since it was the season or if people were just messing around with flares.  As I was on the phone with him looking in that direction 7-10 lights in a row lit up in the sky one by one and stayed lit for probably 5 seconds and was gone.  I rushed home to pick up my boyfriend to go back and see if it was still there but nothing showed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 06:25 p.m. my friend told me he just saw three orange lights perpendicular to the ground in the sky, just above some trees.  He said the lights dimmed out from top to bottom.  I had him explain what he had seen to me since they dimmed out and I was unable to see them myself.  A few minutes later he said he had just seen the lights again but they had gone out already.  I looked in the area of where he was saying he saw them.  I saw a red light further to the right of where I thought he was pointing, from a tower, and he said that was not the light he saw.  At 06:32 p.m. he told me the lights were back.  I looked over and saw two orange lights in the sky above the tree line, parallel to the ground.  I saw a string of orange light that was not as bright as the lights, shoot from each ball of light in an upwards arc back down to the same level as the one it originated from.  When the strings of light would come back down to the same level of the ball of light, a new ball of orange light would appear.  The ball of light it originated from would dim away.  The string of light would then dim away from the originating ball to the new orange ball of light.  The two lights were the same color and the distance of the strings appeared to be the same but the lights were not arcing/forming new balls of light at the same time.  The lights repeated this process about eight times each and lasted approximately 30 seconds total before both lights went out completely.  The lights were moving from North to South.  I am unsure how far away they were but they appeared within a mile distance from where we were.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It was definitely an UNIDENTIFIED flying object.  Very cool to experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called a friend and asked him to look outside and he did, he said he saw the heart shaped object as well. I was amazed when I got home I sat in the patio and just starred at it for about 40 mins, all of a sudden it vanished quickly. I got up and walked about 4 feet just to make sure it did disappear, then about 10 seconds later a little red circle appeared but this time it was moving in circles. I also called my mom and brother to tell them about the objects, the were on the other side of town.

I observed three bright lights in the clear western sky of San Diego, Ca.  The two lights were at 30 degrees and roughly a horizontal configuration and at first seemed similar in brightness as Venus in the early evening sky.  A third light of equal brightness maintained position roughly 5 degrees higher at an 11-o’clock position during the entire observation.  As I drove west toward the lights, I observed the lights maintain a distance from one another that at first blush the lower two could have been lights positioned on the wing tips of a commercial airliner.  As the lights moved closer together, I assumed it was an airliner, even though I could not see a wing structure or fuselage; it seemed to be moving away.  The only major discrepancy was that the lights brightness and size remained the same. Just a few seconds after the lights nearly merged, they separated, moving quickly apart in an upward/downward arc, positioning themselves in a vertical configuration.  As I continued west, I lost sight of the objects, as area I entered was predominately covered in a low-lying fog.  At the moment I last saw the objects they were continuing to move apart and separate as individual entities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unidentified sky objects. Not and airplane. Not a helicopter.

There were a few planes in the air, and this was clearly not one of them. It appeared to be a very bright star, literally falling from the sky. It reminded me of a flare coming out of its ascent.  It moved slower than a ‘shooting star’, was definitely brighter, and there was almost a blue-green tone to the light it gave off.  About half way through the drop, the light stopped very briefly, then started again until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been a number of things, but I wanted to post in case anyone else saw this.<n>

Never seen anything like this before, they were so spread out over such large area that they were not airport lights, moon light, or city lights. Cloud movement seemed to fade them out.  May still be visible as I type this.  I&#39;m guessing, some phenomena with ice crystals or possibly the northern lights (though what I know of them it didn&#39;t seem to be these either).

This went on for about 10-12 minutes. the lights were a bright white color, but because the sky was a little overcast (clouds were moving into the area) some of them appeared to be multi-colored and long in shape. Later that evening I was shocked to see that our local news cast here in the Philadelphia area (WPVI-CH6)was broadcasting it as a big event, and that it was reported and had been seen by other local viewers, who had even included clear eyewitness photos. This was very strange because here locally there have been in the last month alot of UFO sightings here in our skys!!!    You can find more of what was reported at www.6abc.com<n>

Then what looked like a white dot:  appeared about 100 meters from behind the plane moving west.  This unknown aircraft was moving at a pretty good rate of speed and had no exhaust trail of any kind.  Watching this unknown aircraft as it moved I realized that what appeared to be a white object, was the reflection from the sun, and had to be a significant size to give off that amount of glare.  This unknown aircraft continued to travel west as it disappeared for few seconds a couple of times.    Than returned in the same flight path heading west.  There were no clouds in the sky or area that would obscure my sight.  I watched this unknown aircraft for a good ten to fifteen seconds before it completely disappeared 50 meters or more before the ridge line.  Four or five seconds after the unknown aircraft disappeared. There was a small exhaust trail 50 meters to the south of where the unknown aircraft was last seen coming over the ridge line traveling east.  The unknown aircraft did not appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I am very interested in stars so sometimes I take my dads binoculars to look at the stars. On this cold autumn  night i saw lots of stars and when i looked to the right on almost the edge of th tree line a saw this white and shaded blue egg shaped opject. It seemed to hover and there was no noise it was dead silent. It moved very fast but gracefully and I saw a beam of light come out from under it. The glowing object suddenly it becxame bigger like it was coming to me and I backed up behind my dads truck to stay safe and the object was still in sight. Then the object had a red beam of light and beamed it into the front of it and then turned white and quickly dissappeared into a white light and it fell behind the trees. At first it looked ligth a shooting star but to the naked eye it looked like an egg shaped object. I used the buinoculars to look at where the light went off and I saw it hiding behind the trees. Then it disappeared. When I went to look into the night sky again I noticed that the place I was looking at was full of the object there must have been lie 30 of them!!! They started to blink and I ran inside still watching. They suddenly dissapeared 30 seconds after. This sighting is not a hoax and it is real!!!! I feel that this wass very freaky. If anyone else saw it I know they would feel this way too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She resides in Upper St. Clair, PA, a quiet suburb south of Pittsburgh.  I arrived at her home about twenty after eight in the evening. There was a very light snow on the ground. I went to the house, let myself in and found her in the kitchen. After making some coffee and sitting in the kitchen talking for about a half an hour, she went upstairs to change from her work clothes into her pajamas. I went to use the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom faces the front of the house and the road. She lives on a very quiet road with very little traffic, but numerous homes. Behind the house is a very dense wooded area that prohibits any light from coming up the hill from the road below. The road behind the house is about a ¼ mile from our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was using the bathroom sitting on the toilet when I heard her go down the stairs. As I was finishing up, I glanced through the venetian blinds as I have a millions times in the past when I was younger. What I saw has occupied all of my time awake and while asleep for the last 24 hours. The shadow of her home was cast on the snow, a perfect silhouette. No car lights would have been able to accomplish this because of how steep the hill and how dense the woods are behind the house, even with sparse leaves on the branches. I yanked up my pants up, zipper down and shirt untucked and bolted down the stairs. My mother was frozen like a statue staring out the back window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw at that point we will remember for the rest of our lives. In the sky only about 10 yards above the tree line, there hovered a perfectly quiet but blazing ball of orange light. I would estimate it to be about 15-20 yards in width. Not oval or cylindrical, but perfectly round. It was very strong and not pulsating or shifting. It was not blinding us at all.  I looked back at the front window, this time from the family room and still saw the house silhouetted on the snow. I continued to stare out the back door that leads that leads to the raised porch as I opened the door. No sound, no heat, no vibration just this spectacular ball of light as I stood on the porch. I ran back in to get a camera down in the game room on the basement level. As I ran to the back door under the porch, the ball became smaller and smaller as it seemed to be yanked back into the sky at an extremely rapid pace. I never got a shot off. I didn’t have time to turn the camera on unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, she asked the next door neighbors, who are an older couple, they saw nothing. Nor did a woman she knows through church who lives on the hillside about 1 mile away from our home, directly behind the house. I believe what we witnessed was not of this world. This was certainly not a noisy helicopter or some child playing a prank. This was a real, tangible, perfectly silent ball of orange fire well above the tree line. If anyone in this area had a similar encounter from the evening of 11/18/08 I would be highly interested in hearing your account of that evening. Can anyone help us understand this?<n>

The person who came and got me to witness this is presently a law enforcement official. He had watched them for a minute or so before getting me so the total time that he had witnessed them and the time that I got a chance to see them was around 4-5 minutes. They were headed in a northeast direction and were basically in a straight line at that point as they got near the horizon and also seemed to go up and down in altitude. They were filmed with the squad camera for maybe less than a minute or so although I haven&#39;t seen the tape to check for quality yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out into the ocean and a little bit above the horizon I saw a light (the color of a streetlight) blink on then off, almost like the light faded off.  It was a circular light. My friend did not see this. As we kept walking in the same direction, I look up in the sky and notice the light again. I told my friend and he watched. There was a light (same one as before) come on and fade off, directly next to the right of it (with some space in between) I saw another light come on right after the first one and fade away, then another did the same (3rd one). For a little while they did not show up, until we started walking back to my car when we look up again and see another light come on higher up in the sky than the other times, as that one faded away diagonally to the left another light faded on and off. That was the last we saw the lights. About 10-15 mins later, we noticed that around the moon there was an outline of perfect circle of what looked like clouds. After a while it disappeared. I have seen shooting stars and planes before and this was definitely not one. The lights seemed to be stabilized and not moving when we noticed them, the lights stayed on for about 15-30 seconds before they faded away. Other than that I really do not know how to explain what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my cousin were on my terrace on the 1st floor. It had just become dark and we were chatting enjoying the cool air when I happened to look up (I like to look up at the sky a lot) and saw this huge light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say huge because no star, meteorite, satellite, planet etc is that big and bright as this object was. It was around 4-5 times the size of Venus as seen with the naked eye. My first thought was &#34;it&#39;s a plane&#34;. But then I thought planes didn&#39;t fly that low (it was pretty low for an aircraft) and also planes weren&#39;t circular in shape and I had never seen a plane with lights that huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was seen as a huge circular light slowly gliding through the night sky heading towards the north. Me and my cousin rushed to the 2nd floor terrace to get a better view of the object and followed it until it was lost from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t noticed it at first but my cousin pointed out a circular cone of light extending down from the circular object. After seeing that circular cone of light pointing downwards I was pretty sure this thing was not something made by man. Up to that point I had entertained the thought that this might be some type of secret military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I forgot to mention that the object made absolutely no sound at all. It was complete silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Carlow, Ireland ) and observed to the west a rectangular ( slightly fuzzy, dimensions not clearly defined ) craft rising up from beyond a line of beech trees in the West. It was gold/orange/red in color - no sound, no strobe or red/green lights. I would guess it was distant  a 2 € coin held at arm &#39;s length. It moved slowly up along the line of beech trees from west  to the southwest, never going above the top of the trees. I would guess it was 5 miles distant from my initial view point and 2000 feet in the air. As it rose up slowly behind the beech trees  I took some items out of my car into the house i was staying in and was gone for a minute. When I came out it must  have accelerated at unimaginable speed and was visible high up in the SW sky - which was clear of cloud -  and disappeared from view totally within a minute. Shortly after, a commercial jet appeared in the NW with strobe / red and green lights and clear sound of engines high in the sky going E to W. Clearly distinguishable from what I saw. Maybe I saw a helicopter disobeying flight rules but I would surely have heard some noise/seen lights.<n>

I have seen the same aircraft 7 times now in the last month.  I am a well-educated woman in her 20&#39;s who is not crazy, but I can&#39;t explain what they are.  The aircraft is shaped like a trapezoid (although it may be a triangle- I only see it at night), and has two extremely bright &#34;headlights.&#34;  On the two corners that stick out most there are lights.  One has a red light, and the other has a green light.  The colored lights lead me to believe that it is man-made, but I&#39;m not aware of any aircraft like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It doesn&#39;t have wings like an airplane, and it doesn&#39;t fly like an airplane.  It hovers over an area, very low.  I frequently see them when I drive west on the PA turnpike Tuesday evenings.  I drive from the Willow Grove exit to the Downingtown exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw the UFO at 6pm in Southampton, PA.  Then I saw it again (or another one) 1 mile from the Downingtown exit of the turnpike.  That one turned all of its lights off a few times, plunging it into darkness.  I thought that was odd.  Last week my husband was in the car with me and saw it, too.  He didn&#39;t know what it was either.<n>

The object was viewed for about 7 seconds and it just disappeared in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not drop in angle at anytime but maintained a straight line from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was brilliant orange on the right end of the cone, then brilliant blue, and then a brilliant blue white like ice color on the end.  Was very large and not as high in the air as the numerous planes that traverse our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exciting to see but a mystery.<n>

The object was bright enough to illuminate the tops of the Ponderosa&#39;s along my driveway. The object was seen through the trees. I was looking south out the window. Of course, I jumped up, ran to the window just to see it disappear behind a clump of trees and the mountains beyond my ranch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval shaped, and was first seen about 45 degrees off the horizon at 160 degrees on the compass in the south, and  it came in from the east and was heading west, at a 45 degree slope. Lost sighting at about 200 degrees compass heading. My ranch is 6 miles out of Sprague River North, and 18 miles out of Chiloquin, Or. south. The object emmitted a bright white light, no tail, and actually illuminated the treetops on my place. Duration of sighting about 3-4 seconds, this was enough time to make out shape. Time was about 5:35 pm. Size, if I was to hold a nickel coin at arms length, that was the size of this object. I ran to the end of my drive which is over 1000 feet long with binoculars, and no other obects or aircraft were seen. Clear skies, temp about 48 degrees. Estimated distance of object, undetermined at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area we live is very remote and rural, horse and cattle ranches. Little or no commercial aircraft traffic flies in this area. Only an occasional helicopter during fire season. What this object was &#34;NOT&#34;. It was not a helicopter or private or commercial aircraft, as I did run out on my deck within a split second of seeing the object... no sound, or any collision lights red or green, or flashing lights. Could this had been space debris? Possibly. Could it have been the space station? No. Could it have been the Space Shuttle? No. Could it have been a meteor or fireball? NO, it had no tail, was a solid white very bright oval shaped object with a aura/halo around it. I have witnessed hundreds of not thousands of falling stars, meteors, watched comets, ect. It did not meet the characteristics of a meteor or falling star. Could it have been space junk? Yes, possibly. My background is the USAF, and I am familiar with many aircraft. It is undetermined at this time what this may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summery; Reason for posting this report is to see if there were any other witnesses from this Southern Oregon location. Someone may have had a better viewing of the object from a better location and can fill in some more details on this.<n>

Two smaller craft of unidentifable shape but blinking with red and white lights were heading towards the north west. They were flying in formation - one was closely following the other. Initially, I presumed they were military jets, but I could only hear the noise of one aircraft engine. When they reached the spot where they bisected the flight path of the commercial aircraft, both smaller craft immediately turned at a 90-degree angle and began following the commercial jet. These smaller craft did not bank, as airplanes would do - they simply changed directions in an instant. Once they changed direction, they also changed color.  Instead of blinking red and white, they were blinking red only. Further, the location of the lights changed as well. Instead of appearing to be on either side of the craft, a series of red lights blinked in sequence as if along the side of a circular craft.  At this point, two additional craft appeared; they were even smaller than the initial two and they blinked with only white lights.  They flew near the initial group for a few seconds, then they flew off rapidly in two different directions (one to the southwest, the other to the northeast). The commercial aircraft and its companions were ultimately lost to sight, continuing to head southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a southwest passanger airliner headed to Burbank, however the color became a glaring bright orange.  I then thought it was the reflection of the sun setting behind me, although I could not account for a reflection from the sun, as the sun was falling behind the mountains at this time.  Its downward trajectory then sped up and I thought it was a plane going down.  It stopped floating hung for a few seconds and then disappeared.  It was either a huge meteor burnign in the earth&#39;s atmosphere or something from Edwards.<n>

I couldn’t really determine if this was light generated from within or reflecting from the sun.  They each were extremely small to the naked eye, almost impossible to see if you didn’t have excellent vision.  You had to be looking in the right spot.  Again, they were sort of close to the moon, which is the only reason I even saw them in the first place.  If you weren’t looking in that direction, you probably wouldn’t even have noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued walking and watching them, they were moving, but not like a plane or any other “normal” flying object moves.  They were moving rather slowly, yet when I would look at them again (after continuing my walk, then looking up again), one of them moved off and away from the other two.  I kept looking and staring, with breaks inbetween.  This went on for at least 30 minutes, at which time the third one had disappeared, then after awhile, the second one, then eventually all three of them disappeared..<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be hovering most of the time, although there was some movement, then when you’d look again, they’d be in a different spot relative to the “day” moon and relative to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, they were round and not like anything you normally see in the sky.  They definitely were not a plane or a balloon or a helicopter.  They were round and didn’t behave like these things.  Helicopters don’t go that high to my knowledge.  And, from the naked eye, you could tell they were a very far distance away (high up and far away).  Again, they couldn’t have been planes.  Planes don’t “hover,” to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for listening.<n>

Passing through Ben Wheeler (26 miles West of Tyler), we observed a sphere shaped object at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet traveling westbound. This object appeared to be 1.5 miles South of the Highway, traveling parallel to it and was solid gray in color. At no time were we able to see through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For 25 minutes, we had a visual on the object, with the only lapses being caused by us driving through wooded areas which would block our view for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 25 minutes, the object appeared to change to a more elongated form, with the aft section beginning to droop. At this time, we started noticing more detail. We would estimate the length to be 300-400 yards in total. At the top portion, there appeared to be an object protruding out. The protrusion was black and gave the general appearance of a small fixed wing aircraft in a gentle climb. The middle of was still gray, and the drooping section appeared silver in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we lost visual and sped up to try to get through the tree lined area. We pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot, and began to scan the skyline. We had lost visual for 3-5 minutes while clearing the trees and pulling into the parking lot. We never regained visual.<n>

We then turned left onto Oakwood going towards Mercy Medical Center, and took a right on 9th, going west. We then again saw the exact same formation of dots in the sky. It was me, my mom, and my friend who saw it.

It was between 8:30-8:45 p.m.  From the corner of my eye (southwestern sky) I noticed something high in the sky.  I turned my gaze to see a horizontal series of orangish lights, maybe 15 total.  They all looked about the same size and an equal distance apart.  Almost as soon as they appeared the lights blinked out one by one, starting at one end and going off in succession.  I kept my gaze to that area in the sky but didn’t see that long line of lights again.  I did see a smaller number of these sam lights together in a line and one off to the upper left.  These lights blinked off one by one, also.  Initially, the sets of lights I saw after the initial horizontal series was also in a horizontal pattern but as I kept heading west, I noticed that 1) the lights got farther away/I got farther away from the lights, and 2) the short line of lights seemed to be on a diagonal in the sky, with that same one light to the upper left.  I c an’t imagine I was the only person to see these lights, especially the initial series of 15 as they were very close to the highway.  The lights didn’t move from that horizontal or diagonal line except for the one.  I looked to see if there were any news reports of these lights but didn’t find anything.  My experience seems to be similar to some others in that same area (Oshkosh, Omro, etc) that are also documented on your website.<n>

Upon looking I saw two orange/yellow lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They initially were directly beside one another. Then coincidently as I looked my friend asked what I was staring at... he then looked back with me and slowed the car down to a near halt. At that exact moment the craft/light that was on the left side did a U turn going from being on the left side to quickly pacing under it and was then positioned on the right side. Almost simultaneously the light then shot up directly into the sky about a mile or two...and then sped up forward going over our head. All while the other light/craft stayed hovering motionlessly in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t make out the shape, all I can really say is they were two orange colored orbs. The flight pattern was indeed incredible. Something I&#39;ve never seen before. I couldn&#39;t help but fix my eyes on to what was taking place. I didn&#39;t get scared however I had a incredible feeling of joy. But once the two crafts disappeared after about 3-4 minutes. I felt sort of depressed not knowing what to believe.<n>

The saucer sort of turned itself invisible in the blink of an eye, and blurred my eyesight for about 10 full minutes.  From what I could tell, the saucer details were very complicated.  It looked a lot like a stretched out black and white picture of saturn under a shadow.&#34;  The above description is what my daughter said she saw.  It happened while she was walking her dog in the greenbelt near our house.  On her way back home at dusk, she saw this UFO and she also said that after it became shadowy black to blend in more with the sky, it shot off at a very fast speed away from her, which would have been in a southerly direction.  She said that her cell phone stopped working for a few seconds so she could not call me immediately after the incident.  She made a drawing of what she saw very soon after getting home so I will scan it and email it.  Would be nice if you can email me with a case number so I can reply to your email with the scanned image.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on my back porch, which faces eastward.  I saw an object (1) approaching from the northeast to the southwest, at an incredible rate of speed.   There was was a bright white light, but then the light went out.  I could faintly see a shadow in the night sky as it moved southwest.  I could only estimate the elevation at 2000 - 3000 feet.  Shape and color of craft could not be seen.  There were no other observers but me.  This all happened in approximatly 6 seconds.  No sound was heard.<n>

It was moving northeastwards towards the Atlantic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was an airplane, but the brightness remained constant even after it passed over us.  Also, it was constant and not blinking, so we did not think it could have been an airplane.  It was way too bright to be an airplane, regardless.  So this circular, very bright light is moving towards the Atlantic, and in the span of 5 seconds it goes from very bright to dim to disappeared.  We think it accelerated very quickly and took off outta here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was moving smoothly and steadily across and in a v-shape.  There were these light sorts of hazy amber lights.  I tried to count as they flew over my head--it looked like 6 lights and I couldn’t determine how far away they were, but I was so enamored, that I realized I wasn’t even breathing.  I watched as it continued to fly in a SE direction and then it disappeared.  I looked around for someone else to witness but it was too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, then I called my mother on my cell phone to tell her what I saw.  As I was speaking to her another one appeared so I got of the phone and ran to my neighbors.  It more or less was heading in the same direction as the last one.  By the time my neighbor got outside it was gone.  Of course, I was thinking to myself, &#34;I must have a witness or people are going to think I’m loosing it.&#34;   Well, we waited a few minutes but we didn’t see anything.  I asked my neighbor if he’s ever seen a UFO and he said ‘Actually, yes about 30 years ago I was with my young sons and I pulled over to look at my car’s engine at night and they noticed a flying object that was flying sporadically and not like an aircraft at all.’   So, after that I went inside.  But decided to go to my other neighbors who has a roof top deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went on the deck and I thought to myself, what are the chances we’ll see something else.  About 10 – 15 minutes went by and the same amber triangular lights appeared from the Northwest.  This time they were closer than the two other times.  They flew right over our heads!  5 lights total in a very tight v-shape absolutely silent and the lights looked like two equal lines in a cross shape.  My neighbor’s mouths just dropped open.  None of us could utter a word and then, like the others, it disappeared to the SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all shared what we witnessed then just a couple minutes later and shooting star/meteor looking bright light shot over our heads and fizzed out.   After that we didn’t see anything else.  Quite remarkable.<n>

I have seen many planes in the sky, many helicopters, many military planes, many stars, planets, the moon;  I have never seen this, this obviously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light that I saw in the sky, which I first mistook for the Northern Star, was, to me, shaped like a star, just a speck of light, so bright, its like the Northern Star amplified times 10.  Even behind black clouds, I can see this light, a trait I have never before witnessed in any object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would sit in the sky, completely stationary, for a while, about 30 minutes or so, then it would slowly move.. the most amazing thing to me is when it actually starts moving, all over the place.  It moves seemingly closer to me, or further. This may be the light glowing stronger or weaker, because the light would, after about an hour, begin to dim slowly.  It would dim, and re-light a little bit when it was out, then move more, and stop again, when the light was out, I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The even more amazing thing is, I think I saw the SAME OBJECT IN THE SKY TODAY, which makes me think that it might be a plane or something, using a clock, coming back every day, I do not know for how many days this has been going on.  I started at it the second day today, and it did the exact same thing as yesterday.. it was the most eerie thing I have ever seen in the sky.  The amazing thing is, it might be in the sky tomorrow at the same time... I am going to get a large group of friends to go and watch this thing at the same time tomorrow.

Two weeks after I posted that as I was leaving my home on my way to work.  The sun had just come up and there were scattered clouds high in the sky.  I glanced up as I noticed something that glistened in the sky and I saw what I can only describe as a space ship.  It was silver, domed top and a fin on the back.  It rose into the sky, hesitated in between the clouds and then sped off so quickly as if to disappear from sight.  I would say that it was over Houston Texas or just south of there.  I keep wondering what it possibly could have been doing during the darkness of night.  I thought it strange how much it looked like the old Sci-fi movies space ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circular object that I saw in our subdivision on my previous experience still appears in the sky and has not left.  I watched until late that night as it moved slowly up into the sky.  It always seems to be in the sky and appears before dusk long before any stars are visible.  As I drive home from work it gets closer, appearing larger.  Stars don’t do that. One night it came down very close over our home and appeared almost as large as that first night that I saw it.  It seemed very threatening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went 7 hours north of our home to Brownwood Texas and just before dusk I looked into the sky and there it was.  I nudged my husband and pointed at it and he nodded.  We left Brownwood Texas the next morning at 5 am.  As we were driving south there were several strange light formations in the night sky along with the circular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A co-worker even asked me if I had seen the strange light that appears before dusk.  She said that she began seeing it just before Thanksgiving and it could not be a star since it appears so early and sometimes seems to get brighter as dusk falls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d prefer not to be aware of these things as I am becoming very concerned and would like to know what is going on.   Are they just observing us or is there something else?   My husband and I are both college-educated people and not easily spooked, but I don’t feel safe.  I’m scared and I need answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/17/08 06:15|Chesterfield|VA|Oval|5-10 Seconds|Orange Light at 75 Cent Toll Plaza Chesterfield, VA|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66978.html|230|ndxe200811| Orange Light at 75 Cent Toll Plaza Chesterfield, VA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my home in Chesterfield, VA at 6 AM to drive to work in the West End of Richmond.  Between my home and Powhite Parkway I saw 2 &#34;shooting stars&#34;.  I was the only vehicle at that time of morning approaching the 75 cent Powhite Parkway toll plaza headed north bound (there was only 1 or 2 cars headed southbound).  As I was slowing down to drive through the Smart Tag lane at the toll plaza, I glanced in my rear view mirror and saw a glowing oval shaped orange light right smack dab in the middle of the back glass of my minivan (on the outside).  As soon as I noticed it, it zipped off to the right (passenger side) out of sight.  My first thought was that I had almost been rear ended and in just a split second I was thinking &#34;But HOW?  I&#39;m the only vehicle out here.&#34;  I even drove slowly through the toll plaza looking to my right for the vehicle that I thought had almost hit me and saw nothing.  I was the only vehicle.  As I continued on down the road, I was wondering what the heck I&#39;d just seen and was arguing logic in my mind.  The orange light had the shape almost of a vehicles parking light, but for a vehicle to have it&#39;s parking light that high up at my back glass, the other vehicle would have had to have been higher than me (and I think I would have seen that).  I also started noticing the parking lights on other vehicles and all car lights (other than headlights) have that black grid pattern thing within the light, so you do not see just pure orange or pure red, you also can detect the black grid within too.  THe light that I saw was not light that.  I may have only seen it for a few seconds, but I remember it clearly.  It was a pure orange/red light and when it &#34;zipped&#34; to the right, it seemed to have a light trail.  I was talking about the &#34;weird&#34; thing that I saw when I got into work and someone pointed out that we were supposed to have had a meteor shower yesterday moring before dawn.  Yes, that can account for the 2 &#34;falling stars&#34; I saw on my way to the tool booth, but I don&#39;! t think a falling meteor would &#34;hover&#34; at the middle of the back glass of a minivan and then zoom off to the right (in a straight horizontal line, I might add).  I am just baffled by what I saw.  I drove through there again this morning paying close attention to the possibility of any orangish lights around the toll plaza that may have caused a reflection of some sort.  There are NO orange lights that close to the toll plaza.  Well, at least my husband and my parents DON&#39;T think I&#39;m crazy because they agree that it just does not make sense.  I only wish that my 7 1/2 month old son could talk and tell me what he saw.  He was in his carseat facing toward the back glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after, i noticed a light moving from behind a mountain on the horizon.  I originally thought it was a plane but it then started circling the mountain at great speeds.  I stepped out of my car and heard nothing, so i got back in and watched.  After a few minutes the object rose up into the sky and dimmed, after about 3 or 4 seconds it lit up instantly and started doing bigger faster circles around the mountain, even coming close to the reservoir at times.  Once i saw the object&#39;s circles starting to get closer to me i got scared and turned my car on and drove home, very frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was 300ft above the road, about the size of a railroad boxcar, round and perhaps 1/4 mile ahead of me. It made no noise, but seemed to be moving in the same direction, following the road. I would guess it&#39;s speed was roughly the same as mine(65mph) because it remained at the same distance from my vehicle as I was moving. I observed it for 5 seconds, then it simply vanished. About 5 minutes later, further down the road, it appeared again, over the freeway, same height. This sighting lasted roughly 10 minutes, and it vanished again. As I entered the merging lane to the freeway, it appeared again, this time on the opposite side of the freeway. I wasn&#39;t able to keep my eyes on it and merge, so how ong it remained visible I couldn&#39;t say, but I saw it for at least 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I focused my eyes upon it and noticed bright lights along the bottom of the object in a circle. They looked like they had a bluish color to them and I possible saw some green lights. The object was hovering very slowly barely moving but was moving back and forth. It stayed above our car for probably 10 seconds before zooming off into the distance. It appeared to be hovering low and was pretty small. I hope this information helps you in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be about 5 or 6 miles away from us. As we came up to the intersection of U.S.26 and 31, a second object appeared to the left of the first. They were fading from bright to dim. As we turned the corner and pulled into our drive, we observed the the first object get very bright, then vanish. Then a third object appeared just left of the second one. They were about 2 miles from us at this point. They seem to have red and blue (or greenish) lights flashing when they became very bright. I watched them for about 10 minutes longer, fading in and out, then, they both vanished. There were clouds moving behind the ojects, so we know they were not stars. We have witnessed these kind of events many times from our back yard. We know they are not Air Force jet flares, because, the night after, when we have reported these events, the jets are in the same area as we report, shooting off flares. There is no comparison to the events we have seen to the flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night, at approximately the same time, but closer to us, we witnessed the same event, except there were only two this time. The first showed up, fading in and out for about ten minutes, then the second showed up. I called my daughter, who said that one was over the top of her house. Then she said it dissapeared. About the same time, the first light seemed to have moved to the west close to the horizon, then shot off to the north. After about ten minutes longer, the second object, just seemed to fade out, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t have a video camera, so, I couldn&#39;t take a movie of it, but,I did report it to Forsyth county law enforcement. I don&#39;t feel it was a local plane or helicopter; anything around here wouldn&#39;t stay that long in one place,or move, then go back to where it was and hoover again; It was 6pm and already dark when this all started. There are a lot of cell phone towers in this area. My son thought that maybe, that had something to do with it; as he observed the object high in the night sky, he thought it was moving around high over the towers and one side of the object seemed to be emiting a total red light. I did see the red light as I meantioned before, I went into the house after observing for long while; as it was too cold for me. I don&#39;t feel there isn&#39;t much more I can add to this.I am interested in learning more about the mysterous unknown ufo&#39;s. I use to be a skeptic, but, I now believe anything is possible, as I have seen a lot of things in my life that some people would consider impossible or crazy. A lot of people don&#39;t believe in bigfoot, but, I became a believer when myself and family had an encounter with one. I know it may sound weird or crazy; but, could these ufo&#39;s have something to do with the bigfoot being here?

I guess their altitude was about 1,500 feet.  I thought they may have been fighter jets, but they made no noise and their flight patterns seemed rather irregular, almost as if they were bouncing around.  And the closer I got they didn’t seem to have wings but were perhaps saucer-shaped.  I tried to keep them in my sights as I drove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a little more than a minute they turned and headed back up the shore, towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated above is flawed.

The blinking light was white and moved quite rapidly across the path of the incoming shuttle to the space station.  It appeared to be flying and then disappeared.

I first noticed a bright light and then the UFO moved down and to the left and disappeared quickly. There was no exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While looking out towards the Atlantic Ocean, coast line began roughly ½ mile in distance from where we stood, I noticed a quasi orange/amber light very thin, and rough 1 inch wide (from my perspective) slowly flying from the south parallel to the coast line, then do a zigzag and dart off north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was that this was a shooting star based on what I have seen in the past.  Also the shape of the object was very similar to a shooting star as well.  The thing that really caught my eye was at the slow speed it traveled.  Most shooting stars are gone in a flash not too mention the altitude of the object was in our atmosphere, not outside.  Once I noticed how abnormal it was I then brought the object to the attention of my friend to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.  We had just left a bar and were not completely sober, but we were also not completely inebriated either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw the same thing, and it was completely legit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take care,<n>

We were just like stones didn’t know what to do or anything. It just moved slow over us and it looked like it went down to a field passed the woods so we took off running towards it and it was just gone no were in sight we are positive that it wasn’t anything like a plane or a helicopter.

The dot moved VERY quickly and was unlike anything I had seen before.  I went inside to ask my wife to come out and look to see if she could see anything.  I then looked through the eyepiece again and an object that appeared to be the same, moved at the same speed in the exact opposite direction (a reciprocal heading).  I&#39;ve seen the ISS with the naked eye and this object was NOT the ISS.

11/15/08 19:55|San Francisco|CA|Triangle|7 seconds|It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON IT'S BOTTOM|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66945.html|249|ndxe200811| It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON IT&#39;S BOTTOM<n> <n><n> <n><n> This current sighting, seen Saturday night on 11/15/08 at 7:55pm was a flying object over the moon lit night sky of San Francisco, California’s outer sunset district near my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ABOUT ME: I am a retired electronics Eng, 59 and working part time. I also have a FAA Private Pilot License and I am a backyard amateur A. I own a 12-inch reflector and a 6-inch refractor. On this night we were experiencing a warm front over the S.F. Bay Area. 20 degrees above normal for this time of year. The moon was ¾ full and just visible over the eastern horizon. Because of the moon lit sky (the suns light reflecting off the moon of course), birds were easily seen flying overhead at higher altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SIGHTING: I was sitting on a backyard recliner drinking ice water using a  8 x 40 quality binocular to star qaize. My eyes were night adapted and just a few seconds before seeing the UFO, I was looking at the constellation Pegasus, I drifted my binoculars upward to look at a nebula when I saw what looked like a large black bird or object flying where my binocular was pointing. I thought how strange the shape as it did not have a bird shape. I continued to look into the binocular and followed this dark object heading 180 degrees south in a straight line. It was almost overhead, maybe within a ½ mile east of my home. It was flying with NO LIGHTS and NO SOUND. I live with 15 miles of SFO airport and see many planes turning and overhead for final approach with the red left wing light flashing and the green right wing lit. But this craft had no lights at all, made no sound. It was low enough be heard, but no sound was heard! If it was the size of a 747 jet, then I would say it would have been about 1000 to 1200 feet above SL. What was more unusual to me was its belly. It had 3 round disks shapes connected to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So in conclusion, It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON ITS BOTTOM. No airplane wings or rudder or ailerons were seen. It seem to be running in a stealth mode maybe because of its low alitude, but the moon gave it away. I was lucky enough to have my binocular in that direction otherwise I would have never seen it with the eye alone. I followed it for about 7 seconds until my shed blocked further viewing. I ran up to tell my wife and boy but they did not believe me at first but the next day they seemed more convinced by my going on and on about seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PAST SIGHTING: My first was in 1967 over the Pacific Ocean standing on the San Francisco beach and it was at night. I never reported it as I did not think anyone would believe be. But, I did tell friends and family. If you want information on that sighting I would be glad to tell you? I am interested if others had seen it.<n>

As I looked into the sky, I noticed lights from an airliner traveling nortbound. Moments later at a much lower altitude (probably 5,000&#39; or less), I observed a series of dim white lights in the shape of a chevron. The lights were proceeding in a northwest direction towards the ocean at a very high rate of speed. Initially, I thought it was a formation of fighter jets however as the object flew closer, I could see that the the lights were fixed and part of the object. I then thought that it might be a stealth fighter, however the object was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former police officer and currently own a private investigation firm. I have never been a UFO buff nor have I ever paid much attention to all of the books and shows about the subject, however I know what I saw and it certainly was not an airplane.<n>

11/15/08 18:20|Seattle|WA|Fireball|25-30 minutes|Flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dime|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73189.html|252|ndxe200811| flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dime<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6:20 PM, Saturday Nov. 15, 2008 I walked out onto my porch to have a cigarette. While I was lighting it I looked up and saw a dark area with an immensely large orange light towards its rear. I thought &#34;wow, that plane has HUGE lights&#34; and continued my smoking. While I watched it slowly move eastward (my porch faces south) something didn&#39;t seem quite right as the orange glow was Way too large and a plane would have not taken that long to travel such a short distance as it had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess general location, I would say coming from the west, south of Bremerton but north of Tacoma in a straight path eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went inside, told my husband that something just isn&#39;t right with this thing I&#39;ve been watching, it looks like its on fire, and pulled out the binoculars. As I focused in for a closer look, my husband came out to see what i was talking about. The plane/dark object indeed seemed to have the entire tail end of it encased in an orange flaming mass (round mass, mind you.. there were no tendrils or trails.. more like liquid fire contained in a glass ball). I handed the binoculars to my husband who took a long look as well. I thought maybe I should call the airport, then thought that they would probably have a dead-on view of it anyway. We sat and watched it continue eastward .. it seemed to slow and then just &#39;hang&#39; in the sky for about 10 seconds before heading straight south.  It did not turn south, it ended its eastward movement and began its southward movement (the phrase &#39;turn on a dime&#39; comes to mind).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I held my arms out in front of me with one finger at the point where I first notice this object and the other where the eastward movement terminated.. it measures a measly 15-16 inches between. Thus far it has been a good 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southward movement was faster than the eastward. It seemed it would pass directly over Tacoma, the bright ball getting somewhat smaller as it went. When it looked as though it was flying over the Centralia/Chehalis area, the fire went out but I could barely make out a dark grey/black dot which seemed to descend rapidly for a second before I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw this... but I&#39;m sure someone had to have seen it. I contacted King 5 news via their tip line.. but never heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the wolfpack of vehicles I was in ( about 15 vehicles) turned onto a straightaway there was an object in the sky that resembled a lightbulb with the threaded part taken off the lightbulb. It had a texture like the moon but was orange and seemed to have a arua about it like heat rising in the desert, from the bottom to the top..<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the vehicles hit there brakes at the same time. Myself and another guy in a truck realizing this may be a one in a million event raced to where the object was over the road. The only time I took my eyes off the object was when I bolted into the emergency lane. As we both approached the object it turned toward the south and flew away with the same heat signature that appeared to surroound the object. It was almost like the orange part that I could see had disappeared when it turned, and the back part of it was the same color as the sky, almost morphing invisible, except for the heat trail. Even though it moved quickly it moved with such fluidity. By the time me and the other guy got to where it was it looked as if it was 20 miles away over Greenville, SC in maybe 30secs to a minute. I pulled over next to the guy and he said what the hell was that? I shrugged my shoulders and he drove away. About 5 minutes later I was home telling my wife what happened. I watched the local news that night and for days and no reports. I just wondered if anyone else may have seen the same as me and the other guy. I have never seen anything like this in any report or pictures anywhere. It appeared to be more biological looking then mechanical.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Walking out to my car, way outside the city limits, I looked up and observed a disk shaped object flying from north to south in a straight line almost directly above me and very high up but underneath the clouds that were there.  I was standing at the front of my car and before I had a chance to reach the truck of my car for my binoculars the object had flown out of my sight.  It did not veer off, but what caught my attention besides the speed was the fact that it was fading in and out, as to say it was there and then it wasn&#39;t and it continued that clear across until I lost sight of it.  I am fourteen miles from a Navy Air Base, and this was not one of their planes, nither was it a commercial flight as about five min. later I observed a commercial craft, that I could see clearly, flying from east to northwest and higher than the object I had observed.  The object was a silver color with a light blue tinge as it faded out and reappeared.  I have worked near air fields, at White Sands MB and am a retired police officer and have seen a lot of strange things.  This is just another one I tried to eliminate from other things I have seen.

11/15/08 17:00|Reno|NV|Triangle|8-10 seconds|From flock of birds, to plane crash, to WTF is that!|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66928.html|257|ndxe200811| From flock of birds, to plane crash, to WTF is that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My rental vehicle was parked at the Grand Sierra Resort facing east and I was overlooking a small lake called MGM Lake. I was waiting for management to arrive at a new building where I was installing software.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was in the rental vehicle listening to a college football game I noticed fish were jumping out of the lake. I live in Las Vegas and I very rarely get to see any wildlife &#39;in action&#39;.  So I sat there and watched this for a few minutes when my eyes caught sight of what I thought were three birds. It was dark and I figured that lights in the distance had illuminated the birds. The birds were headed north but then banked to their right and completed a 270 degree turn. Now they were headed west, right in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area is very close to the airport and after I figured out the lights were not birds, I braced myself for a plane crash because the 270 degree turn was very fast, low, and heading lower. But once it straightened out, the lights started moving in my direction. I watched this object silently move across the sky (Had to be only 300 FT off the ground and I&#39;d say roughly 1000 FT in front of me and I cannot judge the speed though I&#39;d guess 200 MPH) and it went behind a tree line. I looked to the other side of the tree line expecting to see the object but nothing appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I glanced up before the lights passed the tree line I could not make out any object but there were certainly three points that if you connected the dots you could make out a triangle. The rental car was idling but there was very little engine noise and I did not hear any noise from the object. There were no blinking lights and what made this even more interesting was about 20 seconds after the object went behind the tree line a plane landed. It was a small plane and I was thinking they had to have seen something!  I was in a complete sober state of mind. I called the Reno PD to see if anyone had reported the same thing and they said no.<n>

11/15/08 03:00|North Topsail Beach|NC|Light|20 minutes|Glowing orbs in my room|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85359.html|259|ndxe200811| Glowing orbs in my room<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I  were at our beach house in Surf City N.C.  I&#39;d like to state that I had not been drinking or doing drugs of any kind and was not dreaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up in the middle of the night as I usually do and got up to watch some tv in the living room.  For some reason I decided to stay in bed and try and go back to sleep even though I never do and am up for at least 3 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid there looking around the room noticing that it was not as dark as it should be at that time in the morning.  I could see everything quite clearly....except for the upper corner of the bedroom.  At first I thought I had something in my eye, so I rubbed it.  Still, I couldn&#39;t make out the corner.  It was pitch black, about 18 inches in diameter and fuzzy, as if you put on someone else&#39;s prescription glasses.  Everything else was clear.   I kept trying to focus thinking how weird this was that I couldn&#39;t make out the corner.  All of a sudden a small glowing white ball of light came shooting out!  Then another and another.  Five in all, zigzagging through the room.  No sound.  I got the feeling they were excited that they had made it in.  I just laid there thinking &#34;what the hell is going on here?&#34;   They all gathered directly over me as if they figured out that one of us was awake and could see them.  One of the orbs shot down and went from the size of a half dollar to the! size of a tennis ball and was about 10 inches from my face.  Here&#39;s what I saw.  Energy..a glowing ball of pure energy.  I could see right inside it.  Moving, sparking, like an organic computer.  It stayed there for about 10 seconds then popped along with the other 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the part that bothers me the most.  Immediately after they popped it was if I had been given a tranquilizer.  I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes open and fell asleep.  How could I of fallen asleep after seeing something like this? Why didn&#39;t I wake my husband? Shortly after this experience I began vibrating. Sounds weird but, I woke up one morning and I thought we were having a small earthquake until I realized that it was me, vibrating from my core, not my heart.  I wasn&#39;t having heart palpitations.  This happened off and on for about a year. I usually would just lay there for a few minutes until it subsides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

See a glowing golden light in the distance, I first mistook it for an oddly colored star.  It stayed in place for a few seconds -- then moved at an increasing rate North from its location and disappeared.  As the object moved it picked up speed and once it was moving rapidly it left a golden trail of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It acted unlike a shooting star in the sense that it hung in place for a few seconds, before traveling off and leaving a streak which was quite long.<n>

All of a sudden I saw a strange light formation move across the sky. It was a V like object, similar in shape to a formation of flying birds that appeared for about 30 secs and moved steadily across the sky. It traveled in North Easterly direction, passing from Orion belt, under the moon toward Orion&#39;s head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t appear to be a solid object (like the point of a plane) but was rather like a collection of dim orange lights. It made no noise. It is very difficult to describe its size or how high in the sky it was but it seems like it was as high as the stars and was, very roughly, about the size of 2 Orion&#39;s belts in a V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw seems amazing similar to this report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53154.html<n>

I looked away to make sure my eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me and the lights were still there.  Next thing I no I look up and there is a craft just came over the top of me. It was travelling at a low speed and about the height of five stories.  There were 3 different lights on the 1 craft all in a line. I heard n noise coming from the craft.

Temperature was cold and had many layers on to stay warm. Full Moon at time, and light pollution made the cloud layer above me radiate ~orange (this is usual where I live). There was no wind. It was quiet outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was sitting facing North, surrounded by tree&#39;s and housing - obstructed view of horizon all round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was reading an astronomy book illuminated by flashlight glancing up now and then to check on cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glanced up one time;  Spotted object from aprox NNE at maybe 60 degrees elevation it traversed across the sky to the left of me and then behind me to maybe SSW. It was probably not above 60 elevation the whole way and &#34;seemed&#34; to be at constant altitude. I say seemed because of the speed of the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very quick, at first I thought it was a meteorite - but it was not quite as fast as that, I have seen many &#34;shooting stars&#34; which are really fast, and less meteorites that leave smoke trails which usually seem slower, I can&#39;t say how fast this thing was - it wasn&#39;t as fast as the meteorites I have seen but it seemed in the same &#34;league&#34; as that kind of speed - that&#39;s the best way I can put it!  Object traversed sky very quickly perhaps &lt;1sec maybe &lt;2sec I can&#39;t say but it was fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was definately round shape, had a noticeable but small apparent diameter, can only guess distance but &#34;think&#34; it was quite far from me so perhaps not &#34;tiny&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was silver or metallic, had a &#34;brightness&#34; to it or infront of it or around it (it happened fast sorry!). Though I can&#39;t say if it was illuminated by moon or ground lighting (orange in area) or if it glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was below cloud layer. There was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object streaked across sky and that was that!  There&#39;s a chance it was a meteorite but the speed seemed &#34;wrong&#34; just slower its hard to say exactly. Perhaps it was, but I thought I would post this here in the hopes someone else along its groundtrack saw it, although at the speed it went I consider myself lucky to of seen it!  Nb: I am almost certain it was 14/11/08 but it might of been 13/11/08<n>

I was in my back yard playing with my dog when I noticed a craft of some sort hovering in the sky to the West about a half mile away.  This craft was not moving and it was making no sound that I could hear.  It had a huge amber color light that was pointing in my direction.  This light was not blinking or moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for about 15 minutes and this object still did not move.  So I went inside to get the binocculars.  I went back outside to view the craft/object and it was still in the same place.  When I focused on the object with the binocculars I could see some sort dark craft around the light but as quick as I focused on it the light went off almost as if they could see me watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then I only saw the darkness of the object for a couple of seconds and it just disappeared but in it&#39;s place were a huge area of small green lights that were flashing in a very large circular pattern but sporaticly and then after a minute or two I couldn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then clouds moved in and I came back in the house.  I do not know that if someone was in a &#34;helicopter&#34; if they could see me looking at them from that distance and if they could see me why would they turn the light off abruply plus the light was not like a light that you see on a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all.<n>

It was dark and cloudy with a few breaks in the cloud.  I noticed to my right in the sky, below cloud level a bright red object with a red &#39;glow&#39; around it, almost like your eyes are watery and blurry when you look at a light at night. . In fact I wiped my eyes to make sure they weren&#39;t watery.  I stopped dead in my tracks because of its brightness and it appearred low and moving quite quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appearred to pulse or flash but only very faintly I did have a thought that it was an aircraft that was actually on fire and dropping. Although aeroplanes do go over where i live they go in a different flight path to this and even helicopters don&#39;t follow the route that this light was going.  There was hardly any breeze and as it went directly over me i couldn&#39;t hear any air craft noise at all it was eerily silent,  i was expecting some noise as it was below cloud level (later on in the walk a plane went over and i could clearly hear it and it was well above cloud level).  It could&#39;nt even have been a microlight as there was absolutely no sound. It was moving inapproximately south to north direction. In coming flights to Birmingham airport go in a NW to SE direction, helicopters tend to go the opposite direction. It moved very smothly and disappeared as quickly as it appeared i stood and watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds.<n>

The motor pool is very near El Paso airport, and I have an interest in aircraft, so I stopped to look at it.  It was traveling south-southwest in a sort of &#34;drifting&#34; manner.  It was brown, and &#34;cigar-shaped&#34;.  I waited for its angle to change to determine if it was a helicopter (a common sight patrolling the border), but it&#39;s shape was too evenly &#34;cigar shaped&#34; so I was certain it was not a Blackhawk, and it seemed to lack the vertical stabilizer and wings of fixed-wing aviation, so I stood there and stared at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not at a very high elevation, maybe 1000 feet above the ground (I&#39;m not a trained aerial observer, so I can&#39;t gauge elevation at all), and it seemed to be just &#34;drifting&#34; over the border, like a dirigible, though it&#39;s path was even and consistently south-southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to some of my comrades as I was seeing it, but they apparently didn&#39;t see it.

I do this route frequently as I am a test driver for Roush Industries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on Interstate 15 going north towards Beaver Utah. Approximately 20 miles south of Beaver Utah. I was just past the intersection of I-15 and Utah 20.  I was on the phone with my mom as she is elderly and I call her every day.  I noticed high in the sky in front of me and slightly to my left a shiny object in the sky.  As I first saw it I thought it was an airplane with the sun shining off of it.  I glanced back at it and noticed no vapor trail, no motion, and the shape was circular versus the shape of a plane.  Still shiny as if the sun was shining off a glass surface.  I continued to watch as I was driving. I began to explain it to my mom as I could not determine what the object was. After watching the object for about 5 minutes I decided to stop and get out with my camera so I could use the zoom lens and get a better view. I was curious because the object did not appear to have moved for more than 5 minutes. Still in the same spot, no vapor trail, no motion up-down or sideways. I pulled over and was describing it again on the phone when the phone stopped working. I assume I had just lost the connection as that area is fairly remote. I reach in my camera bag and got out my camera. I looked up and the object was still there. I got out of the car and looked up and the object had vanished. I scanned the sky, double checked my windshield to see if maybe I was looking at a spot on my window, I scanned the sky both with naked eye and then my zoom lens. Nothing. The object was gone and my phone was ringing.<n>

I woke up in my bed unable to move or scream.  My girlfriend was sleeping right next to me, and my 93 pound Great Pyrenese puppy was asleep at the foot of my bed.  I moved my eyes around to my avail on my left side I saw what looked like a rounded expandable antenna held by a white hand moving towards the side of my head.  My dog was woken up and immediately jumped up off the bed and started growling and went into alert mode.  (Im a former Police Officer and K-9 Handler I work in Corrections Now and my dog is a working dog.)  Then my dog got low to the ground and was out of my sight.  The hand holding the antenna was now pointed at her and she stoped barking and growling.  I then was able to move a litle and was filled with unbridled rage.  I moved my eyes to the left and saw my alarm it said 5:35 A.M.  My left hand that had felt like it was being held down as I stated before being paralyzed now swung to my left with all the force in my body and made contact with a hard but latex feeling body. Immediately I jumped and looked to my left where this being was at previously and it was gone. And my alarm now stated it was 5:38 A.M. My girlfriend now woke up i told her to run into the living room and the dog followed her, I grabbed my 9mm Glock went into my living room cleared that room and cleared my apartment. I do not know what this was and why it had happened but I prayed to Jesus Christ to help me and he did. I have had many strange experiances but not on this magnitude and have always felt like I am being watched. I work 11pm to 7pm so I dont have to sleep at night. I work in corrections now so someone is always around be it another staff member or an inmate or my dog. I can never have enough weapons either I am always buying a new gun every few months, and just always feeling like some one is going to try and take me or invade my home. If someone could help me out with this please do so, or maybe just a few helpfull words of encourgement from people that this is! happeni ng to as well. Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully Submitted<n>

While in my car I saw out of the corner of my eye a bright light moving across the sky maybe 1000 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I turned to look at it thinking it was a plane landing at Albany International Airport.  But the light was too bright to be a landing light and it was going in the wrong direction.  Planes landing at the airport have to land either north to south, south to north or east to west.  This was going west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be a bluish-white Sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 20 to 30 seconds until it disappeared into the clouds above Troy, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was but my friend told me to report it so I am.<n>

My desk faces my office window that faces north.  Approx 2:20 am, I happened to look up and away from my computer to see a BIG  bright red light in the sky, it was circular in shape.  The light was moving very slowly in and eastward direction.  I watched it while sitting at my desk until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore from my seat.  I stood up to see if it was still there, it continued moving in an eastward direction until it had disappeared behind the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the light seemed to get a little bigger at the end and it took off extremely fast and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/13/08 21:20|Shelton|WA|Oval|5 seconds|Oblong shaped, silent, moved quickly across the sky and was glowing like pink beach glass.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67433.html|280|ndxe200811| Oblong shaped, silent, moved quickly across the sky and was glowing like pink beach glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:20 I was on the back deck of our house calling the dogs in.  I watched an object move from the SSW sky to NNE.  It was clear night with no clouds. It took approximately 5 to 6 seconds to entirely cross the sky.  It was silent.  It was shaped like a short grain of rice.  It was the color of light pink beach glass softly glowing from within, and with a slight aura of white around it.  If I held my hand at arm’s length with a short grain of rice, this is about how large it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my husband to come, but it had already disappeared behind the trees.  3 to 4 minutes after observing the object, a commercial airliner crossed the sky from SW to NW on an approach path to Seatac Airport.  I am reporting this with the hopes that perhaps the commercial airliner saw something, or traffic control at Seatac.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a fixed wing and helicopter Pilot.  I grew up around Seatac airport and McChord Air Force base.  I am very familiar with the appearance and flight patterns of conventional aircraft.  I also grew up watching for satellites and am familiar with satellite flight paths across the sky. This pink, slightly oblong object was very unique; like glowing pink glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It needs be said that in my life I have seen alleged UFOs.  As a 10-year old (1966) my entire family (7 of us) watched an object above the desert in Utah.  It was composed of two large metallic objects with 7 small metallic objects in between the two larger ones.  We all watched it for over 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While camping at Mt. Rainier in 1984 I and my children (7 and 4 at the time) watched as a blinking object flew a path ascending toward the mountain before suddenly streaking out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here in Shelton, I have experienced several occasions of a very bright flash in the night sky.  Sometimes it is one bright flash.  Sometimes it is a series of erratically timed bright flashes.  The flashes are always in one stationary spot in the sky and are not accompanied by any visual trajectory common to a helicopter or aircraft turning or flying; just very bright white flashes, and then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This last Sunday, December 7th, 2008 at 16:43 I observed a very bright white light sitting stationary in the SSW sky above the tree line.  At first I thought it was the first star of the night, however, no other stars were visible and this light was brighter than any star or planet I am accustomed to observing.  I am also aware of metal objects commonly reflecting sunlight at that time of the day in the SW and W sky.  This bright light sat stationary for 10 minutes.  I had my husband get his detachable rifle scope with a high power telephoto capacity.  I propped it on the back of a chair and we watched the bright light.  It never changed position.  It suddenly just disappeared as I was viewing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated in turning in my reports because I understand that in order to substantiate anything or lend credibility, it is best triangulated or viewed by more than one person at one place in time.  I was also concerned I’d come across like a quack because I have seen objects before.  I support all research and work being done in the field of extraterrestrial existence, however, and believe it is important to move forward and turn in a report when it happens with the hopes maybe someone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned in the flashing light reports to MUFON, but the local investigator for MUFON in Olympia has a very jealous wife who felt uncomfortable with him talking to women (even though I am happily married and have no interest in playing around).  He began taking report my report from me but abruptly stopped telling me his wife was jealous of me.  !!??  That was just a weird extraneous experience but it effected how eager I was to turn in any report to MUFON.<n>

I Noticed it seemed like a different light pattern than any I had seen. It had 1 light in front and 3 in back, all yellow and 2 red lights on what appeared to be the wings. As I watched it it suddenly began to slow down. Then it fully stopped in air. It sat there for about 10 seconds. Then it continued in the same direction slowly. Then suddenly without turning around it started moving quickly in the other direction. I continued watching as it sped away about the speed of a low flying leer jet except it was much quieter almost inaudible over the sound of a nearby road. Then it disappeared out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She started freaking out and said what is that over there. I looked over and saw three huge and bright lights that lit up one after the other and were all horizontal and next to each other. They were not your normal lights and the object was definitely in the shape of a saucer. The lights were very bright and very large however they were not blinding to the eye.  The moon was full and it was very bright so you could see the object very clear. The lights disappeared and then reappeared about .25 mile to the right. I would estimate that this object was a half a mile in the air and about 1-2 miles away from us. After it lit up two times it jus disappeared. There was no streak or anything as it went away. It simply vanished. There was also no noise. This happened in a very rural area and was definitely not anything military. I think the object was about 100 yards or larger across. This was definitely a UFO and nothing else. I am positive. My girlfriend is a non believer in UFOs and is now a believer. She was so nervous and scared that she started puking on the side of the road. I am still blown away with what we saw and hope someone else spotted this the same night and will place a report. We are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the garden with my partner having a cigarette.  I was facing the East anf my partner was facing the West.  She asked me what some objects were that were behind me.  When I looked I could not believe what I was looking at as there were six global, orange, almost firey coloured globes drifting silently from the North, headed South, towards the English channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to obtain some footage using my mobile phone which does identify 2 of the globes but they are very distant, in the footage.  To the naked eye they were probably about a mile away and very easy to see.  They were in a random formation although one seemed to be the leader.  They were travelling slowly and quite simply disappeared one by one.  I went upstairs to see them more clearly by which time 5 had disappeared but one continued over the channel and then equally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The visibilty was good although there was reasonably low cloud in the area.  My step daughter witnessed the sighting independently from her bedroom.  There was a power cut in our street only, at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting to the Police and they in turn asked the Ministry of Defence to contact me.  I was given a number and left a message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For fear of sounding like a lunatic I have not reveled my name to anyone other than the MOD and police but I made an enquiry with the local newspaper and they told me that no one else reported these globes and the police said the same.  I find this odd as they were very visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As yet I have not been contacted by the MOD which makes feel like a fool as all 3 of us saw them and nobody else seems to have.  What happens from her, do I just forget about it?  Will I ever know if it was a phenomenum or aircraft?  Kind Regards<n>

I have about a 20-30 minutes drive home. It was dark and cold, and the road I was driving on is near a park area. There have been many deer accidents on this road, so I always go cautiously especially after dark.  While scanning the empty fields on both sides of the road, I noticed a fireball in the sky to my left. It was very large. Behind the ball of fire, was a tail. I believed it to be a meteorite, but had never seen one so large. A shooting star, it wasn&#39;t. I slowed down to about 20-30 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road was dark, and no other travelers either way. I should have stopped the car, but knew there was no place to pull over. I watched the road and the fireball. The fields on the left had been harvested, so my view was clear. The fireball was going the same direction as I was, perpendicular to the road.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes. The fireball went behind some distant trees, then it was gone. I believed it to crash. There were also 3 blinking &#34;strobe like white lights&#34; ahead of the fireball, which I assumed to be on towers of some kind in the distance. The fireball crashed before these lights.  I haven&#39;t been able to locate these strobe lights since. I looked for them, knowing they would be my reference point.  A few weeks later I saw on the news that Canada had a meteor crash to the ground. From the video that they showed,  it looked exactly like what I had seen...except mine was more red and orange. Also in the Canadian video, the ground and sky lit up on impact. My fireball did not make any light when it hit the ground.  (assuming it hit the ground) If you have information on a meteor in my area, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I quickly drove past, I noticed that the light had disappeared.

I then went outside again, by then it was just going into some light cloud, the cloud seemed to banish the glare which was coming from the object, this is what i could see, it looked like three orange squares in a triangle formation and from each square it seemed to emit a faint white light in a arc pattern outwards from above the orange squares, it then entered some thick cloud and the object was gone.I phoned my dad and asked him if his discription was similar to mine,he said he seen the orange light but he could not make out any detail when it entered the cloud, he lives about a mile away from me in the direction from which the object came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a avid sky watcher and aircraft entheusiast i do know that this was not a conventional aircraft,sattelite or the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The sound traveled SE in a matter of minutes and was not heard of again.  The noise sounded like a hot air balloon.  I am familiar with hot air ballons because I have traveled in them several times.  The sound was as loud as if I was traveling inside the basket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to catch a glimpse of what could be making that noise, but all that was witnessed was a form of a fast moving dark shadow traveling almost invisibly through the faint light in the dark sky. It looked as if the UFO had adapted to its surroundings and became a cloud in the night sky.  The only obvious sign that it was not a cloud was the speed of the object traveling farther away, which could not possibly be the cloud that I could see with my naked eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had no prior experience with UFO&#39;s and would say I am a non-believer.  Until, this!<n>

11/12/08 16:10|Randolph|MA|Cigar|2 sec|Possible Tomahawk Missile|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70222.html|300|ndxe200811| Possible Tomahawk Missile<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and three additional friends were on our way to New Hampshire for the weekend. I was sitting in the front passenger seat while my girl friend drove. The other two sat in the rear. The craft was traveling at extreme speeds so it was difficult to see any real detail. The best description I could give was something like a Tomahawk missile. I was a police officer in the Air Force for ten years and have a great deal of experience surrounding air craft. The craft traveled from right to left across the highway (US 93). The terrain dropped to my right and rose to the left. I was fortunate to see it as it approached. My girl friend witnessed it as it passed to her front and above. If it was not a Tomahawk, (which is what I could have sworn it was) I have no idea what it was. The size was difficult to determine again due to the speed, but the fact I witnessed it and judging from the road and surrounding area I would speculate it was the same size as a Tomahawk or larger, most likely larger (it is difficult to see a Tomahawk at full speed passing directly in front of you). I looked at my girlfriend and she at me. She said what he fuck was that? I did not want to poison her thought process and simply asked her what she saw. She thought she saw a missile and kept asking me why would a missile be going over the highway and where is going and so on. I explained I did not know any of that and told her maybe it was a test rocket or such. To this day it troubles me whatever it was. I have seen many craft public and secret and the fact it was traveling over a U.S. highway bothers me the most. Anyway this is first time I have ever participated in such a public forum. Due the current state of affairs in this area I felt compelled to share.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So we both looked towards the object, suddenly it started to lighten up, a bright white light, got bigger while I could see some, kind of electric aura around the light, the next moment when it was getting a bigger light ball It just disappeared right in front of our eyes, no clouds around, in the middle of the clear, sunny, blue sky.<n>

It paused at about 80 degrees to the S for approximately 4 minutes.  I called for my wife to get our 1000x video camera and the binoculars.  Binoculars were too shaky.  It moved S to N, again slowly.  I was able to video it for a few seconds because of the shakes.  It was a very bright red with white center fireball but I couldn’t make out any distinctive features of it.  After it had passed over head to the Northern sky it faded out of sight at about 45 degrees to the horizon.  If I would have to say it was something for certain I would say a flare attached under a bag or something.  The altitude, however, was very high.  When it appeared to not be moving it could very well have been moving up instead of directionally horizontal.  I don’t really know.  I did video it briefly but the video isn’t clear enough to determine what it was.  I do live right in the flight path of an airport (within 2 miles).  I know how they move through the sky.  This object had no FAA lighting.  A few planes flew W to E near and what appeared to be under the object.  They didn’t seem to take note of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up ahead just above the tree line there was strange lights moving slowly to the west. At first I thought it was an aircraft but the lights were huge and none were blinking there was two big lights not overly bright but like two big bay windows there is no houses in the area and these lights were above the highest peaks in national forest as I was heading west they would have been on the north side of the road.I witnessed these lights off and on while I broke out of the trees for about 15 miles I lost sight of them as the canyon got narrower. I work nights delivering groceries around the northwest. I was heading back to the yard in portland oregon my shift had started at 9:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was so bright and beautiful I dropped my laptop and ran back inside to get my mother.  I was so excited, I was screaming at her to hurry.  She and I then exited our home and walked to the driveway.   The object was still positioned in the air, displaying a large mass of bright color spectrum.  While I was watching this object, my mother started to get panicked and ran towards the house and stopped.  While I was watching the one object, my mother started screaming at me to look at another one.  The one I was viewing started to dimmer and slowly lifted upwards and left view.  As I was turning down the steps towards our home, my mother said oh my God, Oh my God look...I didn&#39;t see the second one.  She states that the second one was just as bright but &#34;shot&#34; through the sky from right to left, then stopped on a dime, then again shot across from right to left and disappeared as fast as it had appeared.  This was the most beautiful display I have ever seen in my life!  I have seen other object, lights that appear to be stars...but this was straight out of a movie.  So beautiful!!!!  They are here!<n>

There were approximately 20 lights in a circular formation which came up very quickly. We ran west across our field to try to see what they were. I called my 19 year old son at 7:37 on my cell phone to come outside to see the formation. By the time he arrived outside, the lights had broken apart, and there were about 10 lights which then scattered moving west. We did not have a video camera or digital camera on us to take pictures. All I had was my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several aircraft circling for landing in the vicinity, as we live about 10 miles north of DFW airport. These lights were in the proximity of western Flower Mound.<n>

My husband and I were sitting on the balcony of our hotel room.  I was looking in the direction of the forest.  I saw a bright white circular light with a yellow outline, rising upwards.  This light stopped suddenly, remained stationary for about 10 seconds and accelerated downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 20 minutes, this light reappeared and seemed closer, or bigger.  This time it jumped to the left and right a few times which would leave a tail like yellow trail.  It stayed for about 10-15 seconds and again accelerated downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 20-30 minutes it reappeared again and stood still before accelerating downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about one hour this light reappeared for the fourth and last time, this time a lot closer. This time it rose slowly and stayed still for a few seconds then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning I did my own research to make sure there are no military bases, etc. in that area.  There is nothing except forest, mountains, rivers and waterfalls.  It is a totally deserted area.  I spoke with a few of the locals and they confirmed that there are not even any roads in that part of the forest.  The locals also informed me that UFO sightings are becoming very common in Central-East Brazil.<n>

Watched 3 real UFO craft enter above Orion&#39;s Belt in a streak of white but it stopped its streak. One shot straight for the small stadium and no steak was emitted, stopped just short of the main lights to the stadium and hovered around the stadium, wisping from side to side just outside the small stadium as if unhindered from Earth&#39;s gravity.  The second seemed to dart in and away from the stadium.  The 3rd was flying up at incredible speed and just stopped in mid-air.  It turned in several degrees of turn I am not able to fathom.  No manned or unmanned craft is capable of such of what I saw.  An incredible sight I kid you not.  The 3rd one showed its belly as it darted up and down in the air with no plausible way to decern how it was able to stop in mid air and go a different direction.  I saw 7 (seven)bright blue and white rotating engines underneath as it flew vertically yet diagonally down for several hundred feet and then it stopped.  This duration happened within about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes time.  Captured a bit on my camera but not enough to give an accurate description.  Sorry. I waved and hollered at the objects to get closer to me but I was not within audible range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The belly of the craft as would be the belly of all three craft had 7 bright blue and white lights.  The shape appearred to be hexigonal or octagonal.  I could see their shapes as their engines made streaks of light in their turns.  Phenominal.  I&#39;d say their weight could not be determined.  The size, if they came face to face would have to be about 13 maybe 14 feet in diameter.  No sound was emitted when they entered, hovered or left.  They left because of a police helicopter was patrolling near the exact area which the 3 craft were hovering as the police helicopter was approaching slowly as it neared the one near the stadium... all three disappeared into the night sky.  As if all were informed of the threat, the police helicoper, and shot out back into space.  After they left, the police helicopter made a b-line to wherever they saw as well.  The one I was watching, didn&#39;t change shape, none of them changed shape, they clearly had a top and bottom to them. The top had a curvature to the front of the craft and all three were extremely versitile.  Hope this is enough for further investigation.  Remember. Police Helicopter saw them too.  Very real, not a hoax or a stupid joke.  Odd thou, when they stopped from time to time in flight, I heard no sound, no sound at all.  No shockwave of any sort was audible.  10 years ago, saw a different craft hovering in the same position before the small stadium was built. Tomorrow I will investigate precisely where I saw one of them hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sometimes the light would shift to gold. As it approached it appeared to be a large arrowhead shape with the underside of the craft covered in white lights with red and blue on the outside, like running lights on a plane, but going far too slowly for a plane, and the entire triangle was filled with lights.

I cannot tell whether this object passed under the aircraft flight path or over it. I could not make out a definite shape but the light never brightened or dimmed - it looks to me like the exhaust of a Shuttle taking off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot estimate its speed but when I first saw the light it was perhaps over or a little to the South East of Wilmslow, Cheshire and it took one minute to pass from there and disappear in the city lights haze of Manchester some 12 miles to the North.<n>

Our backyard is fenced and locked from the inside also...after my daughter was born we filmed on our phone an orb hovering over my daughters bed in back and forth patterns...definitely not random movement as would be expected with dust particles or something picked up by the night vision cameras...also it instantly disappeared when my wife cracked the door to see if she could see it with her own eyes....I have no idea what to think of these occurrences!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

11/10/08 18:55|Murfreesboro|TN|Flash|1-2 seconds|When I was on my way to church I suddenly saw a green flash.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66835.html|320|ndxe200811| When I was on my way to church I suddenly saw a green flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday evening November 10th 2008 at about 6:55 pm (which is dark at this time of year) I was driving on my way to church down a narrow curvy road with a bunch of trees on both sides when I suddenly saw a bright green flash in the sky above and in front of me. The green flash had a small green object falling from the sky with green rings trailing behind it. The sighting lasted from 1 to 2 seconds and it quickly disappeared with tiny white sparks shooting out just as it vanished. All of this took place without me hearing a sound, probably mostly because I had music on in my car and I didn’t have enough time to even think of turning it down to listen, if I could hear anything. I got into a panic as I screamed “Oh my God!” and I started hyperventilating until I started to calm myself down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen or heard of anything like this before.  It wasn’t so much of an Unidentified Flying Object as it was an Unidentified Falling Object.  I was not able to determine the distance or speed because it appeared almost as fast as it disappeared.  I was driving down the road in a northward direction when the object fell almost straight down. I expected the object to hit me any second which was part of the reason why I panicked, the other reason was that it happened so unexpectedly that I was startled by it and quite a bit frightened. I was thankfully not hit by the object which makes me wonder if it just disintegrated or hit somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not have my camcorder with me when this happened, which makes me so mad because I’ve been trying to be prepared for anything like this to happen.  Even if I did have my camcorder with me I would not have the time to pull my car over and get my camcorder out and turn it on before it disappeared.  So I drew a picture of it on my computer as best I could to give a pretty good idea of what it looked like.<n>
11/10/08 06:30|Pagosa Springs|CO|Light|About 10 min.|Bright light hovering over city.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67027.html|321|ndxe200811| Bright light hovering over city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on November 10, 2008 that Dad, my Grandpa, and me were going from Colorado Springs to Pagosa Springs for a hunting trip. It was about 6:30pm, we were near the end of the 5hr drive and were coming down from a mountain pass called, Wolf Creek Pass. Coming down the hill you can see the city below. It isn’t a big city so the lights didn’t really block out the stars at all. We were in a 3 seat truck with my grandpa driving, me in the middle and my dad next to me. I was chatting with my grandpa when my dad asked what planet he was looking at. I looked and saw a very bright light that was off in the distance. I said that I didn’t think it was a planet because it was so bright, I thought it was a helicopter. At that time the light seemed to collapse on itself and disappear. This really freaked me out because of how fast it was gone. About 10sec later it appeared again a little ways to the right. Now it seemed brighter and it started to fade in and out of sight. My grandpa said that he thought it was a plane, I told him I didn’t think so because it was just sitting there. It then stopped flashing and just stayed there. All three of us were so drawn by the object that my grandpa almost hit an Elk that was standing on the road. After that the object just stayed there and as we got closer to the city the object was even brighter and we could definitely tell that it was over the city. That’s when we saw airplanes flying around the light. That’s when the light started flashing again and started moving off into the distance every time it did it. The airplanes seemed to go with it. After that we saw it for a couple more minutes and then it was gone. I have really changed my belief about UFOs after this. I once did not believe in the possibility of them, now I do think something is out there.<n>

As I was looking at the sky, a moving triangularly-shaped light caught my eye. There were no flashing or colored lights, simply one bright light. As it scooted across the sky I tried to peg it as maybe a shooting star (too slow and steady for that), a satellite, or aircraft(questionably large and bright for these objects, also no flashing lights observed). As I was considering the possiblitites, it simply vanished. It did not reappear. No cloud cover this evening; no obstacles in my view.<n>

It was about a 1000 ft away.  Half of the object was above the tree tops and the other half could be seen showing behind the trees. It then started lowering to the ground,got smaller and smaller until it was a small brite red lite to the side of the trees and disappeared.  Believe it or not,the following nite I got up to use the bathroom,at 1:30 AM and the same type object was in the excat spot, but this time it was hoovering about 10 ft above the same trees.  It was the same shape,color and size as the object the nite before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the diameter of this object to be about 25 ft.  I turned around to wake my wife and when I turned back, the object was gone.  Both sightings were within an hour of each other , but on two different nites.  It may also be of enterest that two days ago,an object discribed almost excatly as our sightings were reported seen in Lake County Ohio, about 50 miles North East of here.  It was on the Channel 3 News, a search party went out to look but did not find anything.<n>

None of our security officers had seen anything, but when we checked out our security video at 10:03:45pm we saw a large bright red light appear out of nowhere in the sky and slowly drift from west to east across the sky before we lost sight of it behind a building.  The neighborhood it was closest to was probably the Magnolia area northwest of downtown Seattle. Because of work policy I cannot release the video of the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Perhaps not a serious report??  We would like to see the police report.  PD))<n>

The light closer and to the east (will be further reffered to as light 1) seemed to be shone in our direction because of the way the rays came off the light and how bright it was.  Light two did not seem either as bright or to be shone in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light one seemed to be floating and not really moving in any direction until it slowly turned the light toward the south and began to move across the sky.  The light didn&#39;t seem to move in any massive speed, but it did not go slowly either. (i am a terrible judge of speed and distance)  Light #3 was in the south east and was slowly moving south.  Lights 2 and 3 were not nearly as bright as one and thus i seemed to really only watch 1.  It was also the closer light so it caught my attention more.  My stepfather was mostly watching the one from the passenger side which was in the south on his side of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what an airplane looks like as i live under the flight path for Sky Harbor and these lights did not blink and had no red to them at all.  I also concluded it could not be a police chopper because for the light closest to us to be that bright the chopper would have to literally be aiming at us.<n>

It had a dominate orange light with occasional red glittery flashes but they were not in a rhythm as with a commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had moved and tree branches were obstructing my view so I walked to the back yard and finally went to the road where there is an open field with one tree for a better look. as I was watching I noticed from in front left of the object there was a flash ,one flash that reflected off the sky some how. Then it seemed to spread into a boomerang shape and then back to a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about ten minutes as it slowly vanished. After seeing the flash I remembered when I pulled in the driveway seeing a flash I though might of been lightning and then noticed there were no clouds above town but dismissed until I saw it come from this object. It was moving south in almost what appeared to be a zigzag fashion. I felt My hair on my arms stand up. And kind of disorientated. for some reason.<n>
11/9/08 19:00|Austin|TX|Other|8 min|Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66834.html|334|ndxe200811| Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mother and I were just about to lay down on our pool deck for a cigarette and star gaze as we usually do after dinner.  As I lay down on my lawn chair (which are facing west) and looked up I saw an “unusual” object moving in the sky. The reason it caught my eye was because it was very bright but seemed to be very far away. The first thing I did was yell to my mom, “What the hell is that?” She looked up just before the object moved behind a small cloud. As it came out on the other side of the cloud it was no longer as bright as it appeared. It kept moving North (so as we lay there it look like it was moving left to right) just a little bit above Vega. After traveling for about 7 more seconds it slowly disappeared. At this point we thought that we were just looking at a satellite that, for some reason, appeared to very bright (a magnitude grater than -1) for those few seconds above us. To describe the type of light that it was giving off I used this analogy. When you are driving at night and cars are coming toward you, you notice that the head lights are sometimes a yellowish and on newer cars are more of a “neon white” if you will. The object in the sky looked more like the “neon white” headlights and the typical star and satellite look more like the yellowish headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately two minuets later at 19:02 the same bright “neon white” object appeared right above us again, but his time was going the opposite direction so more towards the south west. It then looked to change its course again so now it was heading almost directly South. At this time my mom and I started to really question what we were seeing because satellites do not change their direction from heading north to heading south. As we watched the object  move “down” we kept saying to each other “what the hell is that?” it finally went out of sight. My mom told me that she was going to go get her binoculars, but I said, “screw that we needed a video camera, my phone (to know the time), and my journal (so I could write down what I was seeing while it was still fresh in my head), and a blanket. She was gone for about 5 minuets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she was walking up the pool deck stairs, at about 19:08 now, she asked me if I had seen it again and just as she asked me that I was looking off into the western sky below Vega but above Hercules and saw a much dimmer object that looked more like a satellite but it would appear then disappear and it did this about 5 times before it did not reappear again. What was strange was the time intervals in-between the appearing and disappearing was not constant and the light was more of a reddish light not the same “neon white” as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this object and its many different behaviors, I can not say that it even remotely resembled anything that I have ever seen in our night sky before. It was not an airplane because airplanes stay on one direct path, it was not a satellite because however satellites do sometimes seem to be going in and out of vision, they do not change there apparent magnitudes as drastically as this object did. I think that it is also notable that from the time my mom and I were on our pool deck (19:00 to 21:00) we saw 4 big meteors and 1 huge meteor in which we could see smoke and debris on its tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student here in Austin and spend a lot of time studying the sky and weather I believe this was an “alien space craft” or just an object that I myself could not identify, is in my opinion, irrelevant. But if there is a rational explanation for what my mom and I were seeing I would love to know.<n>

My daughter (16) and I stop to look at it when we realized it seemed to be moving. It was some distance off to the west and would only periodically move up and down and sometimes to the north. It would move in a sudden motion and stop as quick as it would start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my wife and other two children came outside to look at it. The light would get extremely intense and fade sometimes turning an extremely bright green. This was much brighter than any landing light I have ever seen. At one point it seemed to move to the west at an extreme rate and disappeared in about 1 second. After about 30 seconds it reappeared even brighter than the first time and would occasionally seem to project a light straight forward. The characteristics were not that of a landing light or search light on an aircraft. There is a small airport near my home and I&#39;m use to seeing landing lights on a daily basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this object come in and out of view several times over the course of 30 minutes and at no time did the maneuvers our intensity of the lights make any sense. I have never seen an aircraft that could maneuver in this fashion. If I had to guess at approximately where the object was I would have to say close to the T.V.A. coal power plant in New Johnsonville about 6-7 air miles from my house. The object left to the west and what seemed to be upward and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(This was unusual because of the low altitude over a residential area and the fact that not many military aircraft are ever seen in the area). The jet appeared to be circling the area instead of just passing through. I continued to see many low flying aircraft flying low in the area which were likely military aircraft as well, as they appeared to be very large turboprop aircraft and one large helicopter. Around 5 PM, a large orange/white plane that appeared to be a Coast Guard twin engine turboprop aircraft flew directly overhead. (The first that I have ever seen in the area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:22 PM, a stationary object was observed to the West/Southwest about 60 degrees above the horizon. The stationary object could best be described as appearing star-like to the naked eye except that it was too bright and in the wrong part of the sky to be Saturn or Venus, which were not visible at this time. Already having binoculars in hand due to the &#34;air show&#34; that had been taking place for the past two hours, I took a better look at the stationary &#34;star-like&#34; object that looked very unusual and bright to be a star, and appeared to reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately upon looking at the object with binoculars, it was apparent that the object was not a star, planet, or a moving object. The stationary object was totally dark or gray on top and extremely brilliant like the sun only on the very bottom underside of the object. The object appeared to be round. Thinking the only &#34;logical&#34; explanation for the object might be that it was a balloon sitting still with the setting sun reflecting off it&#39;s underside, I decided to watch the object to see if I could tell if it drifted any like a balloon. I braced my elbows on top of the frame of a patio swing to ensure I had a stable view of the object. After locking down my binoculars on the object for about ten seconds, the object shot off due South barely visible due to the high speed of it&#39;s acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This makes over a dozen unusual &#34;sightings&#34; that I have personally observed in the Westlake, Louisiana area in the past six months. (Many with confirming witnesses).<n>

Between 5:45pm EST and 7:10 EST   I noticed a light in the sky that seemed to drift very slightly left and right as well as up and down. It was pulsing mostly orange but did turn red a few times. The light remained in the basic vicinity of the sky for about an hour and a half. I used binoculars and could only make out a pulsing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was as magnificent without the binoculars as it was with. Brighter than any star and certainly not a plane. I watched this pulse and orange to red glow for a good hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I changed vantage points so that I could balance the binoculars on something solid to reduce the shaking. At this point it was a lot easier to see. Bright pulsing orange fading into red. Then it suddenly turned greenish/blue and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds or trees or any obstructions to accomplish this. It seemed to distinguish itself or disappear. About 2 minutes later a greenish/blue light appeared again very small and it faded right back to an orange brilliant pulse. I watched it for another half hour as it drifted very slightly. Then with out warning it disappeared completely. No streak or trail. Just poof!!!!<n>

Initially my date and I thought they were a small group of birds, however they had a yellowish-white dim kind of glow.  As they went over our head in a v formation heading in a southbound direction, they sped up and began to break their formation and seem to play some type of aerial game then disappeared into know where.<n>

Then I saw it was in fact an object of some type, though I couldn&#39;t really make it out. I passed this figuring it was just some helicopter hovering perfectly above the road. Then, maybe 5 minutes later, I was still on New Circle between exit 5A and 5B (I was getting off at 5B, onto Versailles Rd.) when I saw a low flying object slowly come down at an angle towards the ground as if to land (though the airport is not over there and I don&#39;t know of any airstrip in that direction). I at first thought it was a plane but then the object stopped in mid-air, hovering. It had at least 3 bright white lights on it, and 1 red blinking light (thus I thought it to be a commercial plane at first). The shape of it seemed to be pretty thin, shaped kind of like a saucer. It looked to me like it had a flat top and the edges came out at slight diaganols pointing towards the ground. I was not able to get a very good look for long because I was driving and was literally just about at my exit, though I did brake to slow down and get a longer look. I have no clue if it made noise or not, I happened to be listening to my radio very loudly at the sighting. I believe that some others on the road saw it and thought it was something strange as well, as I noticed cars braking abnormally near the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

11/8/08 19:00|San Clemente|CA|Sphere|45 sec|Foo fighters in San Clemente on 11-08-08, did you see something?|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67462.html|345|ndxe200811| Foo fighters in San Clemente on 11-08-08, did you see something?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sad that you never wrote this case into your site. I am referring to the November, 08,2008 sighting I reported of a basic &#34;foo fighter&#34; that was following a small private airplane along the coast. I think the plane was spooked as a couple of minutes later it appeared to have turned around and was heading apparently home. The next week, as I am a college English teacher, I told the story to my students and honestly by chance one of my students happen to be in Dana Point at the basic time and date I saw the UFO. She and the ones she was with saw the same object as it seemmed minutes before I did. It is a very lucky situationthat we may have seen the same thing, but she claims to have seen the same thing. Dana Point is just north of the city of San Clemente, and as the object was moving along the coast, I surmise that she saw it a few minutes before I did. That would make the total of people that saw this at least five. Most interesting is the security guard I witnessed the UFO with (I saw this at a wedding reception where he works) and he said that he had seen stranger one night in the past. I was at Ole Hanson in San Clemente. It is an older place that offers a place for weddings and has a pool for public swimming. Anyways, he told me that during one wedding reception everything stopped, including the music, because in the sky there was something he described as an organic, moving like a fish swimming, object that moved across the sky. He said that was much wilder than what we shared. So, I know this is not the best encounter, but I hope you mention it as maybe others have seen both my experience and the one the security guard did in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a large building on 99th Avenue south of Glendale Avenue.  It was dusk outside and the sun had just set behind the White Tank Mountains.  My husband pointed out the building with 3 large orange/red orbs stacked over the top of the building.  They were glowing and my husband asked if there were any airplanes that fly over that building because it looked like one of those large poles with lights on it that warn airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glendale airport it just north of this area, but this building is right next to the 101 freeway and no planes would be flying that close and low over the freeway.  I was trying to get my phone on to take pictures, when the lights starting glowing even brighter and getting larger and as we watched they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband got off the freeway and we drove over to the building to see if there was a light pole in the property or even close to it.  There was none.  It was completely dark by then and we went up 99th avenue and got back on the 101 freeway, southbound again.  The orbs were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time.  PD))<n>

The object was probably a few thousand feet altitude. The light had shape, was not point source and the colors were not fixed position – either alternating position or rotating and encompassing a large portion of the object – the rest of the object maintaining a bright white light. From my house just across the Puget Sound in North Edmonds and without visual obstruction the light looked larger than an aircraft. The light moved East and North passing over a tower with a red beacon on the hill, traveling level and seemingly very slowly. After it was several miles North and East of the tower it turned East out over the Puget Sound and headed North towards Everett, seeming to fly over the middle of the sound. There was no noise detected and no other aircraft in the air at that time. The duration was between 5 and 8 minutes. As it moved far enough to be out of view to the North, another similar light appeared in the same location, maybe slightly to the East of the original position of the first object at approximately 5:53 PM. The second moved very slowly over the tower and towards the East, but before it got to the Puget Sound, it began gaining altitude. It picked up speed as it started upward, but the disappearance took several minutes. As the size decreased due to the distance, you could still detect the rotational aspect of the lighting. When it became a point of changing color, it was noted that there was at least one other object up near the one under observation, a little to the east and lower. It also displayed the same alternating color with predominant white light around it. These lights became discernable after a minute or two. The duration of the second sighting was approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/8/08 16:00|San Clemente|CA|Sphere|45 sec|A very recent Foo Fighter following  a small plane. Maybe pilot reported.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66821.html|348|ndxe200811| A very recent Foo Fighter following  a small plane. Maybe pilot reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this the day after the event. I was at a wedding last night and I went outside to smoke. I was with the security guard and we both witnessed what I would describe as a classic foo fighter. We both saw a small, simple, and typical private propellar plane being flanked by an orb that was definitely following it. It was on the left side of the plane and maybe fifty feet lower but moving at the same pace, as if observing the plane. It was glowing in a red-orange way but was not blinking. It kept following the plane over the horizon and then we lost sight of it. Intersetingly, a few minutes later a plane was in the same exact location (following the shoreline) was moving east (the opposite direction of the plane before). Possibly this story could be linked to a sighting given by the actual pilot. It is possible that the pilot was so spooked by the follower that the pilot went back to base. I am not really sure how I would verify it but if anyone knows I would suggest they check the exact time I have given and as a lead the plane might have came out of John Wayne Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, the security officer who watched the event with me, who works these by the beach weddings all the time, was not as excited as I was. I don&#39;t know the date, but he claimed that one evening, at about 9:30pm, the whole wedding party stopped and stared, including the live musicians, and watched a very strange object move through the sky that looked like a fish swimming. He said that this encounter was much more of an unexplainable experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I have a lot more respect for people that claim to see really strange things, be they UFOs of ghosts, etc. I have no idea what I saw but I was really in a way feel blessed to have seen something so unexplainable in an age where things in general have mostly been explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A side note: Of course no one at the wedding believed a bit of my story,even though I had a witness. They all assumed that I drank to much, but I was part of the entertainment and was sober at the time, as I can at best say about the security guard. I really have sympathy now with those that experience something bizzare yet get disfranchised mentally for reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen a UFO. Somehow I feel that this makes this story lose credence, but I am honest about everything. In 1993,I witnessed the &#34;Vulkin Crusier&#34;. Sorry if I didn&#39;t spell it right but I don&#39;t follow Star Trek. It was the exact UFO that was seen in Belgium. I watched it with a witness for five minutes, and it was huge! I have seen stealth bombers while going through the desert and I was definitely way larger. It never did any strange manuvers, it just moved in a straight line though it was strange to watch as it slightly moved left to right as it glided by. It was pure gray, had three red lights on each corner that did not flash, and one additional red light on the center that also did not flash. There was no way it was a plane. It was way larger and it also made no sound. It eventually disappeared over a hill so I never saw a disappearance. Was it alien? Was it military? I have no idea. All I can do is report this as more UFO heresay.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She say the same thing occured at just about the same time. She saw the same Orange ball but moving south and alone. I think it is interesting that a few days later a similar sighting was seen in Mexico. If trends continue, Brazil should get some new sightings very soon. Please, check it out. I think there is a pattern to these things. I could be wrong but maybe now there is a pattern to them as far as they are watching. Maybe you can have a rough estimate as to where they show up next.Please understand that I am a multiple college degree person and I do know the difference between objects. I was once on highway 395 and in a second I knew a plane was a steath bomber. While I can&#39;t explain what I saw at times, it was not from here. I am one more testimony and for the doubtful, I can only say keep watching the skies. You may, if lucky, experience something you cannot explain. I consider it a gift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck,  Me.<n>

I was standing in my backyard having a smoke at roughly 21:20:00 on November 7th, 2008 when the sighting occurred.  It was a very clear night – I cannot remember the moon’s status but it was nowhere near the anomaly.  While looking to the north I saw what could best be described as a “flash ball”, or like that of a striking match head (completely white or VERY light yellow in color), streak across the sky above my apartment building.  I would have immediately felt fortunate to witness a shooting star or meteor but after traveling about 200-300ft it sharply veered off at an angle – basically flying slightly up and towards the left an additional 75-100ft before the fireball immediately disappeared.  The “flash ball” lasted 3-5 seconds and completed the described path in as much time.  It created a trail of smoke or exhaust that drew its path in the sky - yet this smoke was only visible in the light of the fireball.  I thought that I could make out a dark shape that continued along the same trajectory as the fireball vanished, but much faster – but in all objective honesty my brain could very well have just assumed a continuation of movement.  The whole event was over in seconds.  It appeared to be very low altitude, I think too low for a shooting star or comet/meteor.   I estimate it was only 350 to 500 feet in the air.  Very low, and I could hear a noise – but it did not sound like a flare or firework, close as I can come to describing the noise is a short whistle or an oscillated beep.  The brevity of the experience makes description difficult, but it was like a noise my computer from the late 80s would make.  There is most likely a plausible explanation for this sighting - like a meteor hitting Wonder Woman’s invisible jet and bouncing off at the angle – but I felt like the maneuver would otherwise be unlikely for natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be a a huge radiant object in the distant that remained stationary for at least 20-25 minutes, my wife witnessed the object as well and the object was subsequently recorded on video. i could not positively discern the exact shape of this object but if i were to make a reference point, it resembled the vehicular object depicted in the 1st superman movie that brought superman from krypton to earth, i say that not to sound hoaxy but merely as a description. i reside  southern ohio (cincinnati) and the object appeared in the southwestern portion of the horizon. it was a pretty clear nite and this object was clearly no celestial body based on the way it behaved. at times it appeared as giant pulsating ball of light. i noticed a lot of manmade aviation activity in the proximity of this object. this is clearly visible on the tape i made. i called a friend over the phone who resides not too far and he along with other witnesses observed similar activity. after about 25 minutes the object simply diminished in the distance to where it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus.

On occasion it would tilt slightly to one side and it became obvious it was sphere like and small lights were spinning around a turret that set on top.

It moved at a consistent and leisure speed from south to north.  It made no discernable sound.  I had the impression that it was extremely large.  It appeared to be bigger than anything I have seen fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife who was about 2 miles away.  She saw what appeared to be 2 military aircraft proceeding from east to west toward the location and 1 military aircraft proceeding west to east toward the site.  She said she thought they were military aircraft because they were very small but moved extremely quickly through the sky for a second or two before cruising at normal aircraft speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on the outskirts of the city of Mumbai in a newly developed township known as New Mumbai.  I have my own business and I also work for Vacuum Tech. India, the Indian representatives of Alcatel, France.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the said day, I had been praying in my room with my window open, as i usually do, when all of a sudden i saw a silver disc coming into view from the left side. I immediately got up from my mat and ran outside calling for my mom. Both of us ran to the balcony and saw the UFO. (We live in a 3 storied apartment).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was moving very slowly with a slight wobble, and as we stood on the balcony, we watched it move to our right. By now the wobbling had stopped. There were markings on the body (like something etched), and i&#39;m sure i could have read at least some of  it with my naked eyes, had it not been for the glare caused by the strong sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were still watching, it stopped in midair for about 5 mins., and then began to move in a perpendicular direction towards an uncultivated area about 20kms. away from the place where we stay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was quite close and very slow we had ample time to take note of a few things. For one, there was absolutely no sound. Second, it was not a helicopter. It was not an aircraft of any conventional make that i have ever seen. I didnt notice any windows (perhaps because of the glare). I could only make out a few grooves that ran across the body of the craft. It was certainly not a balloon because it stopped and changed direction. That&#39;s all i&#39;ve got to say. I dont know if anyone else noticed it. Indians are not really crazy about UFOs except in the cities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> N.B. Before this, i have also seen a black triangle in the night traversing the same route. It went really fast so i couldn&#39;t see much except that it was black and had very subdued lights at the three corners.<n>

11/6/08 21:30|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|20 - 30 Minutes|I was driving to work on November 06 2008. I stopped for Sonic to eat before work. I live very close to the back side of the locale air|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66769.html|369|ndxe200811| I was driving to work on November 06 2008. I stopped for Sonic to eat before work. I live very close to the back side of the locale air port and 4 surrounding Military bases. I say this because I see lots of aircraft in the air at all times. I was in the drive up and I saw a strange pattern of lights on a plane or what looked to be a plane banking to the left to turn, but the object never turned and the light pattern never changed. I then saw a state police helicopter go in the same direction. I thought nothing of it at the time. I paid for my meal at the window and started driving to the base I currently work at as a Computer Systems administrator. I&#39;m maybe a mile up the road still in town and I see the same object, flying very close to a residential area well under 300 feet in the air. I thought for a plane that’s close I sure don’t here any noise coming from it, so I rolled down my window and sure thing it did not make one sound. It soon dropped off of my vision and I keep driving. The road I’m on comes to a 4 way stop and is just off the back side of a locale air port and I see the same object coming from the direction of the air port and thought for sure this pilot must be trying to land or is having problems. I make my left hand turn at the 4 way stop and then a right on to the highway. The object at that time has stop in mid air just of the right of the highway I&#39;m driving on. I&#39;m coming up to the object and I see a row of well yellow lit windows so bright you can’t make out the inside compartment. But not a blinding eliminating light just well lit and yellow in color. I’m driving at about 30mph now and the object is to my right and I can see the underbelly it had green strips of lights all over the undercarriage of the craft and the body of the craft was black and blended in with the night sky so well I really could not make out the shape or even the hole size of the craft. It was very well triangle shape from the way the green lights were lade out on the bottom of the craft and! I rolle d down my window again and heard not one sound. At this time a second car had pulled over to the side of the road and started flashing its light and the object with out banking in any direction to the left or right to turn seemed to go back in the direction it came from towards the airport. I speed to the nearest cross section to make a u-turn and race to the airport with the object still in sight. I have to stop at a stop light and lose the object behind a set of buildings that a recently gone up in the last two or so years. Its very bright over buy the buildings as if the craft was hiding but the buildings are on a gated road I don’t have access to and I can&#39; see the craft anymore. I&#39;m leaving back towards work and I&#39;m looking at the new buildings that I have never seen before and it seems there is a private run way and some indicator lights lighting up a run way path I&#39;ve never seen before. And there seem to be an airplane hanger right behind this new building that’s just off the main run way to the locale airport, where I think this object my have landed and possibly if it was not a true UFO may have been stored away. Any way I tried to Google maps the location of the building and it seems they are brushed out of the picture or were not built when the photo was taken. I saw this craft up-close and for a very long time, I&#39;m more then sure I&#39;m not the only one in the area as it was flying very close to the ground and very slowly no aircraft other then a helicopter could have pulled off the speeds but not the maneuvers. I wish I would have had my camera to take photos. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen nor was it your typical UFO sighting as the object did not glow did not have over powering bright lights or laser beams. On the ride out to the baseI work at I saw what seemed to be more aircraft all NONUFO and very identifiable in the sky then I&#39;ve seen in a long time it was as if they were looking for some thing. I will be keeping an eye out and would like to know where I could better report my f! indings or receive any information or any other repotted similar sights for that night in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5 to 8 dim white lights along triangle shape edge, one on each corner and at least one light per side of shape. No colored lights as many planes have. Not blinking, flashing or beaming. Trees lining the street ended any further observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dark, starry night, seen just outside home while having a smoke break.  Closest man-made object would be a stealth bomber, but had the shape of a stealth fighter, albeit much bigger.  I&#39;ve seen an actual stealth in flight before.  After observation, I thought it might have been flock of birds moving south for the winter, but speed was too great, and they were dim lights, not reflections of light from the ground.  Object made no sound at all.  It was no natural phenomenon, smoke, balloon or known man-made aircraft in my opinion.  Not a satellite or missile.   Local airport assumed not in service.  Moon was out but in another part of the sky, also visible.  Object flew in straight path, did not hover or change course or altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not under any influence or intoxication at time of sighting.<n>

It was good size a covered one side on the 2-lane highway easy, it was only 200 ft above the ground and looked like it was coming in for a landing. It was a silver disk, with no lights, moving very slow and coming down. I was driving right for it and slowed way down from 70mph to almost a dead stop on the highway, because I was not going to drive under whatever it was. That&#39;s when I noticed the car on the other side of the highway had done the same thing, as well as the car behind me. I watched the disk go across the highway West to East, and just over the tops of the trees in the tree line on the right side of the highway; I could see an open field through the tree line. After I looked over and the car behind me, was now beside me we looked at each other and he took of! f and went on down the highway. There was a gravel road right in front of me headed East County Road 158, the same way the disk was headed. I did not take the gravel road and follow it the disk, and have been mad at myself ever since for not.<n>

The way the obect moved could only be described as fluttering, how a feather or a flat peice of paper would react if you dropped it.The object would catch the sun as it was fluttering and it was refelctive.It was hard to judge size or distance however the object would flutter, srtaighten out, fly in an arc, flutter, fly in an arc.The object did not appear to be losing altitude.I called an employee to witness this and he did. The object eventualy stopped fluttering and flew out of the area, underneath the clouds and was gone.If I had to judge size and distance based on the type of clouds I would have to say the object appeared triangular perhaps 10 to 15 ft and at an altitude between 500-1000ft.It was the middle of the afternoon,broad daylight,and nice weather.<n>

I was so surprise to see at that. so the alien got a handfull of earth from the floor and put it inside the box and in an instance the box trowed a bright red beam to the air, like up into space(for my experience high ultra-violet beams that beam was so powerful that it could send an signal into space) so we waited and the alien got inside of the ship with the box. the ship had a big shiny boulbous hull, and then it took out into far in the skies. so an hour later a dozen of the teardrop-shape ships started to appear more than one mile in the skies.

PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66768.html|380|ndxe200811| It moved in an unreal manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early Thursday morning 11-06-08 approximately 0045 hrs I walked out on to my back deck to enjoy a beautiful fall night, always having been interested in the stars I looked to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking to the Northwest approximately 340 degrees, I observed what at first appeared to be a star just above the tree level surrounding my property, it seemed brighter than any of the other objects in the area. Suddenly it moved, it looked as though it ascended very rapidly, a significant distance and then descended to about where it had began. I blinked my eyes thinking … After watching it for a few more seconds it began to move in a sideways motion. At that point I called to my wife and daughter for verification. They both joined me and verified what I believed I had been witnessing. As my wife and daughter observed I went inside to get our Video camera unfortunately the night sky was to dark and the object was to distant to produce any usable images. I then decided to try some still Photography setting up my camera on my tripod and using a wireless remote I proceeded to take still photographs most not showing much more than a point of light. The rapid movements of the object ceased within 10 minutes of first observation, but I continued to watch the object until about 0300 hrs at which point it was behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a note that although the object moved somewhat from the first position observed, it did not move at a consistent rate relative to the rest of the objects in the sky. I’m not unfamiliar with the night skies and at the age of 50 have seen many different things but after checking the location in the sky the following evening, and seeing on a perfectly clear evening that there was nothing but dark sky where I witnessed the anomaly the night before, I felt the need to share this. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star, we suspect.  PD))<n>

He pointed it out to me as he thought it was a large aircraft coming into landing at the local airport.  We then realized it was nowhere near the airport and the lights were not bright enough to be landing lights and we came to the conclusion it was moving to slow to be a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it as it went in-behind buildings, at which point we lost sight.  Minutes after we saw it emerge and change to the opposite direction it was moving originally.  The configuration of lights changed from about six scattered lights to 3 in the shape of a triangle with 1 trailing light in behind, all of which were moving at the same speed.  We continued to watch it move left to right for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time we witnessed the lights they had changed direction once, originally right to left and then left to right.  The formation, color and quantity of lights also changed. If I had to guess the distance of the formation I would say it was 10-50 miles away, if that is true then the formation would have been 1-2 miles wide.  In relation to the moon it would have been any where from 3 to 4 times the width of a full moon.<n>

I estimate it was 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile directly ahead of us, above the middle of the toll road approximatley 100-200 yards above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION: The light was green, similar to a traffic light, but very bright.  It probably lasted for just 1/2 second to 1 second.  It was so bright that it seemed like it was shining directly at us, similar to when someone shines a flashlight at you.  To me, it appeared that the green light was shaped like a diamond, with its vertical axis 5 times longer than its horizontal axis.  It disappeared without leaving any kind of trail.  We did not see a craft or any physical object - just a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night and there were no other car headlights visible in our rear view mirror, nor coming towards us from the opposite site of the road.  My coworker and I were chatting when the light suddenly appeared and immediately got both of our attention due to its color, brightness, and location.  Perhaps the object noticed us because it was dark, desolate, and we were traveling pretty fast (80-85 mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  My partner &amp; I are both Federal Agents and we saw the same thing.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter, firework, or anything else we could explain.  There were news reports the following morning that a rocket was fired from Vandenburg Air Force Base, but what we saw was no rocket.<n>

As I rounded the hilly section and approached the straight part of the road, the object appeared to the right front of my car.  It was approx 70 feet above ground, about 100 feet away, hovering with very bright lights flashing across the side of the craft.  I was traveling close to 70 MPH but slowed quickly to 55 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it crossed in front of me, going from right to left I could clearly see the symbols the lights were flashing.   A series of triangles followed by a series of squares flashing on then off repeating the same series over again.  The craft continued to climb to a higher elevation, about 200 feet off the ground, following the center divider heading towards Dublin (north).   There was no sound coming from the craft, when the flashing lights turned off, it was very difficult to see the object due to the object was entirely black with no windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the craft close to 10 minutes watching the flashing lights turn on and off with the same series of triangles and squares.  At about 20:40 the craft hovered over the 680/580 interchange then turned towards Castro Valley (Western direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description of the craft is that it appeared to be black, disk shaped due to the location of the lights, about 4 highway lanes wide and about 20 feet in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At this point, the light began to change color and turn from a whitish color to a red-orange and then disappeared.  My wife initially thought it could be a low flying plane or helicopter, but was disproved when we saw a helicopter flying to a local hospital...and seeing planes flying in the area.  While planes and helicopters have strobe-type lights, these where much larger and pulsed very slowly.  There also where no &#34;running lights&#34; common in other aircraft.<n>

11/3/08 19:10|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|40 seconds|Dark, triangular-shaped object traveling slowly to the south-east.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66696.html|403|ndxe200811| Dark, triangular-shaped object traveling slowly to the south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Pima County, AZ about half way between the northerly limit of the city of Tucson and Oro Valley to my north-west.  I am near the base of the south-westerly end of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  My ZIP is 85704, and my altitude is 2500 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This (Monday) evening I was sitting on my second-floor balcony enjoying the evening air and observing the night sky to my north-east.  I was not using binoculars or a telescope.  The sky in my view was cloudless and I could clearly observe Capella rising in my direct field of view.  I was wearing my distance nighttime-diving glasses to aid my view of the night sky; however, my un-aided distance vision is excellent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1910 hours I observed a dark object transit my field of view, traveling generally from a north-northwesterly direction to a south-southeasterly direction at a steady speed and course.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees and the object passed well above Capella.  At first I thought it was a flight of geese in a tight ‘V’ formation of symmetrical shape.  However, the shape simply was too uniform and steady to be a flight of birds; unlike the shape of a flight of geese which changes in shape over even a short period of time.  I thought that I could see individual dark objects, perhaps 9 or 10 of them, forming the ‘V’ (a ‘V’ similar to boomerang-shape but broader at the center than the traditional boomerang shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object for approximately 40 seconds - I have an additional view to the east and south-east which I can observe through a separate opening in my balcony.  So, I was able to observe the object as it passed through an arc of about 90-100 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and no light from the object.  I have no clue as to the object’s altitude.  However, my guess is that if the object was flying at 1,000 feet above the ground, its speed was about 120 miles per hour; perhaps a bit more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m submitting this report simply to confirm and reinforce any other reports you may have received concerning this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it might be a bright star, but the object appeared to pulse, which was quite abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing to examine the object I noticed that it appeared to pulse slightly into a haze, as if the object were having some sort of lensing effect applied to it, so I rolled down the vehicle window and looked at the object in the clear, and sure enough the hazing was not an effect of the windshield or any other glass or reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was observing the object it pulsed and winked out.  I would have thought nothing more of it except that it returned about 4-seconds later.  Upon further observance as we approached berry blvd, the object again pulsed but the effect seemed longer and brighter with angular stabbing lights extending from it briefly.  I looked and noted it was not a plane, had no running lights of any kind and as I was checking to see if it was mounted on a tower, the object disappeared again.  4 seconds or thereabouts later, it re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was certainly not the moon, it wasn’t a plane and the object didn’t move, nor was it mounted on a tower.  I’m not aware of any object that can dead hover, produce no sound, and pulse and disappear and reappear staying roughly two to three hundred feet in the sky.  I’m not sure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct date to be November 02, 2008.  PD))<n>

This &#34;dancing&#34; lasted for roughly 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a cluster of four more identical objects appeared in the sky just south of the other three and were traveling in what some might call a formation.  almost as if they were connected.  But then they began to act independently swooping up and down, left and right as if they were in a dogfighting scene out from the movie Top Gun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then disappeared into the cirus clouds and did not reappear after watching the sky for another 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We have Kirtland Air force Base here in  Albuquerque and out of the 25 plus years I’ve lived here I have never ever heard them fly any sort of war game or sortie this late much less on a Sunday night over the entire city, and much much less with their after burners on!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to see what was going on as their behavior made me think something was definitely not right.  Once I got out in the driveway of my house I saw one of the jets at about 9,000 ft altitude just shredding across the sky.  He made a couple really crazy maneuvers and then headed north of where I was located.  I was looking south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the jet made it approximately 4 or 5 miles north of my home, my attention was caught by two other jets following the previous jet.  (I believe they were either F-16’s or F-18’s).  As soon as they all were north of my location, as I was still looking up I saw a tremendously bright purple rectangular shaped light moving straight southbound at a speed that no human made aircraft (that we know about)  could travel at.  The object was gone as soon as it had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 or so seconds later the jets flew over again in a v shaped three man formation and were still going full after burner.  After this they (the jets) all headed straight south seemingly after the object and disappeared.<n>

At the top of the windshield appeared a streak of light which I originally registered as a shooting star.  It was a pale blue green light fairly bright, consistant with perhaps a trail from a firework, but without any smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It streaked across my vision from the top of the windshield straight due west and possibly down and escaped my vision behind some trees.  It was going far to fast to be an airplane, and it was not a reflection since I have driven that road many times at night and never witnessed the same phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only logical explanation I could come up with was perhaps a firework remain, but I didn&#39;t see smoke and it was an unlikely day and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to turn down the radio to hear anything but it was probably too late.  The one thing I did notice was a slight increase in static on the radio which grabbed my attention before I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM TO REPORT:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Correction to previous post.  It was pale in comparison to the lights of the street. However then again, there were no stars visible and it was much brighter and larger than any shooting star I have seen. Also since it was dark and I&#39;m slightly nearsighted it was difficult to tell whether it was moving parallel to the ground  or downwardly. There was also no clouds that night at the temperature was about 14 degrees Celsius.<n>

The circle had a deep red tone to it and did not flash.  We watched it for about 8 or 9 minutes and the circle only started to move after about 7 minutes.  It did a zigzag to the left, then to the right-as it slightly turned you could view a white flicker(a light of some sort for a split second) then it slowly faded off into the air as it moved off into the night.  During this time, we had taken video with our digital camera and my husband was able to take a clip of it with the actual video camera.  We were able to get about 5 or 6 minutes of straight footage of this with the digital camera.  This was in no way anything like we&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed a bright light through the trees in a field to the right of the interstate about 200 yards away.  At first we thought it was a large helicopter but when we got closer we noticed the object was very large, and in a triangular or arrowhead shape with 3 bright lights at each corner.  It also had small lights going around the sides, mostly white.  The object was hovering, as if suspended in midair, above the tree line, probably 150-200 feet off of the ground.  At first I thought it might be some kind of tower in the field, judging from its large size, low position, and the fact that it was completely still.  We also heard no noise, but we were driving.  However, as we drove by it, I watched in the rear window and the object began to move south very slowly, probably about 20 mph, over the interstate and disappeared over the trees.  Neither of us was sure what to think and I haven’t seen anything in the news today but I know others on the interstate with us must have seen the object too.  The object looked very similar to what was described in the Travel Channel special titled “UFO Over Illinois.”  Prior to this, my boyfriend did not believe in extraterrestrials or UFO’s but now claims to be a believer.  It was a very chilling experience.  I’m interested to see if anyone else reports seeing it too.<n>

At first I thought it was a set of balloons, but when I looked more closely, part of it was swaying sideways(perpendicular to its direction of motion).  It was difficult for me to make out because it was a bit far, but it looked like a banner with embedded balloons or something of sort. It wasn&#39;t very long. Its Length was twice its height. It was floating silently to the west, too fast for a balloon. To my estimate, it was about the speed slightly less than a helicopter at normal cruise. Later it changed direction to northwest and started ascending slowly as it became less visible, until it was too far to be seen. This all lasted less than 5 minutes. It had various colours, mainly purple and a yellow, roughly spherical part that was swaying. The background was cloudy. Almost immediately before I spotted the object I heard the sound of a helicopter which is common in my area, but the sound came from somewhere else and it stopped after a few seconds.<n>

However it was longer, and it didn&#39;t fade out like a shooting star normally does. it went through my field of vision in about 2 seconds. i jumped up and from my angle saw it farther to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started thinking in my head what it could be. My wife asked what was wrong, and I explained that i thought i might have seen a UFO, in the traditional sense, i could not explain what it was. We were talking about for a few minutes, trying to debunk what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we heard screaming.....it was very chilling.  We cracked our bedroom window and heard it over and over. it sounded artificial, not like a human, so we started guessing it was an owl perhaps?  i don&#39;t know what they sound like, but i have heard there are some that make wild ass noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 2 minutes later, we heard a swarm of sirens go past our neighborhood and off to the east, where the light had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I was more prepared and had more than just a story to share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So question, where can I find out if there is to be a meteor shower?  Is there some website that records this information?   2ndly, is there any type of owl that makes a screaming noise like a human?   The answers to those questions would set my mind at ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
11/2/08 01:40|Port Hueneme|CA|Light|30 plus minutes|I witnessed two objects each comprised of five lights at the Port Hueneme Beach in CA.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66646.html|428|ndxe200811| I witnessed two objects each comprised of five lights at the Port Hueneme Beach in CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I decided to stop at the beach in Port Hueneme, CA to admire the ocean after leaving my boyfriend’s house.  I arrived about 1:40 AM. I parked my car with the hood facing the pier with the tail end facing the Seabee military base directly behind me.  I left my engine, headlight sand music on as I was only planning to stay for a minute or two.  I put the car in park and stepped out of the vehicle.  I stood up on the ledge of the driver’s side door to get a better view of the waves.  I noticed what appeared to be a set of stadium lights facing the perimeter of the base over a fountain of water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so I noticed the lights shift their angle/position out of the corner of my eye.  Shocked, I began to stare and then witnessed the lights move.  The first object consisted of five white/yellow lights.  There was no visible craft, just the lights.  They moved together at times and separate at times. The lights were able to move over the water independently of each other and collectively as a group.  They moved up, down, right, left, forward, backward--any way you could imagine.  There was no sound and no disturbance of the sand or water.  The lights remained completely static and motionless at times just hovering over the area and then were able to move slowly or quickly at varying speeds. The lights were low to the ground maybe 25 to 40 feet off of the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this for a minute or two and was so startled I jumped in the car and took out my cell phone to take pictures and record video evidence.  I took a picture and then decided it would be best to record a video because it could capture the fluidity and motion of the objects.  I turned off the car engine, lights and music.  I kneeled on the driver seat and recorded the movement for twenty minutes out of the sunroof resting my arm on the roof to keep my hand as steady as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time a second object appeared, which was lower than the first and considerably closer to the base.  It was also comprised of the same five lights.  It also displayed the same characteristics and motion. However, it moved much more than the first object.  Suddenly, the first object disappeared completely and the second began to move toward my car.  I dropped my phone and it slid shut erasing the video.  I became concerned for my safety and started my engine, called my mother and drove away as quickly as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner than I started my car the first object reappeared and then both retreated farther away.  Once on the phone with my mother, however, I became more curious and turned my car around in the direction of the lights to get a better view.  Both objects moved much more quickly then they had before in the direction toward my car.  I was so scared I stopped the car immediately in the middle of the road and turned around as quickly as possible and left the beach.  I am left with only one crappy cell phone picture, but a picture nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no craft. Just two objects made up of five lights each, which could move collectively or independently of each other.  The objects made no sound and were able to hover very low to the ground.  Neither seemed to disturb the water or sand on the beach in any way.  They illuminated the area.  At one point one or two of the lights seemed brighter than the others on the first object, almost as if a light, beam or object was emitted.  But I cannot be sure of this particular detail as it was quick and hard to clearly observe.  I am unsure of whether or not it may have landed.  It was very near to the water/sand, but I did not witness it do so personally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared on the perimeter of the military base!  There had to have been military personnel on duty who also witnessed the lights whatever they had been.  There are airplanes on the base none of which fit such a description to the best of my knowledge.  I did at one point notice what appeared to be a regular airplane far off in the distance, but was unsure if it noticed the objects.  There were three other cars parked nearby.  I am unsure whether or not they were occupied.  There are also a great deal of apartments and condos on the beach, in which other people may have noticed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a reliable, lucid, sober, sane witness.  I am a recent college grad about to begin graduate studies. I have never believed UFO stories.  I am open to a logical military explanation of what I saw, as it was outside the beach perimeter of the CBC base, but I have never witnessed or been aware of any man made object with such properties or capabilities personally.  I watched the objects for about a half an hour myself.  I am sure they may have been there before I arrived at the beach and remained after I left as well.  They were still visible as I drove away to turn left back down Ventura Road.  I am flabbergasted at what I just witnessed.  I have no explanation and I am dumbfounded…<n>

I was star gazing with my reflector telescope south east of where I live approximately about 11:45 pm pst.  My brother had came out to star gaze with me and just as he had looked North east approximately about 40k-100k ft.(don&#39;t know how high, but no higher than a regular airplane).  I had told my brother that is not a moon, because a moon does not appear where it should.  This unidentified aircraft looked like a full moon large circular with one bright color(orange), the light was huge,not glimmering, shining, neither blinking, it was bright light.  That night there was four of us, me my brother and two other friends.  The unidentified flying object sits in the air without a sound and interestingly the object moved/hover.  And I said oh Sh*t, it&#39;s moving.  It had moved just a bit at the moment, then we were stunned.   This object had no sound, moving very rapidly but slowly towards us and then turned direct! ion towards the nearby airport.  We had thought it was a airplane, all of the sudden the craft flew over us towards northwest of our home and stopped for a few seconds.  The object started moving again, now going south.  As the object was moving away further, the very last thing it did was took off just like we see in the movies star strek,it just zoomed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We have a minuciple airport located nearby so I assumed it was an air plane on a low approach to the airport.  Usually aircraft do not fly above the tree lines where I live they usually approach the airport from the west to land and I am north of the airport.  The sound drew my attention for it was pretty loud which meant the aircraft was very low, so I stepped from my porch thinking that an aircraft may be in trouble when I see a huge triangle shaped aircraft flying over the roof of my house.  I was still talking with my friend telling them what I was witnessing.  The moon was out so the craft was luminated, here is the description, It was a black triangle shaped craft, with the tip of the triangle facing west and the bottom of the triangle facing east.  It was flying from the north to the south, on the ! underside bottom of the craft were two red lights and underside bottom top of the craft one white light.  I have spent 18 years in the military to know that this craft was not flying like how other crafts fly.  This craft was flying sideways.  The size of the craft was bigger than the Stealth, I would say larger than an commercial airplane.  I watched it fly to the south until it went behind some trees and could not see it any more.  The craft was not flying fast but slow, the time it flew from over my roof to behind trees was approx 5-6 mins.  I would like to know what I may have seen, I don&#39;t rule out it is military or some other type of craft that may be on a test run.  I would be interested to know exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was between 500-700 feet long and 50-60 feet high. When we saw the back it was 50-60 feet wide. It&#39;s speed was 10-20 miles per hour.  My friend stopped the car as it went over. Suddenly the round objects on the rear glowed orange and it shot away out of sight. The top half was surrounded with windows allowing us to see inside.  It was well lit inside but our view made it appear empty. This craft looked as if there was no aerodynamics involved and in no way could possibly fly.  This was just one of several sightings by myself but was only one when I had someone with me.  I experienced communication with 5 aliens in 1993 or 94 when comet hailbob came thru.  This experience was very unique but far to lenghthy to report here now.<n>

As soon as we saw one, we noticed other moving lights.  The lights did not blink and I kept my eye on one until it vanished as if it got to far out of site and i am talking directly over head!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, not a cloud in site.  The distance to these objects is unknown but there is no way a normal jetliner could fly so high as to appear to be a faint star. the speed of the objects appeared to move at the rate of speed as a jet, but the distance to it was twice as far if not outside our atmosphere. I dont know what they were but i know what they were not.<n>

It was dark; the sky was clear and there was little or no wind.  My attention was drawn towards a slow moving object to the south west, which was travelling in a north easterly direction. I would estimate the height to be somewhere between 3 and 5 thousand feet.  I was immediately suspicious because the object was bright orange in colour.  As it drew closer (less than one mile) it slowed down and maintained its position above the ground.  A short time later, it backed away, whilst climbing sharply at an acute angle.  It was travelling at an incredible speed and within 20 seconds or so, it was the size of a distant star.  We observed it moving from side to side between 3 stars which were in close proximity to each other.  At no time did I hear the sound of engines or a propulsion system.  There was no beam of light emitting from the object towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw some flashing lights in the sky.  I thought at first they might be sky -searching advertising lights but saw no connection to the ground.   I saw two very large circular/oval white nebulous shapes making very quick circular patterns in the sky.  The two white shapes were hazier than search lights and their patterns danced quickly as if two children were playing with LED lights.  They circled counter-clock-wise continuously and always avoided overlapping each other.  They seem to be chasing each other like two butterflies in the sky.  Their flight patterns seem to be extemporaneous and random circling left in small areas and at other times very large areas many miles apart.   At times they disappeared behind thin layers of clouds.  The clouds were not low and there were not many clouds.  I was fascinated by this and thought to myself I had never seen anything like this in my 63 years on Earth.  I walked two doors down and brought out my neighbor to view the scene.  He agreed that he had never seen anything like that and added he did not believe that it could be search lights, LED lights or airplanes and stated that it looked very high.  We watch the sky together for 10 minutes as the lights continued to circle in playful quick patterns.  I heard the Apartment Mgr. calling her cat and went down two more trailers to tell her to look up in the sky but before I got there the lights disappeared.   I went back to my patio table and watched the sky for another 30 minutes but saw no more activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Accident investigator who for the past 29 years was charged with the responsibility of getting the correct facts at accident scenes for court cases.<n>

As it moved, the object had a sort of twinkling effect.  I observed this object over the course of 2 hours.  It would remain stationary for several minutes then it would move in the erratic circular pattern.  The objects motion over time was in a westerly direction but its progress was more rapid than the other stars.  I phoned a friend who verified what I was seeing.  He lives about 12 miles west of me and saw the object in the same relative position in the sky as me so I would say the object was at a high altitude.  My friend tried to look through his telescope at the object but could only resolve the object as a point source of light.  The object has repeated these maneuvers dozens of times and at the time I am submitting this report it is continuing to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When standing in the middle of the yard, one can see almost from horizon to horizon.  The weather was clear and the stars were shining in the dark night-sky.  We observed many ordinary-like satellites and at least two shooting stars during the evening.  I would consider me and my brother as two sane and perceptive young men.  We had drunk a few cans of beer but we were not &#34;drunk&#34;.  This report is filed some 4 hours after the sighting and is written without the participation of my brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2000 hrs (GMT + 2) I observed a moving, faint, red dot of light high in the sky in direction NNW.  I told also my big brother to take a look at it.  At first he said that he did not see it, but I used a bright star (Vega) as a static target to point the object to him.  Now he also saw the light.  The light was moving quietly in a straight line towards SSE maintaining a visible speed of an ordinary satellite or high-flying commercial aircraft and kept doing so during the entire sighting which lasted about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that the light was an ordinary satellite but it was red in color.  Next I noticed another blinking red light in the absolute vicinity, on the right-hand side of the first light, moving into same direction with same speed.  This observation made me think that it was an ordinary airplane we were witnessing and that the blinking red light was a wing-light or something.  However, I estimated that the aircraft was flying at an altitude of at least 15000 meters because it seemed too distant to be an ordinary commercial aircraft yet too close to be an ordinary satellite.  Moreover, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the aircraft reached the southern part of the sky the first light started to change color from red into bright orange.  Also the blinking red light could no longer be seen so there was only one light now.  This orange light made me think of a tail-light of a low-flying aircraft that typically seems to change color as the aircraft passes by.  The light kept traveling in straight line into direction SSE and it was still visible high above the southern horizon as we started paying attention to other things.  The sighting had lasted about 2 minutes and, as said, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My big brother did not take the sighting very seriously.  Also, he is no expert in astronomy and was of the opinion that the object we had just witnessed was flying outside our atmosphere.  He even said that the object &#34;had it&#39;s braking lights on&#34; as it was red in color.  I however have astronomy as my hobby and this sighting was someting that I&#39;ve never seen before so I took it very seriously and that&#39;s why I decided to file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that it was some kind of sophisticated domestic or foreign aircraft flying from NNW to SSE high over the Finnish airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also see that there&#39;s a very similar sighting filed in your database from 10/25/2008 from location Cedar Rapids, IA, United States.<n>

Smaller sphere shaped object near it, no lights or sounds on either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading south on the road, and saw a few people standing in their yard looking up at the sky, a couple houses down we noticed another family looking high in the sky with binoculars. We looked up and saw what they were looking at as we pulled off the road. High in the Southern sky the left and above of the moon was a very clear u/v -shaped object. It appeared to be gray.  Below it a small distance was a smaller object, it was not as clear, it was more of a sphere shape but I cannot be sure on that. We did NOT see any lights or sounds. The v- shaped object was very high and small in the sky but still had a very distinct shape. It didn&#39;t not move at all although my husband said he thought it might have been rotating horizontally. We watched for about 10 minutes with no change, This was at sunset; We scanned the sky to see if there were anymore around, after that we lost them. We did not see them fly away, they were just gone. We have been trying to figure out if anyone else has reported this besides the people who were near us tonight. We have never seen a UFO and are no sure what to think about it or how to find out if there is any information about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was twinkling and brighter than any of the surrounding stars.  I asked my friend if he thought it was Mars.  We watched it over the span of approximately 30 seconds before it began to fade away.  The light was stationary the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one minute after the light had disappeared I noticed a second red light rising slowly through the trees.  The light appeared to be identical to the first, rose to approximately the same place in the sky, and remained stationary for one minute before fading away like the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the sky for the next 15 minutes before going back inside.  In that time no other lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

11/1/08 14:00|Lafayette|LA|Unknown|1-2 seconds|Translucent orb and high speed objects captured on video during air show|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66699.html|448|ndxe200811| Translucent orb and high speed objects captured on video during air show<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attended the Sertoma Cajun Air Festival in Lafayette, LA. It was a beautiful sunny day and the highlight of the show was the USAF Thunderbird performance. I took snapshots with my digital camera throughout the day, and even tried to use the cameras video feature to get some of the nice formations in motion. When I got home and was reviewing the footage, I was shocked! I had three videos that had objects in the sky or that flew across the screen that I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the show, there was nothing observed by myself, or openly by any other observers there that I am aware of. This is my first photo or video of a UFO, and I have never seen one in person before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time of day: between 2:00pm and 3:45pm CST Camer: Cannon PowerShot A620, 4x optical zoom, digital zoom disabled Media:SanDisk Ultra II 2BG SD card Weather: Clear skies, winds &lt;10mph, temp. mid 70&#39;s (F) Observer: 28 year old male, married, Air Force veteran with 6 years experience in visual and radar identification of aircraft, as well as aircraft capabilities and limitations knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo/Video experience: Novice  The first video is poor quality due to the limitations of the camera. It depicts what I consider to be a cloaked UFO. A single F-15 was performing a vertical climb. I was filming in video mode and trying to follow the movement of the aircraft and zoom in with the climb. In the footage there is a circular distortion on the right. This distortion is stationary in the sky and not a smudge or particle on the lens of the camera. As the camera moved slightly under my attempt to control the zoom and keep the fighter in frame, the object remains stationary, at the same time dust/smudges move with the camera to the left. (The dust/smudges are not in the photo captures.) The fighter does remain blurred considerably on the lower left during zoom. The object in question is very translucent with a slight shimmer around the edges and glimmering slightly over the whole of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO in frame from seconds 0:03-0:06 YouTube Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfwaVB9qjKY Original File: http://rapidshare.com/files/160399199/Cloaked_UFO.AVI.html  This second video is more impressive. Four of the F-16 Thunderbirds are in an opened diamond formation (my description not theirs) awaiting a solo F-16 to come flying through the middle of the group at a higher rate of speed from behind. I am in video mode and following the 4 ship formation. In the review I notice that behind the formation an object moves across at an extremely high rate of speed. The UFO crossed the cameras field of view in less than 1 second! There were only 6 aircraft in the sky at the time, all F-16&#39;s; 5 of which were participating in this pass. Another was preparing to come from a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO in frame from seconds 0:06-0:07 coming from right to left behind(?) the fighters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> YouTube Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJDrklH3FHQ Original File: http://rapidshare.com/files/160399200/High_Speed_UFO.AVI.html  The final video shows all six of the Thunderbirds on approach in Delta formation. The object in question flies from the upper right going to the upper left, and again near the end going form the bottom left to top left. The object may be similar or the same as the object in the second video. No other aircraft were airborne at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO in frame at seconds 0:06 and again at 0:52 YouTube Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdLqZMEgBUA Original File: http://rapidshare.com/files/160399203/High_Speed_UFO_2.AVI.html  I can&#39;t say I noticed any bugs at all. The weather for the whole week before the air show had been fairly cool, upper 60&#39;s day and lower 50&#39;s- upper 40&#39;s at night. The only bugs we have noticed are cold weather nighttime bugs like &#39;stink bugs.&#39; The day of the air show, the weather was fairly warm, mid 70&#39;s. I didn&#39;t notice any bugs or birds that day at all, but unless there is an unusually large amount or lack of, that’s typically something one is oblivious to.<n>

It also had an eminating fuzz like glow right close to the object, much like a mirror reflecting light. It appeared to be not moving and then after takes between the road and back to the sky it had moved over to the right(faster than a plane can travel) in the time it takes to look at the road and back to the sky, possibly over the town area. This was no way a blimp over a small town, because it disappeared in an instant. Time wasn&#39;t something i was paying attention to so im going to guess about 1.5 minutes or so. If you were someone driving north on 81 it is almost impossible to miss this. so hopefully there will be more postings to help this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sounded like huge jets flying by. Ran outside and saw nothing. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and you could see the stars. This happened several times. It sounded like it would fly over and shake the whole house and be gone. We live by the airport so we hear airplanes all the time and this sounded nothing like the usual airplane. Plus on a night with no clouds you can always see the lights from the planes flying by. Tonight there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They were noticable because they where changing colors form red to white to blue.  They also would at times move side to side and up and down.  They also would seem to get closer at times.  At times they almost faded away.  I watched them for about an hour and was mesmerized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has seen them before as well.<n>
11/1/08 00:30|Cleveland|TN|Oval|12 seconds total|Red oval object appeared in the sky on 3 occasions for about five seconds apiece, disappearing each time.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66612.html|454|ndxe200811| Red oval object appeared in the sky on 3 occasions for about five seconds apiece, disappearing each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were sitting on the roof of a building star gazing, looking for shooting stars.  At twelve thirty, around half an hour later, an oval object with a red tint passed directly over us heading east, and disappeared after about five seconds, when nearing the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near five minutes later, it came again, this time moving in a straight line to the west, from the direction it disappeared in previously, and went out of sight behind a tree.  Fifteen minutes later, it appeared again, heading south in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we had seen it for about three seconds, it began to zig-zag up and down, and as soon as it headed straight, it completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the first occurrence with the object, we had seen about three shooting stars, the last being two minutes before the object appeared.  There were also planes in the sky a few minutes before, but it seemed to be at a much higher altitude than them, possibly in or near the atmosphere.<n>

It was traveling north as fast as a shooting star. The speed is the only thing that the object shared in common with a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a dark object in the shape of a cigar but more like a long egg.  There was no light on the craft it was only noticeable due to the light in the atmosphere caused by the city lights.  It traveled silently in a straight line toward the north; this was noticeably in a direct northern path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I caught sight it appeared to be between 300 and 500 feet in the air, it was only about 2 blocks to the west of my position. I was facing the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. What I think was most amazing is it had no lights whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a avid night sky watcher and have observed countless shooting stars, and all types of night flying creatures. This was the first UFO that I have witnessed that I could not contribute to an explainable cause.<n>
