7/30/71 18:00|Bolivar|MO|Cigar|1 minute|Silent fluorescent orange cigar-shaped UFO with neon pink glow around the edges disappeared in an instant|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64847.html|1|ndxe197107| Silent fluorescent orange cigar-shaped UFO with neon pink glow around the edges disappeared in an instant<n> <n><n> <n><n> We moved to 123 S. Oakland in Bolivar, MO in the summer of 1971. It was probably July or August of that year when my incident occurred. I was nine years old, playing outside with my five-year old nephew.  We were pretending the sidewalk in front of the house was our net while we were playing badminton.  The yellow box in the diagram represents our house and the &#34;X&#34; is where I was standing when I saw something over the Coca-Cola plant across the street. It was cigar-shaped and appeared out of the clouds in bright fluorescent orange with a neon pink glow around the edges--it was as long as the block (orange arrow in diagram). I ran inside to get a grown-up to come look at it, but by the time we came back outside it had already disappeared. Since it was just before dusk they told me it was probably the sun playing tricks on me. However it left quite an impression on me--it wasn’t a blimp and it definitely wasn’t the sun shining off of anything. With all of the UFOs in the news lately I decided maybe I should tell my story as well in case it were to collaborate anyone else’s claim if they happened to see something similar around that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother still lives at this location but I would prefer that we remain anonymous (people still think I’m crazy if I mention seeing a UFO). I’m not good at guessing measurements so I am sending an aerial view as well to give you an idea of the length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/25/71 23:40|Puyallup|WA|Circle|2 minutes|I looked up to identify the source of the sound and saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of pattern.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49950.html|2|ndxe197107| I looked up to identify the source of the sound and saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a quiet warm summer night I pulled up to my parent&#39;s house where I still lived while finishing my second college year. Across the street there was a high school football field with an old wood grandstand on the opposite side that faces the field and across to our house. Getting out of the car I heard an intermittent buzzing sound which seemed to come from the field. I thought it might be new sprinklers but the sound was odd so my curiosity was aroused. As I attempted to focus on the sound it shifted from the left to the center of the field and it also echoed off the grandstand. Audibly I realized it was off the ground. I looked up attempting to identify the source of the sound and I saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of rotating pattern.It appeared to have followed my car and was maneuvering in a tightening circle thus shortening its trajectory directly at me, and it was descending. I was awestruck long enough to observe subtle lights of green, red, blue and white on the bottom of the object. I have piloted a plane, boated, and I understand navigation lights well and these were not regular navigation lights. My hair stood on end as I was aware that I was likely witnessing a greatly advanced mechanical object. Suddenly, in sheer animal panic, I ran to the back porch of the house. I was really shaking as I fumbled with the key to unlock the door and the buzzing got louder indicating that it was getting closer yet. I rushed in and yelled at my parents who had been in bed a little while. They came out to the kitchen by the porch but the sound dissipated and they didn&#39;t hear it. Reflecting back, the object seemed rather small, perhaps smaller than my car. I am a sane and logical person and I truly believe what I experienced was not of this world, or at least anything mankind has created. I have told very few people this and this is the first time I have reported it in this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Approx 150-200 yds from 1st to 3rd light. Approx 1 mile from observers, approx 1000 ft altitude. No sound, no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and another Coast Guardsman observed this returning from Calumet heading west toward our Coast Guard station at the north end of the Keweenaw Waterway. Date above is approx, to be best of my recollection. Began as one light coming on, then 2nd, then 3rd. Approx position half mile northeast of Keweenaw Waterway upper entrance (near F.J. McLain State Park, if it&#39;s still there).Could not tell if it was one object or three separate. We turned off the car and got out. There was absolutely no sound or movement, and it was still, clear night. I flicked on the headlights and went from low to high beam and turned them off. Within 5 seconds the object&#39;s center light went out for about 10 seconds then came back on. We&#39;d been observing it for over 5 minutes at this point. Spooked, we got back in the car, started it and watched another full minute as the object&#39;s lights extinguished individually. We could not make out any shape(s) but were convinced beyond any doubt that what we had seen was unconventional, to say the least. I&#39;d like to know if any similar sightings have been reported. Although this happened a long time ago it kind of haunts me and I know I&#39;ll never forget it. Have there been sightings involving 3 bright lights, especially near Lake Superior? To cap off the sighting, we returned to the Coast Guard station where I called an Air Force installation (radar, I believe) which to my recollection was north of Calumet going toward Copper Harbor. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still there. I told the officer on duty I was with the Coast Guard and asked if they&#39;d picked up anything on radar in the area I described to him but he wouldn&#39;t tell me anything, either yes or no. Please contact me about this. Thanks very much! ((Name deleted))<n>
7/15/71 20:00|Steelville|MO|Light|5 minutes|Orange light over Steelville MO in 1971|8/14/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58066.html|11|ndxe197107| Orange light over Steelville MO in 1971<n> <n><n> <n><n> Steelville, MO UFO in 1971  I was very young being only a 7 year old boy in 1971. I was not without understanding of certain things in life, and as I have grown up, I have talked about this with my parents, and with my grandparents. The story has not changed at all since the events took place. It is not a wild crazy story, but simple and pure. I hope people can see how most UFO stories really happen, and can also see the degree of fear that comes over a person as this happens, especially to a young person like me, who barely understood exactly what aliens and flying saucers were really all about. It was not until I was a little older that I had a fuller understanding. Still, I knew at the time as the events I will describe unfolded that aliens meant people from another planet and UFOs were possibly spaceships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not altered this story knowingly, and I have written it down before, but not in recent times. I was 12 when I first wrote it down, and I am not even looking at that as I type this account. I know the story perfectly well in my head, and as you will see, there really is not much to it. I just want people to understand, that I did not embellish this in any way, and I do not want any publicity. I want only to share something that happened. I still have dreams about it. Not really nightmares, because I welcome the experience in my head. At the time, I was scared, and shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in the summer of 1971 in early July. I do not have the exact date, and it is mostly irrelevant in this case since I do not want a case study done. Nothing would ever be proven in this situation or in this account. This story will stand as the only witness to what happened near my grandparent’s home in the woods 4 miles south of Steelville Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 8 PM in the evening and the family was playing cards at my grandparent’s house in Steelville, Missouri (just south of town about 3-4 miles off a dirt road into a woods where they had a nice modern house). I was watching TV nearby in the front room, to this day I am not even sure what I was watching. I do remember that at some point there was something that felt like a vibration from a very low frequency that shook the house. The house is made of brick, and so to shake it means there was a real force at work. Then the electricity went out, and then the phone started ringing, and ringing. Then the back yard lit up in a dull orange glow and something very bright was low just above the trees in the woods behind the house. My grandma answered the phone, but it was still be ringing with the receiver off the hook. All our hair by this time was standing on end either from the fright or electrical static charge that seemed to be in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mom who spotted the orange light in (over) the woods through the sliding glass doors. We all went out back and began watching it, but then it came closer and closer and then I got scared and ran inside the house. I was afraid they were coming this way! They were! I have no idea who they were. I never found out, and the story pretty much ends here, because we saw this light and I mean it was more than a light, it was a huge glow. It was bright, but not over the top bright maybe the woods dulled it some and I was seeing it more or less shaded. It finally appeared in clear view, but was higher in the sky, and went straight up and out of site VERY VERY fast. I did not see it go up; this was told to me by my parents as they came inside, and as we recounted this story. I missed only a few seconds of the show, as it only lasted for 5 minutes or so total time. The power came on and the phone stopped ringing as it left. No one else saw it to my knowledge, and there really are no neighbors close by at all. There were almost no sounds from the light/craft except that low vibrating feeling. It remained always an orange color with no flashing lights. It left, and that is all there is to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a story like this, you will see that I have very few hard details, as there are really none to tell. I can see this all in my head, and it happened. I have no idea what the light was, but it was not anything I would guess is from our current technology. What flies up that fast and goes up and into outer space in a few seconds or less, perhaps as little as 1 second. There are so many stories about people seeing a light in the sky and it all proves so very little in the long run. I have very little to offer, but there is no misinterpretation being made. I have offered this simple story up, and know it is truly a UFO sighting. I hope others who have seen similar lights or craft will be able to gain more understanding from my encounter with a strange light in the sky. There was never anything found in the woods either, nothing burned, no evidence of any kind. We do not believe it landed. It always remained above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me share this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I have looked for reference to it on the internet, but have not found any.  It was reported in the local newspaper and I will relate in this story what the newspaper reported the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A student manager was a quasi-security/manager that were used in the late 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s as an alternative to armed police.  I was riding shotgun with a patrol officer that evening on the 2nd shift.  We were travelling south on US 131, this was before the expressway went through the area.  As we were approaching the M-20 westbound intersection, I had looked up and saw an object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and the sun was in the lower western sky.  The object was south and east of us travelling in a west-northwest direction.  I asked John, the patrolman, what that was.  He looked up and said, &#34;Damn, I don&#39;t know.&#34;  He then turned down M-20 heading west.  The object seemed to be travelling at a pretty good clip.  He sped up and turned on his lights to warn traffic and we started pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I radioed into to dispatch.  We reached speeds up to 100 mph and the object passed us and then slowly went out of sight.  We radioed our position and told them we couldn&#39;t see the object anymore and we were told it had been picked up by the State Police in the next county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of object:  It was oval and size was hard to determine.  If it was high up it would have been very large.  If it was close to the ground, it would have been 40&#39;-50&#39; feet front to back.  Actually, John and I could never figure out the size of the object.  It had an orangish color.  It could have been a reflection of the evening sun or it could have been orangish.  There was no pulsations.  There were no individual lights.  There was no details at all, in fact.  Just an oval shaped, orange glowing object that seemed to be travelling at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local paper in Big Rapids, The Pioneer, the next day reported the incident.  They stated that the object had first been spotted in Big Rapids, then by State Police in Lake county, then by the Coast Guard radar and also Air Force radar located in Frankfurt, MI.  Two jets were scrambled out of Minnesota and they intercepted the object over Wisconsin and chased it into Iowa, where it was reported to have simply just flown away from the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not been able to find reference to this event, though I have searched.  Many people saw this object and it was reported by many different government employees.  In fact, two days after the event, John and I were questioned for about a half hour by two individuals from some vague agency, neither of us were able to understand what it was.  When I first watched MIB and Tommy Lee Jones always made up an agence, like Division 6, I thought of these two guys that had questioned us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We had broken away from the carrier, as we often did.  We were on our way to North Viet Nam and going through the Philippine Sea when all of a sudden of to the starboard side of the ship the port lookout reported to me he saw something bright and big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately stepped back and grabbed the big eyes, which are binoculars that are 3 ft. long and can see 18 mi.  What I saw was amazing.  It looked like a dirigible only it was over 2000 ft. long with a white cloud around the middle of it hovering over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer and closer to it, it was directly parallel to us.  It was a mother ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the starboard lookout radioed to the bridge what he was seeing, it disappeared.  After it disappeared it left a round rainbow of red, yellow, blue and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we pulled up beside it on the port side and I could almost reach out and touch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Navy officers were there with 8mm cameras filming it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for about 20 min. and dissipated.  After that there was no debriefing at all, and no scuttlebutt among crew members, which amazes me to this day.  Everyone went on about there daily duties as if nothing happened.  It amazes me to this day that I never said anything, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my recollection this is how it happened in 1971.<n>

Together, we saw a large, cigar shaped object moving very slowly above the tunnel. I am not sure how high the object was above the ground, but it was close enough to see detals of the object clearly. I would guess it was about 100 feet long, and clearly metalic with no markings that we could see. The thing that stands out in my mind the most was that there was absolutly no sound whatsoever. Neither did we see any windows or other openings. It was simply a solid, highly reflective object, that moved quietly above the tunnel at a very slow but constant speed. We watched the object for about 5 minutes, until it disappeared on the other side of the tunnel. We tried to find it again, but we could find no trace of it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My other friend who lived across the street was coming to call on me and also noticed it. When we arrived at the apartment building, numerous people were walking about looking around and talking about it. There was no physical evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I observed, what I first thought was a shooting star, coming directly at me from space. It was traveling at a extremely fast rate of speed. It was a mild clear star-clustered night with perfect visability of the sky. After a few seconds the shooting star turned into a very bright light that lit up the entire area making it look almost daylight. Just before the bright object struck us it stopped almost instantaneously. Being in the USAF and flying in F105 Jets and working on the same, I know that this was not any type of man made aircraft. I estimated this object to be about 1500 to 2000 feet above us. I could not hear any noise from the object. After stopping at such close proximity to us, I notice that it resembled 2 large bell shaped search lights with tremendous candle power. I could not see what they were attached to, but I assume that these 2 large lights were attached to something. Then the large search lights started to scan the ground traveling in opposite directions and then reversing similtaneously and moving in the other direction. They appeared to be search lights searching for something. After scanning back and forth several times the lights started moving toward the horizon at a slow rate of speed. I observed these 2 lights until they disappeared over the horizon all the time scanning the lights back and forth as if searching for something. My girlfriend cried and begged me to leave. She would not get out of the car we were sitting in. I was curious and frightened at the same time, but I did get out of my car and watched this object until it slowly disappeared over the horizon. I have told this story to all my family members but did not have the means or address to send this sighting to anyone for documentation. I am curious if anyone else has had the same type sighting as I had. Being a Vietnam Veteran in the United States Air Force, I can assure you that our government does not have any type of flying craft that could ! perform in the manner that this object did. This object went from traveling at a speed of approximately 1500 MPH to a complete stop in a matter of a second. I am convienced that this object was guided by intelligence, weather by remote control or by occupancy. This is the first time and the last time in my lifetime that I have observed anything of this nature. I am presently 57 years of age and curious to see if similar reports were submitted to your agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/10/71 14:00|New Orleans|LA|Oval|90 minutes|One thousand saucers observed telescopically crossing the sun over a ninety minute period.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38264.html|18|ndxe197107| One thousand saucers observed telescopically crossing the sun over a ninety minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, cousin, mother and I all were witness to an event where over one-thousand UFOs crossed the sun one bright summer day in New Orleans, Louisiana. (They were viewed telescopically as they crossed the sun’s disk (details below).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was a usual clear blue sky scorcher, and being an avid amateur astronomer, I spent much of the day and night just looking around the sky and keeping notes. It was 1971 and I was 13 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The summer was typically boring, and so I tried out my 2.5 inch refractor telescope given to me by my parents a couple of years earlier on sunspot observations; once again, I borrowed a chair from my mother’s kitchen, and placed a leftover poster board (they were only white in those days) on the chair to accept the image from the telescope eyepiece. This way everyone could enjoy the huge image of the broiling sun at the same time as me and I could leisurely sit in the chair I had taken from my desk to make notes and sketch sunspots. This was the umpteenth time I had done this and so I was the only one watching when the event started, interest from the rest of my family having waned over the last many times I had performed this type of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several hours of watching and sketching that June day in 1971, I noticed a small black dot cross from right to left across the sun’s disk. Being experienced at seeing planes, birds, and insects fly by I was initially puzzled by this rather non-descript and slowly moving object. It took about 5 seconds to cross and was about 1/40 of the sun’s apparent diameter on the poster board. This made the object about a half inch in length. My curiosity increased when a second object began crossing from the right just before the first one exited on the left side of the sun’s disk. I immediately refocused the refractor to get the crossing object better focused, as it had a well defined gray annulus around the black center. Interestingly, the focus for the sun (essentially infinity) was the correct focus for the object! Before the second object exited the sun’s disk to my left (after crossing about 4/5 of the sun’s diameter), a third object entered from the right. Each of these objects were identical; they consisted of a black (matching the center of sunspots, essentially) lozenge shaped center, surrounded by a uniform thickness, very sharply defined gray annular ring. The lozenge length to width was about 3 to one, and the annular gray ring was slightly less than half the thickest (center) part of the black shadow. (In reviewing the sighting afterwards, I took a dish from my mother&#39;s cabinet and found that if one held the dish so that it was about 30 degrees from edge on, the projected shape roughly matched the objects I had sighted.)  The three objects all exhibited the same shimmering that the sun’s disk and sunspots exhibited, indicating they were far enough up in the air (or out in space?) to be affected by the atmosphere in the same way stars twinkle. I was watching in the afternoon and so my refractor was angled about 45 degrees above horizontal to start with, and about an hour and a half later (after the last object had crossed), it was less than 30 degrees. After another half dozen or so had crossed the face of the sun and cast their shadows on my poster board, I had enough data to enable me to leave the scene and gather my family as witnesses. My cousin and sister were playing outside at the time (they were about three years and two years younger than me, respectively), and so I brought them to the telescope to see what was happening. Being only 10 and 11 years old, their interest waned after just three crossings, since the scenario remained identical; just prior to one object leaving the  disk to our left, another entered from our right, over and over. After less than a half minute, they went back to whatever they were doing before I coaxed them into watching “that boring stuff Herbie does”. I yelled for my mom to come see; we lived in one of those duplex shotgun houses in New Orleans; they were called shotgun houses because you could fire a weapon from the front room and it would go all the way through to the one bathroom at the rear without hitting any wall but going through the open doors of each of the four rooms (after the front room, the parent’s bedroom, then the children’s bedroom, then the living room, then the kitchen). It was easy to yell for her even though she was all the way back in the kitchen. Her reply was typical of when I asked her to come see something – whether through my microscope or telescope; a delaying action born of many observations of relatively boring (to her) objects. She said she was busy and would be there soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her to bring the camera (a box black and white) so I could photograph the sun’s disk and these crossing objects, and again she said she’d be there soon. After about an hour I had to relieve myself (one does drink fluids in New Orleans on a hot summer day!) and so I asked my sister to take over and watch if anything changes. I took the opportunity to implore my mother to come see again and after I returned to the refractor and the objects passing (my sister had already abandoned her post to go play again) she showed up without the camera, saying it had no film. She watched for about 30 seconds and then went back to the kitchen, apparently as uninterested in the whole thing as my sister and cousin; it didn’t affect anything that day (or even for the conceivable future), and so I alone was left to the task of watching what I could only assume were alien visitors from space moving from one place to another in single file in their flying saucers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 90 minutes after the procession started, it ended. Not as abruptly as it started, however. At first near the end there was no follower to the object exiting to the left side of the sun’s disk where it should have been, but then another would show up timed as if there had been the &#34;missing&#34; object, and followed appropriately by the next object entering from the right as the prior object exited to the left. This occurred several times before no more objects entered or exited the sun’s image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altogether I estimated 1,080 (that’s one-thousand and eighty, give or take) had passed between my 2.5 inch objective refractor telescope with Barlow lens and the sun. Near what was to be the middle of the event, or about 45 minutes into the procession - the density of crossing increased several times. At one point there were five objects &#34;on screen&#34; at the same time. A single object entered from the right, as usual when the prior object was nearing its exit to the left, when a pair of objects entered shortly after. The top object in this pair was in line with the boring procession as it had unfolded for the last three quarters of an hour, but the companion was below and to the rear, offset about half the length of one of these objects and down about the width in close proximity. When the single object had reached the spot where another object entered opposite it on the sun’s face, another object did enter, and was followed almost immediately by another (fifth) object. This train of discs continued across, followed by four in line objects, and then the pattern returned to normal, with only two objects on the sun&#39;s face at any one time (until the end of the event, of course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also during what was to be the middle of the event, I tried to detect the objects before and after they crossed the sun proper, by moving my telescope just off to either side of the sun and looking directly out into the clear blue sky. I saw nothing through the refractor (neither directly or cast on the poster board), nor did I see anything with the naked eye as I shielded my vision with my hand from direct sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were they ours or theirs? Earth made or made somewhere else? I don’t know. However, subsequent to this observation, I read in a Charles Fort book that a Mexican astronomer by the name of Bonilla had witnessed a similar train of shadows in 1883. More recently, I have found several other astronomical sightings through the internet that resemble my 1971 event (though with far fewer numbers) and I have done some back of the envelope calculations using elementary trigonometry that shows the objects would have been about 100 feet in diameter if exo-atmospheric. Additionally, the difference in girth from a thin plate held at an angle and the thicker, lozenge shape of these objects I found could be explained if they had some thickness to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are other analyses and minor observations related to this event, but these are best left for a later time, as this e-mail has gotten way too big already!  If anyone else has heard of or seen such things, I would appreciate feedback.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The fire department was still there making sure no fires would start up from falling ashes and we along with numerous kids to adults were about to leave when a cigar shaped object with shining multi colored lights underneath appeared over the lake.  It hovered for what seemed like 15 - 20 minutes very low over the small lake.  No one moved until all of a sudden (and I think it was an M-80) a loud explosion sent gravel flying around us and the object raised up a few feet and then swish it was gone.  A picture and article was in the paper the next day but I can not find any mention thru research.  I could have the year wrong + or- one year.

I was in the tallest building in Santa Barbara, where the radio station was.  I was in the control booth.  I was looking out towards the ocean.  From where I was, you could see the bay and on either side were hills that come up.  Often times you see private plans flying or an occasional airliner descending to the airport further north.  What I saw this day was a very fast moving object that covered the distance between the two hill rises (on either sides of the bay) faster than any plane, or commercial jet could.  It was also lower in the horizon than planes flying in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the DJ, did you see that?  They had not.  I was then transfixed at the window.

7/2/71 21:00|Atlantic Ocean (CV-67 U.S.Navy)||Sphere|5 minutes|After noting a communicaitons failure, we observed a large glowing sphere hovering over the ship.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13385.html|22|ndxe197107| After noting a communicaitons failure, we observed a large glowing sphere hovering over the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter occurred in 1971, while aboard the aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy CVA-67 (now CV-67) in the Bermuda Triangle, southeast of Florida. I was assigned to the communications department of the Kennedy and had been in this section about a year. The ship was returning to Norfolk, VA after completing a two week operational readiness exercise (ORE) in the Caribbean. We were to stand down for 30 days, after arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, to allow the crew to take leave and visit family before deploying to the Mediterranean for six months. I was on duty in the communications center. My task was to monitor eight teletypes printing the &#34;Fleet Broadcasts&#34;. On the top row were four teletypes each printing messages from four different channels. On the bottom row were four more doing the exact same thing except the signal was carried on different frequencies. If one of the primary receivers started taking &#34;hits&#34; I would be able to retrieve the message from the bottom one. I also notified Facilities Control of any hits so they could tune the receivers. On the other side of the compartment(room) was the NAVCOMMOPNET (Naval Communications Operations Network). This was the Ship to Shore circuit with the top teletype being the receive and the bottom as the send (known as a duplex circuit). Next to this was the Task Group Circuit for ship to ship communications (task group operations or TGO). It was in the evening, about 20:30 (8:30 PM) and the ship had just completed an eighteen hour &#34;Flight Ops&#34;.  I had just taken a message off one of the broadcasts and turned around to file it on a clip board. When I turned back to the teletypes the primaries were typing garbage. I looked down to the alternates which were doing the same. I walked a few feet to the intercom between us and the Facilities Control. I called them and informed them of the broadcasts being out. A voice replied that all communications were out. I then turned  and looked in the direction of the NAVCOMMOPNET and saw that the operator was having a problem. I then heard the Task Group operator tell the watch officer that his circuit was out also. In the far corner of the compartment was the pneumatic tubes going to the Signal bridge (where the flashing light and signal flag messages are sent/receive). There is an intercom there to communicate with the Signal Bridge and over this intercom we heard someone yelling  &#34;IT IS GOD! IT&#39;S THE END OF THE WORLD!&#34;. A moment later we heard another voice yelling. &#34;There is something hovering over the ship!&#34; As we looked up, we saw a large, glowing sphere. Well it seemed large, however, there was no point of reference. That is to say, if the sphere were low; say 100 feet above the ship, then it would have been about two to three hundred feet in diameter. If it were say 500 feet about the ship then it would have been larger. At arms length it was the size of a beach ball. It made no sound that I could hear. The light coming from it wasn&#39;t too bright, about half of what the sun would be. It pulsated from yellow to orange slowly. We didn&#39;t get to looked at for more than about 20 seconds because General Quarters (Battle stations) was sounding and the Communication Officer was in the passageway telling us to get back into the Comm Center. We returned and stayed there (that was out battle station). We didn&#39;t have much to do because all the communication was still out. After about 20 minutes, the teletypes started printing correctly again. We stayed at General Quarters for about  another hour, then secured. I didn&#39;t see or hear of any messages going out about the incident. Over the next few hours, I talked to a good friend that was in CIC (combat information center) who was a radar operator. He told me that all the radar screens were just glowing during the time of the incident. I also talked to a guy I knew that worked on the Navigational Bridge. He told me that none of the compasses were working and that the medics had to sedate a boatswains mate that was a lookout on the signal bridge. I figured this was the one yelling it was God. It was ironic that of the 5,000 men on a carrier, that only a handful actually saw this phnomenon. This was due to the fact that flight Ops had just be completed a short time before this all started and all the flight deck personnel were below resting. It should be noted that there are very few places where you can go to be out in the open air aboard a carrier. From what I could learn, virtually all electronic components stopped functioning during the 20 minutes or so that what ever it was hovered over the ship. The two Ready CAPs (Combat Air Patrol), which were two F-4 Phantoms that are always ready to be launched, would not start. I heard from the scuttlebut (slang - rumor mill) that three or four &#34;men in trenchcoats&#34; had landed, and were interviewing the personnel that had seen this phenomena. I was never interviewed, maybe because no one knew that I had seen it. A few days latter, as we were approaching Norfolk, the Commanding and Executive Officers came on the closed circuit TV system that we had. They did this regularly to address the crew and pass on information. During this particular session the Captain told us how well we did on the ORE and about our upcoming deployment to the Mediterranean. At the very end of his spiel, he said &#34;I would like to remind the crew, that certain events that take place aboard a Naval Combatant Ship, are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone without a need to know&#34;. This was all the official word I ever received or heard of the incident.<n>

It was a camp in the hilly, wooded area of southern Indiana. We had just put the campers to bed in the 6 cabins and 7 of us counselors (ages 17-23) were sitting on the bathhouse steps talking quietly, as we did every night for an hour or so after the kids went to bed. We could see all 6 cabin doors from the bathhouse steps and a wooded hill rose behind the cabins. Off to our left and on a small hill (in the mowed area of the camp) was the camp owner&#39;s ranch house. Suddenly a ham-can shaped flying object came over the hill behind the cabins and flew past us to stop and hover over the owner&#39;s house. It was about the size of the house and it had white-yellow lights running around the side of the &#34;ham can&#34;. We were all shocked and we stood up and grabbed each other, asking what we should do. Two of the female counselors and one of the male counselors started crying and we were all talking at once. The craft hovered silently over the house for maybe 30m seconds. Then it rose up in the air and then zipped at an amazing speed back where it came from, over the hill behind the cabins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was visiting with some friends that were my age.  We were living in an isolated area that was home to 2 mobile homes.  There was myself, another boy and 2 girls.  There were no adults around at the time.  It was about 3PM and the 4 of us were sitting outside in lawn chairs removing peas from their pods.  We were just talking then out of no where a very large silver disk object appeared just above the treetops (Georgia pines) and approximately 50 yards away.  The object did not have any lights or make any sound it did have a large shadow.  The four of us saw the object at the same time and without saying a word to each other the 4 of us bolted to the inside of the mobile homes.  One boy and girl bolted into one mobile home and the other girl and I bolted into the other mobile home.  We still have not said anything to each other we were petrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got in the mobile home I grabbed a large knife out of one of the kitchen drawer and hid in a small closet in the kitchen that the garbage was kept in.  After what seemed a long period of time I finally got the courage and started yelling for the other girl that was in the mobile home with me.  She yelled back at me and we slowly left our hiding spots.  She was hiding under the bed in the first bedroom.  We eventually went back out and the disk was gone.  We then went into the other mobile home and got the boy and girl out of there.  When I returned home to Warner Robins AFB, GA the following weekend I shared my experience with my sister and she had told me that during the time I was gone there was a high level of UFO activity in the Georgia area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why I would like to be hypnotized is to get a better idea of how long we were actually hiding in the mobile homes.  I have no memory of the actual time span that this took place.  I also believe I would be able to better describe the UFO under hypnosis.<n>
