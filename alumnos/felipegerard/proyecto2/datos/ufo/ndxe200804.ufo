I pulled over right away and tried to get a shape of the object, it was moving very slow, not up, but foward.  and with my hand held at arms length was the size of my pinky nail. after about 20 seconds it just turned off, i did not see any shapes when the light turned off, and there was no noise at all. no airplane lights or chopter lights, nada.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The appox. time was 23:08. My husband discovered it. After watching for about 10 minutes came in to the house to get me to come out and look also. As we watched and discussed it. I decided to contact you. We sit out on our porch just about every evening and have never seen this. We pondered if it was a star because it was so far away.  We could not come to a conclusion what we are seeing. It had a flashing red, green and blues light. That seemed to twinkle. We determined it was not an airplane, because it stayed in the same area. We do not know or have an explaination as to what we were seeing. I tried to take several pictures with no luck. I have them saved on my digital camera. Don&#39;t know how much help it would be. Maybe someone saw or reported what we saw also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5-10 seconds later, 7 white orb-like lights came sweeping across the sky from the east.  The lights did not seem to be in any sort of formation, but were grouped closely toghether.  At first I thought the lights were all part of one craft, but I&#39;m almost positive that a couple of the lights moved independently of each other.  The lights moved in a westerly direction above Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, but were not helicopters.  The lights made absolutely no sound and had no other visible navigational lights.  I called loudly to my wife to come outside, but she was in the shower and did not hear me.  The lights disappeared from my view is less than a minutes after being obscured by the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was silent, it did not make any sound whatsoever.  It was a very large, elongated disc-shape, with flashing red and green lights all over it.  The body of it seemed to glow from within ever so slightly.  I watched it hover for approx. 10 mins, after which time I came into the house and called the police non-emerg. number, to ask if anyone had reported seeing such a thing.  The officer asked &#34;do you mean over Madison school?&#34;  I replied no, over Trumbull High and Hillcrest schools.  Evidently, someone had seen something earlier over Madison School.  The officer asked me if it looked like it was trying to land, and I said no, it was just hovering. I also called 2 family members who live in other parts of towm to see if they could see anything, none of whom did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside to continue viewing, and the object was still there, hovering and occassionally ascending and descending slightly, as well as turning slowly from side-to-side.  I went in to call a neighbor, and both of them called me back saying that they also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and continued to watch it, I watched it for about 20 minutes overall.  It then started to descend more, wavering somewhat from side-to-side as it came down.  It got to the treetop level over in the direction of the Vocational Agricultural School, and I ran back into the house to phone the police to tell them it seemed to be coming down, and when I ran back outside it was gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned the police this morning, to ask if they had determined what it was, and they said that no, they did not, but they filed an official police report, based on what they saw.  Evidently, some police personnel had also seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not make any discernible sound. I watched it for approx. 10 mins., then put the dog into the house, and phoned the police non-emerg. #, to ask if anyone had reported something strange over Trumbull high school athletic field.  The officer who answered asked &#34;Do you mean Madison School?  Yes, people have reported seeing something over Madison.&#34;  I said no, Trumbull High School.  The officer then asked &#34;Does it look like it&#39;s trying to land?&#34;  I said no, I had watched it for the past 10 minutes, and it was just hovering in place, making no sound.  He said they had recv&#39;d. a number of calls, and for me to tell him if it looked like it was going to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned two neighbors, who went out and called me back, telling me that they saw it, too.  I went back outside, and continued to watch it for another 10-12 minutes.  It hovered in the same spot, mostly, then once it raised and lowered slightly, and once it turned to the side.  After it turned to the side, it began to move toward the Agricultural Science school and the animal pasture outside the school, descending as it moved.  It looked as though it might actually land over in that direction.  I watched it reach treetop level, then I rushed back in to call the police again on the non-emerg. #, telling them that it looked like it might try to land.  I went back outside, and it was gone completely, nowhere in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned the police the following morning to see if they had determined what it was, and the woman officer who answered the call said &#34;No, but we filed an offical police report, based on what we saw.&#34;  I asked her if the police had seen it, and she said yes.  I spoke to a reporter from the local paper, who wrote an article about it, and he found out from the police that they had received a call earlier that night of 4-30-08 that an &#34;Anonymous caller on 911 reports massive spacecraft landing.&#34;  That caller was referring to Madison School, not Trumbull High School, which is where I saw it.  The two schools are miles apart.  The reporter confirmed that there were no outdoor activities at the schools that night, no science clubs flying kites or anything.  When the reporter asked the police if they had seen it, they denied that they had.  What I saw was as large as a house, and was only a few hundred ft. off the ground when it was hovering for over 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is something I do quite often since I moved to Lake Tahoe.  As I was standing there on the beach I noticed a small very spherical object moving awkwardly around the clouds.  It looked metallic which is why I believe it was so shinny because the sunset was reflecting off the metallic surface.  Initially the brightness of the object caught my attention but then I realized that this object was moving much faster than a plane and in any direction without losing speed.  I watched this object for about a minute while I was trying to zoom my camera in close enough to get a good photo of it.  I managed to get one clear picture of the object.  I didn&#39;t see it leave the area.  I looked up from the LCD screen of my digital camera after I tried to take a picture of it and it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tried to look for the object once I cleared the trees but it was gone.  The object was a dark color almost a dark brown.  I hope that there were more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had to be over Camelback Mountain (8 miles away), or maybe further west towards Glendale, it all depended on their altitude. They were in an area of the night sky that was void of stars, probably due to pollution. This is why I knew they did not belong there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further visual exploration of the scene, I noticed a third twinkling light at a lower altitude. The three would get brighter and move around a bit, but they would stay in the same general area. Sometimes they would dim to the point that they were impossible to see, only to brighten and twinkle once more. They did not move for nearly an hour, after which time tiredness dectated that I go to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Forty five minutes into watching these lights, or around 12:45, there was what I deemed to be an aircraft with a bright red flashing light, maybe a helicopter, that flew past all three of these objects. It should also be noted that these objects were present before I noticed them, and they probably lasted after I went to bed. I am writing this report after having come inside from watching the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am visiting family for the week, and am leaving tomorrow. I did hear of a &#39;second round&#39; of Phoenix Lights that took place a week ago (4/21/08)on the news last week. I think these lights behaved similarly to the ones I saw on many local news stations, however, they did not change positions such as the ones from a week ago, the lights tonight were relatively stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was heading south on wadsworth and as soon as i passed 44th and wads cross street, A green orb flew SE over wadsworth, about 100-200 ft above my car; at first i thought it was a green fire work,because i saw lights behind it,looked as if firework exploded.But the green orb was moving too fast east to be firework in wind.The lights behind it remided me of jet or helicopter;The lights following orb were white in close V shape with a green light on one side and red on the other, i concluded a human vehicle.The light was moving faster than any jet ive ever seen fly in a suburban area, and the jet or heli was trying to keep up with it; it was moving so fast i couldnt keep up with them going 40mph in my vehicle, I tried to follow them with my eyes but lost them behind some buildings, by the time i got to a street that followed their direction both were gone from my view. I started calling my friends letting them know hwat i saw, i was freaking out,I didnt know if i should call 911 or police or what.i have never seen anything fly that low and quick in the city, everyone i called wouldnt believe what i just saw. The next morning on the way to work i was heading east on colfax toward denver and i saw two sets of 2 black goverment helicpoters flying close together over denver and more north toward lakewood. after seeing those the next morning i new something wasn&#39;t write and comfirmed that something happened the night before, so idecided to report this to MUFON, ive seen this company on history channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 11:05 PM with a clear sky. When we noticed the light, we stopped for a second to look at it, thinking that it was coming from a plane.  After a few seconds, the light started to fade away, almost as if it were moving back. The big bright light dimmed into a tiny red light, then within seconds, it completely disappeared. We drove out of the neighborhood to get onto the main rood (which had a better view) to see if we noticed any thing out of the norm.  There was absolutely nothing in the sky but a few stars in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not tell the exact shape of the objects; however, the lights were square at the bottom and then out from the middle of each of the top 3 sides of the square was another light (a short distance from the box).  The objects were not moving but were hovering in the same place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a beam of light shining to the west (toward Memphis) coming from the first 2 of the 4.  This was observed close to mile marker 35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached mile marker 52, I observed 2 helicopters in the sky crossing the interstate flying toward the direction of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued down the interstate and as I came to mile marker 72, I observed 2 more helicopters in the sky.   As I approached mile marker 75, it looked like 2 more of the same shaped objects in the distance (northern direction).<n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .......<n> <n><n> <n><n> .       .     .       .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this to be unusual.

At first I figured the object was just some type of plane going to land at a major airport about 30 miles away. The problem was that the object didn’t seem to heading in the direction of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed, it didn’t strike me as any type of aircraft I had ever seen before. I couldn’t see the actual structure too clearly but the outline was noticeable. About 10 or so lights as bright as stars lined the craft to form the triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing was that there was absolutely no sound coming from the object. I am very familiar with human aircraft and there is no such craft of that shape that can fly so low and not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for a few seconds, I looked down at my dog and when I looked back up, the object was completely gone. I waited outside another five minutes to kind of gather up what I had seen and to wait for any delayed sound, however a sound never came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also see and HEAR a commercial plane in the distance (about 5 miles away) after about five minutes after I had seen the UFO. The commercial plane was moving much slower than the UFO. And the lights were noticeable for a few minutes. The lights of the UFO were not visible after I had looked away for only 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed flickering lights in the distance. Thought it might be an airplane but it didn&#39;t move for five minutes. Called to my fiance to come look, while I grabed my telescope. Through my telescope noticed a donut shaped object with red, blue, yellow and maybe green lights moving in a quick circular motion. Tried to take a picture with my camera but once I got in focus it disapeared.  I&#39;m not the type of person who believes in this stuff, and I can usually come up with an explanation. But I don&#39;t know what to say about this. Wondering if someone else saw this object. It should have been seen clearly from Malibu to Ventura over the Pacific Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time they appeared lasted about 30-45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ruled them out as commercial planes almost immediately when they didn&#39;t move or have blinking lights. They disappeared for a minute or two, and then reappeared in a different location  a half mile further to the south, but in the same triangular formation. At one point, on of the lights separated into 2 lights, then combined back into 1. The lights would brighten and dim in intervals, but the brightness of all 3 objects was totally synchronized. After they reached their brightest point, they disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked as if the objects were around 100 to 200 feet apart in the formation, but it was cloudy and drizzling, so it was hard to tell for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called a friend who lives on the outskirts  of town outside the range of the ambient city  light and he said he saw  “ dozens of them all over the sky .”  My girlfriend got her camera w/ a telephoto lens and when we looked at one of these objects it appeared to be a circle with a geometrically placed display of tightly grouped lights. We looked at another of these objects and saw the same display of lights. However the light display changed from many lights tightly grouped to just six large lights now occupying the same space . We looked at the other object to compare them again and this objects light display had changed to the six light array as well. The objects did not move and maintained their distance from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/29/08 20:00|Reno|NV|Fireball|6 seconds|Large round glowing yellow fireball traveling at a high rate of speed, then suddenly stopping and disappearing|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62926.html|23|ndxe200804| Large round glowing yellow fireball traveling at a high rate of speed, then suddenly stopping and disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> At appproximately 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 29, 2008, I had just left Reno, NV heading eastbound on I-80 towards Elko, NV. A large perfectly round glowing object caught my eye as it came into my field of vision above me in my front window of my car heading the exact same direction at an extremely fast speed. At first I thought it was a falling star beacuase of the speed that it traveled across the sky, but then I realized it was traveling way too low and it was way too large, and it was glowing yellow not white as typical of the falling stars I have seen often. At that point my mind told me it must be a meteor but here was absolutely no trail behind it. Then it came to a sudden halt but never diminished in brightness, and then just totally became invisible, like it turned its light off. I got I weird gut feeling like this was something I could not explain. Everyone in the car was freaking out because they were all equaly scared. The only other time I had this feeling was in Seattle ,WA in May 1977 at approxiamtely 9:00 p.m. when a small craft the size of a small car followed our car full of five people through a road with tall trees on both sides just floating behind our vehicle, you could see it in the rear view mirror. It was a typical saucer like design that consisted of four rows of glowing windows. Our car died in the middle of the road and we were not able to start it for about a minute. Everyone was hysterical and terrified. Just was curious if anyone else saw the Reno meteor/light in the sky?<n>

They were about 800ft away and 10 degrees hovering stationary in the sky above a farm field. They appeared to be the size of two school buses long and two high.There was no sound and were hovering stationary apart 200ft from each other  on a windy day.After ten to fifteen seconds of observation a helicopter[New   York State Police] flew over the bus about one hundred feet off the ground heading for the craft.The helicopter got about six hundred feet from the objects,then both of them  vanished in a blink of an eye.Then the chopper did a few circles and the radio came back on.I am an aircraft enthusiast and never have seen aircraft look or act like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I brought my friends attention to it in the first 2-3 seconds, and he then observed it as well. It made a slight shift right after direct center from east to west, then continued in a new straight line from that point. The total time was well under 10 seconds, but I would guess over 5 seconds. There were several people sitting near us at the levee, and we asked if they saw it as well, and they said that they had. The speed was absolutely inconcievable to my mind. I do not know the height relative to earth to estimate a speed, but the object was clearly further than the clouds, but either within the earth&#39;s atmosphere, or BARELY without (I am quite sure it was well within the earth&#39;s atmopshere, but do not want to swear to it, and make the sighting loose legitimacy for lack of exact knowledge on this particular detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was clear the entire time, and the speed was, frankly, unbelievable. It went from near due east to near due west, across the entire sky in well under 10 total seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called my friend out and he looked thru his telescope and agreed that it had several lights around it and wasn&#39;t moving or making noise.   I ran upstairs to my neighbors, who are facing the water also, and asked them to go out on their porch with me and look to see what they saw.  My neighbors looked thru their binoculars and noticed the craft had several lights all the way around it but couldn&#39;t tell if it was a triangle.  It stayed in one place for several minutes.  I went down stairs and watched it fade away.  We didn&#39;t know if we should call the radio station or not.  My neighbor looked on a site on his computer to see if anyone had said anything or not.  He didn&#39;t really know where to look and by that time the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept my eye on it for around 10 minutes. In the opposite direction moving north was an airplane with it&#39;s lights flashing as usual. Closer and closer they got to each other. I thought they were going collide. All of a sudden the objects light turned completely off. I couldn&#39;t see anything anymore. The plane then pass through the objects path. Soon after the plane passed, the object turned on some lights but this time they were strobing colors. The colors were red, yellow, blue, purple, cyan just an amazing array of different colors. One thing I noticed was that everytime the lights would flash the object seemed to advance about 500 yards more or less. I would see the object then in a millisecond of it&#39;s flashing lights the object would be further south. I live at the tip of Texas. Mexico is about 3 mile from where I live. That object was moving south towards Mexico. I kept my eye on it until I couldn&#39;t anymore. The entire sighting last for about 30 minutes<n>

Left side of craft (person’s view) is bright and portioned by wavy panel. A life form to the right of the panel appears to be piloting craft, is aware of our observation, and has been observed to wave and beam out lighted hologram faces. The top craft on its top left side has an electronic type of projection that appears as a face hologram. At its neck level, computer like instrument panel has small light that has flickered like robot talking. Observation conforms to Vallee’s Type – I (b) (c) classification description.

The object was almost directly overhead of the observers&#39; location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first observer quickly called the object to the attention of the other witness, who apparently already had observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first observer checked the time of the event with his cell telephone, and the time of the event was measured at 22:11 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time).  He then stated to the second observer that the event probably had been caused by the reflection of sunlight from an Iridium satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the first observer, who has witnessed dozens of Iridium &#34;flares,&#34; was surprised by the fact that the light appeared to be moving surprisingly slowly.  During the duration of the event (3-5 seconds), the object did not move more than from one quarter to one half degree of arc (estimated), much less than the typical angular velocity of a satellite in low Earth orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first observer returned home, he checked the website, &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt;, and was surprised by the fact that no &#34;flare&#34; from an Iridium was visible at 22:11 hrs. (local) on April 27.  The schedule of flares is seen below:  Date Local Time Intensity ( Mag) Alt.  Azimuth  Distance to flare centre Intensity at flare centre (Mag.)

4/27/08 21:00|Honaunau|HI|Fireball|10 minutes|10 to 20 lights in the sky above Honaunau, Hi 4/27/08|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62698.html|33|ndxe200804| 10 to 20 lights in the sky above Honaunau, Hi 4/27/08<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was inside my home exercising and noticed a glowing light in the sky through my window. I went outside to investigate. I noticed ten glowing lights resembling dim fireballs in the sky in an octagon formation with two or three in the middle of the octagon. I went inside to get my phone camera and when I got back out to the road to film, the glowing lights left their octagon formation and began to ascend in single-file into outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as all ten (could be more) faded away at what seemed to be very fast altitudes. It wasn&#39;t over just yet.  Suddenly there were 8 to ten more where the first ten had been in octagon formation. They moved into single-file and ascended into space as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many people on the highway stopping their vehicles to this spectacle. I could hear cars stopping and people talking about what they were experiencing. I heard one person say that they saw a glowing blue/green inside the orange/yellow fire of each light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place on Sunday, April 27 2008 at between 8:30 and 10 pm. There was a report of a man down at Keei beach (4 miles away) who saw the lights in an upside down question mark formation at sundown towards the mountains. That was sundown! that means the lights were in the sky for quite some time (half hour+). When I noticed the lights, they were towards the ocean, meaning the lights were between the main Mamalahoa hwy in Honaunau and the ocean- a 4-5 mile area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two phases of lights. The first held formation, then ascended at approx 9:00, then 5 minutes later as second series of lights (from the horizon) ascended into  in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pondering the altitude of the lights before they disappeared and 20,000 plus feet came to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were dozens of whitenesses. There will probably be more reports of this same sighting. I filmed for five minutes. The movie took does not do the sighting any justice because of extremely low resolution. Only minute specs of dots are seen ever few seconds- nothing consistent to the actual behavior of the lights. here is the link to the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o3AeYLiY-k  (may contain some foul language)  Thank you<n>

At first I was looking straight ahead, but all of the sudden a large green fireball about 50 times the size of a normal star averted my attention to the sky. The object was bright green fire that came to a point at the tail end. It had sparks flailing off of the it as it shot across the sky. I was on the phone with my boyfriend who was delivering pizzas across town and he saw the same thing, and we are at least 30 miles away from each other. His experience was that he saw the fireball separate into four different distinct smaller objects, only to converge seconds later back into one fireball before disappearing. The speed of the object was much faster than a plane, but it lingered in the sky for at least 20 seconds before completely disappearing. There was no sound, and it did not breach the horizon, it simply disappeared! I&#39;m freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/27/08 20:45|Loveland|CO|Light|13  minutes|eight bright red-orange lights in formation at night traveled from northwest to southeast over my house and disappeared instantly|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62712.html|35|ndxe200804| eight bright red-orange lights in formation at night traveled from northwest to southeast over my house and disappeared instantly<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:45 pm on Sunday, April 27, 2008, I went outside  through my open garage door. I had just returned from my job - I work in retail - I looked up at the sky because it was very clear and dark and I thought I would see some stars.  Straight ahead of me- due east, were two bright red-orange lights just hanging suspended in the sky above and in front of me.  I thought they might be a reflection on my eyeglasses, so I removed them.  I was totally shocked and surprised by what I was seeing.  I put my glasses back on - the lights remained the same.  I could not make out a distinct shape because it was dark and the light was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started to move very slowly and silently toward the southwest.  Two more sets of lights, identical in every way, joined the first set.  They took a position directly under the first set of lights.  Then a third set of lights did the exact same thing.  There were six sets of identical lights arranged in pairs- each under the other.  They all moved slowly and silently - there was no noise whatsoever - toward the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in the house to get a family member to see what I was seeing - we were both mesmerized by the lights and their intensity and their slow, silent movement through the sky.  I looked over to the North and saw one more light (I was up on a hill) which I thought, at first, was just something that was being launched, like a flare.  It was a single light that moved (glided) very quickly right next to the last set of lights. I kept trying to identify by some logic what the lights might be: hot air balloons, flares, etc, but nothing fit what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights continued to glide away toward the southeast and just immediately disappeared - they did not fade away - they just disappeared as if their lights went out.  The total duration was about 13 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second witness is an older person- quite skeptical, and could not believe what was being seen either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we first saw them they were at about 60 degrees elevation (about 11 o’clock looking east) and then when they were about at a 30 degree elevation (about 2 o’clock looking east) a seventh came from the Northwest traveling at a faster rate of speed (this is when we remembered the camera and took the pictures) it cought up with the others and joined the formation. And then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time we watched them was 10 to 15 minutes<n>

They were circular in shape, bright orange, and moving  from the west to south east in perfect unison.  They were seen in 2&#39;s appearing to be gliding in perfect unison and spaced perfectly apart from ea. other.  We saw two lights, then two more and then two more with a single light coming up at the tail.  There was absolutely no sound, or noise of any kind.  No trail of smoke or exhaust was seen. I have never seen anything like this before. We watched them for approximately 5 min. and then they were suddenly gone without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I received a phone call from a friend to look in the north sky. I went outside and at first couldn&#39;t see anything. I asked the friend more details where to look. There were some trees in my view that covered the portion of sky I needed to look in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down to a lower house on the property for a better view and contacted the occupant. After explaining what we were looking for, I notice the first of several lights. They were yellowish and slowly accending upward. There were many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I realized that these were not anything one would normally see in the sky. I ran back up to the broadcast booth and announced what I saw. I asked listeners to look, and we recieved many eyewitness phone reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flew in a &#39;question mark&#39; formation according to some callers. Another caller described a &#39;backwards letter C.&#39; From my perspective, these lights were spaced further apart. They slowly floated upward. A couple callers said they saw them float up toward space, but I stopped watching in order to announce this event quickly to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very bright, and callers closer to the area described them as being consolidated...that is, multiple lights made up each distinct object. I would say I was about 4 miles from the area the lights were flying over. Knowing the elevation of this property and the area in general, what I saw must have been flying at about 2000 ft in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the event that these were flairs, I called 911, who called the Coast Guard. I don&#39;t think at all these were flairs, but better safe than sorry. One caller suggested that they might be flairs. All the other callers after that said that they were sure they were not flairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking at the contrails from a fighter jet returning to Selfridge Air Force Base when my mother and I both noticed a bright silver ball moving erratically across the sky between the contrails. It was very distant, but we could tell that it was metallic by its sheen. My father had trouble spotting it, but eventually, we were able to pinpoint its location for him. My sister ran inside the house to grab my binoculars. It took me about 5 minutes to get a lock on the object because of its extremely fast movements. I was able to tell that the object was disc shaped and did not have any markings on it whatsoever. After about 10 more minutes of watching in awe, we were forced to look away to assist some customers. When we were ready to continue watching the spectacle, the object was no where to be seen. We scanned the skies for an hour or so afterward in hopes of seeing the object again. My father is a strong disbeliever in UFOs, but even he was baffled by what we saw. I am an avid researcher into the paranormal, but I was hesitant to make any quick conclusions about the object&#39;s nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed it out to my grandmother, who was in the passenger seat at the time and she also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get one picture of it with my digital camera before it moved, it kept changing positions around the sun, it was first on the left, then above it, then underneath it. I took some more various photos but they are a bit blurry but still easy to see. About two minutes after I started taking photos of the object I spotted two round objects very close together in the sky, that were different colors. I also have a picture of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also took one photo, and didn&#39;t see the object until I got home and enlarged the photo on my computer, it was a silver colored perfectly spherical object, in front of a cloud which was in front of the sun. I took about 10 photos total, and about 5 of them actually have the visible objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted only about 5 minutes total. It wasn&#39;t until I got home that I saw on the news that there was another sighting that evening in Texas, in Baytown. I thought that was eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures I have have not been altered, I have the exact originals on my computer and still on my camera as well, but I also have copies where I enlarged the objects and cropped them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/27/08 04:30|Queensland (Australia)||Disk|10 min|4 witnessed light in the sky come down to us and disappear on island in Great Barrier Reef|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69090.html|43|ndxe200804| 4 witnessed light in the sky come down to us and disappear on island in Great Barrier Reef<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to put into writing what happened to me and a group of friends on a night I can’t forget.  It was the last night of a vacation me and some friends from my university took to an island just south of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.  Most of the group was tired from a full day of sight seeing and swimming, but four of us stayed up to watch the sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on a large sand island called Fraser island just of the eastern coast of Queensland.  It was about a half hour before the sun would rise over the water on the horizon, so we decided to wait under the stars.  There was about a half moon so the lighting was dim, not pitch dark.  It was however fairly cloudy, and when the clouds opened up we could see the countless amount of stars behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were laying back in the sand when my friend Adam pointed out an unusually bright star out over the horizon.  We were all running through ideas of what it could be.  We thought it may have been a star glowing through an opening in the clouds, but after looking at it it was clear this light was below the clouds.  It was unusually close to the horizon and we though it may have been a light house, but we were certain there was no land off the island.  We figured that it had to be a plane or a helicopter, but for a couple minutes the light didn’t move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, the light was gone.  We shrugged it off as strange but a couple minutes later we noticed it was back.  This time it seemed to be a little higher than it was before.  I was pointing out how weird this all was to everyone drawing our attention to it.  Then, all of sudden the light moved in a right-up-right motion, similar to Pac-Man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I started yelling and screaming that this couldn’t be a helicopter, there’s no way this thing is a plane.  I continued to yell “What the Hell is that!? And pointed at it when we all witnessed the light make two motions at an angle down to just above the surface of the water where the ocean met the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched this white circular orb, it seemed to change shape, kind of elongating in a way and changing to a greenish color and then back to white.  We were watching it in shock when it, as I can best describe, projected itself at us.  It was similar to when a light is coming at you from inside a night club or from a distant laser pen.  We could see the light now coming towards us.  This thing was clearly coming straight towards us at an incredible rate.  I had my eyes fixed on it except when it looked like something whizzed past us left to right on the beach.  It then felt like the light that was being projected toward me was going up and down over my eyes as I was staring at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds, this orb, which was now a dim gray came in quickly, floating just above the water.  It followed the contour of the terrain stay just feet over the water, then the sand, slowing as it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw it coming in, I was petrified in fear.  I was yelling and pointing “ITS COMING RIGHT UP HERE!”  As it came in the four us all backpedaled, completely shocked.  This thing made absolutely no sound, but we were all very aware of its presence.  The air seemed to be electrified, as if there was some kind of electrical charge in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about ten feet high, and about 4 feet in diameter.  It looked similar to a disk only flipped up like a tire or a snail shell.  I could clearly see its outline as it approached, but very strangely, I was able to see through it.  The best way I could describe it was as if it were cloaked, similarly to the Predator in the film with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of us backed up terrified, stunned, too scared to run.  As we moved back, the object gradually decelerated to a stop right above the sand where we had just been sitting.  I remember asking my friends in a yelling whisper ”What the FUCK is that??”  I reached for my camera and tried to take a photo of it.  We sat there silently for maybe not even ten seconds, when I could no longer make out its outline.  Then, suddenly a very bright pulse of light above us lit up the beach.  I say pulse because it was very quick, unlike a lighting bolt or camera flash, rather it was a quick ‘bing’ of light that could’ve been missed if you blinked.  The moment after the flash of light, the energy in the air dropped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DISCLAIMER  **At this point, everything became VERY strange.  I will tell the rest of what happened that night exactly the way it happened from my perspective.  Two of my friends remain skeptical.  To this day I can’t forget what happened.**  As soon as the object was gone, we started asking each other what it was and where the light came from.  Before we could even start to come up with answers for each other, we noticed a group of people suddenly standing down the beach from us maybe 100 yards away.  We started asking each other how they could have got there.  They certainly didn’t walk past us from the left, the only trail down to the beach was behind us, and to the right down the beach the next campground was 9km away.  Either they walked through thorny bushes down from where the resort was or they were there the whole time unnoticed, two very unlikely scenarios.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just had the most unexplainable event of my life just take place, so I told my buddies that we can’t rule out the possibility that those are aliens…  One of my friends was so scared all he could say was shut up, don’t say that shit.  As we’re trying to figure out how the hell these people got down there, my friend Matt started walking towards them.  I was hesitant to go with but when he got about half way I decided I had to check this out for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer, I could see that there were 8 people facing the horizon.  They were all standing in two lines, shoulder to shoulder, in groups of two .  We stopped about a rocks throw away and yelled HEY!  As we did this, the two standing in the front and one directly behind him simultaneously did a 90 degree about face, much like a soldier or robot.  One of them was very tall, and was wearing a black suit, the person in front of him was shorter and very fat in the hips, opposite of an hour glass, and another was very short, maybe two feet tall, about the size of a small child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE”. I yelled.  No response.  They just stared at us with dark faces.  At this point we were pretty terrified.  We had already seen lights in the sky and invisible orbs, now a strange group of silent people moving like robots was staring at us.  We could not see there faces.  They seemed to be looking down slightly and had shadows over their faces.  Keep in mind this is in April in tropical Queensland.  We were all in shorts and T’s laying in the sand looking at stars.  These people were all fully clothed and standing, staring into a dark horizon with nothing to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled out again “WHERE ARE YOU FROM?”  As I did that another did a 90 degree about face and looked at us.  Me and Matt jumped and grabbed each other, not knowing who or what we were looking at.  This figure was holding a small blue light towards the ground.  I could best compare it to a digital camera LCD if a small camera display were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there silently when one of the four that had turned towards us suddenly did an about face back to facing the horizon.  We had had enough.  We started walking back towards our other two friends.  We got back to them and started trying to explain how the people were dressed and that they moved robotically, when we noticed one of them was coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially we were pretty alarmed but I remember thinking well there are four of us and one of him.  As he got closer we could see he was no longer coming straight at us but running a path that would cross about 30 feet in front, perpendicular to us.  He was running in very short strides, chopping his feet behind his body very quickly, leaning forward.  As he got exactly perpendicular to us, he slowly moved an open hand left-to-right  in front of his head at about a quarter of the speed he was chopping his feet, as if to waive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all shocked.  He seemed to have big gloves on his hands and was wearing a scarf.  My friend Matt began chasing after him.  As soon as he got close to him, he did an abrupt 180 and began chopping his feet back to where he came from.  Nobody new what just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two friends that had stayed behind said that was it, that was just too weird.  They left the beach and went back to our hostel.  Me and Matt sat down in the sand trying to figure out what happened.  We waited for the light of the sun to come over the horizon, and when it was bright enough to look around, the people were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I can’t explain what I saw.  Whatever came down to us from over the ocean was nothing spiritual, it was not a hallucination, all four of us saw it.  What I will say with one hundred percent confidence is that what I witnessed was some kind of advanced technology.  As far as the figures that showed up, I really don’t know.  But if anyone who reads this testimony has had anything similar happen, or can provide any answers I am open to speaking with you…<n>

We were in the back yard of my home in Woodland, CA stargazing when I noticed one of the “stars” near the big dipper started to move.  At first I believed it to be a satellite and pointed it out to my brother.  Soon all of us noticed the light and its strange movement.  The single light was soon joined by 4 or five more “stars” to create a Flying V formation.  The Flying V moved slowly to the Northeast, I believe, until it was out of sight.  The most peculiar thing the lights did were, as they were flying away, the lights at the back of the formation quickly switched places and moved about at impossibly fast speeds.  It was almost like watching giant fireflies move around in outer space.  I say &#34;giant&#34; because they seemed to be among the stars, so I guess they were at least above our atmosphere.  If they were that far away these lights must have been fairly large, maybe the size of airplanes.  They made no noise whatsoever.  I know they were not airplanes, no airplanes could move like that.  It was like watching a flock of geese slowly fly across the night sky.  I do not believe anything I’ve ever seen could explain those lights.<n>

As I sat, I looked out toward the northeast(over the town of London) and saw a rectangular bright red light. It was probably somewhere around two miles in the distance, low in the horizon, but above the treetops. It was a very brilliant light and was not moving. I am not sure of it&#39;s size, but it was quite large. I kept looking, trying to figure out what it was. I looked from every angle I could from the porch. Suddenly, the oject moved at a VERY high rate of speed away from me. It moved so fast that it became a small dot, then disappeared in the distance. The rate of travel had to be EXTREME, because it was gone in less than two seconds. It&#39;s the strangest thing I have ever seen. I did not report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seen was almost orb-like in shape.  It was pulsating red and green and falling at a rapid pace before it disappeared close to the horizon. The sky was clear otherwise with only stars in view.  The object stood out considerably, and was much larger.  The pulsating color was completely different than any aircraft I&#39;ve seen in the area.  The other strange thing was the blurred almost tail-like effect that was caused while it fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only observer, that I know of, of the object.  I&#39;ve been a believer in paranormal and UFO phenomenon for quite sometime.  This even struck me by suprise, since I have never experience such an even before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something bright and green caught my attention and I looked up. It was completely black outside, but I could clearly see three separate green lights (one at the point and two forming the base of what I assumed was a triangle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These green lights moved quickly and away – high above our neighbours (airplane height) but at a distance. I know they weren’t a reflection because I could clearly see the silhouettes of the trees in our yard in front of the lights, as if they were behind them. The lights flew out of view in a matter of seconds, probably five or six.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They didn’t move erratically (they progressed smoothly like a plane) but they clearly weren’t because of the shape they made and their colours. I didn’t know what else to make of what I saw, so I immediately looked up some place to share my findings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness was flawed.  We have amended it above.  PD))<n>

Upon standing up, we were getting into a theological conversation regarding Native Americans when she pointed behind me and asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;  Upon turning around I had roughly thirty seconds to view and compile what I could possibly be seeing.  It was in the formation of a triangle, moving very slowly across the night sky, too slow to be a jet, and it appeared to be soaring at roughly 1000 feet above the ground.  The formation consisted of three straight faintly illuminated lines, almost appearing like straight fluorescent shop bulbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to rationalize the sight into some sort of concrete explanation before it disappeared as slowly traveled too far to be seen (the lights appeared to be about half as bright as the stars seen around it, but it was quite obvious that it was close to the ground).  I first thought it may be three geese gliding in formation, with nearby light reflecting off of their bellies, but this was quickly disproved, as the lights were perfectly straight and geometrically in tact as it appeared to turn slightly before leaving our vision.  My next thought was a stealth aircraft (as there are military bases within distance on either side of us), but after viewing pictures of said aircraft, the straight lines of light prevent this from being the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that my wife was actually afraid of pointing it out to me, as I am notoriously skeptical... But this site was something I honestly cannot explain, and I feel it should be documented.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Paradoxically, there was a Bartlett police car traveling the same direction on the back road behind my property. In a short matter of 5 seconds the green streak started as a single orb-like light source, and then changed to three green orb-like lights stacked in a vertical line before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound other than the road noise from the moving police car and no smoke trail one would expect from fireworks. The closeness with absence of airplane engine noise eliminated the source of a low flying airplane. This is my first possible sighting and I do not know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was not a shooting star nor was it an aircraft from the United States Military.   I am not one to believe in UFO&#39;s BUT.....I do now.  I know what I saw.  These two objects were right side by side of each other.  they did not just fly off and it was nothing you could track.  They just vanished ....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I and my family was witness to the major sighting on 26th April and took it upon myself to visit and interview all the others following response to a newspaper report of my own sighting. I have absolutely no reason to doubt these people&#39;s veracity or integrity and, similarly, no doubt that there was something unusual going on in the area over this weekend, backed up by similar sightings, at simil times, in England and, indeed, all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set ot the sightings in what appears to have been time sequence:  26th April 2008 5.30am  The first came from an amateur photographer with some knowledge. He is closely involved with a local community issue of some sensitivity and consequently has been unwilling to publicly release his name, although I have met and spoken with him and have no reason to doubt his veracity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He lives just outside Torquay, a coastal town in the south west of England. On the morning of 26th April, he was going fishing on a friend’s boat from Brixham just up the coast from Torquay and was travelling on the ring road en-route when he stopped to take a photograph of the sunrise at a popular beauty spot with extensive views of Tor Bay. This was at 5.30am and was taken in the direction of Torquay. Having taken the photograph, followed by another about a minute later on a different exposure, he continued on his way and went on his fishing trip, taking other photographs throughout the day. One of those photographs was of terns perched on the rail of the boat, an unusual shot, of which his friend wanted a copy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, on his return, he downloaded the photographs onto the computer and was surprised to see, on the first sunrise shot, a bright speck of light above the tree line. The conditions – apart from the sunlight on the horizon – were heavily overcast with low cloud, a situation which had prompted him to take the striking photograph in the first place. This bright light could not therefore have been mistaken for Venus (which was not visible at that time anyway) or anything other than something below the cloud line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enlarged, the object appeared to have a discernible shape, almost like a squashed bell or squashed, truncated triangle, with what appeared to be a dark cross-shaped object at the leading edge. There also appeared to be a cone-shaped ‘tail’ as though the camera had captured it in flight. The second sunrise photograph taken moments afterwards and at a different exposure shows no sign of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an experienced photographer he discounts any sort of lens flare and the secretary of the Cornwall UFO organisation whom the newspaper consulted describes the photograph as apparently showing something of interest. Visiting the site later I was able to extrapolate from the image and the tree line that the approximate direction of the object seen would be in the St Marychurch area, where – coincidentally or not -  the major sightings took place later that day.  It would have been quite high in the sky to have been seen above the tree line and quite probably inland to have revealed the detail that the later enlargement showed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is anecdotal evidence, from a conversation he had with a friend some days later, that later that day a bright object was seen in the sky in broad daylight en route to Newton Abbot(some seven miles distan from Torquay and inland) which then ‘disappeared’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE MAJOR SIGHTINGS 26th April 2008 9.20am – 9.30pm  My own sighting, which drew all the other reported incidents, took place in the evening of 26th April. No specific time was recorded when the sighting started but, extrapolating back from the second incident when we were back in the lounge at 9.30pm after the UFO had passed I estimate the first incident to have been at, or around, 9.20am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our lounge window overlooks the approximate direction of the flight paths to Exeter Airport some 22 miles away. Consequently we are well used to seeing aeroplanes, at varying heights, throughout the day. Light aircraft following those routes are extremely rare and are always at a height where their engine noise can be clearly heard. Even high flying jet engines can be heard when outside. The police and coastguard helicopters frequently overfly and, again, we are well used to seeing these, sometimes with spotlights operational and always with engine noise apparent except when seen from a fair distance away when the spotlight, though bright, appears minuscule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear and dusk was rapidly turning into full dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw a  bright light approaching from the Paignton/Brixham direction over the roofs of houses intervening. It appeared as though it was a landing light of an aircraft, flying low, although aircraft showing landing lights this far out from the airport (22 miles away) are very rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached at a steady pace, at about the speed and height of a fairly low flying light aeroplane. Extrapolations later carried out of the estimated flightpath showed it to be almost precisely on a South to North alignment. Perceived size was probably that of a ten pence piece held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colour of the light was exactly as one might perceive an aeroplane’s landing light, i.e. whitish  (although I did perceive scintillations of red as it passed). The light was diffuse, with no immediately discernible outline, although I would describe it as elliptical in footprint. Whether it was refraction through my spectacles I don’t know, but I believed I could discern north/south/east/west spikes of light within the overall light in the manner of an illustrative representation of a star pattern. This lent it an almost diamond-shaped perception – although I do put this down to refraction and optical illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no engine noise and no navigation lights apparent. The object passed silently over the house, where we were observing it from the front door, and we followed it again from the rear of the house where it continued silently on its way, at its former speed, beyond a belt of trees at the top of the garden. The apparent trajectory over the trees and the angle at which it appeared to travel towards the horizon again suggested to me that it was a fairly low flying object. Anything higher flying would have remained in vision longer over the top of the trees which are set well above the tiered garden at the back of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting, in the latter stages, was also observed by my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been mystified by this sighting we returned back to the lounge, my son to his room. Some moments later my wife announced another, similar, light approaching. It was much the same colour as the other light, although I did perceive it as redder in hue. It took almost the same path (although later observed to be slightly to the west), and appeared to be travelling at the same height and speed. Again this disappeared behind the belt of trees at much the same angle of descent, although slightly to the west of the path that the first object had taken. Again there was no engine noise and no navigation lights apparent. This time the sighting was also observed almost throughout by my son and his girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no explanation for these sightings and later enquiry of Exeter Airport revealed that there were no landings scheduled for that time of night on that date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so taken with observing the objects that we totally overlooked the possibility of taking photographs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a corollary, some half-an-hour later a light aircraft did fly by, very low, with engine noise, navigation lights and even the fuselage visible in the reflected glow from the cockpit lights, making the comparison with the unexplained sightings that much more striking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 26th April 2008 9.30 – 9.40pm  The second family who saw something almost identical to my own sighting live, live in Thurlow Road in Torquay, which is just about three streets removed from my own house and  perhaps some quarter of a mile away, just over the brow of a hill on the opposite side of the valley which is Chatto Road. Their experiences appear to corroborate my own, although the timing is slightly different. The rear of their house faces the front of mine, were they within sight of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Webley was on the patio at the rear of his home burning some rubbish at around  9.30pm when he perceived a bright light approaching from what was later estimated to be the north. It approached his property at a steady pace and appeared to be at what the family agreed was about 500-600 feet. They describe it as orange to red in appearance and about the size of the head of a yale key held at arm’s distance at its closest approach (it appeared to shrink in size as it receded). It appeared to stop and hover at a point estimated to be about 220 yards away judging from the recognised configuration of the roof line in this built-up area, then moved slightly to the east and moved back towards the north, finally disappearing in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed in the latter stages by the whole family. Some estimated three minutes later a second – and brighter – object appeared from the north again, paused in the same spot and then gradually dimmed and faded away without moving off. On this occasion one of the witnesses managed to capture a video on her mobile phone. She says that, at its closest approach, she could discern green and pink colouration within the overall brightness and later study of an enlarged download on the computer clearly shows a green ring in the centre of the object. At its brightest the children describe it as though something was on fire in the sky. Friends of the family were later known to have witnessed this phenomonen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time recording on the phone video the family was able to precisely extrapolate the sequence of events. The video ended at 9.40pm; the second sighting lasted approximately 3 minutes (only part of which was recorded) (i.e 9.37pm); there was an interval of three minutes between the first and second sighing (i.e. 9.34pm); the first sighting was estimated to have been about three minutes (9.31pm).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly these phenomena occurred immediately following the phenomena I and my family had experienced (I noted the time my second sighting finished as 9.30pm). Interesting also is the fact that the sightings these second witnesses experienced were moving in a north to south direction whilst mine were in a south to north direction (and almost exactly on the same line when plotted on a map and then compared – plotting is relatively easy to calculate since the tree line over which my sightings disappeared is clearly visible from the second family&#39;s property).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is intriguing is that they should have been able to see the earlier phenomenon that I had witnessed, since the rear of their house faces in precisely the direction where it would have been visible, but they did not. I also should have been able to witness their phenomenon (at least partially) since the suspected line of flight would have been slightly to the east of what I had witnessed, which would have brought at least part of the trajectory into view from my lounge window. Similarly I did not witness their sightings, nor did my wife who habitually sits nearer to the window than I do, nor did my son and his girl friend who had taken off  by car in pursuit of the second object that we had sighted, travelling in the direction from which the second family observed their sightings to have approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have all spoken of two objects: however, the possibility arises that they could be the same object seen at different time intervals and possibly engaged in a ‘quartering’ activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 26th April 2008 (approx 9pm and 10pm) 28th April 2008 (3.50am)  This third set of witnesses report different activities. Their reported sighting took place at 3.50am on the morning of Monday 28th April. They live in Great Headland Road in Preston, immediately overlooking Tor Bay, with Brixham to their right (west) and Torquay/Exeter to their left (east). Their lounge and bedroom windows look over the bay. The witnes could not sleep that night and got up. As she often does, she looked out of the bedroom window at the night sky and she saw a white object describing wide circles at a high speed, fairly high in the sky above the flat (only half the trajectory was visible from her position. She called her husband and by the time he saw it, the whole of the trajectory was visible, this time over the sea, suggesting that it was spiralling outwards from the position when first noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night but with high cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witneeses desribe the object as white with an apparent cone shaped tail as it traversed the sky on its trajectory. As they watched it ‘shot off’ – in their words – in the direction of Dartmouth (ie overland between Paignton and Brixham). At this point the witness&#39;s husband describes the object as appearing like a truncated triangle and used the palm of his hand and fingers to illustrate the point. They are unable to estimate a height for the object but, from descriptions given to me on site, it appears that it was possibly flying at the extreme height of a light aeroplane. They are adamant that it was not an aeroplane (no navigation lights and no engine noise) and was moving much too fast for any object they have seen from their extensive panoramic windows overlooking the bay. He describes the path that the object circumscribed as being ‘like you might imagine a football stadium would look when viewed from a height.’  My interest, and my own experiences, elicited reference to further sightings that they had been reticent to report to the newspaper when they reported their sighting of the Monday morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These took place on 26th April, bracketing my own and the second family&#39;s sightings, when at approximately 9pm one of witnesses perceived a diffuse red object appear in the sky over the sea and ‘shoot off’ again in the direction of Dartmouth. More interestingly, at around 10pm her husband reports seeing a red light hovering over the sea at height (in much the same direction as his wife&#39;s sighting that evenng and referenced by a church tower), and shining a spotlight onto the water. At the time he put it down to either a police helicopter or coastguard helicopter (although no engine noise was apparent, and they would normally hear that even through the double glazing). The light then extinguished and the object flew off ‘towards the east’. he is used to observing – he keeps a telescope in his lounge and his son runs a boat so he will have  some knowledge of navigation and bearings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later enquires of both the police and the coastguard reveal that there were no operational helicopter flights at that time and on that date and additionally the coastguard elicited the view that no helicopter would use a searchlight at the height described, since it would diffuse the usable light too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Timeline of events  Saturday 26th April 5.30am	Unknown object photographed in the direction of Torquay, and more particularly the St Marychurch area where the major sightings took place that evening. There is anecdotal evidence of a similar bright object being seen in broad daylight towards Newton Abbot; 9.00pm 	 (approximate time) Diffuse red light observed over the sea at Preston ‘shooting off’ to the west; 9.20pm	Bright, reddish light observed travelling a south to north flight path over Dower Road, Torquay; 9.25pm   Similar object observed following an almost identical path over Dower Road, Torquay; 9.30pm   Time noted for the end of the second sighting; 9.31pm	Bright red light observed by the second family following a north to south flightpath towards Thurlow Road, Torquay, hovering moving slightly away to the east and moving away, growing smaller; 9.37pm   Second, brighter, red light observed by the second family following the same approach, again hovering and then extinguishing (this time recorded on mobile phone); 9.40pm	Time recorded on mobile phone as when the second sighting ended; 10am	(approximate time) Bright red light observed hovering at height over the sea at Preston and shining a spotlight on the sea which was then extinguished before the object moved off to the east;  Monday 28th April 3.40am   White, truncated triangle-shaped object observed at some height describing spiralling circles above the witness&#39;s property and then out to sea before shooting off toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checks carried out Exeter airport confirm that there were no landings of aircraft scheduled at or around 9.30pm on 26th April; Devon and Cornwall Constabulary confirm that there were no police helicopters operational over Preston/Paignton during the evening of 26th April; Maritime Coastguard Agency similar confirm that there were no coastguard helicopters operational over Preston/Paignton during the evening of 26th April.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just before the sighting, a small plane flew over.  Facing north we observed two very bright, almost neon green lights.  The lights seemed to be on one object the way they moved parallel to each other, similar to the lights on the wings of a plane.  After two or three seconds, the lights moved closer together as if the object was rotating.  It seemed the lights were only visible from one side. We did not see it suddenly take off.  It simply vanished after rotating. Comparing to the size of the plane we observed earlier, this object was much bigger.  We estimated it to be approximately one to two miles away, and fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approaching from the east traveling at a high rate of speed and was even leaving a bright trail as it went by. There was a low cloud cover that night and it was just below the clouds. I told my girlfriend to look and she saw it as well. When it got about even with my car it took an immediate 90deg turn to the north when and up into the clouds. At that point you could clearly see that is was not one but two(2) lights as they both dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I called the local newspaper and police dept. to see if anybody had reported seeing it as well but nobody had.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the western sky I noticed a long blue/green flash of light. The front part of the light was in a circular red, orange and yellow shape. My first thought was that it was a meteor but this object was in a horizontal position above the tree line.  The object was slowly moving for about 4-5 seconds and then all of a sudden it vanished. The sky was black and this was the only object I saw in the sky. The object appeared to be very long and skinny. The blue/green color appeared to be the tail end of the red, orange and yellow core.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m guessing it was shortly after sunset, which I think was 2000 hours on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a large object fly over roughly east to west.

I looked around the sky and spotted an oval shaped blakc aircraft with red lights spinning around the edge of it. It was getting closer to the ground, maybe two miles away from me. Some kind of dark blue beam light came from the bottom of the aircraft and hit the ground for about 5 seconds. The beam went away, the ship accended into the air, and then it took off, very slowly for an aircraft. It was a very visible sighting, unforunatly, I did not have any camera or phone with me, so I could not get actual proof.<n>

I did a double take because I could not believe my eyes,  I thought at first a plane or helicopter but it was just a red light, no blinkers or different colors, just a steady glowing, red orb.  A commercial jet actually passed in front of it (from my view) and was banking left to head Westerly, this is when I knew it was NOT a plane or helicopter!  I knocked on the French door for my wife and frantically waved at her to come outside.  She came out and witnessed it for a minute and then went back in,   So, I ran and got my binocs and went to the front yard where I got an unobstructed view. By this time it was higher and I’m going to guess about 3-4 thousand feet?  Maybe less, I see plenty of Cessna’s flying at about the same altitude.  It then stopped and stayed in the relative same place for several minutes, it would sort of pulse I guess I would say or become less intense of a red every couple seconds.  It finally dimmed and then was gone.  I estimate that where it hovered for the longest would’ve been maybe a couple miles or so north of me, putting it directly over the West Seattle Freeway or the Seattle Port maybe?  It was very strange indeed specially due to the fact that I sent in a report last night for a triangle craft or 3 lights in formation that sped across the sky!  Strange times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’m on my deck at 12 20 am having a smoke and sitting in a lounge chair looking at the stars as I like to do when skies are clear.  Suddenly I see 3 lights in a perfect triangle speed across the sky in a North Westerly direction.  My deck faces West with a clear view of West Seattle and the Olympics. I don’t know if it was 3 separate lights (crafts) flying in formation,….or a triangular craft with a light on each tip?  Impossible to tell really, I couldn’t see the actual shape of the craft, just 3 lights moving at a VERY high rate of speed, like 4-5  times faster than a jet.  It faded and disappeared towards the N-West sky. No sound whatsoever.  So interesting that just earlier this evening I thought “how strange that I have never seen anything”  “for sure” in 10 years at this location..…a couple hours later, I’m stunned and freaked by this sighting. Most definitely not any conventional aircraft!<n>

The lights were NOT visible without the Night Vision.  The lights traveled faster than anything I’ve ever seen, moving within my line of vision from the South towards the North/North-East in about 5 seconds! 	Less than five minutes later, I saw four more lights of the same description moving in Delta formation from the South towards the North.  These lights were also traveling incredibly fast and were not visible to the naked eye.  No sound was audible while these lights were traveling overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While out, I saw planes, birds and many satellites, some that could be seen with the naked eye as well as some that could not.  All of a sudden while facing south, positioned around 10:30-11:00 in the sky, and to my left, I witnessed two objects traveling north.  The field of view for this device is 40 degrees and the device has no magnification.  The objects appeared to be about the same brightness as a satellite when seen through the device, yet could not be viewed at all without it.  The objects were approximately 1/8 inch apart when viewed through the lens.  They were traveling in a Delta, lead/wingman profile, and moved both fast and in a deliberate manner.  At about 12 O-clock in the sky, the object in the rear and right of the front object took an abrupt turn, heading 90 degrees to the right, disappearing over the building to my left.  This entire event took place in about 5-7 seconds.  Later, timing of satellites traveling in approximately the same direction took a voice count of about 60-80 one thousands to travel the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting, I went inside to tell my girlfriend about it.  She thought I was kidding her.  I went back outside and within 15 minutes I saw what appeared to be the same objects traveling south, in the same fast, deliberate manner, again, oriented in the same manner to one another and again bright as a satellite through the lens, but not visible to the naked eye.  I went inside again and this time was able to convince my girlfriend to come have a look.  I believe we were outside less than 15 minutes when she saw the same objects and within a matter of what felt like minutes saw them again.  After she went inside, I witnessed them one more time, again traveling north to south, same configuration, same speed.  I am not sure whether said objects were emitting light or reflecting light; my feeling is that they were reflecting light.  I would approximate the whole chain of events to have happened in at the utmost 1 to 1 1/2 hours time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He noticed that there were no blinking lights on this object like a regular aircraft. The night is crystal clear and other planes lights were as clear as day. After watching it for about 1 minute it slowly faded away to nothing. Like I said before there were no clouds in the sky, and there were other aircraft in the sky in and around the same area, and were completely visible. Not quite sure what it was but I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was still daylight and no other objects were around it.  As object drew closer no sound was heard.  We both witnessed it.  It appeared to be near the height commercial aircraft fly, yet made no sound and had no visible markings or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flew in a direct path most airplanes take when coming and going to the airport.  It passed over a building and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t float up like a balloon, it moved across the sky in a horizontal fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over it turned on its side and had an appearance similar to a stealth bomber while making a sharp turn.  However it was slow moving and had no lights or sounds associated w/ it.  It also was more akin to a boomerang and more rounded than traditional stealth aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought it was a helicopter, as it came and passed it’s appearance was clearer.  The black slow moving triangular and rectangular w/ no lights/sounds reported by others was the closest thing to a matching description I could find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near the commercial/passenger airport.  This craft was different than the ones that fly overhead almost constantly.  Not sure if it’s terrestrial or not though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It faded in and out of brightness a few times.  It was not a blink, or a timed fading.  More like it flickered in stages from light to dark.  It did not change position until the last flash of light that was shorter than the others.  There was no sound.  There was light cloud cover, and this object was below that, so i would have heard if it was a helicopter because it appeared about half a mile above me.  As soon as it vanished there were three planes in row heading west, and a helicopter moving back and forth north to south.  All of which I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both noticed in the distance a small black oval moving erratically over the highway. We had the same reaction &#39;What is that?&#39;. It seemed to sway back and forth across the interstate.  As we continued travelling, it was briefly blocked by overhead road signs.  When it came back into view, it was slightly larger and still black in color.  Within about 30 seconds, it seemed to make a quick 90 degree turn towards the North and appeared much larger in shape... it was very bright as if was metallic and the sun was reflecting from it.  As soon as it made it&#39;s turn, it very rapidly &#39;swooshed&#39; downwards and flew off towards the North at a very fast pace.  It moved so quickly, we lost sight of it as it flew behind the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lightning was striking fast and the entire sky was lighting up.  My husband then asks me what is floating in the sky.  I look up to where was pointing and I see it.  It was a grey craft that looked somewhat like a jellyfish with no lights emitting from it. It moved in what I can only describe as an organic manner.  We watched for a few minutes as it moved from one place to another.  Some times we lost track of where it was but would see it again only a moment later, as it stayed in the same general area.  Then it ended up flying closer to us and when the sky lit up again the grey craft tuned in to what looked like a geometric 3-d rectangle.  The outer edges of the “rectangle” were lit up with all different colors.  After the lightning strike and the sky went dark the craft again looked like the grey jellyfish with no emitting light.  It then moved back to its previous general location but looked a little paler than it had at first.  Maybe it was further away and we could not see it as well.  After about 30 minutes we were no longer able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It kind of looked like the fiery exhaust from a missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the North East portion of the sky. I could see some stars behind it, but don’t know what constellation was in view at that time of the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the orange streak was about 6” in length (using my thumb and forefinger at arms length) about 55 degrees above the horizon. It was a steady orange glow that kind of pulsated. It kind of looked like it had a head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over on the side of the highway to observe it twice on my way to New Orleans and tried to video it with a cheap video camea I carry with me. The video did not come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still visible in the pre-dawn sky when I got to Avondale Louisiana and was almost directly over head at that time. I was not able to continue observing it due to heavy traffic a little after 6 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kind of reminded me of a comet with a tail, but I never heard anything in the news about one or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we drove even closer we noticed the object starting to come towards us I told my brother to pullover which he did shortly thereafter the object went right over top of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silent for a minute, my brother and I in disbelief.  Finally, I said what was that, let&#39;s chase it Which we did we were young this was 25 years ago  This was happening in the countryside of the small-town we grew up in anyway we did a U-turn It was still in sight. We followed it  this was happening in the West End of town It took us to the south end of town still in the countryside using back roads we followed  This is when we saw the craft break into three pieces doing all kinds of different things At this point we&#39;re still in denial not sure what to make of this 4 more join the mix so now we have seven red dots doing all kinds of weird things in the end form two different triangles And then started moving towards the east which we followed and then lost At this point I&#39;m not sure what just happened i&#39;m thinking maybe we saw UFOs Now were on the east end of town in the countryside we decide to call it a night we drive through town we live on the west end of town right on the edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we get closer to home my mind is full thoughts I start thinking to myself if I saw what I think I saw they should be able to read my mind ? At this point I think I&#39;m going to write it off as military activity or something so in my and I asked them to prove themselves to be over my house when we arrive As we approach the house there was quite a big UFO there I told my brother to stop the car I got out to look at it it was right above me. It was very big all I could see was the bottom of it It look like a maze of tubing so I can&#39;t tell you what it look like but I can tell you imagine you&#39;ve never seen a car before and the first time you ever saw one you saw it from underneath the car that&#39;s what it look like Anyway within seconds it pitched off silent sounded like the wind maybe and was gone in like no time The weird thing is well one of them my brother and I both go in to the house without saying a word to each other he goes to his room I go to mine blown away by what we just saw I look out my bedroom window at the stars I see nothing but stars too restless to sleep I decide to walk a short distance to the 24 hours convenience store on the way back from the store I started thinking well they seem to read my mind once maybe they can do it again I know this parts crazy But I start thinking if you can read my thoughts I want to win the lottery this is no joke at this point I don&#39;t think I&#39;m even legal to win I was only 17 years old the next day my brother and I were still blown away we called some officials to see if there was military activity in the area but we got nowhere anyway within a year I won the lottery I bought the ticket from that store. March 25, 1989. I haven&#39;t spoke of this story too much with people I can hear myself saying it sounds very crazy I know  A couple of years later in the hot tub with my girlfriend at that time I saw WhiteLight dart into a cloud waited for a minute I don&#39;t know why but finally said to my girlfriend did you see that without hesitation she said yes I saw that too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything since I thought maybe it&#39;s time to share this story I don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t change anything  I guess the point of the story is if you ever see a UFO Make-A-Wish<n>

When I was walking across the yard I noticed what appeared to be two very bright lights in the sky, one higher than the other. They looked like close stars. I kept walking in the direction of the lights toward the field and stopped at the field to let the dogs do their business while I watched. I had assumed that they were helicopters looking for one of our neighbors who have had a shady past; however, I saw that there were no beams of light coming from the craft as a spotlight would. They were simply bright, a whitish yellow light like that of a typical household bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the craft appeared to be at about the same altitude, but about .5-1 mile away from each other, making the distant one appear lower in the sky. They were motionless in the air, simply hovering. While watching I noticed that each craft had two strobes that alternated. One red and one white. These lights blinked in unison to each other although on separate craft. The crafts then dimmed simultaneously, although the strobes continued to blink, still in harmony. The craft then traveled off in the same direction parallel to each other, still at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear any noise, and am very accustomed to seeing and hearing helicopters in the area. Although I cannot judge exactly how far the closest craft was, I would estimate approximately 1/4 mile. The crafts continued in their path until they were out of sight behind a forest that was closer to me and obstructing the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I could detect no sound and it was a clear quite night at about 55 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred between Lyons Mill Rd and Eldersburg MD just on the SW side of Liberty RD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything of this nature before, nor am I prone to believe in aliens or anything of the sort. I am looking for anyone who saw this same thing. I reported this to the local news (WBAL TV) with no response.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was quite unusual.(I live in a rural area and always see a few house lights, snow on the mountains, and occasional car headlights in the distance.) In the upper left corner of my window I saw a large luminescent lime green rectangular object with rounded corners. In the 2-3 seconds I saw it, it did not appear to be moving. There was no glow, trail, aura or beams from this object going to the ground or sky. All the luminescence and color were contained in the rectangle. Inside the rectangle there appeared to be other colors of perhaps yellow-green or silver-white that I can only say reminded me of plumbing pipe shapes. There appeared to be movement of the light within these shapes.  All of this happened within a few seconds and as I thought &#34;what in the world is this?&#34;, before the whole sentence was formed in my mind, the rectangle light flickered out, as if a switch had been turned off. It was still completely black outside my window. I went outside within five seconds. All looked &#34;normal&#34;. No airplanes, satellites, barking dogs - nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary had just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It looked as if it was spinning in place as it hovered there for about 5 minutes.  I looked outside my window to see if anyone was controlling a toy but no one was around.  Then it flew west toward the foothills at a very fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was long, very narrow, and silver, and standing up-right, and seemed to be somewhat pointed on each end, but it was hard to tell exactly because of the second or two that the sighting lasted. I thought it might have been a reflection, but I could also tell it was far away as I could compare it against other objects such as power lines, and telephone poles, and commercial buildings.  This has to be one of the oddest things I’ve seen, I don’t see too many of these reports shown on the web sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I saw in the top left corner of my windshield 3 fighter jets in formation (2 in the front 1 in back) and they were doing a u-turn and heading back over the thick cloud cover of the Antelope valley, and they were going really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked on F-14 Tomcats in the Navy and have lived in Lancaster, Ca.  since 1991 and consider myself very observant of the sky around me   (I guess that’s from working on a flight line and liking astronomy ) and I have seen many things in the sky like test flights of new designs, Space Shuttles, Stealth planes and even the giant triangle also on a rainy night.  But these 3 jets which were unmarked one dark gray, one med. gray and one white were in hot pursuit of another vehicle that looked almost as big as the two front fighters and it was vibrating really vibrating so much I could hardly make o! ut the grayish color of the craft and the x-wing kind of shape the vibration was making, It looked like a disk or a single edged  shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I’ve seen so many things in the sky here I never knew how to report it, I just thought everybody saw this stuff<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

4/24/08 14:30|Tucson|AZ|Light|1 Hour|Star in broad daylight|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63054.html|93|ndxe200804| Star in broad daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working on the Tohono O&#39;oddam Reservation, I observed a star like light in broad daylight directly overhead. My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west. This object drifted no more than 5 degrees NNE in an hour. Balloons pop or move rapidly to the east after reaching altitudes of 30,000ft and up. A near Earth asteriod is my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My signal corps background in the Army required me to maintain the highest level of secret clearances. I recruited for the Army in Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a stable person in society.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted three brillently lite lights, seperately but within seconds of each other, in the early morning hours of 24 April, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting out front having my morning coffee prior to leaving for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 0610, I caught a glimpse of a bright light up around the nearly full moon and the star to its western side. This light lasted only a matter of one or two seconds and was traveling at a super rate of speed from south to north direction. It&#39;s altitude seemed to be either out in space or very near the earths upper most atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light/flash was so intense that I had to contemplate what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definately not a commercial aircraft, it moved across the sky far to fast. I know what Navy and Air Force fighter aircraft look like in flight and these lights moved far faster than any aircraft in the fleet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise prior to or after the sightings. There were no contrails, and the moon lite sky was for the most part clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what meteorites and space junk look like when they enter our atmosphere and burn up on entry. These did not burn up, they simply appeared out of nowhere and just as quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were brighter than any star that is visiable with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not appear to be traveling a set path as would a satellite crossing over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the space station crossing over and getting the reflections from the sun rising. No way. It would be a single siting and be over with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed these three lights on three seperate occations, only seconds apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first as mentioned above. The second followed up in the same path as the first, south to north, same exact location between the moon and a star just west of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third appeared suddenly and traveled east of the moon on a westerly to easterly direction. It too, dissapeared quickly. You could count one thousand one, one thousand two and in this time period it covered a large area of space and sky prior to disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night is beautiful and the sky bright with stars.  To the west of our home I noted a distortion in the sky, silent in sound and the object appeared to be hovering.  The distortion was triangular in shape, and although hard to explain appeared to be pulsating.  I don&#39;t have the exact length of time I viewed the object, however, my estimate is slightly over 30 seconds.  The object began to pulse rapidly and was simply gone!  We&#39;ve lived in several states over the years, but only in Arizona have I seen strange and unidentifiable objects in the skies.  Perhaps this is military work in progress, perhaps it was from another world.  I called for the dogs and we hurried inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was playing World of Warcraft so i was up late, also being on leave from Iraq. I went outside for a smoke looking off at the woods having heard the dogs, wolves or whatever they were suddenly stop barking. The tree frogs that normally make a chirping sound had stopped as well. Going on a stright azumath of about 340 (north). The color is kind of hard to explain but it was white and green but sort of shifted as it passed like a car with the paint that looks 2 colors when passing by. It passed abut 30 meters west of me. There was no sound and no heat. I asm not good with elevation height but it would have to have been a good distance up but way lower than a plane would fly. The most accurate desription i can give on the height would be about the same height an OH-58 would fly on a recon if you have ever seen that. Though no sound or heat you could clearly feel something as it passed. It was not electrical or magnetic. It was not my nerves as i am traied to not becomefrightened at the sight of things, foreign or domestic. the tree line from my house is about 300 meters back, and to the front about 100 meters. given at its height i can most likely see it from 500-600 meters, and no extra distance going away given the close tree line. To travel this distnce it was about 3 seconds or less. No trail per say was left, but the air after felt different though i am unable to describe how,as i have never felt it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a trained soldier who works on networking for the military. I am around planes alot as i support them in their mission keeping their networks up. I am air assault qualified. I am aware of the military planes we are currently using that could fly with no sound. This was not one of them as at night they fly lights out and when lights on, red and green lights, and not that low, ever. I am at my parents house on leave from iraq so i am trained and adept at making note of all details possible and keeping them in memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> though when comming out they may jumble.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 3am, perhaps a bit earlier, when we saw the bright lights swooping low over the freeway and making radical turns, repeatedly flying over a nearby grove of fruit trees and then over the freeway again.  The shape looked triangular, but I could not tell for sure since all I could see were the three lights (could be three sets of two lights each).  I could not see any markings, or even the shape, but I got the impression that it seemed to be a &#34;flying wing&#34; like the B2 bomber, from the positioning of the lights (one forward, two a little further back and on the sides).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The seems just like the other reports for the object near Coalinga on this site.  There were no red and blue lights like standard aircraft have.  This was very low, and there were other cars on the roadway that spotted it.  I was somewhat dismissive of this as any sort of alien craft, seeing as we were just a mile or so short of the &#34;Harris Ranch Airfield&#34;, near Hwy 198.  I made many remarks about the craft, being careful not to mention &#34;UFO&#34;, but my elderly father, who I was with, did mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still am not convinced this is an alien craft, however it most certainly is and &#34;unidentified flying object&#34;, and it was being flown highly illegally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did make sure that the lights were in perfect formation, so I was completely convinced this was a single craft, and not a formation of several.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked over toward the SW because something caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright and quite a long distance away.  I could make out red, green and white lights with my bare eyes.  It was moving very fast from side to side.  I ran in the house to get out my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I could really see it.  I saw one row of horizontal very bright lights.  I went back into the house to tell tell my wife and got another set of glasses for her.  Now it had moved to mid height in the SW sky about mid height in the West.  I could not take my eyes off of it.  I was really excited and my wife was like no big deal but glad to have seen one.  You knew it was not a plane because a plane could not hover like that and make the very radical moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about a half hour.  Toward the end a second UFO joined the first one, but quite a distance from the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, this morning on Channel 7 news they mentioned that UFO&#39;s were spotted over Phoenix.

My friend turned to me and said &#34;that cloud looks like a teardrop.&#34; I said Whatever because it really did look like a teardrop, but we noticed that it kept getting closer, and then my other friend noticed small little lights on the sides of it. So suddenly it starts defusing from it&#39;s melecular cloud structure into a solid teardrop-shaped object with these blinking lights and shit started dissapearing, like leaves and even trees and rocks. So suddenly their&#39;s this giant flash, and then I just remember lying in my house naked with my two other friends. So we got up and I was all freaked out because I thought I had had a fucked up dream, and I was also naked now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So when i told my friends they had had the same dream, so We looked up UFO and Alien shit on the internet and found that you guys had a subcategory for teardrop shaped spacecrafts so I was wondering if their had been similar sightings before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

I then went to the kitchen and drank a glass of water, hoping to shake the feeling and go back to bed. For whatever reason I decided to step out of the side door on the southern side of my home and saw a large disk shaped object in the hovering over a cow pasture in the southeast direction from my position. I estimated it to be about fifty yards across, and hovering about 150 yards above the ground. It had several large lights in a ring formation around the bottom of the craft that were glowing with an intensity that I liken to a very high powered hps light bulb. The colors of the lights are what astounded me though, they were extremely rich and saturated looking and were displaying changing colors that I can&#39;t even begin to describe. The craft itself didn&#39;t really make any sounds, it just had a strange pulse that it seemed to give off. Almost as soon as it had started, the craft shot up at about a 45 degree angle and cut back to my left before disappearing into the darkness. I&#39;ve always been skeptical about the whole ufo thing, and honestly, had I been asked yesterday afternoon if I thought such a thing really existed I probably would have been unsure, leaning more towards no.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to look at it and noticed it was moving in a circular type motion, we then looked throughout the sky and noticed it wasn&#39;t the only one. We noticed there must have been between 20 and 30 of these moving stars. Some of them alone, some of them in 3&#39;s. When in 3&#39;s they formed a triangular trapazoid type shape. As I said some brighter than others but all making the same movements, as if they were hovering but sort of moving around and covering a very small area. Whatever this was, was there for over 2 hours. It was viewable from different areas in Montreal (Canada) as I called friends to go outside and look. It couldn&#39;t have been airplanes because there were no flashing lights whatsoever and it couldn&#39;t be a mass fleet of helicopters because there was no sound associated with what we saw. I&#39;ve never seen an object move in the ways I witnessed these &#34;lights&#34; move. I have never seen or thought I had seen a ufo before last night&#39;s experience, but I am sure that what I saw was incredibly abnormal and nothing I have ever imagined.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have lived in this same home for eighteen years with my wife. I&#39;ve seen strange lights before, that have turned out to be planes or helicopters and even a blimp one time, but this object was totally different from anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to my back yard about 12:30pm EST. The sky was perfectly clear and I was looking at the stars. I caught something out of the corner of my eye, looking up into the night sky I saw a triangular object in flight towards the north. The first thing I noticed is that it was completely silent and rather high in the sky. I am close to two airports, also two hospitals.  I&#39;ve watched many planes and helicopters over our area for the past 18 years but, this object seemed much higher in the sky than most planes that fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object fly approximately from the south to the north for a few seconds then come to a complete stop. The object sat in one spot allowing me to get a good look at it. It was white and triangular in shape with three red spots(not lights) on the belly of it. There did not appear to be any sign of a rear exhaust or any lights on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting in that spot for maybe five seconds the object shot off to the north at a speed I&#39;ve have never seen any aircraft move and totally disappeared as if it had flown out of the atmosphere and into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I noticed an extremely highflying object moving east off the ocean then quickly changing course proceeding southwest. The object had an enormously large red haze or halo around what looked like a star, traveled at fast speeds with no sound. Because the object was flying so high, this red halo/haze was the only way my eye could keep tracking its position and movements which I consequently lost sight of behind high clouds. A moment later I tracked another object starting at the same position as the first, again showing a red haze/halo around it and followed the same course.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/22/08 23:00|Fitzgerald|GA|Fireball|45 min - 1 hr|We both saw a very bright light that drew our attention from what we were doing.   The light startled us both.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62655.html|119|ndxe200804| We both saw a very bright light that drew our attention from what we were doing.   The light startled us both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 22, 2008 around 11Pm, my friend and I were outside enjoying the crispness of the night.  At the same time we both noticed a bright light in the sky to the south.  The light appeared out of nowhere and glowed brightly in the same exact spot for several seconds.  Then there was another light right beside the first that did the same thing.  It could have been as much as several miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at it as we both said , “Man what in the world is that?”  The light got brighter for a moment then disappeared in thin air.  We both walked towards the light for about a hundred yards when we noticed that there were several planes/jets in the night sky in the area.  As we watched the jets circled the area above and around where the light had came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For at least 20 minutes we watched as two then three jets seemed to be monitoring the area.  The jets were flying cross patterns and large circles in and around the same area.  Then out of nowhere there was 7 bright bursts of light in a trailing pattern.  The light was very bright at first and within a second or two would get brighter then go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes after this the jets left the area and the night became still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to seeing the first bright lights, we had seen a very low flying jet moving across the sky on two separate occasions.  This may have been some sort of military training, but at ages 36 and 38 we both have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The fireball thing had a tail and a reddish tint on the underside of it. It disappeared almost as fast as it had appeared, and I immediately called my mom and dad who were coming from Moran, Texas on a parallel highway. They weird thing is, is that they saw the exact same thing I did and they had no idea what it was either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first friend looked up and said to us,&#34;Check this stuff out, Dude&#34; We were all looking up, and notice an egg shaped craft with about 9 flashing light surrounding it, it amazed us, but by the time we got a camera from my buddie&#39;s truck, the craft sped away!<n>

I was with my friend and had a sudden impulse to go lay outside in the back yard with some binoculars to look at the stars. We took a blanket and were laying down for a few minutes when something at lightening speed zipped above us no more than 20 feet in a north to south direction. It seemed like a small object but it appeared and was gone within half a second, it almost seemed like a rocket. We were both saw and heard it and almost discounted it until we realized shared details of what we experienced. We heard a faint &#39;whizzing&#39; sound as it zipped overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second experience was much more profound and happened a few minutes later. As we discussed the first incident, we noticed about 7-9 lights coming from the south towards the north. There were unlike any lights I have ever seen, they weren&#39;t bright, somewhat hazy. At first I thought it was a flock of birds but then I realized there was no flapping, and that I wouldn&#39;t see birds so clearly at this hour and at that altitude. Suddenly the lights took a V SHAPE formation as it passed above us in total silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the most shocking part. It seemed like a giant triangle gliding silently at the edge of the clouds, it seemed quite large. I grabbed my binoculars and looked at it and saw that the lights had a strange geometric shape to them that were identical in each light. (I created an image file that I can email with this submission) I couldn&#39;t tell if it was one UFO with 9 lights or 9 lights in a V formation. All we could do was keep exclaiming &#39;oh my god what is that?&#39; over and over as we watched it disppear on the north horizon. There was a lot of haziness in the light around it as if it was passing through the clouds, my mind literally short circuits when I try to think about it because it does not fit into the framework of anything I understand. Neither of us could get any sleep that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked up, I saw no helicopter but  an extremely  large spherical object  surrounded by very dim lights right over the tree tops.  I stood looking up at the sky for about 10 minutes while the object just hovered in the same spot. Then when I was walking inside to get everyone outside, it just vanished, instantly. Living right by Quantico for a long time, I know that this was no normal aircraft, not with the size and shape of the one that was hovering that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

4/22/08 15:26|Plant City|FL|Unknown|approx. 2 min|The black object  flew at a  constant speed, high altitude, in an uncommon & constantly changing flight path then vanished instantly.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62940.html|125|ndxe200804| The black object  flew at a  constant speed, high altitude, in an uncommon &amp; constantly changing flight path then vanished instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I witnessed a flying object that I definitely could not identify, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I am a 24 year old man, healthy, with perfect eyesight, and no history of mental illness of any type. I am not prone to exaggerations or having an overactive imagination. I served in the U.S. Army a few years back, and I do not drink or do any type of drugs, nor do I take any kind of medication. What follows is a detailed description of the object I saw this afternoon while sitting by the pool with my fiance. She did not see the object because her view was obstructed by some small shade trees surrounding the pool, also her eyesight is not that great, and by the time I told her what I was seeing, the object was seconds away from disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be flying at an extremely high altitude, making it appear extremely small and making it very difficult to discern it&#39;s actual shape and size. From my position on the ground it was like watching a tiny sugar ant! It appeared to be dark in color, probably black. The object appeared to be opaque, and it did not seem to reflect the sunlight or emanate any light of its own either. It moved in and out of the few clouds that were in the sky mostly at a constant speed, although it did seem to speed up somewhat as it left from view. The really odd thing is that it did not disappear from sight into the clouds, but rather just seemed to become invisible into a clear blue sky. There was very little cloud cover at the time, but I did see what appeared to be a very faint trail of vapor or exhaust trailing behind it. It flew in a very odd flight path that I&#39;ve never seen with airplanes, helicopters or birds. First it seemed to make a circular pattern, then a figure eight, followed by a straight line from left to right, and then back from right to left, it again made one or two circles, one more figure eight, and another circle, before simply disappearing into a cloudless patch of blue sky. Another thing that struck me as odd, and this my fiance did witness first hand too, is that there were several large black birds that flew above us just a short while before the object first came into view. They were flying towards us, in the opposite direction of where I saw the object. At first several of them were flying pretty high up, but they were still very clearly recognizable as birds. This is why I know for certain that the object I saw afterwards could not have been a bird, for one thing it was flying at an altitude that was much higher than any of the birds, who at one point were flying about as high as any birds I&#39;ve ever seen before, although later they flew above us again but at a much lower altitude. Also the flight path &amp; speed of the object was so completely different from  birds or any known ai! rcraft, at least in my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each has at least two lights. They are arranged in a three parallel line formation with the middle line sticking slightly past the other two. First this object was blue over the tree line. After going onto my back deck and taking the first picture, which failed to show, it changed to yellow as if in recognition of my attempt. I took another picture, which came out well, just before it gained speed and flew relatively over my vicinity.

It began as the size of other stars, just brighter, but then it looked like a ring of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not spherical because the ring of lights would combine into one bright light, implying that it was disc-shaped.  A red light also flashed when the ring of lights became one extremely bright light.  The ring of lights and the bright light were the same color as the stars, and even brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered back and forth, growing as it approached us.  It zoomed out and in away from us, and when we walked close to the area under where it was hovering, it became larger and chased us, as the red light appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer, we could hear the buzzing noise.  It wasn’t a constant buzzing, but had crescendos and diminuendos.  It then hovered, tilting dropping one side then the other, until it landed about 200 yards from where we were standing.  I took a video of it on my cell phone, but when I went back to look at it, the video wasn’t there.  I also took a picture, which also was not on my cell phone when I went back to check.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it landed in the park behind Dockweiler beach down a street called Argonaut.  There is a lake in the park and it is a possibility that it landed in the lake, but it did land for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO before, and never believed in the sightings, but this was for real.  Within an hour of the sighting, I also saw 4 shooting stars.  I have never seen shooting stars before this night as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking along the horizon to the west and up into the sky at the stars and noticed an object that I had never seen there before. It was just over the tree line. I knew at once that it was either a plane or something else since it was too bright to be a star or a planet. It was spherical, bright, and appeared to have a halo or an aura around it. I kept watching it to see if it would turn towards the airport to land, but it didn&#39;t. For a good three minutes it remained stationary in the sky. Then all of a sudden it dropped in altitude and picked back up to the exact place where it was when I first saw it. It then zipped toward the north and disappeared. In the place where it disappeared, there seemed to have been a hole ripped in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew at this time that it must have been something not of this world, so I went inside to get my blanket and wrap up on the balcony. About five minutes passed with me sitting on the balcony watching the sky for another or the same object. Suddenly one appeared on the same place the fist one had. It had the same characteristics as the first. This craft zipped to the north and the south with ease and agility. Then it returned to the same place where it first appeared, and the light that it was emitting slowly faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a few UFOs before, but never anything of this magnitude. My father had once described the same phenomenon to me, except the craft was much closer to him. There was the same agility and the same aura to the object. He also reported that the craft shot up into the air and that there was a hole in the clouds from where it passed through.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/21/08 23:30|Durham|NC|Triangle|3 to 4 min.|large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappeared|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63596.html|133|ndxe200804| large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place on April 21, 2008. My buddy was taking me home that night it was about 11:30 pm driving down highway 70 between Raleigh and Durham. And coming around the bend there is a straight shot of about 2 miles of road to the intersection of page rd. and highway 70, so as soon as we go around this bend I see two really bright lights all the way down at the intersection that were noticeably brighter than any of the other lights around the area. And immediately my friend says “that’s a plane man” and I automatically agreed with him thinking it has to be… no way you know? As we got about half way down the road we noticed it hasn’t moved at all, so the next thing my friend says is that it has to be power line stand with lights or something and my reaction was were about to find out we are coming up on it now, we pass the power lines on the road which has no lights at all on it and then we pass about 300 feet of tall trees blocking the view and as we pulled up next to this craft immediately three other lights were now visible one of which was a blinking red light. It was a big black triangular object hovering completely stationary at least as long as 2 city buses together. It was only about 50 to 100 ft. over the trees, no sound completely silent no shine what so ever. I could see the angles of the craft through the light and could tell it was a three dimensional triangle about as tall as one story of a house. As soon as we stopped the car after taking a right on page rd. the craft started to move slowly away as if it had seen that we figured out what it was or as if there was some sort of intelligence looking back at us just steady slow cruising seemed to gain altitude and in a matter of seconds was totally gone, the lights we had seen two miles away had disappeared in a few seconds. See the thing is I got such a good look at this thing it is unbelievable, much less did I even believe in the phenomena but to be in the right place right time to even come in visual contact with one! blows m y mind. It looked like to me it was just sitting there watching the airport that has planes flying in and out all day but as it moved away I could tell that the blinking red light was on the back left corner cause of the direction of the leading point. I want to add that I have never been more scared in my life really my eyes were watering from shock I guess and I had goose bumps all over the place all night because of it. And other than that this is as far as I can go with it because its impossible to pursue further and half the people you actually tell your story to think you’re out of your mind but I don’t care we know exactly what we saw.And the reson i filled this out now i because it took my a while to be able to look at this site because of no internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the stars and planes in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a bright light just for a breif moment so I thought it was a falling star and I just barely saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flashed again and again. This was not a typical airplane or jet type flashing. It was a white light, very bright and steady. It would stay on for about five seconds and then go out. It seemed to be higher than planes and was moving slowly toward me from the south moving north. It flashed about six times and disappeared. Just thought it was very odd and I might report it in case anyone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the altitude I thought it could be the space station or something. The light was brighter and higher than any plane or jet in the sky. Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds before or after.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned and saw a dark object as big as a helicopter hovering over the park. It was silent and less than a quarter of a mile up in the sky. There was this belt of tiny irregular-flashing lights that would move around this big, dark oval object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO started to go higher in the sky and it moved slowly back and forth like how you could swing a pendulum.  It was now about half a mile in the sky and gradually started to move North-East towards Berkeley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have I seen something like this before. It was shocking, and I want to know if anybody else saw it. I’m glad I found this website to share this sighting of a UFO which I always thought was as a funny thing until this past Monday night, it is now certainly no joke to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am into astrology and astronomy, so I look into the sky a lot at night.

I casually looked in the sky as I normally do, and noticed a very bright flickering star that was emitting blue and red lights. I stared at the object for a few seconds and saw it start to move in a zig-zag motion towards the northeast. I continued to watch the object, while another witness came outside and I alerted her to the object. She watched the object for a few minutes when it began to move again. The object would sporadically move up and down or left to right , and even looped in a horizontal circle several times. The object would stop abruptly without any inertia from the previous motion. The object made these movements in every direction, but would only move either vertically or horizontally at a time. For a few minutes I was under the expression it was in a scanning motions, which the lights were apparently scanning the area around the object. I alerted a third witness who also noticed the motions. The object moved around very randomly in the southwestern sky. The lights would dim and grow brighter. And twice I saw a red glow shoot out from the object horizontally and disappear. It appeared to be turning itself , while the body was moving as well. The lights appeared to be facing one direction but would change very quickly as it turned. The object then would stop, and move quickly off and on for several minutes. The objects movement was almost too small to notice , except for a few drastic movements that made  us gasp aloud. The object then stopped moving and slowly dimmed as it drifted west. The object was visible for about another hour, but did not make any movements in that time. The object faded from our site around 23:15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I heard her and our other neighbor talking so i went to my window. I live on the second floor and she&#39;s below me. That&#39;s when she told me to look at the red lights in the sky. I went to my balcony and saw the four red lights in the sky. they were positioned in a line except that two were clustered together. we watched them for another 7-10 minutes and the top single light began to flicker and then faded out. following that, the two clustered lights also began to flicker and fade out. the final light lasted the longest and did fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> during this time, i called 911 to tell them about, and the operator said that there have been no calls received around my area, maybe they are military flairs. the closest military base in at least 50 miles from where i live. my neighbor tried taking a picture of it, but nothing came out. my other neighbor has this event on video. what was very noiceable was how high they were in the sky. airplanes were flying below them. i say the lights were at least 1/4 of the total distance higher than the airplanes. They were very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/21/08 20:15|Phoenix|AZ|Triangle|18 Minutes|Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 Minutes|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62875.html|140|ndxe200804| Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 20:15, as I was taking out the trash, and walking back into my apartment, I glanced up at the sky, and saw a triangular shaped patter of 4 red lights, located in the Northwestern sky. At least one of the 4 lights was set slightly back from the others, making the triangle off just a tad. The lights were at the approximate height that any helicopter, or airplane getting ready to land or having just taken off would fly. There was absolutely no sound with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back into my apartment to get my camera, thinking how odd that was. When I got back out, I almost did not expect the lights to still be there, but they were. It appeared as though the lights were moving very very slowly, because they had hardly moved at all. I attempted to take a picture, but was unable to get a good result.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time I was trying to get the picture, two other people were walking to their car, and also saw the lights. Upon staring harder at the lights, it seemed as though they were moving very slowly in a Southeasterly direction. By this time, the 4 lights had formed a uniformed triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the furthest westerly light started blinking, and after a few seconds, blinked out. Then, the next light began blinking and also blinked out. Within seconds, the third light also began blinking, and then blinked out. By this time, the last remaining light had switched directions, and was now moving northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the remaining light, there would be times that it would flash very brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a shape of something, but before I could define it, the light would grow dim again. It almost seemed, as if it were a rounded shape, like the nose of an airplane, but much larger. As I watched, the singular remaining light continued to move to the Northeast, and then it just stopped. It would still continue to blink brighter, allowing me to briefly make out the shape of something, but then it would grow dim again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within, 18 minutes of my first seeing the lights, the fourth and final light then blinked out. As I walked back into my apartment, I suddenly got chills, as if I had just seen or experienced something extremely important.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past, I have seen other strange sightings, including something similar a few months where there were three lights also in a loose triangular pattern. All three of those lights eventually blinked out as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This report aired during the 10:00 p.m. broadcast.  This Sighting(which WAS FILMED also) occured in the Northern Portion of Phoenix. The Sighting was reported from North (18500 n. block) 7th Street and Union Hills(Street Intersection) Area.  The area is mostly Housing, with the 101-Pima Freeway(Runs East and West) located 1 mile North of the 7th Street and Union Hills Intersection. To the N.W. (appx.) 2.5 miles of the Intersection, is &#34;Deer Valley Airport&#34;. East of the Airport are small mountains and Desert area. The Lights filmed were &#34;Definately Not&#34; Conventional Aircraft. There were 4 Points of light, White and they maintained no consistant shape or formation. They occasionaly blinked and moved. Then each one &#34;winked out&#34;. And were gone.. The Report was fresh, So Details are yet to be reported, Reguarding: Movement,Direction(s),Color Variations, Behaviour(s) and any Related Anomilies ect.  Being a Native of Phoenix for 48+ years, I can attest that Peculiar Lights are... On, Or just above the Mountains around the valley fairly often. Usually, They seem to &#34;Hang Out&#34; alot around or near the TV/Radio/Microwave Towers on the Mts. Or on the Mts. Peaks and Ridges. They have Demonstraited Deliberate, Evasive(and)Invasive type Behaviour(s)By Mimicking; Tower(Beacon)Lights,Stars,Car Headlights, even Traffic Signal Lights. And By Adjusting their size, You can&#39;t really approximate their distance.(They can appear distant, And possibly large.  But, Actually be Very Small and &#34;Uncomfortably Close&#34;.)They are Brilliant at Being Deceptive. They &#34;Pretend&#34; To be a Distant Aircraft in the Sky, Stars, or a Car on a far off road. They can Blend into Reflection(s), And Match Their Immediate Background(s)Scenery..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They then changed direction to the shape of a lightning bolt.  Basically, the two middle lights became closer together.  The lights then faded out one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They ran far and were jumping at the sky. We looked up and there were 3 helicopter-like objects and had really strange designs om them. they started coming toward us and we ran back to the house. then this afternoon, we went to see if there was any evidence of it.

It sounded like it was right over our house.  I then realized my husband had also been startled by the sound and had already been up to investigate prior to my awakening.  The sound I heard was totally unfamiliar to me.... I would describe it as sounding like a gigantic bumble bee that would get louder, trail off, and then come back again, only to then disappear altogether. My husband was clearly shaken by what he saw and heard. He told me of bright blue pulsating lights shining in through our dining/living room plantation shutters which were open.  By the time I decided to go take a look out the windows myself, it h was 4:09 a.m., and all was quiet and normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought perhaps it was a storm brewing and the sound was a result of the wind blowing through the trees.  As the sound continued, I got up to investigate.  I walked into the living room and opened the sliding doors to the lanai.  I was amazed to learn that there was, in fact, zero wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perplexed, I returned to bed and tried to sleep.  The droning sound seemed to fade away.  Then the sound began to increase, getting much louder than before.  In fact, it was loud enough to awaken my wife.  She was alarmed and asked me what the strange noise was.  I told her it&#39;s been going on for some time, but that I would check it out.  I got out of bed, put on my robe, and walked through the bedroom door into the living/dining room area.  As I stepped through the doorway, a very bright pulsing  blue/white light came through the dining room windows.  It was bright an pulsing and quite frankly scared me.  I put my hand up to my eyes and backed into the bedroom.  My intent was to dial 911, but as quickly as the lights came, they stopped and the droning sound began to fade away.  The next morning, I went to the Sherriff&#39;s office and asked if they had reports of anything odd that occurred in our development during the early morning hours.  The officers checked the police log and said nothing unusual was reported!<n>

The pitch didn’t change like a helicopter would have as it moved closed, and its bass increased also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While listening to this strange noise for about 1 minute or so I then started to think that it was some ones car stereo, however the sound never changed its rhythm during the entire time.  Observing the only possible routes a car could take into and out of neighborhood no cars were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This noise also seemed to take a path that could only be taken in the air.  After several minutes of my curiosity being peaked I thought to myself I’m going out and see what the hell is making this strange noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this exact moment I could feel this slight pressure all over my body and felt somewhat off balance.  This freaked me out enough to say the hell with it and stay parked firmly in front of the TV, and allow this sound to pass over without  me investigating further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We thought it was a tire fire near the dump, but when we drove out there, there was nothing. When we went back to town, we saw it again and it was much much larger. No fire reports were reported.  No sighting of it as morning came. May have been one or maybe a congregation of some sort, since the glow grew brighter, and had black lines running through it, i would assume it was multiple ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was like I did not have a choice I felt under there control.  I live on a golf course and the area which they lead me to was a distance away form my house. It was on the 5th hole of the golf course when I got there, I did not know what was about to happen. It made a load beeping sound, I looked up and there was a small gray saucer no more then 30 to 40 yards up.  They could communicate with me in my head, but I did not see them just the space craft even when they left I could still here them talk to me.  They wanted me to go with them to there planet, I was scared and did not think that was a good idea.  They were pulling at me, it felt like hundred of hand grabbing at me. I knew I had  to get out of there; I made my way to the road which was open, and I knew it would be hard for them to land.  As I was walking, it followed me step for step if I stopped, it stopped if I moved fast, it moved fast if I moved slow, it moved! slow. When it stated to move, it was at a horizontal position as it moved it  moved at a 45 degree angle. When I got to the road, it ascend very slowly till I lost it in the sky. After the attack, I got very sick; I was bed rid for 3 days I did not eat, I did not drink, I did not use the bathroom, I was barely conscious I thought I was going to die! I could not even speak I was so weak. The reason  I am coming forward now is because one I did not think any one would belive me and two I am still having problems from the attack. I have had over 10,000 in medical testing done on me and all my tests have come back normal and none of the doctors still do not know what&#39;s wrong with me. I&#39;m at the point where I don&#39;t know what to do can you help.<n>
4/20/08 21:30|West Bend|WI|Circle|10 min.|Four circular UFO's, one glowing orange, over West Bend, WI 4-20-2008|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62925.html|158|ndxe200804| Four circular UFO&#39;s, one glowing orange, over West Bend, WI 4-20-2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was out on our balcony cooling off and called me out to show me an odd &#34;hole&#34; in the sky. It was around 9:30 p.m. and the sky was mostly dark and cloudy. This specific &#34;hole&#34;, or clearing, in the sky was bright blue. A few seconds later, I saw a flicker of an orange color in that area. We kept watching, and suddenly another flash of orange glowed, much brighter and more clear,as if closer to us. It traveled slightly before going back out, or quickly disappearing. We saw a flicker again as if it were further away.  Then several minutes later my daughter saw four white glowing circular crafts moving quickly together. She got it on her cell phone video, approximately 15 seconds worth of footage. I studied the film carefully and noted that the larger one first zipped by in a straight line and flew behind the clouds, then suddenly returned back into view, moved in a circle, as if waiting for the three smaller crafts that then came into view. The first two flew together in a diagonal line, then stopped as one did a few circles and the other hovered around quickly in odd angles. Then, the fourth craft came into view, appearing to be the smallest. Once the fourth one was in site, the first craft zipped back into the clouds and the others seemed followed and just disappeared. I was going to make an anonymous call but was too embarrassed.  After hearing about the World News Report, I figured it was my duty to report this as others may have been afraid to report that day too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked at it, and noticed a red flash come from it. I stopped in the middle of the road, and watched the light but it wasn&#39;t moving. I was about to just start driving again when the red light started flashing again. I thought the only normal thing that it could be was a helicopter above the lake, so I kicked it to the lake to see if it was a helicopter. Helicopters have been known to land down at the lake to life flight a wreck victim from the bridge, so I knew how loud a helicopter would be so I lowered my window to see if I could hear something, but there was no sound. I crossed the bridge,(Neil&#39;s Bridge) and stared at what looked like a skinny long object with two long blue lights in the middle and a red light at one end and a white light a the other. I stopped on the side of the road when I was across the bridge, and watched the lights just sit about a hundred feet above the lake. I climbed out the widow to look over the roof of the car, and it flew off over the trees in the direction I had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tullahoma! I then drove back towards town, but I could only see lights off in the distance. There were about four sets of red and white lights going across the sky, so I have no idea what I saw. I can only assume it was something from the air base that is about thirty miles from my house. I don&#39;t believe in aliens, so I believe it was something man made. Probably an experimental aircraft. Strangely enough, we had an earthquake while I was typing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was viewed with the naked eye and only a hyper-blue white was eminating from the underside of the object. When viewed through 8x21 binoculars the object appeared to have red and white lights at each of the 3 corners in addition to the hyper-blue type light coming from the underside. The blue light would get brighter and dimmer but the red and white lights remained constant.  The object hovered for at least the 30 minutes that it was viewed with very little movement. When fixing a position and then viewing the oject in comparison to the fixed point the object remained at approximately the same location with very little movement. In checking online there were reports made in March 2008 with the Pasco County Sheriffs office by others but seemed to be explained away as an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was seen in the sky by myself and one other observer on 04-20-08 was not any type of craft ever seen in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The couple of light glows appeared in front of the wing then travelled towards the back of the airplane.  Distance cannot be determined because I was too worried about getting my Olympus Camera out of my waist pouch.  This was the only shot I got.  It was bright enough that no reflection could&#39;ve been casted from within the cabin.  I am not sure if other&#39;s had seen such object.  The plane was about 4 hrs into its flight.  Please see attached image.<n>

It was getting dark, and there were large cumulus clouds in the sky. On this particular road, there isn&#39;t much but countryside, farms etc, everything is pretty open. I was trying to keep my eyes on the road, but I was also paying alot of attention to these amazing huge white clouds in the darkened sky. Amazing scenery. At one instance, I looked back up at this big cloud out to the right side of my windshield, and an intense ball of silver white light just appeared. It burst out in front of this cloud. Out of nowhere. It was not a star, and it wasn&#39;t a plane. It was a round intense ball of silvery white light that stayed in the same place for a few seconds, then it slowly took off to the left a short distance and faded out. Like it went into the cloud. A white car was in front of me, and they had to have seen it too. The distance of the object is hard to determine. From my perspective It was about he size of a dime right beside this huge mid level cloud. Very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/20/08 18:45|Dothan|AL|Diamond|5 minutes|Possible UFO in the South|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62938.html|164|ndxe200804| Possible UFO in the South<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting object.  I was outside near sunset and I saw what I first thought was a bird but the motion was odd and the object was much larger.  There were birds in the sky at the same time.  It was traveling from West to East.  At about 1500 - 3000 feet, but this was hard to tell. It was a very dark, black object. I could tell it was diamond shaped.  It was rolling and flipping as it traveled along.  It maintained altitude and heading as if it was on a direct path.  The was no sound.  There was no exhaust.  And it maintained a relativly constant speed.  Not very fast and slower than a light aircraft in flight.  The rolling and flipping motion is what I found odd.  I first thought it was a huge bird, but I could see it was not a bird after it past by. My next thought was that it could be possibly be a balloon, but, again, after it passed by, I could tell it was not.  It was a very dense, dark object.  And it was diamond shaped. There were no lights or anything luminuos. I have no idea what it was.  I was hoping the local news media might have had some reports of this, but it appears not.  So I would have to say what I saw tonight would be classified as a unidentified flying object.  I am hoping though someone else reported something similar as this object headed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In fact, we even tried to take pictures of eachother and the same result happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes another craft came into view and the two crafts lights began blinking.

I then noticed four very tiny crafts also triangle shaped that seemed to be hovering along side of the huge one. Moving ever so slowly, I then looked even deeper straight up into the sky and shockingly realized there was an enormous grayish triangle that actualy covered almost the whole sky above me. I could barely see the outskirts of the sky itself! I watched in awe for hours as it moved ever so slowly.Then it went straight up so fast and out of sight. This is the first time I have seen this craft. I have wittnesed many other alien actions in this pasture with my son since November 2004! I can&#39;t describe in words these events. They usually always occur in November. This is the first time we have ever encountered anything of this magnitude.On other occasions, I have witnessed smaller alien vehicles that were landed in the pasture, which resembled only what I can describe as a &#34;tent&#34; with a glowing lantern inside. The actual beings I have seen range from 12&#39;tall and skinny, to short at 3&#39;. All with their own &#34;jobs&#34; to do in their alien race. I&#39;ve seen them digging in the field with what appeared to be an object resembling a shovel.Some forming an assembly line passing something down the line and loading onto this tent with the glowing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching with binoculars ( which they get disturbed by ) if you watch too long! In one instance as I had been peering to intently, the tall one swiftly turned his head looking at me right back through my binoculars causing them to break inside, now looking through them everything I see is double! I have seen craft&#39;s that look like a birthday cake with colors of blue, red, yellow and green. One actualy lifting off the top of the other and seperating in opposite directions.There are many other instances we have enthusiasticlly waited hoping to see them again.This is also the first instance in which they have appeared during or close to a full moon. Another symbolism is that it always gets real cold like a bone cold when they are near. I have no doubt at all that they know we are watching them! They know we are there!Since Nov. 2004 many occurances have taken place which is totally mind boggling. My son is the person that brought this to my attention and at first I must say I was a little to aloof about the whole idea of such! My mind was completely changed after the first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We think these are the aliens better known as ( The Grays. ) After all they are gray and do not seem to be aggressive. So many other odd instances too many to write on this paper! So I will stop noe. Thank you,<n>
4/19/08 23:55|Santa Cruz|CA|Rectangle|30 seconds|Large Dark Glowing Semi Rectangled object chased by plane in the Sky at about 2000 feet a few minutes before midnight in Santa Cruz Ca.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62630.html|175|ndxe200804| Large Dark Glowing Semi Rectangled object chased by plane in the Sky at about 2000 feet a few minutes before midnight in Santa Cruz Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see planes cross the night sky every night.  I am used to spotting commercial planes going to San Jose Airport and Military Planes going to the base coming inland off the coast as I watch the stars nightly.  Last night right before midnight I had an urge to get up and went outside to peak at the moon, which was either full or very close.  Clouds covered the moon partially. The rest of the sky was clear. It was a beautiful small cloud formation.  Others must have seen this. Although you had to be paying close attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly saw an object. It was glowing, but had no lights.  It glowed evenly around the craft with a slight green hue. It was more like seeing a giant shadow.  It was large, massive, sort of rectangle but it had an angle that slimmed to the nose.  It made no noise but the shear size of the object caused my heart to skip and me to involuntarily verbally blurt &#34;Holly SHi%T!&#34;  I waited to see the shadow appear from under the clouds where I would really see it as it was not that high in the sky, maybe 2000 feet.  I was a bit scared in honesty.  It was so big and silent.  It quickly came out of the clouds and what I saw was a huge glowing semi rectangular object move quickly across the sky.  I could clearly see its underbelly.  It was being followed by a large plane.  It was not a civilian plane but it could not keep up with the craft.  It certainly got a better view than I did.  The underbelly had no visible markings, very stealthy. The size really shook me.  It was like half the size of the giant craft in Independence Day, minus the lights etc.  It was just a smooth surface glowing with a very defined shape.  I would have to draw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound of the sound barrier breaking thundered when the UFO left. This could of been the plane pursuing it as it was escalating in speed.  The UFO was just there and passed out of view from the building as did the plane as the sound went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was gone very quickly but I know what I saw.  If it was not a UFO unless the military has some very fast, dark,  glowing planes of strange dimension they are testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO seemed as if it was gliding effortlessly and with no sound.  I could hear the plane as it came closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit it looked just very much like the only other UFO I have ever seen with my own eyes and with my mother very close up around 1973.  I can find the exact date as we had a family death later that night. I was young.  It was within miles of here. 20 other people saw it as the paper wrote it up the next day. It glowed the same way and was shaped the same.  But in 73 it hovered right above the trees so close my mom drove off the road and we just stared and said nothing until it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft looked the same but was moving where the one in 73 scared us both simply due to its size and left so fast, we did not see it move.  I never forgot that night and the strange dark huge glowing object, only to see it again nearly 37 years later.  It was just as ominously as the first encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no time to grab my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We could see stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a disc-shaped craft moving slowly and smoothly across the sky, east to west, much like an aircraft at a high altitude.  There was no trail, nor sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband out of a tent to see it. It had chaser lights going around its perimeter.  We watched it together for about 2 minutes, until it went behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our friend, ((name deleted)), joined us and saw it for about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all quite sober, all around 50, and none of us had ever seen anything like that before.<n>

Since around 10:00 p.m.. I mentioned something about the moon when all of the sudden. My car lit up, with all these bright colors everywhere, red, yellow, and pale yellow. And I told my friend &#34;oh my God Cindy you ought see  this&#34;! ! I jumped out of the car I could hear Cindy shouting &#34;Susan Susan&#34; and the bell of the door going ding ding. Then what I saw was AWESOME!!!!!!!! There was a humming sound and the colors where everywhere. The lights were the length of two buses side by side above my trees. And the lights were in rotation. In between the lights I felt like I was being watched. I held my cell phone in my left hand and in my right hand I raised up the symbol of hook em horns, and I smiled. Then they took off to the west. This lasted 25 to 30 seconds. To me I&#39;ll always cherish this for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 4/20/08 I contacted Midland International Airport at 10:45 a.m. spoke with Clay airport opperations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who wouldn&#39;t let me inquire about the sighting on the 19th. And thats when I couldn&#39;t talk to the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He gave me Petersphone number.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn&#39;t hear any sound from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much about it until I seen it again on April 22 with my sister and it Glided right over us very slowly, we then heard a low bass murmur sound coming from it. As it got right above us it turned east. The lights were so bright you couldn&#39;t see the craft itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And approximately 1 mile away, and approximately 100 feet above the tree line I noticed what at first I believed was a white flare. After observing the object for a little while I noticed that the object was stationary, ruling out a flare(I served in the military). The object after about two minutes increased in brightness. The object remained at the current brightness for about two more minutes, and then just disappeared. It did not fizzle out like a flare would. And during the whole event the object remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This area is in St. James Parish, Louisiana.  It was a clear night with a beautiful bright moon and the objects were moving west to east in a scattered pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be moving about 30 miles an hour because we were able to follow them.  I then stopped the vehicle and got outside to see if we could hear any noise.  At that time all but one of them just disappeared.  We watched the last one and then it disappeared.  We did not hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The back light sped up to catch the front light and both continued to move across the sky at a slow speed.  They eventually both faded out, and then a third flew directly over us at the same speed and in the same direction. All three were the same brightness and color.  They did not blink like a regular plane. It was definitely not an airplane.  Hopefully others will write what they witnessed!<n>

I thought it might be a planet or something the way it just sat there. It was the coolest thing I can remember ever seeing, because like a bolt of lightening it took off sideways then straight up. I&#39;ve seen jets kick their afterburners in before but this was nothing like that, the speed that this moved from sitting still gives me chills today. Even the new planes that they have at Tyndall AFB would not be able to touch this, it would be like trying to catch a Porche on a Tricycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4/19/08 01:20|Kalispell|MT|Triangle|20 minutes|Two objects seen flying, stopping, and then dissipating.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62672.html|187|ndxe200804| Two objects seen flying, stopping, and then dissipating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was a triangular shaped craft. I would say it was at least three football fields wide and about a quarter of that long. There were five giant lights spaced at regular intervals from tip to tip (width) on the craft. The craft seemed to vibrant and hum as it passed overhead. It traveled fairly fast. It got to about 4 miles away and then it abruptly stopped* and then disappeared over a period of about 5 seconds. The spot where it was just looked many stars bunched together that are no longer there when you look at that general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *With how big the object was and how fast it was traveling, it should not have been able to stop that fast and that’s what made me first think that humans could not have made this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft appeared about 3 minutes after the first craft disappeared. It flew from the southeast and was descending. I would estimate the craft was about as wide as the wingspan of a commercial jet and about as long two football fields. It had a cylindrical fuselage. It had one green light near the front and two purple lights at the rear. The front sloped down from the main body of the craft and was lower than the rest of the craft as well. I heard no noise from the craft. It also stopped very quickly and disappeared. Just like the previous craft, the place where the craft stopped looked like a bunch of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw or heard nothing more for the rest of the night, but the next evening I looked at those two spots and did not see the bunch of stars from the night before, making me think it was some kind of camouflage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had been walking to the gas station to buy some food and I stopped to light a cigarette.  Something caught my attention and I looked up to see a chevron shaped object flying north.  The object had several orangish/yellowish lights emanating from the bottom of the craft.  I was quite stunned to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be only a few miles away though I&#39;m not sure of it&#39;s altitude, but it was very low.  It&#39;s wingspan was one of the more unusual aspects of the sighting as it seemed to be 1 1/2 times the length of a typical commercial jet airliner.  I had headphones in my ears at the time, so I took them out to see if I could hear anything.  It was absolutely silent.  It seemed to be gliding through the air.  I continued to stand and stare for approximately 10 seconds until it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

We both thought that it was a little to bright to be a meteorite and &#34;zip&#34; that fast through the sky like that, so we both said at the same time; Did you see that!?? We both got up out of bed and looked out the window and saw this perfectly round bright dot in the sky that seemed pretty far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked just like a star, but was not flickering like a star usually does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just focused on the what we though was to be a star for a short while before it suddenly started bouncing around in the sky at a speed that I have never seen before. I am 100% positive and sure that it was something that was from out of this world! At first my heart was racing and we were both startled trying to figure out what we both just saw. Then later we picked each others JAWS up from the ground, shook our heads in disbelief and calmed down. We both talked about it for a whie and still can&#39;t get it off of our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I lost sight for a minute when I arrived home and parked and exited my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the general vicinity where I originally seen this and what I thought was an extremely bright star caught my eye. I didn&#39;t watch it continually at first but kept glancing back as I carried groceries in. Then I stopped and watched it closer. It was only white at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it didn&#39;t look like a typical twinkling star because it was so much brighter. Then it seemed to be shimmying a little or maybe slightly wavering from side to side. The light on it then appeared to be scanning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother to get her to watch it. She agreed it was moving and the light appeared to be going around in circles or scanning. It gradually started to fade farther away but was still noticeable to us. Although if I had only seen it at this point I would have definitely thought it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a red light that seemed to come from it. This red light was getting more and more bright as the other was fading more and more. I watched the object with the red light go from west to east just opposite of what the first had done. It traveled along the mountain steadily just as if it were a typical plane I have seen at night. It did seem much lower though. I watched it as far as I could see it and it done nothing significant. The other light continued to fade and eventually I could not see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all lasted for approximately 45 minutes. I am not sure how long it had been there when it first caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object had couple of yellow lights in a row on one of the sides. The body of the object was dark and it was hard to identify the shape on top of the disk. It remained in one spot for about a minute and then slowly started to disappear into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, it was horseshoe shaped as best as I could tell or at least it had lights going around it that were in a horseshoe configuration. The lights looked almost crystal white. My daughter who is 18 saw the same thing. It looked to me that the object was not moving or barely moving. My daughter thought it was moving a bit but since we were driving it is hard to tell if it was moving. The object appeared to be as big as several houses put together. Or if you looked at a full moon in the sky it may have been as big as 50 full moons. I didn&#39;t hear any noise but I think I had the radio on. I got out of the car to get a better look in a minute after seeing it because I couldn&#39;t see it any more. When I looked all around there was no object at all. It literally seemed to have disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed pretty large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m bad at estimating altitudes, but we&#39;re on the direct flight path to the Dallas/Love Field airport which is only about 4 miles away so airplanes fly pretty low overhead (maybe 300ft). This object appeared to only be 2 or 3 times as high; it was roughly the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length when it disappeared (possibly into the clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also traveling pretty fast. We heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I did so, out of the corner of my eye I saw a light moving at very high speeds, when I looked at it, I noticed it was moving at too high of a speed to be any man-made aircraft, not even a jet could fly this fast. Just as soon as I saw the light, it had vanished, towards the mountains in the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After traveling several degrees in the vision in just a second or so, it had accelerated to the point it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this I began marking times using a function on my watch, and at 8:06 I noticed another one of the red darts. During the next hour the sky around our job is filled with air planes and helicopters deviating from the normal flight path into North Las Vegas Airport to circle around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I leave the job for home at around 22:30, I check to see if my laptop (which I don&#39;t normally leave in there) was okay, at which point I find the backpack and the laptop to be both hot to the touch (I&#39;ve never had this problem before), with the laptop already fully powered on. The laptop has only an effective battery life of 70 minutes, and was not at full capacity the last time I used it, which was around 18:00.  Out of curiosity, I touch the back of my hand to the car stereo, and it is also hot to the touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen &#34;white spheres&#34; or dots over this part of the city. In fact, this is the third time in less than a year, but the first time I reported the incidents.<n>

My mother (who does not believe in U.F.O.s) said she saw a light in the sky. I went out to investigate and up in the sky was a light, which at first I dismissed as a star. I was about to walk back inside when I saw this craft move at incredible speed closer to us. It was then that I noticed that what I was looking at was NO STAR! It was cigar shaped with a long triangular strut coming off the top and two smaller ones coming out the bottom, kind of like landing gear. I noticed yellow and green lights rotating around the craft with a large yellow light on top of the large triangular strut. It hovered COMPLETELY noiseless for about 10 minutes, then me and my family witnessed 3 or 4 smaller crafts come out of the bottom and fly away. The speeds of these crafts were humanly impossible! The smaller crafts were pulsating green lights. After about another 8 minutes we all witnessed the smaller crafts re-enter the large one. It continued to hover for a couple of minutes then it just disappeared right before our eyes! I just want to let everyone know that this is NO HOAX! I am very good at debunking things but I can never debunk what my family and I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also heard numerous reports on the internet about a lot of other people seeing these objects not only in Tennessee but in other states as well. I hope more people come forward about these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/18/08|Albion|IL|||me and 2 of my friends was walking from fairfeild to albion illinois on  friday the 18th,the time was 4:30 we would walk for 20 minutes|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62951.html|199|ndxe200804| me and 2 of my friends was walking from fairfeild to albion illinois on  friday the 18th,the time was 4:30 we would walk for 20 minutes and  take a 5 minute breather, while taking a break, i look up in the sky and  notice &#34;a bright star&#34; or so i thougt, moving in a very unique way, in  no way any airplane or other man made flying machine could every move  through the skies. this &#34;ship&#34; was moving slow in one direction, then  speeding up, and then turning back the same way it came. after examining  this thing for a while, i made up my mind that it was somthing out of  explanation, and after panning the skies, it became clear to me that  there was more than one, i counted at one time in the sky more than 5 of  these blinking lights. but i kept my eye on the biggest brightest one, at  one point the one i kept track of stopped, i watched for about 15  seconds and then a red dot appeard miles away from the ship and in an  instant both objects dissapeard, and in seconds the ship was back, and at  one point the big ship was stopped and a little ship beamed a light to  the big one, and when that happend the sky lit up. i felt scared, but i  was amazed at what i was seeing at the same time. we kept walking, and i  might add i tried to get my friends to look at these things in the sky  but when they would look they just kept saying i dont see anything and  wouldnt take the time to look very long. so we were walking and an  elderly man pulled over to the side of the road, i asked if i could use  his phone, he said yes, and when i took the phone i said &#34;not to sound  weird or anything but do you believe in aliens?&#34; and told him what i saw  and made him look. he too didnt see anything becouse he didnt take the  damn time to actually look at what i was pointing at. and when i said  sumthin about aliens, he told me there was had been an earthquake that  shook the midwest, about 10 minutes ago. the whole time me and my  friends were walking we didnt feel anything shake at all, and this earthquake  was a 5.4 the biggest recorded in the midwest. so while the whole  midwest region was feeling the ground shake, i was experiencing the most  shocking time of my life. IF ANYONE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT I SAW THAT  NIGHT OF THE EARTHQUAKE PLEASE SAY SO, BECOUSE I KNOW IT WASNT JUST ME  WHO SEEN THESE THINGS, THEY WERE OUT FROM 4:30 TILL THE SUN CAME UP,  THERE HAD TO BEEN MORE PPL TO WITNESS THIS<n>

Besides Myself A Lincoln State Police Officer Also Saw The Object And He Couldn&#39;t Figure Out What It Could Be.

At first, I thought it was a plane (since we have an airport in the general vicinity),  but after a second or two, I realized that it had no blinking lights on the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then listened for a sound... There was none.  The speed at which it was moving was also in question: it was slow and methodical...about 5-10mph at best.  As it climbed overhead, it began to fade, until there was nothing left to be seen…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source implies a nighttime sighting.  We have changed the time above, to reflect that fact.  PD))<n>
4/17/08 23:15|Freeland|MD|Unknown|5 minutes|Totally Silent bright white light with no strobe lights or navigation lights, heading in an odd direction.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62874.html|202|ndxe200804| Totally Silent bright white light with no strobe lights or navigation lights, heading in an odd direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not live near an airport, but we do have a steady flow of aircraft nearly overhead, but they are usually coming from the Northeast and heading South/ Southeast towards Baltimore- Washington Airport (BWI) and Dulles.  Over my house the larger airliners are typically at about 10,000 ft. or above, but even at that altitude the are easily distinguishable by the strobes, nav lights and jet sound.  We also have some light, general aviation traffic at what I would gage to be about 3,000 to 6,000 ft. altitude; again , easily distinguishable by strobes, nav lights and noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:00 pm on the late evening of 17 April 2008, I decided to take a soak in my hot tub on my deck, open to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, I would guess to be about 11:10-11:15, I noticed bright lights to the Southwest that under normal circumstances I would have identified right away as a relatively low flying general aviation light aircraft.  There were several things about the object that were odd.  (1) The object headed due North, a direction I almost never see aircraft go.  (2) The lights were white, and not flashing like strobes would.  (3)  There were no wing lights/ navigation lights- just unblinking white lights.  (4)  The object, flying at what I estimated to be low altitude, based upon many previous sightings of small aircraft, generated absolutely NO SOUND whatsoever!  The object flew across the sky rather quickly, and disappeared in the due North horizon.  I refer to this as a “mundane” sighting because there were no multi-colored lights, no “cigar shape”, no instantaneous 90 degree changes in direction, no odd noises- nothing spectacular; just an object that flew across the sky without flashing lights and totally devoid of sound, something I cannot explain.  I have ALWAYS heard the sound of EVERY aircraft that has flown over my house, high or low; I simply cannot explain this particular sighting- why was there no strobe lights?  Red and Green Navigation lights?  Why was there no sound at all?<n>

We decided to stop at my folks place on South Chain Lake.  It was around 11:15pm or so.  The weather was windy and cold with some light snow.   My folks were out of town so I was checking in on the house periodically.  My fiancé wanted to check the baseball scores so he went downstairs to use the computer.  I was upstairs making a late-night snack in the kitchen.  About that time I was startled by bright lights in the backyard towards the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so bright I thought a helicopter was shining lights down but there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness quickly reduced and turned into a blue-hued light shining into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I fainted and my fiancé, Dwight, heard me hit the floor. He came running upstairs to find me lying on my side by the sliding glass door (I must have gone over to look out the window).  He says he saw no lights and nothing outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside and there were two parallel tracks coming up from lake shore to the middle of yard, almost like car tracks but they were smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is I seemed to have no injury from when I fainted, and this all seemed to take place in under a minute, but Dwight swears he was on computer for 10 or more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt I had to tell my story somewhere.  I never really believed in UFO’s previously, but I’ve been having nightmares about it for 5 days now and have had a couple of flashbacks. Also, my dreams include seeing a hovering globe or sphere-shaped craft and I feel weightless, like I&#39;m always falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was coming home with my family and i just happened to look at the moon. Then it caught my eye. I watched it for about 30 minutes before it disappeared. It looked like it was spinning around because of the different colors that woukld keep repeating: red, blue, and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would shoot out yellow beams of light. It hasd been in the same spot for 3 days now and I&#39;m really concerned. Right before it would disappear you would hear a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I live between Noblesville and Lapel, we have left the house to go to work at 10:00 pm. as we pulled out of our driveway onto 186th street we notice what to be an object with several different color lights to the North West. Within 30 seconds we saw what appeared to be five to seven yellowish lights appear to the left of the first object in a V shape and shortly there after another group of yellowish lights appeared just below with the same V shape. We stopped the car and rolled down the windows we heard nothing, no sound at all. These lights we stationary and not moving, we watched for about 2 to 3 minutes then noticed the first object disappear and shortly there after the two V shapes were gone, just disappeared. There was no sound and no other type of flashes that would be associated with an explosion. We did not see any trailing streaks as has been reported by others. A short while later my wife did say that she had seen a falling star with a trailing light behind it. We don&#39;t know what it was that we saw, but we do know that it was not a jet liner as our house sits in the flight path of Indianapolis International Airport in which we see jets preparing to land every night. This is really strange and we agree that we will never know what we saw Wednesday night for sure. The Military and government has a long history of covering up the real truth, thinking Americans cannot handle the truth thus causing panic among the population.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didn&#39;t hear the sound of airplane jets or a streak of light  behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two of the lights were green and one red, and each light was in a corner of the triangle.  It looked as if it was moving at first but when I got closer I realized it wasn&#39;t and rolled my windows down.  It was extremely close to the ground maybe a few miles up not many and it hovered for nearly half a minute while I was stopped on the road and I didn&#39;t hear anything that you would hear from a plane.  When it started moving again it moved so fast that even though I tried I couldn&#39;t follow it and was out of sight into the clouds in mere seconds.  I have never seen any manmade aircraft that could do that and am still shocked beyond belief.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/17/08 21:00|Slovan|PA|Light|30 minutes|flashing object in southwest sky, changed colors from red to blue to white staying in same spot  for 30 minutes, then vanished|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62934.html|209|ndxe200804| flashing object in southwest sky, changed colors from red to blue to white staying in same spot  for 30 minutes, then vanished<n> <n><n> <n><n> On thursday April 17, 2008, my son wanted to ride his bike at around 8:45 pm. He asked what an object was up in the sky, and upon looking, I saw that it was a star and told him that. He for some reason has a fear of aliens. He thought the star was a ufo and to comfort him, I looked for other stars to point out. I pointed to the southwest sky and sid that there was another one. Upon looking though, I noticed it was changing changing colors from blue to red to white etc. He even asked why it was flashing and I told him that it was probably the effects of the atmosphere...what do I know, it sounded good to me. I thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think that much of it. The next day at work, one of the guys ( Bill, whom I didn&#39;t talk to at this time) who lives about 40 miles from me in Irwin, PA said that he saw a ufo. He told the guy that I&#39;m working with that it was changing colors from red to white to blue, and I said that was exactly what I had seen. On monday the 21st, I saw Bill and asked him about it. He said that it was in the southwest sky, and then I knew I saw what he had seen. He said that he looked at it through a telescope, and that it was surrounded by five other lights that would go on and off intermittently. He said that it had moved at one point also. He also said that it appeared on friday the 18th as well, although I didn&#39;t look for it that night. I decided that I would look for it on monday the 21st. Sure enough, it was there in the southwest sky, and the odd thing was that very few stars were visible due to the cloud cover, but this was a very brilliant light. This was at 9:15 pm. I went in and got my mini dv camcorder and took about a two minutes of video. I zoomed in with the optical zoom as much as I could. I made a dvd so I could watch it in slow mo. It actually changes from red to green to blue to white purple etc. Not neccisarilly in those orders. At some frames it almost appears to have a sort of diamond shape that is flat on the top and bottom. At 10:15 pm, I hap! pened to be looking at it, and it just sort of vanished and I didn&#39;t see it the rest of the night. If it is there tonight I am going to try zooming in with the digital zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lightning was all around and as we were watching it....some lights appeared from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the flashing white lights over the tree line  on our property  and told my husband to look. When he turned to look....the white lights were gone and then all of a sudden we saw a row of about 15 to 20 rectangular orange lights aligned in a row flashing in a north to south then south to north sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that I have seen this object before and so my husband got in his truck to see if he could get a look beyond the tree line. He returned about 10 to 15 minutes later and said that he could see nothing and yet the flashing lights continued after he got back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not explain the lights. The object had no sound and was huge. ( we estimate about 150 to 200 yards long) and that the object was approximately 1/4 to ½ mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband refused to let me call the police in fear of ridicule, but we both believe that we have seen an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I turned to look I noticed there were 4 to 6 circular lights. All equally spaced, as if you were to look at the bottom of a six pack or something. This all happened very quickly and lasted 10-20 seconds at the most. As I was looking at them the lights seemed to flash or pulse I guess because the lights never went out, they just brightened up and back down very quickly. They went right down the line, the two front ones (north lights) then to the next set and then to the last (south side). After the last two brightened, all of them disappeared into on single light that took off to the north, very, very quickly. Looked like a shooting star, but much much faster. I mean, real fast. Within a minute of this, I heard jets or other familiar sounds of aircraft in the area. Not right after I witnessed this, but within the minute. There is a military base nearby and I have witnessed many planes in the sky, but I could not explain this ad had to tell someone. I have always been sort of open minded about ufo&#39;s and such, but have never witnessed anything of the sort. The fact that I have never seen anything has made me question the idea that they even exist. But like I said, I really cannot explain this at all. I was inside and thought maybe it was a reflection on my window from a neighbor or anything and I could not explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about 2 miles away from Duke Field AFB when I noticed a bright light in the sky off to the left from my frame of vision. I watched it for a few seconds thinking it was a reflection of the sun off a jetliner. As I watched the object it began to change colors and turned orange/yellow while moving up and down slightly more pronounced then hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then turned a red/ orange for a few seconds and then to black in the shape of a vertical line or sideways oval, then vanished. I began to look for the light again while driving and noticed in the distance of the general direction of the first event there was what looked like an air craft with contrails coming off of it ( like the tails of comets) usually the aircraft engines can produce this kids of contrail that is a V formation out the back of the craft but this one I saw was not, it was forming a U with the contrail, which I also thought was odd, it had to be a wide aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the new craft the light came back next to it, it again started out a bright white light, then turned two different shades of orange/ red and then black before vanishing. I have lived in this area 16 years. I have lived on the AFB and worked on all 3 of the bases whe have here,I have seen many different type of air craft over the years, but I have never seen anything like this here before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I got past some building I thought that&#39;s not a kite. It was far away from me more over the city. When it got closer to the mountains it was almost camoflouged because of the color it was. It was big like a square turned side way to make a diamond shape with 3 crafts smaller behind it. They were kind a bunched up. Anyway it disappeared. When I got on the freeway mabey 15 minutes later, I see it again. Traveling south over the city, Murray,Sandy, then Draper. I didn&#39;t want to wreck and I was on the phone telling my husband about it. Anyway just really wierd. I know other people would have seen it. This is the second thing I have seen in a week. I also reported a star that moved during the day last sunday with my family seeing it also, and then later a flashing one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The photo is of the mountain I had just finished climbing.  The sky was clear that day.  I understand that there is always the possibility that the object&#39;s occurance in the photo could have something to do with the camera itself, but I took several other photos that day and none of them have this.  I&#39;ve also taken hundreds of photos since and have searched them for any sign of the image.  At the time I took the photo, I was faced southwest.  The object would be hoovering over Joshua Tree National Park.  I just want to share the photo, and maybe receive an explanation or even just an opinion.<n>

All were moving very fast across the horizon. One other person witnessed the event aside me. The lights were completely random, I could see an airplane in the distance. I know it was an airplane due to its slow speed and contant red light. This is how I concluded that these crafts were not man made.( for all I know ) After a few second, all the crafts were out of sight, except for the airplane. The lights flashed randomly, it apperaed to be circular objects but I could not tell because of the darkness. All I could see is the strange white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it started to move very slowly in a strange way. This lasted for 10 minutes and caused all the dogs to howl.I was very nervous and spooked. I ran back inside and turned all the lights off. I kept my eyes on the object until I could not see it anymore..It was not a plane .It moved way to slow and strange and it did not even make a sound..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I cannot remember the time that night that this incident happened but if I had to guess i would have been around 2 am of april 17th...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up to my boyfriend screaming: &#34;What the F--- are these lights?  And he got up out of bed immediately, he almost jumped out of bed literally.  He became very pale and disoriented.  I opened my eyes, and I saw an amazing event happen right before my eyes..  From what I can remember there were about two solid &#34;fire ball lights&#34;  in a perfect circle the size of about 3 tennis balls.  and they were moving around in such a synchonized pattern, almost a pattern of something that existed all on its own.  It had sort of a magnetic movement...  The balls were moving very fast in a circular sideway motion and they would leave a trace of light behind, which made an amazing design in front of us..  It only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds and then it completely dissapeared.  The lights were not on the wall or on the ceiling, they were floating in the middle of the room.  Now, there are no open windows in the room, they are all covered with blinds and dark curtains.   So there is absolutely no possible way that they were being reflected from outside.  I also heard a few knocks in the door, but my boyfriend says he did not hear the knocks.  After this happened, he ran outside and saw nothing.  My heart rate went up for about a whole hour after this incident and he could not go to sleep.  He described this adrenaline rush the whole night.   Then my cell phone messages were all messed up.  The saved ones: it kept on saying that they were no longer there. But then later it came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time i actually saw something like this in my life, and I think is absolutely fascinating.  I wish it would come back so that I can really figure out what it is. Maybe it will.   I know 2 other people who actually saw the same thing that night , strangers, and the reason I know they werent lying is that they actually were the ones to tell me the date and describe it into details...  If anyone experienced this, please,  I am very interestedin science and the paranormal.  Whatever it may have been, it will bother me for the rest of my life if I dont see it again, because I need to understand things... Also if you know what it could possibly be, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The road I was on headed straight towards the light that seemed fixed in the sky and as I kept driving (about 15 seconds or so) I realized that the light was no longer on then horizon, but now in my local area not more that a hundred yards in front of me and had transitioned from a yellow/golden light to a what appeared as a physical object with lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued forward I noticed a blue blinking light similar to an airplane, yet the object was completely stationary in the sky (so much so that I thought it may have been the lights on a radio tower, but I knew there were no radio towers in this area.)  I ended up driving almost directly under it and noticed there were more lights. I noticed about 5-8 different lights of different colors. They where blinking in unfamiliar patterns, not the standard, regular, repetitive way an airplane’s lights normal blink, but they seem to blink faster with irregularity much more swirly and flashy than standard airplane lights (like an artistic light show). I was only under it for a second or 2, but noticed that the lights were circular and had a wavy character as if it were passing through a waving liquid media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not that high up, only about as high as a 20 story building and was absolutely fixed in the sky. It was dark out and the object appeared to be black and in the shape of a triangle and about as long as a city bus. I passed the object and could not view it anymore as it was a behind me. I stopped my car a minute or 2 later to look and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I saw it in the distance on the horizon until I drove under it was about 30-45 seconds. I thought that this may have been a helicopter, but it had no psychical similarities to one and I drove almost directly under it and heard no sound.<n>

The object also outshined every star in the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a star until I noticed that it was slowly drifting. Questioning what I am seeing I compared it to other nearby stars, but the object not only outshined the all the stars in the sky, it was also the largest in sight. The object was glowing like a star, but the color was different. The object was located near the horizon. The morning glare near the horizon blocked out all the stars near it exept for the object. That led me to believe that whatever this thing is, its not a star because the morning glare would of blocked it out. Immediately I ran into my room, picked up the camera, ran back outside and recorded the object on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the rate the object was moving, it would of taken more than a couple of hours for it to leave my range of sight. I repeatedly watched the footage for the past three months trying to find a reasonable explination only to be left with questions. I also tried to recreate the incident at a later date using the largest and brightest star in the sky. I was unable to duplicate the incident because the star was obviously stationary. So finally, I decided to report the incident.<n>

I saw a solid white light traveling from the south (behind me) to north then disappearing. This took no longer than 2 minutes. There was a jet (commercial plane) flying from east to west. The jet took ten about minutes to travel the distance that the light did. I saw the flashing lights on the jet like normal. I did not see any flashing lights on the other (solid white light) just one solid light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

My good friend sitting to my right in the back seat of the jeep (My other two friends were in the driver and passenger seats) had pointed out seeing a light in the sky doing some strange things. We all watched the light for a minute or two and after seeing that it was moving in a pretty regular pattern to the south we passed it off as a plane. As my other three friends continued to talk I continued to watch this light, I noticed that it was an oval shaped light and had changed direction, it was now moving exactly on the same path, but in a different direction, then it stopped... moved vertically upward... stopped... moved in a diagonal direction, and started moving south again. I had at this point told my friends to take a second look at the light and we were all baffled as it repeated its strange movements, the strangest patterns were the perfectly verticle upward and downward motions of the light, and it was close enough to see that it was not a plane, or a car driving with its headlights on over the mountains. After two or three minutes it settled back downward slowly out of sight to the hills near the Grand Junction Airport. With 4 whitnesses as equally sane as I am I cannot begin to explain this light. But we were all very shaken and disturbed for the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

THE 2 CRAFTS HOVERED IN THE VACANT FIELD AS IF IT THEY WERE MEETING ONE ANOTHER.  THE 2 CRAFT WERE EXACTLY THE SAME IN APPEARANCE.  THE 3RD CRAFT ACTUALLY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A CRAFT BECAUSE IT WAS AN ORANGISH BALL OF LIGHT.  THIS 3RD ONE WAS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE OTHER 2 WAITING CRAFTS FROM ABOVE IN A TYPE OF SWOOP OR SWISHING MOTION.

I called for my husband to come outside to see it and he caught a quick glimpse too.  It didn&#39;t make any sound that I could hear and was out of sight in seconds.  Because of the extremely fast speed, I am sure it was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am a long-time employee at a local university and wish I had an explanation of what I saw since it was a very unusual experience!<n>

I tried calling news stations, but lines were busy. Channel 6 News helicopter is flying over the area right now. It&#39;s kind of wierd because we heard a loud explosion, the lights moved and did their thing, and then they fell crashing down. You would think that the explosion noise would have followed all of this??? The police are looking in fields and in homes with flashlights and they originally thought a plane crashed, but they can&#39;t find a plane?

My wife and I live between Noblesville and Lapel, we have left the house to go to work at 10:00 pm. as we pulled out of our driveway onto 186th street we notice what to be an object with several different color lights to the North West. Within 30 seconds we saw what appeared to be five to seven yellowish lights appear to the left of the first object in a V shape and shortly there after another group of yellowish lights appeared just below with the same V shape. We stopped the car and rolled down the windows we heard nothing, no sound at all. These lights we stationary and not moving, we watched for about 2 to 3 minutes then noticed the first object disappear and shortly there after the two V shapes were gone, just disappeared. There was no sound and no other type of flashes that would be associated with an explosion. We did not see any trailing streaks as has been reported by others. A short while later my wife did say that she had seen a falling star with a trailing light behind it. We don&#39;t know what it was that we saw, but we do know that it was not a jet liner as our house sits in the flight path of Indianapolis International Airport in which we see jets preparing to land every night. This is really strange and we agree that we will never know what we saw Wednesday night for sure. The Military and government has a long history of covering up the real truth, thinking Americans cannot handle the truth thus causing panic among the population.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was pretty far away. It seemed to hover some and move to the left and right some. We also saw a red light separate from the blue that was smaller and dimmer, but stayed close to the blue lights. It was not always visible. We went up a block from home for better visibility with a telescope (not a high powered one). Thru the telescope we saw that there were actually three blue flashing lights on one craft shaped like a triangle. We could not make out the definite shape of the craft due to the distance. It must have been turning while it hovered because the lights were not always in the same position. We watched it for about ten minutes and went inside, checking on it every five minutes or so. By about 22:30 or 22:40, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work as an engineering intern at an AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING FACILITY.  I know aircrafts very well, both experimental and common.  So as I was driving home, I looked up to the North West and saw a light approaching very low over the highway.  There was an airport close, so I assumed it was a 1 or 2 engine plane coming in for a landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up again, and prepared myself for a huge blast of noise (this is how close it was).  When I looked up a second time, a triangular object with three white lights at each point hovered silently over the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is no plane, as I&#39;ve said before, my education is in engineering, as well as working specifically in aero-engineering field.  I am not dumb, and I know what I know. I looked up a third time and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw cannot be identifiable by anyone on earth, and by my good understanding of physics, broke many physical laws that we could not even begin to comprehend.  I&#39;m not saying it was an alien, I&#39;m just saying that I could not identify it, and I believe most on this world couldn&#39;t.  I mean, an object of this shape could not create lift unless moving at a very fast speed, and if it did create lift by using a propulsion system from underneath, how could it move side to side efficiently?  I mean, the harrier jump jets work similarly, but being that close, or anywhere near that close, i would have felt the vibrations and heard the huge roar of the engines.<n>

The object was round and the size of the moon, which caught my attention because it was so big.  It was coming down in a N/W downward slant ahead of us.  It was navy blue with gold and red around the outside rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to hear a boom or feel the ground shake because of its size and because it seemed to be so close.  But nothing was in the paper or news.  A few days later I was watching the History Channel and they said many sightings have been found to go into the ocean.  If it didn’t hit land it could have gone into the Pacific Ocean because it was going in that direction.  I don’t know where it went or landed for sure but I do know what I saw and being we were in an area where there are no lights and open fields, nothing to reflect from I knew I saw this object and I had a witness, this is the first sighting I’ve ever experienced seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a minister and my witness is a college student and housewife.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have come out of a cloud, but there were no clouds present. It seemed very close(about cloud height, it was moving very fast, and appeared to be the size of a football stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in San Diego, and the evenings can be a little misty or foggy. The lights of this object seemed to reflect off of the fog making the whole phenomenon a little hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as soon as I got a good look at this phenomenon it appeared to fade back into a cloud, but like I said there were no clouds present. Absolutely no sound was made by the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event only took about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the horizon to horizon evening sky is 180 degrees I estimate the whole phenomenon took about 20 degrees of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have operated commercial sea clam vessels off the Atlantic coast for many years and I have never witnessed anything like this. My house overlooks Atlantic City and I enjoy the views with a set of surplus Russian boarder patrol glasses. I am sure of what I just saw and so is my wife. The speed that this object moved was incredible, my glasses are equiped with range finders and I can tell you that nothing that I know of can move like that. About ten minutes after we sighted the object there was a very large tremor that we experiened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and company deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone.

While on commercial flights I typically follow the flight progress by looking for airports below and trying to figure out our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were flying out of San Diego on a commercial flight on 16 April that departed about 3 pm local time. We were seated a few rows in front of the wing of the MD-80.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes out of San Diego we passed over three very remote airports at an altitude I would estimate as between 12,000 and 15,000 AGL. The area is desert mountains and is very rugged. The last airport I saw was marked &#34;US NAVY&#34; on the approach end of the northwest-facing runway (about 320 degrees). From referring back to aviation sectional maps I believe we were just south of El Centro, AZ, which is located in an area of highly restricted MOAs (Military Operational areas). I have noted that the sectional maps warn that there is a tethered surveillance aerostat (blimp) north of El Centro at between 5,000 and 15,000 ft MSL. What we observed was clearly not a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after we passed over the US Navy landing strip, which was situated between two small mountain ranges we both observed a large, extremely bright and shiny metallic cylindrical object below us, on the opposite side of the eastern range about 20 miles from the airfield. The cylinder was oriented north/south. Based on its relative size, I initially I assumed it was another commercial jet traveling about 2 miles to the north of our track and a few thousand feet below us, but I could see no wings or tail or markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our jet flew eastward we observed the ground gradually disappear beneath our wing and as the Navy landing strip disappeared we noted that the metallic cylinder was not moving away from us but was nearly keeping pace with our aircraft, although we were moving slightly faster. What was most interesting was that the cylinder was oriented perpendicular to us but traveling parallel to us. The craft did not move northward; it was flying perpendicular to how a normal aircraft would move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Realizing that this was highly unusual, I now spent some time trying to calculate the size and distance of the craft, based on my experience with visual cues at altitude. Based on the ground detail and runway appearance, I would guess that we were at 15,000 ft AGL. By comparing the observable detail on the cylinder, which consisted of two parallel lines running almost the full length of the craft as well as some slight variations of surface texture on the highly polished surface, I would guess that the craft was three to four hundred feet in length and traveling eastward at about 7,000 AGL. The craft continued to travel in an eastward direction, running parallel with our jet, until it disappeared from view beneath our wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear blue without a cloud in sight.  Noticing what I thought to be a commercial airliner I focused my sight to see what type of plane it was.  As I steadied my gaze I realized the object wasn&#39;t moving but rather hovering, and as I looked closed there seemed to be not distinctive edges to the craft.  I alerted my fellow passengers in the car in the car just so I didn&#39;t think my eyes were playing tricks on me.  As I looked closer the color of the craft appeared to be a white to faded chrome like color.  The strangest part of the whole sighting though was that, as the other passengers int the car started to take more of a notice to the ship, it began to move very fast in a parallel direction with us.  It was an unexplainable speed which I have never seen before in any man made vehicle.  Then without inclining or declining it just disappeared.  I&#39;m still dumbfounded as to what it could of been, I am much more intrigued into what it could of been....if anyone can help me with this post a response to it somehow on this site.

As soon as I looked again for it, it would disappear.  I thought it was a plane, but noticed it again and it was in the same spot. Then it kept flashing (flipping) as the sun reflected on it. The flashes would last a slight second and disappear again. It looked like a small silver line. Then I noticed a second one nearby. Made it to work and told some co-workers. They said they saw the same flashes, but as they went to look directly at it, it was gone.<n>

I had just stopped in Augusta to get gas  at least 15 minutes before. I saw deer and put on my high beams in order to spot them in the road. After driving 15 minutes I saw a triangular shape on the opposite side of the road facing me. It flashed its lights (which were under the aircraft) and then it was darkness for about 2 seconds. Then it flashed its lights again and I got a clearer look at it. The Aircraft was hovering over the tree on the opposite side and it seemed to standing still. The aircraft appeared to be very high tech and it made no noise as I passed. I didn&#39;t fear at all I just kept driving but I knew it was not from here.<n>

It was one solid object because the individual lights were perfectly aligned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It leveled itself out and just kind of hovered for about 20 seconds or so.  While all this was happening the lights on the object were rotating counter-clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then took back off up toward the sky and so fast... it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 20 miles from where this happened.  I was just far enough to know that it wasn&#39;t a bunch of little objects.  It was not a flare.  We would have never been able to see a F16 from there esp. in the night.  We could tell it was one big object with about 15 to 25 lights.  I would imagine that if you were anywhere close to the site like 5 miles or so it would look like a fireball, but it wasn&#39;t we were had a perfect look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we got out camera phones loaded up the thing was long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the local news talked about sending heli&#39;s up to the scene, but I didn&#39;t see any of them headed that way. They also said it was F16&#39;s last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning they said it was meteor showers. Now they are saying it was F16&#39;s.  F16&#39;s are not allowed to break the sound barrier and why would they do a training mission around a residential area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things are not adding up. I am the biggest sceptic of them all... and after last night I don&#39;t think  I will look at the sky the same anymore.   What we witnessed last night was no man made aircraft!!!

We camped that night in a remote, isloated area south of the crater (38-22.281N, 116-01.821W).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was brisk and uneventful, after a short recon hike and a light supper we retired. Around 0230 I felt an unnerving sensation that awakened me.  I felt this pass thru the camper, and myself, as if I were being scanned, accompanying this was a low pulsating sound, a hum that increased and decreased as it passed by and thru.,  As this was happening, I awoke my friend who experienced likewise this event.  Alarmed and cautious, we did not venture out, thinking it might return.  The next morning nothing appeared different, except we both became very irritated, and quit talking, we followed a set of way points to Highway 375, we stopped at Rachel, but were unable to enjoy  what is usually a fun stop.  It took several days for the gloom to lift.   After dicussing this event, we both feel as though a shift in our consciousness occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry for the belated report, it seemed very surreal, but for this to have happened and for two people to suddenly be at odds, when they usually get along very well seems uncharacteristic at the very least.   Also please note the time frames are open I&#39;m not sure how long this event took place--but I am sure it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m about to return to the Death valley area and perhaps NV, maybe  It&#39;ll happen again, who can say.  One thig is certain I most always see stange lights in the skies around area 51.<n>

It was very bright because the moon was out. I shut the door turned around bent over to light my cigarette up, when I looked up I noticed about 150 feet from me in the sky right above the horizon a triangle shaped craft. It looked like it had light bars on each of the sides and each of the three corners had very bright lights on it. It seemed to pulsate a bit and was completely silent. I stared at it for 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finally realized what I was seeing, I ran back inside to grab my phone to take a picture because my camera was on the second floor. I was gone for approximately 20 seconds, when I came back I noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky for it I looked farther into the distance and could see it had moved very far away and much higher. I tried to take a picture buy my phone camera could not pick the object up. I tried to move into the moonlight but it still did not help. The pictures on my phone just seem to be black skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about another 2-3 minutes as it moved left and right and up and down. I then noticed another object (a plane I assume because I could see flashing lights on it) underneath the object. When, in an instant, it disappeared completely from sight to the south. It seemed to start moving and then it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been living in the same house for almost 6 years now. I am married for 9 years. I work full time and attend school part time. We have no kids, but we do have 4 dogs and 4 cats. I was at home and my mother was asleep upstairs. My husband was at work last night working the graveyard shift. We are a very normal couple. We do believe in other life on other planets because we have seen crafts in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night a very long time ago a triangle shaped craft flew above our house without a sound. My husband and I both witnessed it. When my Dad was alive he witnessed another craft that seemed to come in with a storm and disappear instantly. My husband noticed a craft above our home one night moving erratically in the sky that took off to the north at speeds beyond anything he has ever seen. In the 6 years we have been in our current home we have witnessed at least 4 incidents like this. This one was so close and unbelievable I had to report it!<n>
4/15/08 23:15|Chandler|AZ|Sphere|10-17 seconds|Glowing orange sphere spotted hovering and performing angular flying at various speeds.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62616.html|257|ndxe200804| Glowing orange sphere spotted hovering and performing angular flying at various speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 04/15/2008 I was leaving work at approximately 11:15 P.M. from a restaurant I work at in Chandler Arizona.  As I was waiting outside for my wife to pick me up I noticed a spherical orange glowing ball in the south sky at roughly a 40-degree angle from my position. The sphere appeared to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object was hovering and appeared to be wavy like the surface was hot. The look was similar to magma and distorted like the surface of hot asphalt.  The object did not have what looked like conventional lights on it, but rather the whole object seemed to give off an orange fluorescence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object hovered for about 4-5 seconds approximately 2 miles to the south, it bolted off directly north, passing overhead and stopping about a half mile north of my location.  Again the sphere halted to an immediate stop and hovered.  When directly overhead the object appeared to be about the size of a house (1,500 square feet) the object at this point was at about a 120-degree angle.  The object traveled that distance in about 2 seconds.  The object then sped off at a 90-degree angle and immediately stopped again.  The object would not slow down and come to a stop, but rather come to an instant stop.  While accelerating the object would maintain a constant velocity and achieve its maximum speed at the instant of its movement from a stop.  After hovering in its location, the object bolted off to the N-NW in an upward 45-degree angle, disappearing from sight in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object while in motion about 5,000 feet high was traveling a speed of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 MPH.  When the object sped off into the sky the final time, its speed was at least 4 times faster then its previous speeds.  The whole sighting lasted about 10-17 seconds.<n>

After being on the road for a couple of hours, it was now getting late and we were really not near any cities.  I could tell it was rural-ish area because there weren&#39;t a lot of exits, or even really hardly any street lights for the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, this HUGE, extremely bright, neon-green object HURLED across the dark sky.  It practically lit the sky up it was very bright, almost fiery looking, and I almost drove off the road.  It was going so fast I thought something was going to crash down the road ahead of me, as it was going in the same direction as me.  I was thinking and trying to figure out what it was, and I thought maybe it was a meteor, because I had seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor shower wasn&#39;t green, wasn&#39;t fast, and it was no where near this bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend and we didn&#39;t really know what to do, so I wound up doing nothing, but after 15 or so minutes I saw a bright green light ahead on the highway and it really scared/excited me because I thought wow, maybe something really did crash, but it turned out to be the lights from some Georgia/Mexican/kiddie-park type place&#39;s exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *shrug  I hope someone can tell me what that thing was someday!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4/15/08 21:30|Cary|NC|Unknown|5 Minutes|Stationary Light Flashing Erratically, and Low Flying Object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD))|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62595.html|259|ndxe200804| Stationary Light Flashing Erratically, and Low Flying Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> A stationary strobe of bluish light was observed roughly 10 miles southwest of RDU Airport at 9:39PM EST. Two minutes of video has been recorded on a cell phone showing a stationary and erratically flashing bluish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:40 a small blue light seemed to approach the flashing object from below and roughly east. At this point the larger stationary light ceases flashing and is replaced by a dim blue light at a constant brightness, and begins to travel roughly west, and away (and out of my view) from the approaching object – which also changes course, leaving the two lights moving in separate directions, almost simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the first, larger object/light had flight characteristics similar to a helicopter (though no sound was observed). The cell phone footage taken clearly shows the object as being stationary for the better part of two minutes. The footage also shows the light as flashing erratically and alternating between blue and possibly light green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:02PM, a third object was observed. This time a neighbor witnessed. We both agreed that it was large, and didn’t behave or sound like any plane we knew of as it flew very low and very slow with only a very slight humming sound. It was observed in the distance as hovering initially by myself. The neighbor observed it only after it began moving east from roughly the same area as the original lights were observed at 9:39-9:40PM. This object flew approximately 1-2 miles from our vantage point (near highways 55 and 540, and at approximately 1,000 ft. It traveled no faster than 80-100 mph as a rough estimate. We observed this object as having approximately 6-7 lights. A bright yellowish green light in front, three or more red lights around its center, and two flashing blue lights near the rear. It disappeared behind a row of trees after approximately 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the relative proximity to RDU Airport, we agreed that it could possibly have been some sort or plane. But its total lack of sound considering the short distance, and its extremely low airspeed were obvious and unfamiliar to both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No discernible shapes could be made of any of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??

I am familiar with the celestial bodies, this did not fall into that category and was much brighter than the ISS. It almost appeared as if a plane was heading directly in my direction and I was in direct line of its lights (hope that makes sense).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stare at it and noticed that it was barely moving. I looked for the familiar flashing lights normally spotted on planes, they were absent (for the record, my vision is better than 20/20). Then it began to slowly move south at the same time the light began to dim and flicker a bit. Then it moved north and came to a stop, then the light started to grow brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I thought to myself that this might be something a bit more interesting. I ran into the house and asked my husband to come out quick to see and ran back out. It was still in the same spot as before. The light began to move south again and then it disappeared. It hovered over Lake Champlain around the Grand Isle area. I stayed outside for another ten minutes, just in case. But nothing else happened,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed this from my home in St. Albans, Vermont.<n>

The vehicle was illuminated but appearded to be made of glass or was translucent or clear thru...however the back of the craft had two white lights or exhaust type engine ports to the back end.  The vehicle appeared to begin the veer or bank down to the right, which I believed that the craft was going to crash.

I was outside looking at the sky towards the south east and I noticed an object, only one about the size of a planet,like venus or mars at an altitude of about 30,000 feet.  The object was a solid white in color, a glowing appearance and completely still, holding it&#39;s position.  I continued to look directly at it and did not take my eyes off the object.  Then suddenly that white object moved quickly in a short distance then sped with a streak in another short distance then it disappeared in the southern direction.<n>

I TOOK it to be Sirius, as thats what it looked like. From my view point as i neared my home, it was CLEARLY HIGH in the sky ( hovering NO movement) , i focused on it, and just thought, my Sirius is QUITE brilliant tonight! Lost sight thru the trees, and as i rounded the last corner before i get to the house, i looked again and it was gone. As i pulled into the driveway, got out, i looked for Sirius, which was to the FAR RIGHT on the HORIZON. Now my Dad`s house is in line slight to right as i`m driving home on this particular stretch of road, this OBJECT was &#34;&#34;VERY&#34;&#34; High in the sky, and i would approximate it ( object)in my viewpoint to Dad`s house as being just to the LEFT of it and then vertical. I found &#34;&#34;SIRIUS&#34;&#34; it WAS too &#34;&#34;FAR FAR RIGHT&#34;&#34; on the Horizon and VERY LOW at that! , no way i could have mistaken it!!  Height i would approx at 2000 feet.

Each of these lights had a yellowish-oranginsh glow. The lights seemed as if they were traveling at a downward angle from left to right at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. I would guess that they were at an altitude of 1000ft. The light to the far right began to fade but soon reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, they all disappeared. It didn&#39;t seem as if they flew away, but rather dissapeared. At first, I believed this to be the result of cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I stopped the car to get a closer look, we noticed that there were no clouds in that particular area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this was at night, I am confident that there were no clouds in the area of the aircraft.<n>

I was told by her over the phone to go outside and look, because her boyfriend&#39;s knee is injured. I went outside and saw the same thing but they were moving. I eventually made my back into the house and told my friend who was upstairs still. I looked out the window to see if I could see anything, and i saw the four lights combine with the three lights, into what I can only imagine was one massive object, because when they moved close together a bunch more lights popped up around and they all moved together the left and eventually vanished. The Formation moved fairly slowly. My friend had managed to hobble to the window to see the same thing, after he heard me yelling about it. His girlfriend got home and I and she went outside to see if we could see anything more, but nothing was out there. There’s no way it was a plane or orb lightning.

As it moved closer it went farther up.  As it continued heading toward the south east, the bright white light began to dim as it went higher up, the glow changed from white to bright red.  It then disappeared for and one could not find it, but then, it appeared again, but very dim, barely visible, continuing southeast.  The movement was zig zag, there was no noise.

Sheriff’s dispatch logs have reports from Chetek and Cameron at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But Rice Lake airport manager Jerry Stites said he reviewed the survelliance tapes from the airport, which could have recorded activity along Hwy. 53, and found nothing unusual. He did say, however, that the tape showed an aircraft doing touch-and-go landings at the airport from about 9:20-10:35 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The family that reported the incident were all of Chetek. They first saw the object when they were driving northbound on Hwy. 53, taking one of the daughters to her job at Wal-Mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “The oldest daughter said ‘What is that?’”  “I thought it might be some new-fangled helicopter, then it turned on all those lights,” the mother said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the UFO, which was larger than a semi, seemed to come directly to their pickup truck from the area of the airport. She said it hovered above the truck, only about 15-20 feet away. She said there was also a semi and another car on the road, and that the semi was swerving, possibly trying to get a look at what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “It was just the scariest thing” she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the object looked like a “sideways teardrop,” and had blue, green and white lights, and had a purple flashing light at the pointed end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stites said airport runway lights will cause strange sightings, particularly in cloudy or hazy weather, but the mother said the UFO was definitely not a result of airport lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “There were lights on it that were lit. They were on the thing. I don’t know anything that has purple lights on it,” she said. She said the object quickly darted off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “It turned and switched directions so fast,” she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The daughter said she always has a cell phone, with a camera, with her, but that night she was in a hurry and left her phone at home, which she never does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mother said they dropped the oldest duaghter off at Wal-Mart, and that they had another encounter on the way back home. She said the object again launched from the airport and came toward their truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The son said for a bit it looked like the craft landed, and that it had a red laser-like light when it went near the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “It just sat there in midair, about 5 feet off the ground,” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mom said it followed the truck for about 4 miles, then suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said although brightly lit, the object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “It was nothing from this planet,” she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “This is a real sighting. This is the real thing,” she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spooner’s Highway Patrol district had no log entries about UFOs, nor were there any entries in the Polk County sheriff’s log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the Barron County Sheriff’s Department log had an entry at 10:19 that stated “Three officers saw it too. Cameron, Chetek and Vince Graf.” Graf is a county deputy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Cameron police officer was on duty Monday evening. He said he saw something in the air near the intersection of Hwy. 8 and 53. He said it wasn’t unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “What I saw appeared to be a helicopter,” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Medical transport helicopters are based at the Rice Lake airport, but Stites said there was no record of helicopter flights during that time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Chetek’s police log notes that at 10:28 p.m. all units were asked to look for a UFO between Cameron and Rice Lake.

The orbs were completely motionless, but were gone in the matter of a few seconds. I stared at them in confusion for about 2-3 seconds and out of no where, the orb on my right disappeared and immediately after that, the left orb disappeared into nothingness. We both looked at each other in disbelief and excitement and before I knew it, goose bumps covered my body. By the way, neither of us drink nor do drugs (a question our parents asked us after we ran inside and told them what had just happened). I kept driving to the end of the road so we could possibly get a better look and when we reached a clearing, there was nothing. The two orbs were in the west-southwestern part of the sky and appeared to be over the town of Marana, Arizona, but could’ve been further to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It at first looked like a plane, but the object seemed to rotate back and forth.  Its exact shape was hard to make out.  It was not a bird, since it reflected sunlight.  The object moved silently in a random pattern, moving left to right and up and down without any trajectory.  It changed its altitude several times, going from what seemed to be about 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet within 15 seconds, at times coming down to around 5,000 feet.  It hovered high over New York City, and then was out of sight (I was on a bus and could not follow it without getting off).<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/14/08 13:00|plymouth|MN|Sphere|2 seconds|I was watching Tiger Woods win his 3rd green jacket at my friends house when out of the corner of my eye out the patio window I thought|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67151.html|281|ndxe200804| I was watching Tiger Woods win his 3rd green jacket at my friends house when out of the corner of my eye out the patio window I thought I saw a hot air baloon in the blue sky, I immediately looked again because the darn thing did not have a basket un derneath and it took off really fast east on co rd. 42. It was a sphere copper in color it was divided into two halfs and the top half was divided in two also with the top right corner a darker red then the rest.I couldnt believe what I saw but told my friends abouted and they said I was nuts. Well three years later I was searching ancient ufo art online  when I came across a painting from the french book &#34;The book of morals&#34;. The painting shows a person in a long cone hat giving seeds to two farmers and in the sky a sphere the exact thing I saw in 2003.This painting was done in the year 1338. Now I swear I never saw that painting before my encounter yet the spheres are identical, what are the chances? Divided into two halfs and the top divided in two and the same color and size.I think I now have some sort of proof that it was not my imagination. The thing must have appeared in view of the patio window and not just a fly by or I would not have seen it. It went east at lighting speed from a dead stop and it was about 2/3 the size of a hot air baloon 100 yards above ground over Plymouth, Minnesota south west corner of hwy. 169 and 42th av n. It&#39;s wierd right over a big city 100 yards above a highway. Now I wonder if the guy with the pointy hat in the painting is covering his long skull, because archaeologists have found skulls in Peru with long skulls and they can&#39;t be human.I don&#39;t know what to make of this but it is very weird to see something that somebody painted 665 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/14/08 12:10|McHenry|IL|Changing|One Min.|Orange object moving slowly while oscilating wildly is seen approaching, then changes to a point of light.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62617.html|282|ndxe200804| Orange object moving slowly while oscilating wildly is seen approaching, then changes to a point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04-14-2008,  @12:10:17 pm.  (Derived from the exif data of the first picture.) Approximate location was the City of McHenry, Illinois, the intersection of Routes 31 and Bull Valley road, and traveling South from there, approximately one quarter mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking down my driveway to check my mailbox, I saw what seemed to be a kite or windblown scarf, brilliant orange and darker orange in color, it was slowly moving toward me traveling from North to South very slowly, its size at the time appeared to be no more than maybe four feet in any direction.  I did not observe it intensely because it had a motion as though moving up and down as if tethered by a string from the ground, the speed of the oscillations were approximately three or four cycles per second, the range of motion restrained to about twice it’s physical size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd motion had me ready to grab for my pocket Sony camera that I keep with me,  but still not enough to trigger a reaction to take an image, &#34;no need to waste memory card space,&#34; I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on to check the mail, it had not come yet, when I looked to see where &#34;the Kite&#34; was located, all my internal alarms went off.  The object was now abreast of me, it’s path seemed to be about 200 feet West of me, but I had no reference to gauge it&#39;s actual size, and it was never directly over me, it was clear to me that something strange was happening, the “thing” was rising up while still traveling due South, now directly West of my position, and abreast of me, any sense of its size was now lost, it may have been much larger than my initial estimate. It is worth noting that the bizarre appearance and motion of the Orange object matched nothing in my mental catalog of known objects, it is almost impossible to even describe it accurately because it looked so strange, it had sharp angles and curves and as it was rising in front of me, it&#39;s motions were so fast as to cause it to be a blur as it was close to my position. The motion at this angle were now a horizontal back ! and fort h, as it was rising, same frequency of cycles per second as noted before, about three of four times per second, and still rapidly rising. I did grab my camera, got it turned on, as I lifted it up, the LCD screen was almost completely washed out by the brilliant sunlit sky, I had to approximate the correct direction, the camera is set in bracket mode, it will take a series of three frames, each with a different exposure, one overexposed, one optimized, and one underexposed, usually at least one will be usable, and you can make an HDR image by combining all three together. As I depressed the shutter button, the multi hued Orange “thing”, abruptly faded out within one second, an extremely brilliant strangely hued point source of light popped into view slightly to the south of the orange colored object at the same instant, as the first orange colored one dissolved, the bright light appeared. The distance between the two objects locations was about the size of my fist held at arm’s length. Upon examining the camera images I saw that I did capture the light points but they are quite underwhelming compared to the impact of the actual event. The Sony cameras lens was set to minimum zoom which is 38mm, the average 35mm cameras lens would be 50mm, this means my camera (a Sony DSC T9), was set to a fish eye setting as opposed to a zoomed in setting, this makes the light I saw too small and far away looking to provide images with high detail. The light had an odd purplish blue cast to it a little bit like a welders arc, but strangely different,  to my amazement, this small yet powerfully bright light began immediately moving up and away now traveling Southwest an unknown distance, in just a second, it paused in its apparent movement and ascension, but then engaged in a series of severe and rapid saw tooth type oscillations, occurring within a second, while staying within an imaginary box, the size of which I could not guess due to a lack of references pertaining to size and distance. The small bright light seemed to! have an abundance of energy to burn judging by its erratic and speedy movements. I was taking pictures all the time, the three images are taken in quick succession probably almost occurring within a second, there is a delay of several seconds as the three shots are written to the memory card and then it will take another series of three. The point source light then either dimmed or moved away at an incredibly fast rate, leaving again in a steep vertical climb, with a slight Southwest direction of travel. My initial reaction as it disappeared from sight was that the thing I had just witnessed was very unusual and most likely not caused by any natural phenomenon I am familiar with, the rapid oscillations were so fast that I saw a streaking or elongating effect that happens with fast moving very luminous objects viewed with my naked eye. I would say the after image (The streaking effect.), behind the light source was very noticeable, like rapidly waving a glowing stick of incense in the dark. My impression of what it was is mixed, the first manifestation looked like something solid, but it moved erratically, it seemed to have a physical presence. When the point source of light appeared, it is hard to imagine anything moving so erratically could be moving under intelligent control, the motions were just so extreme. Why would such radical motions be part of its operation or function, it does not make sense. I took pictures, but they are only of use to someone with some computer graphics background, I think someone with some Photoshop skills could overlay some of the pictures and show the trajectory that the object took as it moved away. There are foreground objects (Trees and power lines), in enough of the frames that they could be overlaid to show the differing locations of the light as time elapsed. The digital images do not show any streaking caused by the rapid motion, perhaps because of the bright conditions, the automatic settings most likely would have selected a very fast shutter speed on the camera, or it c! ould be that the object happened to be moving at a slower speed at the moment the frames were taken. The pictures have no value to the casual observer, as far as the wow factor goes. But the testimony I give is honest and true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for myself, I have a limited educational background, but have always been a scientifically minded person and was an Ultra light aircraft pilot, with a good understanding of weather and other natural phenomena. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and am very skeptical of 99% of the UFO videos and images seen there and elsewhere. I enjoy reading and contributing to the Above Top secret forums, especially those topics concerning alleged UFO activities.  The Chad Drone incident was covered there extensively with hundreds of contributors joining together to analyze the data, eventually a consensus was reached that it was a hoax. In short, this object flew over the wrong person, if it was attempting to be stealthy!  I feel that I am very qualified to make an impartial, detailed report detailing the behavior and visual characteristics of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Flickr account has the images here. http://flickr.com/photos/ring0/sets/72157604542071914/ there are 21 images in all. I hereby release them to the public domain, free to use for nonprofit purposes.  They are of very low usefulness for the casual viewer, no craft are seen, only a hard to see point of light in most of them, the last few images show none, but I included all the frames that I took that day. The few people I have shown them to have said that they do not show anything of an interesting nature, and I cannot blame them, but there is enough there to satisfy myself that I was not imagining the incident.<n>

Sometimes they would go into the water.  They would be stationary for about 5 seconds then would disappear and instantly reappear about 10 degrees away from their original position.  It was a sunny day with many clouds and I was the only one who saw it on a sparsely populated public beach.  Then they just disappeared.  After they were gone there were about 6 -12 lenticular clouds in the same vicinity.  In about 5 minutes the lenticular clouds were gone.  It was very exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a Easterly view and a partial view of Lake Erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next building to mine is far enough away that I can get a pretty good view of the sky.  Today was a pretty windy and cold day here in Cleveland, so the waves off the lake are pretty rough.  Since I can hear the waves, I tend to notice the lake more and often look out my window to see how big the white caps are.  At about 10:00 tonight I did just that.  I couldn&#39;t see the waves so well, so I glanced up and saw what I thought were two airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airplanes often approach the city from the lake side, so I didn&#39;t think much of it.  The &#34;Planes&#34; had three lights each, which again didn&#39;t surprise me because I thought i was seeing the two wing tip lights and then a central light under the fuselage.  The lights were blinking rapidly and were more of a strobe fashion.  The lights on the objects were white and red, and I can&#39;t remember what order they were in.  I immedately noticed how close the sets of light were, and thought they might be helicopters, but I didn&#39;t hear any sound.  Just when I thought that, the lights, which were moving in a northwest to south east direction started to rotate around each other in a circular fashion.  The set of three lights in the lead, kind of looped back and circled around the three trailing lights.  Then the three trailing lights took a sharp turn and went north, while the first set of three lights proceeded on it&#39;s southeastern course.  Its fairly overcast here, so when the lights were obscured by clouds, I never saw them again.  At first, i was really scared, because I was still under the impression that these were airplanes.  I thought, oh my god, they must have clipped wings, and the one is circling out of control.  But the lights never lost control, they just went their separate ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I questioned her as to the specifics of the incident while it was still in progress and she informed me of the following observations using my instructions as a guide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her to put her arm out straight and put her thumb up into the air and then sight along her arm, using the thumb as a guide to the size of the objects. She reported that the objects were each as wide as two-thirds of her thumbnail at that distance. The then asked the angle of the objects relative to the perceived horizon, and she reported that they were between twenty and thirty degrees above it, meaning that they were at relatively low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also informed me that the objects appeared to be in the vicinity of, or over, a local park at Sandy Lane (Lat: 50o 57’ 55.7” N / 1o 18’ 11.7” W), a former gravel pit, now grassed over, and that they were maneuvering around in the sky in a smooth motion, with one or more of the objects repeatedly descending smoothly and then ascending. While she watched the objects formed up into an equilateral triangle formation and maintained it until they were lost from sight into low, heavy rain and ice clouds, which had been moving through the area all day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the objects were brilliantly illuminated, seemed to be unaffected by the prevalent meteorological conditions. they did not carry additional lights or changed colors.

My husband went in an got our 2 set&#39;s of binoculars, and gave one to me. It was slowly and I mean slowly moving northwest. We watched it for about 15 minutes, all 5 of us! I got a closeup of it, and it was a bright round white light. When it was out of site, my son&#39;s friend noticed another one about 15 minutes later, north again, same size but this one was flashing. We were surprised. It was like it was flashing on and off for us. It was the size of a bright star. We live in the path of the airport and watched the planes fly all day. These were no planes, and the bright lights were really, really high up. The flashing one we saw headed slowly northwest until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.

Saucer with lights and windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw flashing lights pretty far off in distance.  It was flashing randomly, no type of pattern.  It would flash rapidly or slowly or not even flash for 10-20 seconds at a time, it was very random. I watched it for about 3-4 minutes moving from one place in the sky to another in a back and forth motion.  I ran down stairs to get my camera, which took approximately 30-40 seconds.  By the time I got back it was practically above my head.  Unfortunately I was unable to get video of the object because I froze in shock watching the object.  I did not expect it to be so close.  It was about two to three stories overhead and about two closely neighboring houses down.  It made no sound and for an object that close and as visible as it was, it was unlike anything else.  At this point it hovered slowly in an up and down motion almost like a zigzag.  It was in view for about 30 seconds until it went past my roof and above the house.  The flashing light was in the middle of the metallic like object. I saw a saucer in shape and it clearly had dark windows all the way around the side I viewed.  It was not very big. It was less than 20 ft. wide.  I went to the front window of the house to see if it passed by but I saw nothing.  About 45 minutes later I looked out the back window again and saw flashing lights in the opposite side of the sky as before.  This time it was about 5:15am and it was all over the sky.  It moved very quickly and in far distances in a short amount of time, unlike before when it was moving slowly.  Almost like it was having its last of fun before the sun came up.  About 5:30am the sun was rising and the light became more faint just as the stars did.  It was above a tree that has not yet formed leaves so I could see the object as it moved straight down behind this tree and that was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear. As we looked to the north-west, near the Ballard area, we both observed a very large burnt-orange object slightly above the the skyline, about 3 to 4 miles away. The object was glowing and almost looking like a full moon that was on fire. Slightly above and to the north was another light that moved in slow, tight turns very close to the larger object. After about 45 seconds, the object began to change shape, it became more compact, almost as if it was flying away from us, and in less than 10 seconds, it was gone. There was nothing left behind in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After experiencing that, my friend and I tried to think of every option of what it could have been and still cannot come to any conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After posting a bulletin asking if anyone else had seen the object, a friend who lives in the area said he heard a loud &#34;electric/static&#34; sound and flashing orange lights out his window. Although he did not see anything, he says it seems as though a nearby house was on fire and there were lots of emergency vehicles with flashing lights, then suddenly disappeared  and the sound was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It gave off a bright white light, sometimes turning gold, then it would turn red<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled in front of a friends home on Sunday night and was waiting in my car for My friend and his mother to get back from the store. As I sat there I was looking at the stars and noticed That one was unuseky bright considering I have been looking up at the sky almost on a daily basis to hopefully catch an anomoly or the real thing . So anyway I set a maker for a referance point so that I would ve able to tell if it was a star moving along with the oters at the same rate as the earth spins. So I began to notice that at times the star had other colors that would flash as I focused and also noticed that it eas moving behind my referance tree at a little faster rate than the other stars. Well considering those facts I still diddnt realy believe that it actualy was ands then my friend showed up. As he started to unload the groceries I mentioned jokingly that I saw A UFO  and as I tried to locate the brightest star I noticed it was much further behind the tree and all of a sudden there ware neumourous types helicoper and small aircraft flyby&#39;s happening all over the sky coming in from the Edwards AFB behind us and heading in the direction of the bright light. Anyhow as I then began to belive in what I saw. My friend and I began discussing the event and I allowed him to convince me that I just wanted to see one so badly, I saw what my mind wanted and that it wassent anythimg more that. Well by the timr he convinced me the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I opened the sliding glass door in our bedroom because of the nice breeze &amp; temperature outside and noticed what looked like a flickering star but it was flickering purple &amp; green &amp; white.  So I went and got the binoculars and went out on the balcony and sat down in a chair and steadied the binoculars on the railing and saw what I would best describe as an object that was stationary but pulsating different very brightly colored lights, blue, green, purple, white &amp; red - the object looked very much like the body part of a jelly fish without the tentacles.  I watched as it at first looked like a circle with lights all the way around, and then it seemed to tilt on its side and looked like a see-through dome on top.  I watched this for 10 minutes and had my husband look through the binoculars and verify that I wasn&#39;t making this up!  I then called a girlfriend of mine at 12:05 a.m. who lives 2 minutes away and she hopped in her car and came right over.  She also saw the same thing I was seeing, although we did notice that, although appearing to be probably 25,000 to 35,000 ft. in the sky, it looked to be above a mountain in the Sylmar area that has some kind of buildings with lights at the top of it.  But there was no beam of light coming from any of those lights on the mountain to what we were seeing in the sky.  It is now 12:55 a.m. and it is still in the same spot.  It is now almost 1:00 a.m. and it is still there!!!  I will look again tomorrow evening and see if it is up there again, then maybe I will believe it is somehow tied to the lights on the mountain.  If anyone could shed any light on what those buildings are at the top of those mountains perhaps that could narrow this down to a logical explanation.  But I have never in my life seen anything remotely like this up in the sky!!<n>

Me and the 2 other guys I was with shooting pool walked outside to the parking lot but failed to see anything and went back inside. We talked to Randy ( person who called us ) again after going back inside and he said they were more of them apearing and that some of them were hovering in the south. I was so anxious to see this that I jumped on my motorcycle without even paying my bar tab. When I got home I was finally able to see the bright orange balls in the sky. I ran inside to wake the rest of the family up and they too witnessed the orange balls of light. We must have witnessed up to 5 of the objects in the sky at once, sometimes they appeared to be hovering and then would move slowly from the west to the east coast ( cocoa beach florida )up to 20 of them were witnessed. The new ones would come as if someone turned on a light in the sky and once they got far on the east coast out of are atmosphere they apeared to turn light blue almost like a star but continued to fly in mysterious patterns. I called the police to see if there were any other reports of strange orange balls of light in the sky or if the military was testing and they had no answer but yet after talking to my friend Randy that called me he said before I got home from the pub he and his wife and kid witnessed military jets chasing the balls of light. My friend was able to get a couple still frame photos and are in possetion right now. I am really lost for words I have never seen anything like that in my life and I am even a pyrotechnic. Please let me know if you need anymore details, Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Matt<n>

The object looked as if it was floating in a circular motion. It was bright orange in colour and circular in shape with a slight haze to it. I would say it was about magnitude -7 as time went on the object climbed slowly then faded till it was impossible to see. There was rather a lot of high cloud but the moon was visible. It moved I would say south east slightly as it faded. There were no Navigational lights on this object and no sound. Two people witnessed this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first sighting was around 20:00 TO 21:00.  The first time was just after sunset, thought it couldve been the reflection of the sun on an airplane.  The color was bright oarange/red, very strange.  The flight path was odd as it climbed quickly and soon was out of sight.  My wife was witness to this 1st sighting.  The second sighting was the same color, same sort of light and shape.  The light was in the same place as the 1st time, which made me again think it couldve been a plane taking off from Tampa Intl Airport or St. Pete Clearwater, but it was too high to be St Pete Clearwater.  The light again disappeared into the sky.  I am not sure what I saw, but if others saw something thing strange than so be it.  I should also mention that this was in the general direction of Mcdill AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I take a glance outside my front window to see what looks like fireworks about a mile South of my house. As I watch I realize that it wasn&#39;t fireworks, but looks like helicopter hovering above the treeline. As I watch it for a minute or two I realize there are actually 2 of them. I turn to the tv and try to put on the local news channel...thinking there might be somekind of a chase going on or something. But...they really aren&#39;t moving so I think maybe it&#39;s an accident and someone is about to get medivacked&lt;sp&gt;. Then the original light which is a bright yellow/gold in color, changing to an amber color. The object makes a turn and heads to the West...But, it was moving so slow, there is no way a plane can fly that slow. As I am watching it move I now realize there is another hovering above the original one. As i am watching the highest one it completely dissapears. Gone! I now an so intrigued that I go outside to get a better look. When I go outside I realize there is no sound! If it was a chopper I would have clearly heard it...and planes just don&#39;t hover like these did...nor do they fly as slow as the one that moved to the West. The one that moved to the West is still shining the brightest, but after a couple more minutes just dissapears....as does the other one that was hovering just above the treeline. All three objects didn&#39;t have any blinking lights. They all were the same color, just one was brighter than the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I am very skeptical when it comes to this stuff. Untill last night I never saw anything in the sky that had me second guessing like last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my buddy about it. His brother is a Suffolk Cop and asked if anyone called in any weird calls last night. He was blank on the other line for a few minutes. He said are you serious? I said hell yeah...he proceeded to tell me his brother spoke to him before me with some woman claiming that there were strange lights shining into her house and thought there were kids in the tree&#39;s with super bright flashlights!!!  I swear I am not losing my mind, but I certainly have no explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was stroking my cat at the window of my dining room, strange yes but I like animals. I decided to check the skies, literally in the hopes of spotting something like this. I spotted a star, and looked up at it for a while before realising something: it was rather bright considering no other stars were visible, and appeared to be flickering slightly. I looked closer, making out what I think to be the shape of a disc. I looked around to see if there were anymore, to my relief and dissapointment I saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I looked back I glimpsed as another seemed to shoot straight out of it and dissapear in moments. Of course, at this I knew something was awry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It dissapeared for a while, at which I thought I was imagining things. But, it returned, along with another, brighter one flying lower to underneath the other with flashing lights. I disgarded it as a helicopter, thinking maybe all was well. But then they both just dissapeared, like that. I checked again after and they haven&#39;t returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please look into this, the other sighting I had mirrored this pretty well As soon as I spot them they go, almost as if they are watching me. Please, I do not wish to be abducted at all, and my discussions with other believers on the internet may have gotten them interested in me (I intend to uncover it all in a few years time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be greatly assured to know either result.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.My email is genuine, although I do not wish to give you my adress; my whole family already mocks me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced that this is intended as a serious-minded report.

At approx. 8:55 central time we spotted the ISS. Almost instantly below it a light flicked into view and shot across the sky. Shot is not really the correct word. It did not seem very fast. It was very unusual that we saw this possible meteor at the same the ISS came into view. This meteor was also perpendicular to the ISS. Another unusual thing is I thought meteors usually entered the atomsphere from the east heading west. This one entered low from the north heading south. Here is the viewing info for the ISS from the NASA site ISS Sat Apr 12/08:54 PM 2 min 24 degrees max elev 11 degrees approach above NNW 24 above NE This might help to solve this small mystery. My house blocked out most of the mystery lights travel, so I am not sure how far it went. I can tell you from the time it appeared it was steady and not blinking and it traveled straight across the sky, not appearing to change in elevation at all. I guess it is possible for a meteor to enter the atomsphere at an elevation lower than the ISS travels.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was amazed to see what looked like a typical grey alien being in my garden but I also noted the following. It was translucent, like not completely solid. It was taller than most reports of these things.. approx. 5 ft tall.. and it seemed incredibly thin and had a very pointed chin.. more so than what I would class as a typical &#39;grey&#39;. It appeared to be studying plants and from this point on I have no certain recollection of events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t appear interested in me and carried on studying the plants. I have two memories of walking into my house. One is where I walk in and go straight to bed. The other is one of alerting the dogs and making them check outside... which they do not as they don&#39;t want to go (too sleepy). My wife was working till 7am and I was in bed asleep when she arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that the next day, I had no recollection of any of this. In fact it wasn&#39;t until some 20 hrs later that I remembered it. I told my wife as soon as I saw her the following morning when she got in from work (monday am) and she thought I was insane.. for not mentioning it sooner!  The other thing of note was that the following night I wasn&#39;t at all afraid to go out into the dark garage or garden. I never saw any UFO or craft on this night (although I have seen many previously) and I had the distinct impression this thing belonged here and had as much right to be here as I did. I have the sense it came from below the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also point out that I did see a large white light sweep across the sky the following evening as I was walking my dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m confused - and it all appears very dream like and not real now. Anyways - I draw no conclusions - the info is just here for the record.<n>

Whether conditions:partly cloudy. Sighting traveled from north to south along gulf coast line, coming out of thunderclouds into very wide clearing. I stood 1/8th to a quarter a mile away as formation flew to the southeast direction. Its&#39;altitude was 600-1000ft above and flew over singular apartment/hotel six story building. I compared size with building; its&#39; area encompassed entire roof of apartment building. No moving or flapping motions as it flew. This early in morning on saturday I can hear engines from over a mile away. object flew back southeast into clouds passing passing quickly in straight line within ten seconds. What is pronounced is the way the sighting blended with the sky&#39;s physical characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After going outside to investigate, we observed one bright light at what seemed to be a great altitude flashing red, green, and white light and moving in various movements.  At times, it would seem to be still, then it moved in one circular motion, and then reversed course and stopped.  At times, the object&#39;s movement seemed to be slow, and other times rapid jerking motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching that object for approximately ten minutes and trying to get photos and looking through binoculars (it was hard to focus because of the tiny size of the appearance of the object, and its distance), we returned inside of our home.  about twenty minutes later we went outside of the north side of our house and observed another brighter object in the north sky with rapidly flashing red, green, and white light.  We then observed an object in the western sky that was a bright white light moving in short patterns.  To the sky directly above our house we observeda golden bright object, also moving in small movements independently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the back yard on a clear dark night. With my love of astronomy, I always watch the the heavens. I saw what I thought was a US space probe with reflected sunlight. They are easily seen as I used to see many in the late 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s during the early space race. This &#34;light&#34; was moving on a straight projectory from due east to west at an extremely high altitude. Then it turned north and made a complete 360 degree turn  and did this two times. Then a second one appeared on the same projectory and it did the same 360 degree turn once that I could see. These were very tight 360 degree turns. During the second sighting, I called my brother that lives about 6 miles from me and told him that I just saw a UFO. He went out on his back porch as I explained what I was seeing with directions, etc. By the time he got outside, he was not able to see what I had seen. However, a third one appeared on the same projectory which he did see as we remained in contact via cell phone. This one did not make a 360 degree turn as we could see. They had no blinking lights. As far as a sound or noise, I cannot say as the pool pump was running at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object would flash for several seconds then dissapear, then would flash again for several seconds.  This lasted for about 15 minutes while the object traveled through a short span of the sky (comparable to the distance between the shoulders of Orion).  It seemed much slower than a satalite and was definately not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking up at the stars, out in the country with almost no lights around, and there were almost no clouds in the sky.  I saw one star and it appeared slightly redder than the others, so I looked at it wondering if it perhaps was Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well it wasn’t a planet... it was moving at what appeared to be the speed of an airplane.  I looked closer and noticed that it wasn’t flashing any lights as a normal airplane would so I kept looking at it. I decided to look until I couldn’t see it anymore.  It was moving left in the sky, passing the stars, and abruptly it got smaller and smaller until I couldn’t see it anymore. As it got smaller, it also got redder, until it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else I must mention is the fact that when I first noticed what I thought was a star, it wasn’t moving.  I looked at it for about ten seconds, it abruptly started moving for about 20 seconds, then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was maybe 1,000 feet above me straight ahead and it just stopped. Then all at once, about 5 more lights flashed on. It was huge! As soon as I saw it I knew what it was and I started screaming hysterically and crying. I could see the exact saucer shape of it with a smaller half circle light on the top. I got the goosebumps and chills made my turn watched it for like 10 seconds after the turn and then it was gone. It just disappeared and I continued screaming and crying clenched onto my steering wheel.

I heard a plane and glanced up and when I did I saw a very dim object moving not too far from the plane but seemed to be lower than and behind the plane.  It was moving silently and roughly the same speed as the plane and started to veer off in a different direction from the plane and then suddenly disappeared.  It was hard to tell if the object was six or seven round objects flying in formation, or one object that had six or seven discs on it that were either very dim lights or reflective material reflecting ground light.   My friend was the only other person to see it because my co workers were busy talking to one another and by the time they looked up it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These objects were observed with the naked eye. Their initial appearance is a star in the sky; however, I viewed what appeared to be flashing lights which were red, yellow and blue. It appeared in a pattern of blue, yellow, and red. At first, I figured they were helicopters. After viewing these objects evening after evening, I used a low end set of binoculars to view these objects. I viewed serpentine shaped structures moving like a serpent. A program recently played on the history channel &#34;UFO Hunters&#34; played an episode of a video recording of a similar structure filmed by a local resident. One must realize I had never viewed the program until after my observations of two to three months. I have used a method using reference points in regards to the objects which proved to be moving, but not in the traditional sense of UFO&#39;s. I am not for sure if it is an aircraft or living organism. I have reently purchased a telescope and have viewed these objects. These objects are pie shaped which is evenly segmented into an estimated 10+/+ slices. The color is opaque with which has the appearance of electrical flashes and the three light spectrums are viewed. It appears to be spinning. They do not move rapidly across the sky (appearance of yellow stars on first observation, then one can view the three flashing colors if paying attention)), but sometimes move out of the telescope fixed and locked position. I must adjust the telescope fixed and locked settings to re~obtain the object in the viewing lens. This supports the object is moving. The objects can move vertical or horizontal and are there for up to 4 to 6 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is always very active chemtrail activity; however, my chembusters have provided me views of the objects while the skies are complete haze around my vicinity. I am positive what I am seeing is not terrestrial. I have never seen anything like it. I am seeing these objects every time the sky is clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a strong believer of science and have a very technical/technology back round. Something is going on and I would love to understand it all. I am continuing my observations and educating myself on this matter. Also, I am a six year veteran whom maintained air traffic control radar systems for air craft carriers. I spent 4+ years on a nuclear aircraft carrier and have observed many aircraft and how they appear from a distance. The object I viewed was nothing like I have ever<n>

Even though Im a science nut and enjoy reading about the history of UFO&#39;s and seeing all of the photographic and video evidence to back these theories up, Ive always remained a skeptic; Until now. Tonight while I was out side smoking a cigarette I noticed three bright lights slowly hovering and rotating both clockwise and counter-clockwise. The three lights also appeared to form a triangle with three distinct lights as its points with a red, almost laser-like beam, connecting the three lights together as a triangle. As the weird object grew nearer, I noticed it had dim sopts in the bright red lights that were flashing almost as if it were a triple set of eyes looking at you and blinking at you. When the object reached behind my garage it stopped and quickly turned the corner looking directly at me. It must&#39;ve instantly changed color within a fraction of a second and the puipl-like circles flashed very rapidly as if they just took a millon high speed photos, and simply dissapeared. The blinding flashes of light had paralyzed my vision and for about 10 minutes after the incident I was literaly blind. I couldnt see anything at all and all I could hear in the background was my dog barking and my uncle coming outside to see what had happend. He said he saw the bright flashes and didnt know what it was so ran outside to investigate. He did not see anything upon going outside and helped me from my knees to my fett and brought me inside. He wants me to go to the hospital still, but I dont want to let people know what had happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then went down and got my to childern ages 13 and 14, to see this.  We all continued to watch for about 1/2 hr.

What looked like an unusually bright star in between the last 2 stars in the tail of the big dipper that was twice as bright as the other stars stayed fixed and did not move for about 20 seconds. Then it began to slowly move back and forth I thought my eyes were playing games but I judged the realationship between the other stars and this bright object had subtle movment then it smoothly started &#34;sliding&#34; off to the right and quickly got darker at the same time moving east/northeast then it was dark and I could no longer see it, just 10 minutes earlier I saw a Solid white &#34;star&#34; blinking off and on every 5 seconds seen in the northwest sky moving left to right,East did not have the normal red and green lights of a normal aircraft, I thought it could have been a satelite rotating reflecting the light of the sun on it&#39;s solar panels that had set hours earlier.About 5 to 10 minutes after seeing the object in the big dipper 4 F16&#39;s flew out of Luke air force base in the general direction of the object I saw in the big dipper and flew right over my house, they normally do not fly at that time of night and not in loose formation, I live near Luke AFB and have a general idea of thier flights they train pilots and fly in tight formations in gruops of 2 to 4 aircraft.

I began to watch it to see if it moved.   However, without moving, it merely &#39;closed&#39; from my left to right, as if someone holding a flashlight turned away from me.

I went to the window and saw an object with 5 bright lights in a circular formation. The object was about as high as a helicopter would be flying. It was soundless, and it remained still and moved slightly up and down. The object then drifted away at a fast speed and a never moved in straight line, as a plane or some other aircraft would. Approximatley 1 min later I saw an airplane flying in the same vicinity where the object was and head in the same direction. I was very leary about reporting this,  because I really am not sure what I saw, but I know it was not an airplane or any other craft that would be common. I have never seen anything like it and I&#39;m really shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked out of the facility through the front entrance.  It was nighttime, and the moon was shaped like a smile.  I saw clear stars in the sky.  There was one bright light that I thought was a star when I first saw it.  However it was a big star and it was moving.  It actually looked more like it was glowing than twinkling like a normal star.  It was not moving fast or slow, but at medium speed.  No light was blinking on it like I would see on a normal airplane.  As it moved it looked as if it was slightly wiggling from side to side.  It looked as if it was more floating than flying.  The movement of the light seemed very smooth, unlike an airplane that deals with wind resistance.  Even as it moved almost directly above me, it was a big bright light directly facing me the whole time, like the image of a very big or bright star.  Normally when an airplane flies over me, the brightest front light of the plane faces the direction that the plane is moving.  An airplane front light does not continually face me as it passes over me, as it looked with this flying object I saw.  When an airplane passes over me, I usually see some kind of blinking light(s) on its wings and/or underbelly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might have even been bigger than any star I ever saw.  It made no noise as it moved.  As it kept moving, it gradually started dimming, and eventually disappeared, where I saw just a little light before it totally faded into the night sky woodwork.  Keep in mind that this sighting happened all during the course of about seven or eight seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also keep in mind that this was nighttime.  There might have been redwood trees that it went behind, and perhaps this was the reason it disappeared.  There also might have been fog that it disappeared behind.  However immediately after the experience I went to other locations to try and get a different view and angle of the area that I saw the light disappear to see if I could see any stars.  Well, in one of my other views, I saw stars, and there did not appear to be fog in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to return to my sighting location tomorrow during the day to see if some kind of object or redwood trees might have caused the object to disappear from where I was standing at the time of the sighting.  I will get back to you on this sighting after I do this, to judge whether or not I feel the flying object actually disappeared, or merely went behind some kind of object like redwood trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My code name will be ((deleted)), so you will know who I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Truth Teller<n>

The craft appeared to be 2 inches at arm length and a loud, jet type exaust sound was heard.  I noticed a strange array of steady white lights in a triangular shape with a red flashing light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally two additional white lights were centered long ways in front of the first &#34;triangular&#34; set of lights.  The craft appeared to have a long, wide fuselage with small triangular wings. The shape was similar to Boeing or Martin Space Plane.  The craft continued to gain altitude until out of site.<n>

At 9:00 pm, I witnessed a barely detectable object that flew over Texas A&amp;M University at a height normally reserved for military aircraft.  The object was silent, round bodied as large as a jumbo jet, but with strange red lights that seemed to float independently around the fuselage.  The craft was moving slightly faster than an airliner, but again it seemed to float, with no noise and with no normal aircraft lights.  The weird floating red lights where not attached to the aircraft and moved over the aircraft body likes flies.  The craft moved from the south over the college toward the east and the whole flight over the town lasted perhaps 5 to 8 seconds.  In looked like it met up with another object of similar design and then both vanished into the night sky.  It was really strange and I am left completed numbed by the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/10/08 20:44|Greenville|NC|Formation|12-15 seconds|four large greenish hazy lights, in straight line formation, moving very fast, no sound|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62564.html|338|ndxe200804| four large greenish hazy lights, in straight line formation, moving very fast, no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time sighted: 2044 EST, Thursday, April 10, 2008<n> <n><n> Location: Greenville, North Carolina, USA<n> <n><n> Duration of sighting: approximately 12 to 15 seconds<n> <n><n> Sky conditions: Very clear, stars visible and distinct, the moon a one quarter crescent just above the formation, scattered low small thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my patio facing west.  At 2045 by my watch which is one minute faster than the official U.S. time, I observed four lights going from southwest to northeast, from my 11 o&#39;clock to 2 o&#39;clock position, at elevation about one half way between the horizon and directly overhead.  The lights were four abreast at first, top to bottom from my perspective and eqi-distant apart, which I thought was unusual for military aircraft.  If you hold your hand at arms length with your thumb and first finger about three inches apart, that would encompass the formation.  There was only one light per object and they were not blinking.  Each light was maybe three to four times the size of Venus, with a faintly greenish tinge, and appeared not distinct, but slightly hazy like looking through a fog.  They went through about twenty degrees of the sky and then one light dropped back into trail.  After going through another twenty degrees, they disappeared behind a cloud.  They traveled in a straight line.  The entire sighting lasted about twelve seconds.  I expected to hear sounds of jet engines following the lights, but heard nothing.  There was no vapor trail like I observed on other normal aircraft seen later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years, I have done a lot of fishing at night.  I have observed many aircraft flying overhead and have seen many shooting stars.  This was like nothing I have ever seen before and immediately caught my attention.  The unusual formation, speed, and lack of sound were unique.  To cross the sky that quickly, they had to be relatively low but I heard no sound.  If they were too high to be heard, they were going many times faster than other planes I have observed and were extremely large.  It was definitely not the ubiquitous weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our south about thirty miles is Seymour Johnson AFB.  I was stationed there in the mid-60’s and am familiar with military planes.  Their F-15’s often fly over Greenville since their runway has a north-south heading.  They are generally low enough to be heard.  We also see the louder F-18&#39;s out of Virginia Beach.  Most aircraft have red, green, and white lights.  On most airplanes you can usually see blinking lights or rotating strobes and not all lights are visible from every direction.  The four lights I saw were steady and looked the same from a left to right forty degree arc.  Pitt-Greenville Airport is about four miles away to my northwest.  I worked there for three years ending two years ago.  Again I never saw anything like this during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me.  I am sixty-four years old and retired.  I was in the air force four years, worked at Eastern Airlines for twelve, and was in computing for thirty-five years, the last eighteen with a university.  I do not believe in UFO’s, little green men, or alien abductions.  But I will admit that this was like nothing I’ve ever seen before and it was interesting.  I’d like to know what I really saw.<n>
4/10/08 20:30|Denville|NJ|Triangle|10 min.|Black Triangle In Deville NJ|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63071.html|339|ndxe200804| Black Triangle In Deville NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday April 10th. at approximately 8:32 PM Eastern time, I was heading north to northwest past the town’s center on a road that led to a more rural section of town. As I drove past the normal line of trees that eventually led to a slight clearing on the left side of the road, and ultimately revealed a lake, I noticed bright lights in the sky that caught my attention. I was traveling rather slowly as I was in no hurry to get home so when I focused my attention on the lights I was able to pull off to the right without any problem. From this vantage point I was able to witness the object in the sky and it appeared to be quite large, triangular in shape, and black. It had large lights on it’s underside, at least three white and one red. It also had one small blinking light. It hovered over the lake making no sounds discernible from my car. It moved with a pivoting action as it reached the shores of each part of the lake and It moved in the direction of each corner as if it had no designated front. It traveled slowly and at no time did I see it accelerate beyond that constant speed. Motivated by curiosity I decided to go to higher location on another nearby road that overlooked lake. Upon reaching my destination I could no longer see the object. I then returned to the original location where again I witnessed the same aircraft as before. I left when other cars started passing, as there was not enough clearance around my car. An interesting side note: The next afternoon, an incident occurred involving a nearby military arsenal. A piece of hot metal, supposedly shrapnel from an exploding shell, went through the roof of a house in Jefferson, N.J. killing a family cat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I love star gazing and have always been interested in astronomy, outside planets, stars, galaxys etc... Anything abnormal. I want to get to the point. Basically, as i was gazing in Los Osos, on the bay view hights area up 9th st, I saw a bright light, white in color, and brighter than other stars around it moving in strange wiggly patterns, and making quick circular turns for a few split seconds; and then fading strangely and flying down toward San Luis Obispo and the Los Psos valley road area, as this was happening...I pointed it out to my friend, and since we have previously seen a few ufos or unidentified flying objects, not known to us, and making no sounds, we kept paying attention to the area. I was sure she would see it but her eyesight is a little bad in the dusk lighting so she kept looking and then OUT OF NOWHERE the same bright light appeared near where I saw the previous one and did similar motions but then flew straight over us, and started dimming very quickly but flying in strange ways unlike man-made or top secret government equiptment. definetly not of this world.  I got teary eyed and the chills, and a few minutes after this happened, another tiney dim light flying the same way flew up toward cambria and dissapeared after going in a circle (small, VERY FAST ) very CREEPY. We are not alone, I CONCLUDE that tonight, was an amazing spectacle I will never forget. I see this amazing universe is full of LIFE!!<n>
4/10/08 20:00|Dandridge|TN|Light|10 minutes|Light moving over Sevierville|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62921.html|341|ndxe200804| Light moving over Sevierville<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the front porch it was almost dark. I was in Dandridge TN, I live on top of a ridge facing the great Smoky Mountains. I can see 5 counties from my porch. I sit out their every evening and watch the sun set but I have never seen anything like this before. I watched bright light move across the sky. It was over the area of Muddy Creek, north East of Sevierville. The light, which was not blinking, was moving very slowly across the sky, using the Mountains as a reference the light was only a couple of hundred feet off the ground. Our mountains are only 6,000+ feet tall and it was at the base level. When it neared Sevierville the light dimmed and I lost it. this took about five minutes and the distance between when I first saw the light to when it dimmed and I lost it was about 7-8 miles and lasted 5 minutes. About 30 minutes latter I saw it again and it moved from Sevierville back the way it came to muddy creek, going to same speed and at the same elevation. It went back another 6-7 miles then I saw it land. I was able to see the light through the trees as it went behind the ridge. I didn’t see anything else that night. We have a lot of helicopters in the area, I have seen these and this was not helicopter, it was traveling too slow. We have an airport but an airplane cant land like that. Besides it is a very small airport. As far as a helicopter landing, no one with that much money lives in Muddy Creek. I have never seen anything like this before, I watch the evening sky every night, and I can see 5 counties but I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were slightly different in design but looked generally the same. Once the lightning slowed, one of them left in a generally calm fashion. A moment later, the other headed off into the clouds with a very sharp, fast turn. It came close enough to see it pretty well. It had 3 very bright still lights on the bottom and a bright red blinking light on the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/10/08 04:00|Nevada|TX|Unknown|10 min|On April 10 2008 @ about 4am bight lights heading in from the east towards my house.|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62569.html|344|ndxe200804| On April 10 2008 @ about 4am bight lights heading in from the east towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of April 10, 2008 at about 4 am I was awoken by a phone call from my daughter telling me that there was a possible tornado heading straight for my house. I turned on the news to find out this line of rotation expanded over several cities and was coming towards me from the east. At about the time the storm was to hit my house , my satellite went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out the back door to watch and see if I could hear or see anything. It was quiet except for the thunder. As I was watching I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye coming from the west. I thought that it was stupid for a plane to be flying directly into a storm of such great magnitude. Then I saw the flash again only closer. I still could not believe this plane was still heading directly into a possible tornado. I turned to look at the plane and realized immediately there was something not right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned to look at the plane... there was not only one light but a whole line of lights aligned perfectly in a row. I could see them over my tree line.  The lights were very bright and all of them were flashing. I tried to rationalize of what it could be. The lights were too close together to be planes or helicopters flying next to each other. I tried to hear an engine or a propeller and I could not hear anything. I was terrified because I realized it was not several objects ... but one big one and it was getting closer and closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started screaming and was trying to reach my husband by cell phone ...but he would not answer. I started to think he would think I was crazy, so I tried to take a picture with my cell phone. I was shaking too much to time it right. Every time I would take the picture, the lights would be off.  The 4th time I went to take a picture I looked up and froze. I did not realize how close it had gotten. I t was huge. I was screaming at the top of my lungs for anyone to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to rationalize calling 911 ....I did not want  anyone to think I was crazy. Then it had gotten so close that I did not care who thought I was crazy. As I opened the phone to call.....It thundered to the west of me  and it startled me so I turned to look ..and the storm was hitting my property line. I immediately turned back to the east of me and the lights were dropping down below the tree line.  I was scared to death that it had landed...but I could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light flashes seemed to slow down and continue about three more times and then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They just stopped flashing all together. Nothing happened . I have  never been so scared in my entire life. I felt I could not call the police because there was nothing for them to see. It just seemed to vanish. I stayed staring at the tree line and crying for over an hour waiting for the sun to rise enough to assure myself there was nothing there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought I would be the one telling an UFO story.  All I can tell you that what I saw was not anything like I have ever seen. I do  believe what I saw was an UFO. If anybody can prove to me of what I saw was something different...please do. I have not slept very well since this has happened.<n>

Four individuals on a hillside in central WV were present. The sphere was first noticed by one individual and then all four turned their attention to it. The sphere seemed to be high in the sky, but was roughly the size of a pinky nail at arms reach. The sphere could be seen over the top of a far building and moved almost parallel to that line. It however moved slightly up as it traveled towards the northern sky. It continued this course for 3-4 minutes before beginning to climb more. At this point something occurred at ground level diverting all attention there. When attention was returned to the skunk the orb was gone. It could not be explained as to where it might have gone or what it might have been. Certain things such as an individual on the roof of said building have been ruled out though.<n>
4/10/08 01:00|Gray|ME|Light|20 minutes|Encounter with a light form|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96675.html|346|ndxe200804| Encounter with a light form  This happened when I was living in Gray, Maine in the spring of 2008. At the time I really didn’t think of where or how to report it since I thought no one would probably believe it anyway.  But I still think about it quite a bit, so I’d like to share it now on your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 1:00 am and I was getting ready to go to bed. One in the morning is not an unusual time for me to retire.  At the time I lived in an apartment over a garage that was separate from the main house and at the end of a semi-long drive way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My bedroom window faced the driveway.  I had venetian blinds on the window and the window was on the other side of the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, I want to say that I lived a half mile in on a long dead end road.  It was a country setting with no street lights, so when it was dark, it was pretty dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just shut the light out and was getting into bed and I noticed a flashing light coming thru the closed venetian blinds.  This was unusual because at that time of night most people living on this road were in bed including my landlords. They might once in while have people over for an evening, but if they did it was on a weekend, and this was a weeknight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still, my first thought was irritation because I thought they must be doing something outside and I wouldn’t be able to sleep with that light coming in. It had to be a pretty bright light to be coming thru the blinds like it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like living in the city and having a neon sign outside your window that was slowly flashing on and off. I crawled over the bed to the window and peeked thru the blinds just enough to see who was out there without them seeing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The landlord’s house lights were all off.  But there was a light flashing.  Down the driveway and across the road were some tall trees, woods really.  Through the tops of the trees way up high I could see a strange light source.  It was like it was stationary in the sky. And it was so far away I could not believe it was so strong that it could come thru the venetian blinds!  I was fascinated and mesmerized by it.  Another odd thing about it – it had no stream of light attached to it. There was no ‘beam’ of light.  Then it started to change locations.  At one point it was on the road – literally on the surface of the road -- like a giant bright firefly, except it was just a stationary point of light that continued to flash slowly on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My landlords had a canvas structure for a third vehicle that was located to the left of the driveway.  As I watched this light it moved to just the other side of this structure.  But it was so bright that I could see it flash thru the double walls of the canvas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it didn’t create a bean of light like a flashlight would. I just kept watching it. It was so curious.  Then suddenly it appeared right over the window I was looking out of!  It seemed attached to the surface of the garage.  I could see it up close – it was like a self-contained elongated sphere of white energy maybe a foot long.  And even though it was very bright it didn’t hurt my eyes. It was still flashing at the same consistency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it struck me – as I had given my attention to it, it had come to me – it was responding to my watching it.  Then I was scared. All I could think was the next move it would be inside the apartment. I quickly moved away from the blinds and within seconds it was dark again. I was too frightened to sleep after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days after, I felt differently – I felt sad.  I had missed an opportunity. If I had been brave enough I could have gone outside and maybe really connected with whatever form of energy it was.  It’s too bad I reacted out of fear. I’ve often hoped I would see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d love to know if this has happened to others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My boyfriend(22) and I(20) left a beach club around 11:00pm. We were walking home along the beach and we decided to sit down. We were sitting right under a palm tree about 2 feet away from each other facing the island of Cozumel. He told me to look up and see this shooting star. Just a few seconds later he jumps up and says that its coming back in the opposite direction. I immediately jump up and see what is a white glowing, circular object dimming in and out. I couldn’t even catch my breath, I was too shocked. It was just one light/object by itself and it seemed to be way up there with the stars. The object was shooting from star to star quicker than anything I’ve ever seen in the sky. The light then shot off and disappeared very quickly. It came and left 3 different times. I took a minute to try and replay the images in my head when it suddenly shot back into the sky. It repeated to just hover and move across the sky for about 2 minutes. It then disappeared again. I didn’t ever see it again. This experience definitely made me a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the low-right of the Moon, in the North/North-Western sky, a light suddenly came into sight and proceeded to get brighter and brighter. The light was yellow,orange and white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it looked like the lights of an oncoming aircraft heading directly towards us (Eastward), but the light, at its brightest point, suddenly moved in a Northern direction at a very high rate of speed and eventually faded out of sight. It&#39;s as if it just appeared out of thin air and shot off. Quite amazing! The whole thing took place in about 20 seconds.<n>

While looking up at the sky,I thought I was looking at a white plastic garbage bag initially blowing in the atmosphere by the way it was moving and responding to the wind. As I watched it for a few minutes I came to realize it couldn&#39;t be a plastic bag because it was moving  slowly and with intention to the East and bags just didn&#39;t move this way. It was shaped similar to a boomarang, white/silvery in color. When it first came into view it seemed to be about 2-300ft high and almost cruising. I starred at it for about 2-3 minutes before I ran into the house to get my mother, we came back out and was able to locate it immediately. By this time it had moved slightly farthur to the east and upward. It had to be about what I consider 6-700 feet high at this time. The white/silvery color stood out against the clear blue background of the sky. And was no longer heading east, but straight up. It got to a really high altitude and kind of came to a stand still for a period of about 4 minutes then increased in speed really fast and shot out of eye sight for a while. My mother and I screamed and jumped up and down, we couldn&#39;t believe what we just saw. Eventually after about 5 minutes she went back into the house, I stayed outside hoping to see it again. About 5 more miutes went by and I kept scanning the area, I saw it and another reappear much farthur to the east, but not as high. They continued to travel southeast in a pair until they went out of my view. It took about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2-3 minutes after they disappeared I noticed 2 fighter jets hauling butt in the direction in which they were traveling. I assume they were trying to track them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m located in the Mission Hills, and noticed a very loud noise, assuming it to be an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it did not fly over as usual, and considering we have no airport I was perplexed. I looked out the window and assumed that it was a helicopter of some sort. However, the flight pattern and speed was unlike any helicopter, and I fail to understand why a helicopter would be in near barren hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft made several rounds, rather than concentrating a search if it was for a search, and upon closer direct inspection it had no helicopter blades and thus was not a helicopter. However, it did have the ability to levitate. The craft was in sight for around 20 minutes, circling around a few times and eventually leaving. I do have some video off of my camera phone that I can provide. If you could provide an explanation, it would be appreciated, but as far as I am concerned, I cannot explain what I saw. This occurred at about 12:30am tonight in Fremont. There was two bright lights, one on front and back, and a bluish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

The light flashed 3 times with 3 seconds separting each flash, and then it stopped.  There was no sound, and no other lights.  It was extremely high up in the sky.  The only thing visible, was the flashing light.  There were no clouds and no jet in the vicinity.

Out of curiosity i ran to my window, opened the blinds and to my surprise i did not see a helicopter overhead but a brightly lit, isosceles triangular shaped craft &#34;floating&#34; at about a speed of  15 mph directly above me.  The craft was not completely a full triangle, the base was cut out resembling an arrow or a chevron. The lights were vividly bright colors of blue and red, racing at a moderate speed around the full perimeter of craft. Standing there in amazement, I called for my mother and my younger brother, by the time they reached my room the craft was only approximately 100 yards away. Together we watched it barely graze the tree line. I then got my camera and went outside, the craft returned several times. I have two recordings of the sighting one 45 seconds and the other 1 minute and 30 seconds. It was very quite, and moved as if it was literally floating. The object appeared to be round in the sky, my conclusion is because the lights race around it giving it the illusion of a disc. After about 7 minutes the craft vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking over the roof of our house I saw a lime green bar of light stationary in the evening sky.  It was about five feet long and hung silently.   I stopped and starred at the light for about half a minute and then became paranoid.   Got a feeling I was being watched by someone or something.  I darted behind the house so I would be out of view.  Thoughts of what should I do came to mind.  So I walked down to the corner of the house and peeked around to see if the light was still there.  It still hung there in the sky in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dropped the bag of trash off at the can and ran back around the backside of house.  When I got back to the side door, I asked my wife to come outside and take a look.  I went around to the front of the house and light was going.<n>

I decided to get out of the car to takr a better look, I thought it had to be some kind of baloon for advertising or somthing when I got out it started moving not in a motion like a plane but up and down in the same place, then it rotated and just bliked out like you turned out a light. I have never seen anything like this before and am quite disturbed, I hope it is somthing military or some kind of projected image.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was pretty clear out and just a few wispy clouds. My wife stepped inside for a moment and I called her out to take a look at something kinda of strange. I first thought it was a flock of pelicans flying in v formation but then as it came more into view it was to wide to be birds. It looked like a wide boomerang like the stealth plane ,but it made no noise at all and had no lights what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it from the back yard around the side of my house and then out front where it finally passed behind some clouds and we lost sight of it. At first it looked really low almost at helicopter hight and if it was at that  level it would have been the size of 2 buses but when it passed behind the clouds I knew that it was much higher because not to much later a small Cessna flew below the clouds and was much higher than I had first perceived. If this was at a high altitude it would have been huge.   I would love to know if someone else in my area saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were fairly close together and at first I thought it was a commercial jet on high approach to Pittsburgh Airport, but it was not heading in the usual NE to SW direction. It reminded me of a satellite because at one point the lights were jumping slightly out of the path of the object as if it might be rotating, but the distance they traveled sideways was more than 4 times the distance between them (there appeared only a slight separation)as if it might be a larger object and the lights were simply moving from one side to the other in a sideways direction. I could not see any outline, however. As I watched, the lights made a slow wide arc of about 90 degrees to the west and disappeared over some trees to the west. They were in view for quite some time through the trees and my impression was that the object was either moving very slowly or was very high. It was almost like it was floating or gliding and there was no sound coming from its direction at any time. The night was clear and the visibility was good. I had expected a green starboard wing light, but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have always enjoyed the night sky and as I looked up I realized there was cloud cover.  The clouds were heavy with moisture similar to dense fog.  I began to scan the sky to see if there was a break in clouds when, from the south, an object came into view. It appeared to be low flying and it was silent. I live in a very small town and the nights are always quiet.  The object had a basic triangular shape and at what I assume to be the front of the object was a white triangle, behind this triangle and out an equal distance to the left and right were white rectangles and behind them were two more  white rectangles.  To give you an idea of the brightness of these shapes I would compare them to typical white paper for printing against a backdrop of dirty white.  They were not bright but definitely noticeable.  The object flew over my house in a northwest direction. I ran to the backyard hoping to see it flying away but I didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in three weeks that I have seen something unidentifiable come from the south and fly toward the northwest.  The first time it was a beautiful clear night with a temperature of about 40f.  The object was the same shape as previously described but instead of a solid white color there were bright white lights at each corner of the triangle and rectangles. It was as if the object was trying to blend in with its surroundings.  Another difference between the two was the speed. This time the object came from the south extremely quick, slowed down, changed direction and flew away even quicker than it appeared. It was in sight no more than four seconds.<n>

Would Turn Into A Night I Will Never Be Able To Forget!!!|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62977.html|372|ndxe200804| Who Would Have Thought Looking At The Stars... Would Turn Into A Night I Will Never Be Able To Forget!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in the sky yesterday night to say there weren&#39;t very many stars out.. The sky is very clear usually. When i looked up i happened to notice this very bright light.. It was a little bigger then the regular size of star. I asked my boyfriend what  it was, because i have never seen anything move that fast. For a second i thought it was a shooting star, it was NO SHOOTING STAR! He thought at first that it was a airplane but there was no blinking lights or anything to show it was a airplane..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides it was doing triple speed of a airplane. We were on the way to Store to pick up cigarettes for a friend.. After i noticed it it began moving faster and staying above us.. When we stopped to look up at time i stopped in one spot and looked like it was hovering over us. Then when we started to walk it moves again which ever direction we moved it would hover above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked very fast back to our friends house. My Boyfriend told his two friends to look.. When we got back out side it finlly moved from above the house almost and was going the opposite direction from where i first noticed it. Not even two minutes we were all looking at it, it then disspeared into the sky. I sat inside my friends house, scared out of mind. I didn&#39;t know what to do!! I never believed in other life forms or anything.. I don&#39;t believe in ghosts and i am not supersicious. After about half a hour we went back outside to go get my friend her cigarettes for the second time. We weren&#39;t more then half way there and i had seen these three bright stars in the sky.. I told my boyfriend again about something in the sky. There were 3 perfectly spaced apart bright lights, that weren&#39;t there before when we were outside.. I couldn&#39;t have been mistaken either because.. Like i had said before there weren&#39;t very many stars out and i am very observant. I didn&#39;t really think anything of it then i realized if it was o&#39;rein&#39;s belt or anything i wouldn&#39;t know because i was never into that kinda of stuff in school. i can honestl! y say i  have never seen that low to the ground stars before. But the fact it wasn&#39;t there before really didn&#39;t honestly scare me.. Considering what we just had seen not even a hour prior to that. We decided to go back again.. To scared to even walk our 5 minute walk to grab cigarettes... We got back inside and told my boyfriends two friends to come see this for themselves.. My boyfriends one friend is very smart when it come to stuff like this so we had asked him about it. The odd thing was the lights weren&#39;t the same color when we got out side they were an almost a green color as silly as that sounds.. After a few minutes they kept like moving a bit.. Almost like doing a VERY slow circular motion. Not even 5 minutes after that they faded away completely. My friends that were in the house came out and they thought we crazy because they didn&#39;t see anything.. They kept making jokes and thinking we were crazy.. But four of us had seen these objects.. And i can&#39;t even explain to people how scared and how weird that was. I used to hear stories about people seeing flying saucers and thinking they were crazy and it was like a myth.. But i can honestly say, i never thought i would have saw anything like that in a million years. I was also talking to my boyfriend on the phone today and he had told me he was talking to his friend.. And his friend also had said that last night he had seen these weird bright lights in the sky. I have nothing else really to say besides the fact i never want to experience something like that again for as long as i live.. I really hope this is helpful!<n>

My first instinct told me it was a comet or something similar, based mostly on the fact that it seemed to be too far away to be in the atmosphere.  It also appeared to have fiery red tail at this time, although what I saw as a tail may have just been my eyes blurring the image trying to maintain focus as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or so of seeing the red object to the south, I see what first appears to be a very bright star, with a bluish white color, directly to the west of me.  When I noticed that the light from the bluish white object appeared to be flickering slightly, I moved to a place in the road where neither of the objects would be obscured by trees.  After getting a clear perspective, I saw that the bluish white object was still flickering slightly, and was moving slowly to the south, then began to slowly bobb back and forth (south to north) as well as up and down, and I turned my attention back to the red object, which was now to the southwest of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now able to see both objects simultaneously from the aforementioned perspective, they both seem to be much closer than they had when I was looking at them separately.  When viewed seperately they appeared to be at least two hundred miles away, if not much farther.  When I had them in a single visual frame, they appeared to be be between 50 and 100 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the red object reaches the point to the southwest of me, it appears to begin moving north, which makes me think it may have been making a wide clockwise circle, starting from the south, and ending in the west, almost directly above the bluish white object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With both objects to the west of me, the bluish white object appears to be maybe 5 - 20 miles high, with the red object about 10 - 40 miles above it, and they still seem to be 50 - 100 miles away from me.  After coming almost directly above the bluish white object, the red object starts descending towards the bluish white object, without pausing or altering it&#39;s speed.  The bluish white object then appeared to ascend up towards the red object, although much slower than the red object descended  I would have dismissed the bluish white object as a plane or helicopter after seeing it move, but it seemed to be much too high for a helicopter, and seemed to be moving far too slowly to be a non-harrier airplane.  After coming to the realization that these two objects were not inanimate, and were moving towards one another, my vision began to shake slightly as I strained to comprehend what I was seeing. When the red object seemed to be no more than 5 - 10 miles above the bluish white object, both objects stopped moving suddenly and quite simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I became completly amazed at what I was seeing.  Both of the objects were staying far too still to just be moving directly towards or away from me.  As astonished as I was by then I really can&#39;t remember how long both objects stayed perfectly still, but it was at least 30 seconds, if not 4 or 5 minutes.  I was outside maybe 5 - 10 minutes total during the aforementioned sightings, and when I went back inside I believe the objects were still motionless in the same positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back outside about 30 - 50 minutes later, and the objects appeared to be in about the same place, and shortly thereafter the red object started ascending away from the bluish white object.  After reaching its original altitude if not a higher one, it started moving to the east, being almost direcltly over me at one point, but still about 10 miles to the north of me.  It was moving extremely fast, and I heard a &#34;sonic boom&#34; about 20 seconds behind it.  When it passed above me it seemed to be at an altitude of 5 - 10 miles.  With the red object much closer than it had previously been, I could tell that it had 2 red lights opposite one another, which did not flash or flicker.  There was a yellow light directly in between the two red lights that was flashing on and off, every second or so. There was a second yellow light directly in front of the first, which did not flash or flicker.  I couldn&#39;t see anything of the craft except for the lights, which appeared to be (based on a normal airplane frame) posiitoned on the wings (red lights), one on or near the underside of the nose (steady yellow light) and on the underside of the craft directly in between the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned my attention back to the bluish white object, which now appeared to be moving north again, to where I first saw it.  The bluish white object stayed in the same area flickering, and I went inside after watching the bluish white object stay in the same place for a few minutes, and noted that the red object still seemed to be moving very quickly in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside at approximately 10:30 pm (cst) and didn&#39;t go back outside that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My overall feelings from the event are that the red object may very well have been a  military aircraft, as the pattern of lights was fairly normal, and the sound of the sonic boom seemed similar to other sonic booms I&#39;ve heard that weren&#39;t associated with an unusual sighting.  I don&#39;t know much about aircraft, but if the red object was a man made craft, it had to be some type of harrier, as it definitely stayed perfectly still for no less than 30 seconds, at an altitude of no less than 30,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I didn&#39;t get as close of a look at the bluish white object, I really can&#39;t speculate as to what it was, but it stayed in the same area, moving no more than 35 degrees from a given perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Neither was mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out of my house to fix my solar lights which I just bought from Home Depot that morning, andlike every other evening, I would glance at the stars and watch the constellation. I looked up towards the Big Dipper and I saw this huge V-shaped object, almost like a wing with black and green color. It wasnt brightly lighted but theres some glowing green light along the edge. I thought it was a glider but it was late at night and the object was so huge and was gliding so low that I can see it vividly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a Stealth bomber but military planes dont fly as low as 30-50 feet from the neighborhood&#39;s rooftop, it would be dangerous and illegal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lowest Stealth bomber I saw was in Pasadena during the Rose Parade, and it created a sound 20 minutes after it passes you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was just very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for almost 8 minutes until my roof covered the view. It has no sound,  was gliding very slow towards the NorthEast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont want it to be a UFO, but what else can it be? Theres no airport in my area nor an airforce base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Registered Nurse. My brother is a pilot. I asked him if he had seen a plane like this that flies so low before and he has not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there. I told my story. Wether you believe it or not, its not my problem!<n>

It was Monday evening, I was outside my house fixing my solar lights and by chance looked up the sky to watch the stars. I was staring towards the Big Dipper when I saw this huge V-shaped space craft, gliding silently about 30 to 50feet from my roof top. At first I thought it was jsut a glider but I realized that it was late at night and the object was so huge and so close.I thought maybe it was a stealth bomber but I saw a stealth bomber before and it is not even close to that. It has green lights, made no sounds nd was just gliding silently. It even resembles a wing of a dragon, green and black.It was very vivid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for almost 8 minutes until my roof covered the view. It cant be a plane cause it would be too low that it would have been illegal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am glad Iam not the only one who saw it, or my co-workers would think that I just made it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Registered Nurse and I am not making this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no airbase close to my place nor an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the lights and thought maybe a weather balloon then the light shot in a horizontal motion several miles towards mendon swirrled in the sky and went back to the position over the power plant and vanished.  The lights appeared again over the power plant for a few nights.  I thought was odd, then I saw a show on tv about lights in southwick.  The videos look exactly like what I saw.

When she looked up there was a orange-yellow glowing circle object in the night sky.  It was being chased by at least 6 fighter jets.  She said, if you compare the size of the UFO to the jets.  The jets would be the size of the lead end of a pencil and the UFO would be the size of a half dollars.  She actually saw the UFO being fired upon by the jets and returning fire.  Then the UFO quickly disappeared to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was 3 other people present all of them saw the same scene.

The light was so bright that it caught our attention from inside our house (we have windows that look out towards the view).  Airplanes normally travel north/south in our area.  The light was white then dimmed and rebrightened to orange.  It was like a huge spotlight in the sky shining straight horizontally towards us.  My husband said he could see it was going down vertically very slowly.  When it became orange, it shined for a minute or so and then dimmed out until it was completely gone.  It did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

UFO was Cylinder type shape with the back like a boomerang. The Saucer had a white aura with sort of a bump on the bottom of the saucer projecting a white beam. The saucer was very low to the ground almost as when an airplane starts descending but it was still. The light beam did not touch the ground but you could see from the light there was nothing below it. As me and my spouse drove by I kept yelling to him to look and explain what it was but he didn’t look. I would like someone to explain what I saw but I am convinced this was out of this world.

After a good 4 minutes of just staring upwards, I saw two circular red lights appear out of thin air in the Northern part of the sky and they hovered shakingly for about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By that time I had yelled to the people who were with me and they quickly turned their attention to the direction that I had pointed. We all watched as the two lights moved across the sky from the North part of the sky all the way to the East part. The way they were moving was strange too, almost as if they were chasing one another. They moved in and out in a disarranged criss cross motion weaving in and out from each other, shaking and almost bending in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They reached the Eastern side of the sky in approximately 8 seconds, and they made no sound what so ever before they vanished as easily as they had appeared.<n>

I thought at first it was a low flying plane on a really odd angle, then three yellow balls of light came out from the tail end of it. They were a little larger than the stars. They swirled around in the sky for a couple of seconds before all joining together in a bundle and flying off towards northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no noise, and it was brighter than any star or planet, includng the planet venus. I would say it&#39;s altitude was about 3000-5000 ft., because it illuminated the clouds that it passed through and the jets weere under the clouds that were coming in to land at the airport.

I tried to take a photo of it with my phone, but my phone would not pick up the image, all it could see was black sky. it was very slow moving, slower than a plane would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The area was near 2 university campuses. All I saw were the lights, my girlfriend saw a shape before it became two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the 2 strobes of white light move in an erratic pathway high in the sky.  The 2 lights looked similar to stars and did not move in a straight line. Going generally from east to west they moved in bursts of high speed. There were erratic directional changes in their path. While covering this path the two objects also moved in relation to eachother. They repeated a path of semi circles. The lights started out larger  and brighter at the start of their path, by the end they were too far in the distance to see. It was still high above the horizon as it faded away. By the end of it&#39;s path it was not covering as much area, pretty much still as it dissapeared. It&#39;s flight was similar to that of an airplane covering the whole sky. But it flew in bursts of much higher speeds and erratic angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What my girlfriend saw was more vivid. I had her explain in detail to me what she saw but she would not be interested in admitting  her account to anyone else. Over my shoulder she saw a sillouhette directly above her. She described this as what she thought was a bat or &#34;two blobs&#34;. She asked me &#34;what is that?&#34;  and by the time she had me looking it became the two lights and was in the oposite direction she originally had me look .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both in our early 20&#39;s and skeptical.  I know this was not a conventional aircraft or  a shooting star due to the velocity, erratic path, and pattern or formation.<n>
4/6/08|Columbus|OH|||White and Yellow shiny starlike object moving irrationally and gracefully|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62895.html|394|ndxe200804| White and Yellow shiny starlike object moving irrationally and gracefully<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I (3:39 am) had the windows in my apartment open and saw a asterisk esque shining light hovering around closely and far away. We watched it for 5 or 6 minutes to see if it was making the path to the airport east of here. We were unnerved to see that it was tilting back and forth, in a seesaw sort of motion across the sky. The colors would slowly shift, some colors hard to see, but some colors were white and yellow. When it had no lights on, the body indicated a very soft-edged cone shape with irrationally placed red lights. Its path circled in a diameter around the general downtown area. It was disturbing because it looked so defiantly different than the typical police helicopters, care flights, and airplanes. That had a lot to do with its non-linear path, and slow, but very graceful speed. I&#39;ve never seen something like this before and wanted some insight on similar sightings, I didn&#39;t know if maybe extremely distant helicopters can give this impression, but then I doubt that. I doubt it because the light was very profile, it never moved in a three dimensional fashion, just sort of gave the illusion of moving two dimensionally. The irrational red and white blinking lights moved about this dark cone like object irrationally. It&#39;s also important to note that it was very large and resembled a huge shining star. One more thing to note is that you could not hear it like an airplane or helicopter. Two witnesses: Male<n>

He told me to pick him up at 11:00PM but didn&#39;t get off until close to 12:00AM. I was stuck waiting outside for him for over a hour. It was pretty humid so I didn&#39;t want to wait inside the car so I got out and waited. The parking lot was almost all empty except the cars of the people that were cleaning up the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:45PM I laid out on the roof of my car and looked up at the night sky. I looked at a couple of planes passing by and then something caught my attention. There was this object moving really slow directly above me. I&#39;m a skeptic so I tell myself it&#39;s probably some balloons, until the object stopped moving. Then I got a really good look at it. Here is what I can describe as only a black Triangle and it was pointing north, and where the angles were, there where white dots in their place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was almost directly over me. I got a good look at it but because of the lights in the parking lot I had to cover up the light coming off the street lights so the glare wouldn&#39;t get to my eyes. So I just stared at it for about a minute, then it started to move north very slowly. Nobody was around so I could show them so I didn&#39;t bother taking my eyes off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued north until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I googled &#34;Black triangle with white dots in the sky&#34; and this website came up, and I saw that there was a string of sightings of the same thing in February of 2007 that described the exact same thing. So I was happy I&#39;m not the only one who seen it. I hope this info was helpful.<n>
4/5/08 17:30|Long Branch|NJ|Light|2 Minutes|Two bright lights off Long Branch, NJ over the Atlantic Ocean|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62901.html|396|ndxe200804| Two bright lights off Long Branch, NJ over the Atlantic Ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I was standing outside and a bright star over the Atlantic ocean caught my eye. At first I thought it was just an early bright star, kind of like when you see the moon early in the afternoon. The sky was very clear. I figured it might be a &#34;star&#34; because the sun was now in the west, behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very high in the sky. It had height similar to a star or even a satellite moving in low orbit, but was stationary. We live in an area that does not have high light pollution, so at night (especially in the summers) we are able to see satellites at night when they fly over. Our views are so good that one evening last year we were able to see a NOSS satellite group fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to gauge the height when an aircraft was flying at what appeared to be it&#39;s maximum altitude to the left of the &#34;star&#34; and the &#34;star&#34; was much higher than the aircraft. I knew the aircraft was high due to its jet stream. There were also two birds flying at a height that dismissed the chance of the &#34;star&#34; being a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a second light appeared and was aligned in a way similar to Orion&#39;s belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second &#34;star&#34; seemed to have started to move slowly below the first &#34;star&#34;. In order to make sure the second &#34;star&#34; was moving I closed one eye and used my finger as marker and sure enough the lower &#34;star&#34; was moving in a southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Literally, in a blink of an eye the moving star was gone. It just disappeared. No flash or high acceleration, just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking back to the first star when it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for a few more minutes for the &#34;stars&#34; to reappear but they did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been bothering me all day so I decided to post it here to see if anyone else has seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I came outside to see and there was an object that at first appeared to be somewhat kite shaped. That is what we origionally thought it was. Then I noticed another object above it that the lower object appeared to be hanging from. There were two more appeared to the Eastern side of the object so that it formed a sideways triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point there were 5 of them atleast around the origional object. It was a metallic silver in color and shiny. The sky was clear and it was sunny out. As we watched the objects disappeared from sight. I managed to take one photo but my camera was low on battery and that is all I was able to get. It is not a very good photo but you can see two of them in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was gray and spinning at quite a speed then a very bright color changing light came from the bottom of the craft blinding me it also made a very load wish sound and then I looked up and it wasn&#39;t there I was just standing there in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please help me find out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/5/08 16:00|Pomona|CA|Unknown|20-30 minutes|The craft moved too much to be an airplane and it made certain moves that make it not man made.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63477.html|399|ndxe200804| The craft moved too much to be an airplane and it made certain moves that make it not man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, frist of all I&#39;d like o say that I&#39;m very scared because ever since April the 1st of the year 2005, I saw what looked to me to be an alien craft, since that day i keep seeing it over and over every year on the same day exept for this day. Well, this time i was smart enough to call over my sisters to have some witnesses. This is how it happened i had come home from school and i went to go check on the dogs that we have, well the moment i went out there i felt has if something was wathching me and i loocked up and saw a small object preety high up in the air i was suprised and i started to think its gotta be an airplane or a ballon or something and then i started to remember about what happened one year ago and two years ago on the same day. It acted almost the same has the one from last time. It moved around pretty fast and it keept going back and forth, thn after probably 5 minutes i called my sisters and told them look i see it agian look come before it leaves. when they came they were like i dont see anything?? And then they looked closely and one by ione started seing the object. But then something more strange happened we saw one appear alomost alkl of a sudden they looked like they were close to each other aligned but then one would go ahead of the other, it was creepy and scary cause we started thinking that maybe more would appear and would see us. The object seemed silvernad round or oval shaped i couldn&#39;t figure it out cause ti was so high up in the air. Now one thing is for sure this were not an aircraft because aircraft or airplanes cannot go back and forth or make a turn in mid air, a ballon would leave out of sight, and another thing that day wasnt so windy at all, it was mostly clear. All i can say is i cant explain what i saw and i am always going to keep that question in my mind till i fnd answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A light caught my eye in the sky and it was much closer than a star.  More like an airplane traveling over the city at highest altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon observing it, I noticed that this solid, white light was moving forward quickly, but in jerking motions forward, then one side to the other, then every now and then it would move backward, only to go forward again.  At times, it would stop completely, then move in tiny circular motions.  It was stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved forward and then backward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house faces due west and it was traveling from the west to the east.  As it came more overhead, at this time about a 90 degree angle, I began noticing a straight line extending from the white, round base that was also a solid white.  I called Nellis Air Force Base and they gave me your phone number.  I have left a message for you on the phone number that the Air Force Base gave me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before signing off, I just went out to check it again.  It is still in one place, but bouncing around in an almost jerky, circular pattern.  I can still see the line of white protruding from the circular base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound and it was proceeding across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. From the time we noticed the object until the time it had passed was approximately 3 minutes. We noticed that there was no pulsing light and no sound. This was a solid object that did not change in color. I had to point it out as it appeared as a star. My friends and I after pointing out the object were awwwwd. We could not explain what it was and it was moving extremely fast over the sky. At the time we had noted commercial aircraft in the sky but this object seemed 5x further away and had no flashing lights. The speed of the commercial planes was not even close to what this object was moving. I know what planes look like at high elevations and this was nothing close. For something like this to catch my eye and make my company look in aww I figured I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The engine noise was very silent and sounded like it was an airliner at high altitude. It had a light on the two back corners and possibly one on the nose. I had captured a short video on my cell phone but it is low quality and you can barely see the lights. Shortly after, there was another aircraft in the distant south-west which appeared to be heading in the same direction as the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking into the sky at stars, small aircraft, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked ESE and saw, just above a tree line, four small white lights in a triangular pattern (three on the left side, one completing the back right corner) travelling approximately south.  I said to my brother, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; and pointed to the lights.  I had initially thought it was a formation of planes, but it couldn’t have been; besides the fact that there were no red, blue, or any blinking lights, it became apparent that we were looking at one solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only realized this as the triangular object began to move behind trees.  My brother was standing to my left and had a better vantage point, and he saw it dip down, come back up, and then fade out.  The whole incident lasted a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, a helicopter started circling around that area; it’s difficult to determine distances, but I would say that the helicopter was probably closer to us than the object had been, and a little more south.  It had a bright search beam on and searched for about a half-hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw quite a few planes and a bird in flight while standing there, so we could distinguish between those and whatever it was we saw.  As much as we searched the sky, we never saw it again.<n>

Both of us will take a polygraph to confirm sighting is authentic. time was 9:15pm till 10:00pm. The small object was not a sattelite.<n>

It moves up,down side to side, and in a circular motion. Very quick, not like a plane or helicopter. Sometimes it is close enough to see the flashing lights and sometimes far enough away to only appear as a star. But stars do not move, actually nothing I have ever seen in the sky moves like this thing does. I see in previous reports that other people in Missisiipp have seen this also, in the same area of the sky. Is there any reasonable explanation for what we have seen? This is for me the 3rd time I have witnessed this in a week. And frankly it is creeping me out a little. I do believe there is somthing out there, but why are they out there this close? It makes me think that they want us to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD))<n>

The sky was clear with no clouds visible.  It moved very slowly, appeared to be high altitude and was changing directions.  Being next to LAX we could easily compare it and it&#39;s movement to other familiar aircraft flying by in the sky.  Every now and then very faint lights could be seen flashing from left to right and back again in a single row along what we could view as the body of the object.  It&#39;s body position did not remain parallel to the horizon as other aircraft flying by were.  At the final point we viewed it, it was perpendicular to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a fire at ground level.  We witnessed this from a lookout point in the Smokey Mountains where you can overlook the whole city.  There were no news reports of crashed or shot down aircrafts and it had to be something small and not a commercial flight.

The object was like a rectangle shape with a light at the bottom.  The object was going south parallel to the 5 freeway that goes to San Diego.  At the time of the sighting, it was passing over Laguna Hills Ca.  I rushed home and told my girl friend to get the camera while i waited outside the house and observed the object.

I looked up and saw a flashing red light as any airplane would have. This object was in the shape of a large sized normal airplane. It was flying rather low... not more than a couple thousand feet elevation. It was also going rather fast. I thought it may have been traveling faster than the speed of sound so I waited a moment for the sound to pass, but I never heard any noise. This plane was silent. I&#39;m curious if it might be a new experimental technology. A friend that lives about 6 blocks away also saw it and described it in the same manner, before I ever mentioned it to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was similar to the disc type I have seen on TV and pictures over the years but it was a bit different. The disc was a bit thicker and not as &#34;flat&#34;. Is the only way I could describe. There was also a section on top of the disc as well. It looked to be made of some type of metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low enough and close enough that I could see it clear as day. I also noticed  rather then flying in one direction, it seemed to hover and move side to side slowly, like a zig Zag. I watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds until it moved to a point where the house located in the lot behind mine had blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother immediatley. She has seen one over a cornfield at our old house about 20 year ago. This one did not look like the one she had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering how low this was, and how busy the area I live in is, I would definately think someone else saw this. There is a major airport located about a 45 minute drive from me so I do see many planes regularly however I know this was definately not a plane. However about 1 minute or so after I had seen the ufo there was a place in the same area. I dont know if this is somehow connected but I found it ironic at the time.<n>

I do/did not believe in UFO&#39;s. I have never done drugs or drank, not even coffee.  My friend was with me, she hasn&#39;t done anything like that either. We&#39;re both Freshman at a private University in Idaho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, my roommate and I went to DQ for some ice cream at about 22:00. When we got back to the women&#39;s dorm&#39;s parking lot, (22:40) I jumped out of her van to move my car to a different spot. She was still parking her van when I got done. She and I both took astronomy during summer 2007. While I was waiting for her to park her car I looked up at the sky to see if I could remember the names of the constellations. It was a crystal clear night. I was looking westward. Out of the corner of my eye (south) I saw something moving in the sky. It was moving slowly. I thought maybe it was clouds or the Milky Way. Then I looked at it. It was a black, slightly grey color, which made it hard to see unless you were already looking at the sky. I thought it was part of the sky but I realized it was a distinct object. It was gliding northward. It was very high up in the sky, at about where planes would fly or a little higher. It was huge, as in if you would land it, it would have been gigantic! It definitely wasn’t as small as an airplane would be when you see one in the sky. It didn’t have any lights on it at all which is why I kept looking at it. I’ve never seen an aircraft fly without lights. There seemed to be a little blur around it.  My mind couldn’t make sense of what that was around it. Usually when that happens, something weird’s going on. To me it looked like a dragon, but without any arms or legs. It was kind of squarer at the front and gradually got thinner, kind of like a triangle but it didn’t look like a triangle. I drew a picture for one of my other roommates. She said it kind of looks like the shape of a whale to her. I thought it was a dragon, which I don’t believe in either. When my roommate got out of her van, I ran over to her and told her to tell me what that was. We couldn’t figure it out. She thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but it was too high up for birds to fly. We listened closely to see if we could hear it making a noise, but we couldn’t hear anything. We had no idea what it was. We’d ! never se en any aircraft like it before. It was a definite object, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what it was made of, since it was dark outside, and the object itself was black. I would guess metal, but it was so smooth. It didn’t leave behind any exhaust or anything. We watched it until it got further away so we couldn’t really see it anymore.<n>

It caught my eye as it was unlike any light configuration I had ever seen on an aircraft (there is an airport near by and we have a lot of heliocopter traffic, so I am familiar with standard aircraft lights).  I watched it for as long as I could until the turn of the freeway off ramp took it out of my field of vision.  I saw it for approximately 10 seconds and in that time it did not appear to move nor did any lights flash (such as flashing red and blue lights that is on standard aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I frequently look up as I am an aviation enthusiast and am very observant of flight paths, and can identify any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started noticing something wrong when I saw a 737, an A320 and a 777 WAY off of the normal flight path into Denver International Airport.  I kept looking up when I saw a craft flying at about 40,000 to 50,000 feet.  It looked like two oval shaped cigars joined somehow.  When I first saw it, I thought it was wreckage from some type of mid-air catastrophe due to its strange way of moving, but realized it was something else when it continued northbound in the sky for about 10 minutes. The way it flew looked like something tumbling, yet in control. Like it was rolling in all directions while still flying in a straight, coordinated manner. I am an extreme skeptic, and usually write-off UFO sightings as military craft, or natural phenomena. But, what I saw was not earthly. I know alot about aviation, and nothing, I repeat NOTHING can fly like that. It was black, and gave off a glare from the sun&#39;s reflection.<n>
4/3/08 16:22|Wichita Falls|TX|Changing|20 seconds|UFO'S Seen in Wichita Falls, Texas/Sheppard AFB area April 3, 2008|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62719.html|422|ndxe200804| UFO&#39;S Seen in Wichita Falls, Texas/Sheppard AFB area April 3, 2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, April 3, 2008, around 8:20 p.m. I had just arrived home from attending an event.  For some reason I decided to pet my dogs, which were barking inside the gates of the backyard.  As I was petting them I noticed a light or large star in the Eastern Sky..  As I continued to observe the white light, it moved from side to side vertically and horizontally, very rapidly , and then it turned into two flying vehicles.  At first, all I could see was the &#34;V&#34; shape on the front where lights were outlining the front of the vehicles, which was flying downward at a 45 degree angle.  My first thought was that they were some kind of new air force jets, since we have Sheppard Air Force Base here in Wichita Falls. As soon as I entertained that thought, the second of the two vehicles stopped and turned to a horizontal position and then turned its lights on!  It was just like the ones I had seen on television with the narrow horizontal long wise lights around the outside, and a large light shining out of the vehicle on the bottom..There were maybe 35-40 lights around the outside of the ship. I could see that the shape was oval and could see the beam of the light, as it shone downward.  There were also windows at the top of the dome, and I could see white light shining out, from the inside. It seemed that althought the light was on the bottom of the ship there was something around the light, maybe the device or air system which was keeping the system airprone.  It also seemed like there were some kind of purple or blue lights on the side of the vehicle as it turned on the bottom light.  The side lights and windows appeared first and then the bottom light. Then, after about 5 or 6 seconds the second vehicle returned to a 45 degree angle behind the first vehicle.  They continued flying in a downward pattern and disappeared behind some trees, so I am assuming the vehicle has some invisibility mechanism.  I did not see anyone in the vehicle through the windows but for some reason I think the cabin par! t of it was in the front where I first saw the V shaped light pattern.  When it returned to an angled pattern it turned its lights off, except for the V shape strand around the front. It was flying, maybe 25 or 30 feet behind the first vehicle.  This all took place within a 20-30 second period and is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I was by myside with my two dogs, and surprisingly they werent barking during this period, perhaps they could sense the light or see it as well.  When I went inside, I told my husband, but he didnt go outside to look.  This happened so quickly Im sure I dont remember everything but I know it wasnt a glare, since there wasnt sunlight and it was not an airplane, not ones that we normally see..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some of my past reports have been labeled as such (ex. metallic sphere tailing fighter jet((HOAX)). I assure everyone that reads this report to be 100% truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student at (name withheld) high school in Alabama. On the morning of April 3, 2008, at 7:15 a.m., I was leaning on my car in the parking lot of (name withheld) high school, waiting for the first bell to ring. I got bored and looked up. First I saw a puff of smoke or steam appear in the sky. I then saw a small, fast aircraft appear out of it. After it traveled for a short distance at a great speed, I saw another puff of smoke or steam appear. It came out of the cloud, and then sped up so fast my eyes had trouble keeping up. I t ust not have been made of metal, because it did not glint in the rising sun. Are there any other kinds of aircraft that don&#39;t use metal in their full construction? At this point, I coyuld discern the shape, which was a cigar. A cloud was ditrectly in the way that the object was travelling. What happened next didn&#39;t make anyy sense to me at all. I looked at the cloud, and part of the cloud just disappeared. Completely cut in half. I know this sounds pretty wierd, but the flight path of the shape where it would intersect with the cloud had completely disappeared. The shape went through the small hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My mom and brother had just gone to bed, and i was awake in my room. I was just about to go to sleep when i herd a low sound comming from outside. I ran to my mom&#39;s room and looked out the window. I was a huge objusct that lokked almost like a fighter juet but i was glowing a green eary color. It vanished out of site high in to the sky, I could still see the flares from the back thought. The secound time occured 10 minutes after at 12:25am. Another object came from the right side of my house....but it was not glowing green. It made a loud, low rumbling sound that you couldnt make up in movies, it passed right infrom of my window. After it was out of site the sound could still be herd for about 3-4 minutes. 1 car&#39;s alarm did go off at the time of the secound object passing by.

This flying craft was sitting in a fixed position in the sky over my friend’s neighborhood for about 1-2 minutes and then started to slowly hover farther away.  My friend and I followed the craft for as long as we could then lost it in sight.  I dropped my friend off (he lived very close by to where we saw this) and then I started to drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of sudden I saw the flying craft again but it was about ¼ mile away from when we first saw it.  I drove as fast as I could through the neighborhood to try and get closer look.  Finally I was driving directly below the flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft looked nothing like a typical plane for this area.  It looked like there were multiple cigar shaped tubes all connected to one main base.  It had different sets of lights that were blinking in a order.  When I was driving directly below this slow moving craft there was almost ZERO sound coming from it.  Most airplanes around here even 5-10,000 feet you can still hear taking off and landing from far distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Craft was also able to fly straight upwards and take off very fast then it would slow down and go lower.   After I lost the sighting of the first craft I started on my way home where I saw 3 other crafts (same designs) hovering slowly over 2 miles of neighborhoods that I drove through to get home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ am not surprised at all by this, but at the same time would like to know why soundless aircrafts are being flown very low around my neighborhood when there is a airport so close.<n>

Just above the tree line.  The light alternated in color between white, red, blue, and green as if a light was shining through a prism. When viewed through binoculars the formation of the light was changing and at times took on a triangular shape with a line of each color (red, blue, and green) making up each side of the triangle. The light remained stationary in the sky and very bright for about 20 minutes then dimmed and became much lower in the sky (even with an electrical pole from the second story porch) for about ten minutes before it was no longer visible. The rate of descent was much greater than the movement of the stars in the sky which remained more or less stationary in relation to us and the light during the time the light changed positions. However, the rate of movement was not significant enough that you could really tell it was moving if you were not already watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was Venus or Mars at first but this light was much too bright to be either planet. It also seemed to have an aura and extending rays in variations of the contingent colors at times. The closest analog I can think of is the glint of a prism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius??  PD))<n>

I had been talking to a friend of mine and decided to take the conversation out onto the balcony while I smoked a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear and the stars were very visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I spoke on the phone to my friend and smoked I looked up at the night sky because the view was spectacular.  At this time I saw a triangular shaped dimly lit object come over the apartment building and move at a steady but somewhat slow pace on a northwest trajectory.  It only seemed to be about 200 to 300 feet above the ground and not very large.  It made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in astonishment and relayed what I was seeing to my friend via phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then hung up and thought about what I had seen to see if there was a &#34;logical explanation&#34;.  I thought of geese because of the somewhat low flight pattern.  However in my experience here in Indiana you ALWAYS hear geese when they fly overhead. HONK HONK!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also fails to explain the LIGHTED nature of what I had seen.  It was almost like a kite with very dimly lit lights along its edges  Possibly six if you count the point.  It was so dimly lit in fact that if not for the motion of it I may not have noticed it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother in Louisiana to describe the event to her and once again as I was talking to her I scanned the skies.  It was then that I sighted movement in the northwest and saw the same object taking a &#34;nosedive&#34; downward for about 5 seconds and then once again disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time I have ever experienced a sighting of any kind in the night skies.<n>
4/2/08 20:51|Jenera|OH|Triangle|3-5 minutes|Rounded triangular object  with green lights on the sides and a white blinking light on the back. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67384.html|428|ndxe200804| A rounded triangular object  with green lights on the sides and a white blinking light on the back flies over rural Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:51 pm EST on April 2, 2008 I witnessed a UFO that flew directly over my house.  I was very skeptical about UFO&#39;s before that day, I am now firmly aware of extra-terrestrial beings.  I had just looked out my window when I saw a huge green light coming towards the house.  At first it reminded me of an airplane but it was so low it would have made a huge sound. I ran outside and saw a triangular object flying overhead.  It came from the South East and was traveling to the North West. This triangle was about 125 feet in the air maybe less and there was barely any noise. The noise that was there sounded like an airplane taking off in a scene in a movie, it was very quiet. It was cruising at about 25-30 mph, almost like it was floating. It was rounded triangle, the edges did not look sharp, and on the two sides there were small green lights, maybe six or more on each side. On the back were five white lights. The middle light was bigger than the others and was flashing a brilliant white light. It was blinding if you looked at it directly. It was not like the blinking lights on a plane. It blinked about once every two seconds. Something else I noticed about the encounter was that my dog was quiet. He barks at vultures above our house and chases them. This object was about 10 times bigger than a vulture and you could hear it more, but he just sat down on the grass, he didn&#39;t bark at all which was extremely unusual. This object was also witnessed by my sister and mother. My mother thinks it was a plane from the Dayton Air Base but I do not agree. It wasn&#39;t like anything I had ever seen, it was not a plane, and I will firmly stick to that conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Probable hoax.  PD))<n>

The light was a bit bigger than a star, thus the abnormality in its apparent speed, if it were an airplane. The light also seemed very bright and consolidated,  with very faint flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was some kind of orbiting satellite, but that seems unlikely due to its visibility.  I live near 2 major airports, JFK and La-Guardia, and see all kinds of aircraft flying overhead at all times of the day.  This was different.  A plane flying at its height would be fainter, the blinking would be more articulated, and it would be considerably slower.  Also, there were other planes in the area, which made it easy to compare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After walking towards my apartment for a minute I turned around and it appeared not to be moving, and seemed to pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another craft, flying considerably closer than the first one, flew in from the west.  It had 4 lights rapidly blinking in an L shaped pattern: 3 of the lights making up the rod of the L were white, while the tip of the L was red.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but it did not sound like one, and I have never seen a helicopter with such a light configuration.<n>

I lived in a 20 floor from where I am able to see airplanes coming from the island airport, and also I have visibility to see airplanes going to Pearson Airport but never at that hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Defining the shape of the object I saw is difficult, due to fact that first appeared as it was an airplane by its distance but when it approached west, in a fast manner, just seconds, turn on even more lights and turn on a big beam light towards up the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam light seems as it was coming from the back of the craft, very impressively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were mainly white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft traveled from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder what I saw.<n>

This was no more than 20-30 min after I laid down. A bright blue-white light came bursting through my window. I jumped to the end of my bed and opened my blinds expecting to see a helicopter. To my surprise there were 3 orbs out my window. They were all a red purple color, about 2 ft wide, yet they didn’t seem to illuminate any light. The light seemed to be almost internal rather than radiating. The objects were stationary for probably about 10 seconds when they all moved together in line. They seemed to now form one object with the center orb now becoming a blue oval. As soon as the objects merged together the one object moved slowly away and seemed to just &#34;blink&#34; away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The power only went off in my room of the house. No other room was effected. Only the clocks and other electronics in my room were effected. This experience completely baffled me. I researched everything I could find. My family thought it was a dream until the next day there were, and still are, circular areas of dead vegetation about 2.5’ wide. I cant explain what happened but whatever it was, it was real I have dead spots surrounded by healthy green plants. I want to know if anyone else out there has had a similar experience.<n>

Through the tree line behind our home and slightly above the horizon, I noticed flashing lights, like that of an airplane; only these appeared to be brighter even though there was an obvious distance between myself and the object.  They were brighter and more colorful than the simple red green flashing of a plane’s wingtips.  More colorful, meaning that it APPEARED to me that there was a blue and white flash along with the red and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for about a minute or two, adjusted and cleared my eyes (I have perfect 20/20 vision) and got my fiancé from the living room.  I asked her if she wanted to see a UFO and to come quick.  She ran out, I pointed out the object to her and she also witnessed the object.  We watched it move slightly in and out of view just above the horizon, again, at a distance.  I had to move around a couple of steps to keep in into view; there was also a distant tree on a little hill that I was looking at the object through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She asked me could it be a helicopter distantly overhead, and I said that I was pretty sure that it wasn’t.  I have some dealing with helo’s in the past and I am sure that isn’t what it was.  After moving around in the sky for a couple of minutes, the lights just turned off.  An aircraft you would see the lights fade away, these simply just went out.  There were no low clouds for the object to have hid behind; they simply went out like someone flipped a switch.  I was so sure that what I was looking at was a UFO that if it had been earlier in the evening, I would have gotten my neighbors to look at it as well, but its kind of rude to wake someone up at just after midnight to tell them you think you have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing Sirius.

It looked like a fiery ball, not a meteorite or shooting star.  I&#39;ve seen meteorites and shooting stars and supposed UFO&#39;s, this is nothing like that.  It appeared to be within the atmosphere, but there was no sound.  Has anyone reported this and did it appear on radar?  Thanking you in advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))  4/1/2008<n>

The lights were white in color, they werent very bright at all, something that would easily be missed by someone not looking directly at the sky as I was, I was outside smoking and tend to stargaze which I believe is the only way anyone could have seen it. This information is copied straight from an image I made directly after the sighting, I have uploaded the image I made http://imbatech.com/sighting.jpg - I also recall seeing a commercial airliner high overhead coming from the east also, this helped me to know it was close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve seen or caught these images before several times before during previous months, but never paid much attention due to air traffic in this area from Nashville international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I&#39;ve seen them I&#39;ve more actively seek them out and for the next 2 days I saw them briefly each night. Couldn&#39;t figure them out, couldn&#39;t find anyone to collaborate my story.  It was on the 3rd night which would have been on a Friday I was heading home, it was 16:00 ( we get out early on Fridays ).  No objects yet, I had been seeing them from Mallory station road for the previous 2 days.  I proceeded home as normal, I was now on Murray lane/ Holly berry gap heading towards the 431.  I came down off a hard turn on a very steep incline which winds down into a valley.  It was then that I seen this same small very bright circular object in the sky I caught it in my sight for about 3 seconds as it flew over the hills ahead of me, I appeared to be slowing down and disappeared into the tree or hills.  As I came around and head down the road towards the hills I saw 2 black military helicopters they looked like Comanche&#39;s and they were moving in a direct line towards where I last saw that object.  They copters were flying low and as I moved out of range they appeared to be hovering above that hill where I saw the circular object disappear.  Something was going on some where between Murray lane and Old Hickory Blvd.  I heard nothing on the news and have told very few people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was traveling north on HWY 1130 at about 11;20 am. As I glanced ahead and down the road my attention was drawn to a dark object in the clouds moving at a higher than normal rate of speed, also at an altitude of about 500 or 600 feet. The object moved from west to east and seemed to accelerate as it turned rapidly to the north and I lost it though the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I replayed it in my head over and over to try to make sense of what I saw.  If it had had two rotors I believe it could have been one of those large lifting choppers the military uses, but there were no rotors or wings of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4/1/08 05:30|Homer Glen|IL|Light|3-4 Minutes|On 4/1/08 at 05:30 I saw three objects with very intense bright white strobes over  Homer Glen Illinois.|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62478.html|441|ndxe200804| On 4/1/08 at 05:30 I saw three objects with very intense bright white strobes over  Homer Glen Illinois. I was getting on Toll way I-355 north, from west bound Route 6 in New Lenox. I noticed the strobes while on the ramp and watched them for the next several miles (minutes) as I headed north on I-355. The objects were northwest from the Toll way and about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The weather was dry but overcast, I have no idea what the ceiling was at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects appeared to be identical in the fact that all three had the same varying intensity, and frequency of the strobe effect, but the objects were not in sync with each other. Since they were identical in brightness and appearance I assume they were of the same size and distance from me. There was also many strobes on each object with some slightly more intense than others, making each object look like a continuous varying strobe. There were no other lights, no red or green or landing lights, no steady lights of any kind, just very white intense strobes. I could not see any discernable shape of an object or objects, or tell how many strobes there were per object since the strobes on each object were very close to each other. My best description is each object was like a cluster of tightly packed, very intense strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects also appeared to interact with each other, meaning as one moved another would follow. This dance went on for a minute or two. Then while two of them were more or less stationary the third one headed away then quickly, amazingly quick, turned around and passed right between the other two and came to an abrupt stop shortly after passing them, making all three the same distance apart. Shortly after that maneuver the three objects got in a straight line with one another (north to south), were equidistant to each other, and appeared to be heading south (remember I’m heading north at 65+ MPH)  and then climbed away slowly at a 45 degree angle. At this point they were now due west of me. I never did see them enter the cloud deck or if they changed direction due to my vantage point while driving, and a strong desire to stay on the road. As they were climbing away the distance between them slowly increased but they were always equidistant to each other, as if in formation, and their appearance and strobe intensity although fading, remained constant between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aircraft technician and I am very familiar with various, not all, aircraft and helicopter lighting. I see airplanes almost everyday and night, going into and out of Chicago’s Midway and  O’Hare airports, and several smaller airports, as I travel over 100 miles roundtrip every day (or night) to and from work. I am very familiar with the traffic and holding patterns too. In fact I did see airplane traffic in their usual routes, north and east of my location (for the given wind direction at that time). These objects were not in that vicinity, they were alone. I am also aware that there was a Hotel fire in Lockport Illinois, to the south and west from were I witnessed these objects, and the local news teams did have their helicopters up covering it, but these objects were nowhere near that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen helicopters with so many intense strobes. I have never seen helicopters or any other aircraft accelerate and decelerate in such a short distance(?) and time. And, I have never seen them “play” with each other for a lack of a better description, and depart in single file and climb at a 45 degree angle. I am not saying it couldn’t have been 3 identical aircraft or 3 identical helicopters playing cat and mouse in the predawn hours, all I’m saying is I have never witnessed anything like it in my 30 plus years in aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was smoking a cigarette listening to my Ipod in my driveway early one morning when i started to wave my hand over the light to create a slow strobe pattern.  After a couple of minutes i took my headphones off and looked at the sky.  I didn&#39;t hear or see anything come near me, but I looked up and saw a trapezoid shaped craft hovering silently about 75-100 feet above me.  The outline of the craft was a flashing red line that was the shape of a trapezoid, two equal sides then the front of the craft was shorter than the bottom.  It moved from side to side in a kind of sporadic movement, I was frozen stiff scared and stood there for about 20 seconds staring at it then cautiously waved at it, it then changed to a red and white light pattern and hovered away towards the moon behind my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4/1/08 00:55|Covina|CA|Triangle|about 45sec-1min|Large Triangle shaped Lights(object) passed across the sky in total silence|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62473.html|443|ndxe200804| Large Triangle shaped Lights(object) passed across the sky in total silence<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were standing out front of his house this morning at about 12:55am when he exclaimed &#34;look&#34; and pointed to the southern sky. What i saw was a triangular shaped group of lights that stayed fixed in position but were coming more clearly into our field of vision (traveling south to northwest across vision). If these lights were at regular airplane flying level, the triangle object should have been at least 3 times bigger than a 747. At this time i was doubting what i was seeing because it was so unbelievable. It was not until the large object had passed bye us that i realized that there was absolutely no sound being emitted, and it in fact seemed quieter, as if all ambient noise was being hushed. The total time of this sighting was about 45 seconds. I would have to guess that the object was triangular and flat because when i saw it in the southern sky four lights were visible but as it passed by other lights came into view on the rear. The lights also would shift in brightness probably due to the angle which it was being viewed at. The object kept traveling until out of view. I looked at NASA to see if it could have been the ISS but the orbit of the station travels North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
