4/15/63 19:30|Lompoc/Vandenberg AFB|CA|Disk|5 MIN|FLYING DISC OBSERVED OVER MOUNTAIN DURING LAUNCH OF SCOUT MISSILE|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04908.html|2|ndxe196304| FLYING DISC OBSERVED OVER MOUNTAIN DURING LAUNCH OF SCOUT MISSILE<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN APPROXIMATELY APRIL OF 1963 I WAS ASSIGNED AS A NAVY CRYPTOGRAPHER AT NAVAL AIR STATION POINT MUGU, CALIF.  NAS PT MUGU WAS AT THAT TIME THE NAVY MISSILE TEST CENTER, OPERATING CLOSELY WITH VANDENBERG AFB.  THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER AT PT MUGU HAD WHAT WE CALLED A &#34;COUNTDOWN CIRCUIT, WHEREBY A MINITE BY MINUTE COUNT WAS PASSED FROM VANDENBERG TO PT MUGU DURING A MISSILE LAUNCH. DURING AN EVENING SHIFT (UNABLE TO REMEMBER THE DATE CLEARLY), WHILE WORKING IN THE CRYPTO CENTER, MYSELF AND MY PARTNER, JOHN WELLS, AND A CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN, (NAME NOT REMEMBERED), WERE MONITORING THE COUNTDOWN CIRCUIT DURING A LAUNCH OF A SCOUT MISSILE BEING FIRED DOWN RANGE INTO THE MID PACIFIC AREA.  THE COUNT DOWN WAS GOING NORMALLY UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 4 MINUTES TO LAUNCH, WHEN SUDDENLY BELLS BEGAN TO RING ON THE TELETYPE MACHINE AND A READ OUT STATING &#34;HOLD HOLD HOLD UFO UFO UFO&#34;.  THE REPORT WE GOT VIA ANOTHER (CLOSED CKT) TELETYPE, (CRYPTO COVERED) WAS THAT VANDENBERG HAD LAUNCHED TWO CHASE PLANES TO INVESTIGATE THE UFO..  THE REPORT FURTHER STATED THAT THE UFO WAS &#34;HUGE&#34; (NO OTHER DEMENSIONS GIVEN) AND WAS HOVERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS JUST SOUTH OF THE LAUNCH SITE.  UPON THE APPROACH OF THE JETS, THE UFO SHOT OFF AT VERY HIGH SPEED IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. IN ADDITION THERE WERE MANY CARS DRIVING NORTH AND SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 101 WHICH PASSES DIRECTLY INLAND FROM THE LAUNCH SITES WITH A LOW MOUNTAIN RANGE BETWEEN THE TWO.  MANY VEHICLES STOPPED ON THE FREEWAY AND PEOPLE GOT OUT AND WATCHED THE UFO HOVERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS, AND ALSO OBSERVED THE UFO LEAVE TO THE WEST AT HIGH SPEED.  AT THAT TIME I WAS A NAVY RADIOMAN (E-6) AND THE CRYPTO SUPERVISOR. I WAS ALSO TRAINING OFFICER TEACHING CRYPTO AND CRYPTO OPERATIONS.  DO NOT BELIEVE THE NAVY COULD IN ANYWAY RATE ME AS UNSTEADY OR UNRELIABLE. ((Personal information deleted)).  THATS ABOUT ALL I CAN REMEBER AT THIS TIME, AS IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO.<n>

4/7/63 20:00|Vero Beach|FL|Disk|10 minutes|Vero Beach Fla, 1960's; low, huge hovering disk over highway shooting colored lights out the back  with illuminated windows.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84899.html|4|ndxe196304| Vero Beach Fla, 1960&#39;s; low, huge hovering disk over highway shooting colored lights out the back  with illuminated windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 1963, making me about 10 yrs old, and my family, (my father, a mechanical engineer for Carrier Corporation, my Mother, and my 15 yr old sister, all of sound mind), were on a highway in Vero Beach Fla.just about 8 PM, as I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just above us, appeared a stationary UFO, hovering without sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was huge and very close overhead, causing all traffic to come to a halt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People exited their cars and just stared at this huge metallic disk with white lights in windows, shooting colored lights out the bottom in one horozontal direction; red, green- I can’t remember how many colors absolutely. It was a clear, unobstructed, overhead view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nothing else, but a UFO, and everyone outside their cars were pointing at it.  We got in the car to continue to our lodging, watching the news for an explanation.  In the morning, the newspaper or TV (I can’t remember, but my parents said that the reports of the sighting were numerous, but the official release was &#34;weather balloons&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family knew that explanation was impossible.   I remember how disappointed we were that they were NOT truthful in disclosing what it really was! We then visited my grandparents (in Vero Beach) and they were telling them about the UFO sighting.<n>
4/1/63 07:00|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|10 minutes|Observed in western sky @ about 100 ft. flying to the south at about 10 to25 mph Flying in formation as geese would fly|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08381.html|5|ndxe196304| Observed in western sky @ about 100 ft. flying to the south at about 10 to25 mph Flying in formation as geese would fly<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on the south side of Tucson about 1 mile from the Papago indian reservation.I went outside to feed our pigeons at about 7:00am before I went to school. I saw them to the west flying in formation like geese fly. They were about 100 ft. above the ground flying at about 10 to25 mph. I was very excited and started yelling for my mother and brothers. 2 of my brothers and mom came outside as we saw them move to the south. They were triangler shaped with rounded edges, grey in color, and seemed to be about 30 ft. or so. They proceeded towards the reservation slowly until they came to a small mountain where the reservation hospital is located. Behind the mountain is the Santa Cruz River which is dry most of the year. This is about 3 mi. from our home. They then stopped and hovered for a bit, then dissapered behind the mountain into I belive the Santa Cruz. After school that day my 2 brothers and I went to see if we could find any traces but didn&#39;t find any. That was 34 years ago and is just as vivid as then.<n>
