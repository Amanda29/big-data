12/31/01 23:40|Tulsa|OK|Light|5-10min|Slowly moving red (then orange) flickering light joined for a time by a faster moving white light.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20947.html|1|ndxe200112| Slowly moving red (then orange) flickering light joined for a time by a faster moving white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At appx 11:40cst, I saw a fairly bright red light moving very slowly toward my location, appx north to south.  I first assumed that this was normal air traffic (probably around 30-35 degrees above the northern horizon)  but it was moving slower than what I thought was normal.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my head away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back at the light, there was a second light, white and not as bright moving from appx west to east at a faster, but not very fast speed. Had this been a 2-D screen, the second light would have been slightly below the red light.  It did not seem to be moving fast enough for me NOT to have seen it before I turned my head, i.e. it seemed to appear from nowhere.   After about 30 seconds, the white light just went out.  This got me kind of excited and I continued to watch the red light which never blinked as much as it sort of flickered, now much closer to my location still moving VERY slowly.  At times it seemed as though the light had come to a stop.  As it continued moving toward to the south (now about 45 degrees off the horizon) I realized that it had become more copperish orange in color.  I am almost sure that it came to a stop and then began moving more easterly.  It moved very slowly for maybe 20 seconds before in dimmed to the brightness of a dim star and then went out.  I kept looking for about 2 more minutes before I decided it was not going to reappear and I had to go back inside (I was at work and was watching from the first floor roof of my job site, taking my coffee break checking out the sky as I always do on my overnight shift.)  The moon was somewhat overhead and could be seen fairly clearly through a thin clould layer.  There was a slight ring around it and I could see a bright star, actually probably the planet Jupiter through this same thin cloud layer.  There was a slight band of heavier clouds between the moon and where I saw the lights but I am 90% sure that the lights did not disappear behind any clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red (to orange)light moved in a straight line until just before it disappeared when it appeared to stop for a moment or two and then began heading east. (Again, the very slow speed of the object was, to me, very strange and what really kept my attention.)  I agree that a white light moving slowly and then disappearing, under other conditions, would beg to be labeled a satellite, but the conditions at this<n> <n><n> location, in that direction and under these weather conditions was not right for a satellite.  One of my hobbies on weekend nights, when I do not work is to sit in my backyard and hope to see meteors.  I have seen many satellites and I would bet the farm that this was not one.  This light, though not<n> <n><n> blinding was at least as bright as Jupiter, considering that Jupiter was dimmed somewhat by the icy haze in the air.  It seemed too low in the sky to have been a satellite and the fact that it appeared so suddenly and so close to the red light (probably two to three fingers width at arms length &#34;lower&#34; than the red light) was at best very coincidental.  The location I was at is just not conducive to seeing satellites.  One cannot even see stars that low in the sky facing north.  Its just too close to downtown Tulsa.  Too much light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I could be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) in OKlahoma<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS Say hi to Jeff for me next time you are on the show.<n>
12/31/01 23:20|Victoria (Canada)|BC|Disk|20 seconds|My wife and I observed a dark brown/black disk shaped object with a dome of sorts on its top.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20950.html|2|ndxe200112| My wife and I observed a dark brown/black disk shaped object with a dome of sorts on its top.  I did not report this to you yesterday after having seen the object (although I did send an email to the local newspaper asking whether anyone else had seen the object), as I was hesitant to do so since, firstly, we both thought perhaps it was a balloon of some sort, and secondly because I had previously reported a &#34;star-like object making erratic movements&#34; some months ago, and felt that my credibility may have been suspect by making a second report - this one more &#39;outrageous&#39; than the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I do want to report this, primarily because I would like to find out whether the object has in fact been positively identified as a balloon, and/or whether anyone else had seen it.  As it was travelling due south, it may have been observed by others in Victoria, and in Port Angeles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event this is what I/we saw: I had the day off from work (I work as a paralegal with the B.C. ((deleted/government employee))) and after a night of poor sleep, I thought to get a nap on the livingroom couch at about 11:15.  Unable to fall asleep as planned, I lay on the couch looking out the livingroom window. Within a few minutes the object came into view and, in relation to a highrise about 9 stories high about a block from our home, it appeared to be moving somewhat above the highrise and to its left (east).  I generally do not like to speculate on an object&#39;s height unless I know how large it is in fact, and cannot say how large this object was. I can say that if one scaled the object down, it was when I first saw it about the size of a twonie (two-dollar coin) held at arms length, in otherwords quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Admittedly, I was wearing my glasses which are not a precise prescription (I usually wear my contact lenses when out and about - which actually give me slightly better than 20/20 vision). Had the object been much farther away, I would not have seen it well enough even to think it may have been something unusual.  However, because of its relatively close proximity, I was able to see what appeared to be a dome on its top and a disk shaped underside that seemed to dip slightly back and forth while moving generally south. Again, it is unfortunate that I was not wearing my contacts, since I believe that it also tipped slightly at an angle forward in a south east direction (imagine holding a pan in front of you and tipping it forward to look at its bottom), revealing its underside, and at that same time swooped a few degrees to the left and back before resuming a straight course south.  Like I say I would have gotten a much clearer view had I worn my contacts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after seeing it and realizing it was something unusual, I called to my wife Leann (a teacher, off for the Christmas break)who was in another room.  She came quickly to the livingroom. I pointed through the window to the object, and said &#34;what is that?&#34;.  At the time that she arrived it had moved far enough off and was less than the size of a dime at arms length. She ran for the binoculars, but by the time we got out the front door for a clear look it had disappeared.  I asked Leann if she had seen the dome on the top, which she did.  She seemed to think it may have been a balloon, and because I was not seeing it as clearly as I might have, I have been inclined to defer to her better eyesight.  However, a few things seem to militate against it being a balloon: 1) it was moving very quickly and it was not windy (at least not at ground elevation) 2) it appeared to slow down, almost hover, and then accelerate 3) it moved side to side 4) it was disk shaped and dark - what balloon has these characteristics?<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, I am not drawing any conclusions and really only want to find out if I am corroborating other sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the reply.  Yes, you may pass on my report and this email to the UFO BC group.  Perhaps they are in contact with those parties who would know whether or not a weather balloon was in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I neglected to mention in my report that later yesterday evening, during a New Year&#39;s evening get-together, a fellow mentioned that he and some co-workers had seen the object while taking a break at the time (which he thought was about 11:30 am).  They work at ((deleted)), a ((deleted)) operation located approximately a block to the west of where our house is situated (this is an in-city operation -  near downtown Victoria).  ((name deleted)), the fellow who said he saw the object, said he didn&#39;t pay that much attention to it, but indicated that his co-workers were looking at it with some degree of excitement, as they also were not certain what it was.  I understand, however, that they decided in the end that it Just have been a balloon.  This is, of course, hearsay, and if you&#39;d like I can ask ((name deleted)) to get one or more of his co-workers who saw the object to contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned in my HMTL report, it seems to me that there are reasons for thinking that this was not a balloon, but my curiosity has been sufficiently twigged that I would like to find out if any weather balloons were in the sky at the time (it almost certainly wasn&#39;t a regular blow-up balloon).  If there were, then it seems we could rule out other possibilities.  Frankly, I don&#39;t know what weather balloons look like - if they are dark/black and disk-shaped and generally move quite rapidly at relatively low altitude, then I suppose that is what this could have been.<n>

12/31/01 15:00|Dallas|TX|Circle|several minutes|Perfect Circle UFO Spotted at 30,000 Feet|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21017.html|5|ndxe200112| Perfect Circle UFO Spotted at 30,000 Feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on an American Airlines flight 1566 from Dallas, TX heading to National Airport in DC.  Our takeoff time was delayed and we left Dallas at approximately 2:15 p.m. Dallas Time.  Upon reaching cruising altitude (33,000 feet), I opened my window flap (I usually keep it closed during takeoffs and landings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, our plane is flying above the clouds with about 1/3 of the horizon and sky visible.  I cannot see land beneath the plane.  I noticed a solid white round object several thousand feet lower than my plane and located up to the North and East of my window (and the plane).  At first, trying to rationalize, I think it is a bird.  Realizing birds do not fly at 30,000 feet, I continue to watch the object.  It seems to hover or float.  Eventually, it is directly in line with my window (but at the same distance away.  I surmise that at 500 mph, we have caught up with it, and it has not moved.  Didn&#39;t see it move at that point.  Still it appears to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, rationalizing further, I think it might be a weather balloon.  I have never seen a weather balloon, though, so I am not sure.  No sooner do I process that thought, then the white object moves to the West.  It is still for a moment and then, shoots out in a diagonal of a north-westerly route and disappears in seconds into the horizon.<n>

I wrote down this information but cannot find it, so the time is approximate, but everything else is quite accurate.  I was watching the skies as I always do, and it was a mostly sunny day (having driven beyond the mostly cloudy skies nearer Albuquerque), and noticed a black shape in the sky which I first guessed was a bird gliding over the beautiful desert landscape.  But it was quite high and it did appear to be approaching relatively quickly from the East/Southeast, flying to the North/Northwest.  As I watched, I saw that it was appeared to be a small, black disk, flying VERY rapidly, and as it passed just to the east of me I examined it as closely as possible, determining there were no wings or other appendages.  So it could have been a cigar-shaped object, except that as it crossed the highway behind the car (perhaps 2 miles north of the car, which was travelling south, continuing to the North/Northwest, I saw that it did not change shape, therefore it appeared to be a solid disk-shaped (or round) vehicle.  I judged it as travelling several hundred miles per hour, and while it is very hard to judge the size, it must have been between about 20 to 50 feet in diameter.  I did manage to grab my binoculars but due to being in the car and it moving so quickly, could not bring it entirely into perfect focus, but can confirm it was a solid, black, apparently round object (seen from the side).<n>

The object remained very bright for about 20 to 30 seconds, and then light dimmed to a small white object/ball while still moving ahead of the fighter jet going west.  This happened every 7 to 8 minutes for 45 minutes. Every time the sound of the fighter jet would approach, the objects light would appear in the same spot moving in the same direction, continuing to dim and move in a somewhat fast pace, always ahead of the fighter jet.  It seems they were going in circles from west to south to east and north. The night was extremely clear with a full moon. What do you think????<n>

There were about 8 of us looking at it when what we thought were stars ,what we were looking at started to dart and shoot all over the sky.  There were so many!.  Some lined up in order and then just went off in their own direction. just to zip back nd forth. Others looked like they were playing a game of cat &amp; mouse.  They were darting all over the sky for the longest.  It was so strange that I ran back into the restaurant and called the people inside out to see it.  We were all in shock and disblief..<n>

We witnessed an object which appeared quite large in the sky above us.  It was hard to see a shape, it seemed to be moving in and out of the cloud cover, or changing shape.  It was black and had no visible lights.  This lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  Then about 1 minute later, we saw a black, disc-shaped object fall like a leaf out of the sky, above some trees approximately 1/2 mile away.  After this was seen, we noticed more movement in the same area of the falling object.  The first thing I thought was, oh, they&#39;re hang gliding!  So, it almost looked like 2 objects in the clouds at this point, maybe triangular shaped.  They seemed to be moving playfully, but it was very hard to tell because they (or it) were in and out of the cloud cover like before.  We never noticed the falling object coming back up or actually landing.I was able to watch the movement in the clouds for about 10 seconds then they (or it) disappeared, seemingly flying into heavier cloud cover.These objects or object appeared to be floating or hovering and actually changing shape with the clouds - it&#39;s quite hard to describe. There was absolutely no wind, or sound at all.  We thought of kites, hang gliders, planes, weather balloons, none of which seem to fit what we witnessed. We continued to watch the sky for the next 20 minutes, but saw nothing else unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted to MUFON by same witness.  PD))<n>

He observed a huge black object above him, seemingly cloaked in the clouds.  It was a calm day, with a partial cloud cover, no wind at all.  He watched the object(s) for a minute then ran in to yell for me to &#34;come now PLEASE!&#34; I ran outside and he related to me what he had seen, since the object was no longer there.  He described it as a huge black &#34;wall&#34;, but it almost seemed to be changing shapes within the cloud.  He said it was at least 2 football fields in length from his perspective.  I continued to watch the sky with him and about 1 minute later, we both observed a solid, black disc shaped object fall like a leaf from the clouds, about 1/2 mile from where the object originally was seen by my husband.  It seemed to be heading N/NW This was seen above the treeline, so we didn&#39;t see where it went, just that it fell.  Then directly above that, in the clouds again, I saw what appeared to be two large black objects &#34;dancing&#34; in the clouds.  I immediately said &#34;oh, look honey, they&#39;re hang-gliders!&#34;  But they were seemingly quite large, in fact it could have been one object, as the clouds were obscuring parts of whatever I was seeing.  They or it continued moving for about 10 seconds, then completely disappeared into the cloud cover.  This is the first time my husband or I has witnessed anything remotely unexplainable in the sky.  We are at a complete loss as to how to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve thought of kites, hang-gliders, balloons, airplanes, blimps, stealth bombers, none of it seems to fit.  There were no visible lights on the object(s), it was just big and black.  It made no noise whatsoever, and there was no wind at all.  It was afternoon, with about 1 hour left of good daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional, working in the health care field here in town.

The craft was about 50 yards in total length and almost as wide. The craft appeared to be at an altitude of 50 feet, made no sound at all and was traveling at a slow rate of speed (approx 25mph)heading south east toward the &#34;Little Belt&#34; mountains. As the&#34;Black&#34; craft flew over the point of observation, it was observed that it had a low glow of perimiter lights of pulsing greenish blue. As the craft exited over a small portion of the city it was opserved to dissapear or blend into the street lights rendering it unobservable with the exception that one could still make out the movement of the craft as it was blanking out the street lights when the craft got between the street lights and the point of observation. Once the craft exited the east notrheast portion of the city and proceeded over wheat fields the craft was no longer observable. It is interesting to note that in the local Great Falls news, we have had reports of cattle mutalations in the area.<n>

My family and I had gone out for my birthday that evening.  It was a beautiful night with a full moon.  The restaurant door opens on a corner so it made it so condusive to looking up to the moon.It looked like the sky was full of stars but then they started to move.  I don&#39;t mean like a shooting star, it was like each one had a mind of its own.  They each moved in their own direction, then about 5 lined up straight then took off in opposite directions, some looked like they were playing tag, it was wild.  None of us could believe what we were seeing.  The star balls were doing this for so long that I ran back into the restaurant and called the people who were inside to look at what was going on.  Everyone ran outside and were freaking out.  I&#39;ll never forget that sky.<n>

We kept on looking at it and we freeked cuz it wasn&#39;t moving, so we desided to follow it, it looked like a bright light, but after driving for about 10 min it began looking like somekind of a saucer, we stopped on a quiet street watching it for about 3-4 min huvering in mid air about a 1 km over the ground, all of the sudden with great speed it zoomed down to the ground, ending up about 500 meters away from us and about 50 meters off the ground. It was there for about another minute or so and then all of the sudden it went into a big flash leaving us blinded from the light for about 2 seconds and then when we focused back in that area it was gone. It was truly the most incredibly wierd thing i have ever sen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was at my office off of Enclave Pkwy on the westside of Houston.  It was dark and the time was about 6:30 pm.  The sky was clear and the temperature was about 60 degrees.  I was standing outside waiting for my ride and I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a very bright white light very high in the sky moving north to south.  I watched light move across the sky for about 10 seconds before it faded out. Light was moving too slowly to be a meteor. I first observed light directly overhead and the light traversed approx. 45 degrees of sky in approx. 10 seconds before fading out.  The size of the light was about the same as the surrounding stars.<n>

A winter storm was moving in and snow was forecast. This craft was hovering over a mountain range,in line-site of my position.I used the interstate to gauge it&#39;s size,and estimated it at over a mile and a half in lenght.It had sequential running lights that illuminated the clouds that were just above the immense craft.I have seen every known military plane,blimp,tanker,helicopter and stealth included.My esteemed colligue got a deathly white sheen to his face and would not come out of his personal jeep and quit 2 weeks later,no explanation.It re-appeared 2 more times in different location&#39;s but never too far from this gold mine it was hovering over.I,myself have seen more than i am writing about today,i just find it hard to belive that no one saw this gigantic craft making no bones about hiding,or playing hide and seek.Incidently,the next night,we were visited by 2 attack cobras who sat and watched us for god knows how long,until i cranked up the track hoe to feed the incinerator,and had to flick on the floods.As soon as i was aware of their presence,they circled our site several times,scanning us with a green laser light and i flicked my day-lighters in approval and the left at a high rate of speed going directly towards that gold mine.I have never seen attack helicopters fly in such miserable weather.My co-partner didn&#39;t want any mention of this to anyone,like it shook his very religious foundation,he was scared,i know scared and he was babbling like a child.ME,i turned the track hoe to face it and kept flicking my day-lighters in the hope they would come and see who was behind those lights.The back ground was a unique canvas,snow cloud white and a deck down to 9500 fett and the immense reflection from the circulating lights gave a crystal clear image of size,color and pure mavolence.I felt at ease,no panic.you see,i felt as these were friends,like we had met before.As i said earlier,i have many a tale to tell,maybe we can converse on another time,another report,maybe even meet some day.I am a regular guy,i have an associates degree in structural engineering and an advanced degree in heavy equipment operation.My name is barry,and you should be able to gleen my e-mail from this.Thank you sooooooooo much for reading my story.<n>

The object had bright white lights with maybe 1 or 2 small red ones.  I was wathcing the object above the tree line wondering what it could be.  I thought since it was around christmas time it might be some sort of ornament.  As I got closer probably 100 yards out, I slowed my vehicle to a stand still to get a better look. The object was probably the size of a basketball court or a little smaller. Upon stopping I noticed the object hovering(standing still)In no more than 5 seconds it went from a dead stand still to an ubrupt fast sprint forward and after a few seconds began to slow.  I through my truck in reverse and drove backwards somewhat parallel to the object, the horizon grew higher with trees and I eventually lost it.  I figured I would drive out to the main rd, which was higher in elevation to see the thing departing in the distance.  It didnt take any more than 20 seconds to get to the high elevation, and there was nothing to be seen.  It either descended into the woods, or departed very very quick.  The way the thing moved and looked, was nothing similar to any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  we spoke with this individual, and found him to be a credible witness.

Any who, in my experience growing up around all these different  aircrafts, I have never seen one that looked or flew like the one I just saw.  So here&#39;s the story, I was on my parents up stairs balcony gradually commiting suicide (smoking a ciggarete in other words),  when all of a sudden accross the lake past the road, out in the forrest (i&#39;m guestimating approximatly 8 miles away) I noticed a light (which at first i thought had to have been a meteor) followed by a triangular shaped hover craft (it was unusually bigger craft)zoom out of an area, of possibly a very remote housing area but more likey is forrestry, it zoomed up about 30 or 40 feet, stopped dead in it&#39;s tracks (which i have NEVER seen an aircraft accomplish) then just zoomed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the time indicated above is the correct time for the event.

I stopped dead in my tracks and watched as this object move across the tree line and disappeared into the distance heading North east at low altitude. I thought to my self that this object looked so low as if it was going to crash in the distance. I stood there for about three or four minutes just couldn&#39;t believe what I just saw. I waited to see If I could here any noise but there was nothing, just a small noise from the distant chopper I had seen earlier.<n>

By the time I said, &#39;What&#39;s that up there?&#39; and my girl friend glanced up, the dot disappeared out of view.  I know this wasn&#39;t a meteor because we had just seen the Leonid meteor shower just a few weeks prior and this object moved much slower and didn&#39;t leave a trail.  The object took about 5-8 seconds to traverse half the sky.  I&#39;ve been told that it could have been a satellite but being the winter time, the sun wasn&#39;t going to be rising for over an hour plus I&#39;m not familiar with there being many satellites flying south to north over the islands, they&#39;re usually east to west.  It could have been a plane too, but there weren&#39;t any other lights except for just that one dot, and there wasn&#39;t any sillouette as it crossed other stars.  Also, I&#39;ve never seen aircraft flying over the sky that early in the morning and going in that particular direction.  F.Y.I.  I periodically stargaze on early Sunday mornings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an unrelated event, sometime in 1995 or 96, I recall seeing a series of bright blue light beams shooting up from a fixed point along the Koolau mountain ridge near the Pali Highway area.  This blast of 3-4 distinct beams shot up like a spot light and lit up the sky and clouds in the area.  The beams moved very fast and independantly of each other (some angled as low as 45 degrees to the horizon), however it only lasted for about 5 seconds.  Keep in mind that there are no houses that far up on the ridges and why anyone whould have powerful spotlights that deep in the woods for a 5 second show is beyond me.  This was viewed by my roommate and I while we were talking outside our appartment walkway on the 7th floor (located on the corner of ((deleted)) St. &amp; Kapiolani Blvd.) at around 10 p.m.  Nothing was ever mentioned about it on the tv news or the newspapers the next day.<n>

On Christmas Day night at 6:42 p.m. a family of 4 were on their way from Sioux City, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska on I-29 (southbound, about 3 miles north of the North Omaha Exit which turns west on I-680) when they sighted a lighted object about 1/2 mile ahead of their vehicle.  As their vehicle neared the white-lighted object, they saw that it was hovered near the opposite side of I-29 approximately 500-600 feet ahead and diagonally to their left (SE) of the witnesses&#39; vehicle, at an estimated altitude of 500 feet.  (Investigation shows that the cloud ceiling was 2,200 feet, so we at least know that the object was below 2,200 feet.  Without the ability to be more specific, what seems obvious is that the sighting was close, and at fairly low altitude.)  Traffic on the northbound side of I-29 had slowed down drastically, with 4 vehicles pulled over, and with at least one individual standing outside his vehicle looking up at the object.  The bright lights, seeming to present a visual crown effect, and perceived by the witnesses to be somewhat smaller than an airliner, suddenly did a &#34;back flip&#34; - that is, the lights did a 360 degree turn, as the object rose straight up and ascended through the cloud ceiling.  Three (3) of the four (4) witnesses were interviewed at the site, the father and two adolescents, age 11 and 12.  The adult witness is a thoughtful type individual, with no apparent desire to embellish or over-conclude.  The two adolescents are intelligent youth, fascinated and amazed by what they saw and articulately willing to share their perception of the incident.  They exhibited nothing giddy or frivolous as they described and drew sketches of their perceptions of the incident.  As an investigator, I consider this a multiple witness sighting with 3 good witnesses, who from their position in the family van had a good vantage! point f rom which to view an anomalous object.  While this is essentially a &#34;lights in the sky&#34; kind of sighting, with only an impression of curved edges, which might suggest a boomerang or disk,the bright lights, the low altitude, the nearness of the object to a heavy trafficway, and the report of a &#34;back-flip&#34; as the object rose straight up, make it an interesting case for examination, even though no other reports were called in to local law enforcement, and FAA at Eppley Airfield indicated nothing unusual on radar.<n>

The object, exhibiting a few different bright colors, seemed to stop, hover, then move up and down before disappearing completely.  The unacceptable movements of the craft are what keep me so skeptical.  A westchester county newspaper the following business day reported that a stealth bomber was on routine post 9/11 patrol lit up for Christmas.  I, however, cannot believe this report as again, the craft was moving in such ways that cannot be explained by our modern day aircraft.  I can accept that perhaps it was a harrier jet, but I do not know which alitute hovering limitations the jet has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

She pointed it out to me and I thought at first that it was an airplane. What I saw was a red light that seemed to pulse, however, after watching it for a few moments I asked my girlfriend to go and get the video camera from inside the house. The light moved around in a small area of the sky above and to the south of our home. It was at times very bright and moved in many different directions. It took a moment but I managed to get the camera focused in on it. At that moment my girlfriend ran and got the neighbors to show them what we were seeing. They too thought the light was very unusual. The most exciting thing happend whem I watched the tape I had made which was zoomed in to the object 16x. The object was close to another object or what may have been a star that can be used as a reference point. The larger red object seemed to move very quickly and stop very ubruptly and them move away some of this effect can possibly be atributed to the zooming of the lens but some of the movement is so obvious that I can&#39;t even beleive what I am seeing. Perhaps someone can direct me to a person or institution that can assit me in either explaining this or ? The video is approxamately 5 min. long on vhs C<n>

It was difficult to judge the height of this light because I couldn&#39;t make out any object. Suddenly, the light dropped straight down out of the sky towards the ground where it disappeared (before actually reaching the ground). My mother was in a car in front of me. I called her when I got home asking if she saw anything on her way home. She described the same light to me. There was more detail in her description. She witnessed a &#34;cluster of lights&#34; that hung in the air, then suddenly fell towards the ground, whereupon they disappeared as well.<n>

The closer I got to it, the more it looked like two lights. When I was nearly beside it, it seemed to be about 1500 to 2000 feet up and just sitting still. While going past it, I lowered my window with the radio turned completely down, and I heard no sound. I could barely see the shape of a triangle. In the front, two lights were noticeable, one at one corner, and one at another. A third light was observed at the back (apex) that was much dimmer. It was not a helicopter, as I am an EMT who has been around them before and know their sounds. I had my Cb radio on and didn&#39;t hear anyone else saying they saw it. Visibility was clear and stars could be seen in the background. With the thumb out, this object was about the size of my thumbnail.<n>

After a half hour of driving we got pretty close to it and that is when i actually saw the smoke being distributed from something. It was a line of smoke, very dark, and then a few seconds latter looked like the other smoke puffs. While the smoke was coming out, right above in the clouds, I saw a line of black dots. It was deffinitly something solid and very large. I know they were not clouds. Something was dispensing that stuff.<n>

So we were about to leave the bike and drive away when a cigar shaped object appeared in front of us, it was about 300 meters ahead of us. There was a humming noise out of it. It was about 50-65 meters in diameter. Leaving a trail like a glowing cloud, then an identical UFO appeared and they orbited each other for about a dozen seconds or so. One of them accelerated away with blinding speed, emmiting a large amount of light. The other one at some point had stopped leaving a trail, and dissapeared like it was a light in the sky being turned off. When I got back in my car I found it would not start. Then my freind said he got the bike working, then after three or four tries the car started. I drove off and found that I had arrived at the house about an hour later than I should have. Which seemed ridiculous because I had been stopped for no more than 5 minutes.

Suddenly i saw 3 flying objects looking like satelites. But they were too fast. Four or five times the speed of a satelite. They flew in a triangle formation and suddenly the last of them flew with an incredible speed from left to right and then back into formation. They flew so high, too high for any known plane. They were definitely outer space because one moment you could see them and one moment not. That was the proof for me that they changed the altitude so that the sunlight couldn&#39;t reflect them when they dived into the earths shadow.<n>

It&#39;s not moving and it was as bright as a star at night but it was 4:40 pm . This thing was way up there because we saw two airliners I know for sure and it was way higher. after a 10 minutes of watching we saw a smaller sphere or orb, It looked the same but smaller also metallic. The smaller object then vanished or desolved,That&#39;s the way it looked anyway.But soon after I would say 5 minutes the larger sphere began to move slowly away. niether object did any quick u-turns or fast zig zags. Just a slow ,very slow silent parting. These objects looked to me like the one&#39;s caught on film in Mexico.<n>

The first oval flew slowly towards the sun in the west and the 2nd soon followed.  The third started to follow,then changed direction and went the opposite way.  It turned slightly and I saw a metalic flash.  After about 15 seconds the ovals were gone.  We ran back to my house and got binoculars and a camera.  We returned and watched for the ovals again. Two small private planes flew by low but they didn&#39;t look like the things we saw, plus the third oval had changed direction and planes can&#39;t do that.  The sky was also clear and sunny.<n>

I noticed several small, silver objects in the sky.  At first I thought they were balloons.  They were approximately as big around as a large pizza, from what I could see from 1/4 mile away.  The objects were round/spherical and silver.  Very shiny, the sun was out for a change and glinted off of them.  I think 3 of the objects were hovering or floating above the river/mooring basin. The height in the sky ranged from (guessing here,,,) 200 to 400 yards.  The original 3 came from the West. Then they were joined by 5 more.  These seem to have come from the East.  They hovered together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the trees and the bushes.  There was not really much wind.  Not enough to make balloons move that rapidly.  I don&#39;t know how fast they moved, but it was rapid and kind of decisive.  I really thought they were balloons, did not pay a ton of attention until the group of 8 divided and 3 zipped over the hill, in a SW direction and the others zipped in an Easterly direction.  The movement of these objects was not a bobbing or weaving, slow motion, as a balloon would move when tossed by the wind.  It was decisive, quick.  Don&#39;t know what else to say except that I don&#39;t beleive they were balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

It is about a 15 min drive from Grimsby to Hamilton, and as my 2 friends chatted away, I kept watching this bright star.  It struck me funny as it seemed to be stationary, then go slightly lower in the sky and then up, and when it looked like it moved slightly north of the highway and then back to the other side, that&#39;s when I said, what the hell is that and my 2 friends noticed it.  I had been watching the light for a good 7-8 min before speaking aloud.  We all watched in silence for a couple a minuits as we neared the outskirts of Hamilton.  It was on the left side of my vehicle and the closer we got, the higher in the sky it seemed.  I then realized it was hovering way above the large chimney stack of a recycling plant about 3 blocks south of the highway.  the chimney is about 6 storeys high and on any given day, there is a wisp of smoke coming out and the winds grab right away and it changes direction almost as soon as it leaves the stack.  What I saw, was a huge column of smoke coming out, several times wider the the mouth of the chimney and going straight up, maybe 40 storeys and this light seemed mostly in the top part of the smoke which made it strangely reflective(like lights in a fog)on this clear night.  As we were now almost parallel with the chimney, I was pressing my face every couple of seconds against my window trying to look at this and it was now the thing was almost straight up(and I was still driving and could only glance every couple of seconds). There was only the sound of my truck engine. The funny thing is, I told my self that some construction company was building some huge structu! re behind this wall of smoke, beside the chimney, and that&#39;s where all these lights were coming from(but, there is no huge structure in the area and the chimney is the tallest thing). At that moment, the highway turns 90 degrees, and that was the last we saw of it.  One of my 2 friends saw 3 lights on top but what I remember the most was, when right beside it, looking at this incredible volume of smoke coming out of the chomney stack and hiding the entire bottom of this huge circular object but on the edges were all these different colors reflecting off the smoke and the smoke was rising thick and perfectly vertical at least 40 stories and, I had been watching this, light, for the entire time as it grew in size the closer we got.  I checked the local paper the next day, radio stations and even have a business account 1 block away from the recycling plant, but nary a word.<n>

Then it started moving west towards the Los Angeles Airport.  Then it stoped for a commercial Airplane to pass as it was on approch to LAX.  The craft move a little south to give the airplane a little move room to pass.  Then continued to LAX and stopped moving.  The craft just stayed motionless over LAX for about 10 minutes until some cloud cover eventulally blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object or the light source emitting directly out of the body of the craft was circular in shape and was bright white. A filled in V shaped white light rose above the craft about three times the height of the craft and moved side to side in a scanning motion until just before the craft headed West, then the light on top went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to see the actual craft itself because of the intensness of the light emitting from the body of the craft.  There was no sound that I could hear comming from the craft itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfotunately I was so intrigued with what I was seeing I din&#39;nt grab my Vedio Camera and I did&#39;nt varify the time.

The lights were too far away from each other to be on one airplane but they seemed connected to each other. The lights seemed to move sort of erratically around and it seemed that the distance between them would vary. This lasted for about two minutes then they got too far away to see. I recall the lights being red, white and maybe green and there was no noise. It all happend too quickly to remember exactly what it looked like but it was vary strange.<n>

(my wife doesn&#39;t get into that kind of stuff like i do)  i watched it trail almost directly overhead in an easterly direction then slightly bank.  it still continued in an easterly direction but the color changed to a very brilliant red and seemed to either be on fire or reflecting the sun, considering it&#39;s apparent altitude.  i have studied aircraft for years and had even started pilot training several years ago.  (ran out of money)  i would judge the altitude to be something upwards of 50,000 ft.  it initially appeared to be a satellite.  i watched it seem to leave a &#39;dust&#39; trail as it slowly seemed to burn up.  perhaps it could have been a deliberate attempt to destroy some &#39;space junk&#39;.  i&#39;m not sure.  i thought that it would be unusual to &#39;destroy&#39; a satellite in that manner, though probably not completely out of the question.  the entire viewing pleasure lasted approximately 7-15 seconds.  who knows.  perhaps there were more sets of eyes that had the privilege of seeing the abnormality, as well.<n>

The couple was driving toward Cresecent City from Manteno, IL. They looked out the window in a northerly direction and reportedly observed a large, dark triangular-shaped object in the sky halfway up from the horizon. The object they described was estimated to be 100 feet in length and had three circles of whitish-orange light (one positioned at each corner of the triangle). As they observed the object, it slowly moved from the north to the southwest. It did not appear to change altitude during the sighting. While it was in the general vicinity, the radio in their vehicle had interference. The witnesses stated they observed the object for approximately 15 minutes and supposedly were able to videotape the object during this time. However, after repeated requests by the case investigator to view the tape, the witness has failed to produce it. In addition, the credibility of the witnesses was judged to be low based on other factors.

As the brilliance intensified it also increased it&#39;s speed significantly to twice the speed it had been originally moving and also changed direction slightly by perhaps one or two degrees. At the same time there was a plane in the sky moving from the west towards the east and this object seemed to pass under it rapidly.

I  saw a very bright circular object above the tress. it wasnt too close t the trees, it was as far as a helicopter would be. I thought it was just a helicopter. But to my amazment it wasn&#39;t. what i did was i opened the window and expected to hear the helicopter but all i heard was a low humm. It was very low, then we got scared and tried to hide ourself with the window curtains. Amazingly it turned from bright white to a less brighter orange. then the circular thing got dim.

I saw three sphere shaped objects high in the sky.  I believe they were silver, as the sun was brightly reflected off of them.  What caught my eye was that one of the spheres was making impossible movements.  It was moving back and forth in perfect swinging pendulum types movements.   It was moving very quickly like this, back and forth for some time.  I parked my car in a parkin lot on Ynez and Winchester Road and continued to watch a bit longer.  There were two other sphere shaped objects above, however, they remained stationary.  At one point, the sphere that was moving had attracted two large hawks to it.  The two birds and the sphere seemed to engage in a playful game together.  I think this is significant because comparing the sphere to the birds, I would say the sphere would be about 3 to 4 feet in diameter.  I sat and watched this for about 45 minutes total.  At 1300 hrs, I ducked my head back into my car (I had been standing outside of my car) just long enough to unbuckle my baby from his car seat.  When I got him out, and looked back into the sky, all that was left was the two birds. There were no signs of the spheres anywhere.<n>

It looked to be approximatly 500 to 1500 feet up in the sky, and approximatly 1 mile from our current position. At first glance it appeared to be a plane heading in our direction which would be to the southwest. Almost immediatly it was determined by myself and the driver of the car that it was not an ordinary aircraft. At first there were two lights in the front of the craft positioned when an ordinary commercial airliner would have its headlights. The two lights were at least 10-15 feet in diameter and were blinking on and off one at a time. (one off and then one on again). On the top of the craft were a number of small, bright blinking lights maybe 5 or 6. These lights were similar to what you would see on the top of a tower antenna. (a very bright strobe affect). There did not appear to be any determinable shape or angles to the craft. There was no shape of a wing or tail found on either a plane or helicopter. As we got closer we saw that there was another large bright white light turning on and off in a pettern with the first two lights that were seen. As we approached the craft it appeared to be completely stationary just to the side of the interstate. I then stuck my head out the window and observed the same bright lights that wre in the front and side of the craftin what now appeared to be the rear of the craft. We were now going approximatly 60 mph and as soon as I brought my head into the car to get a better view from the rear window it had completely disappeared from the sky. We scoured the sky for maybe two more minutes to find any sign of the craft, which had appeared to have disappeared. It was still very light out at that time of day and the craft appeared to be black or grey in color. There was a group of about five cars driving in the group with us and all of the people in the other cars had appeared to acknowledge the craft and ha! d baffel ed looks on their faces. Myself and the driver of the vehicle could not think of any type of craft that we knew of that this may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite lucid and credible  PD))<n>

I noticed a very strange object in the sky after I developed the film. We never noticed anything that day whilst taking the pictures. This was taken in a remote part of our country with no air routes passing over this area. I took the photo to the Cape town planetarium and the are as baffled as I am. They inspected the negatives for possible dust images or any other likely distortions on the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting thing was that I took three pictures at the same place within the space of less than one minute and this object only appears in the last photo. The object is at an angle with the sun reflecting on the top part and casting a shadow on the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will post the picture on the web as soon as I have the access to the equipment to do so.<n>

My boyfriend said it looked like a glowing football, I thought it looked like a disc.  I was very fast and it seemed like it was producing it&#39;s own light.  It made no sound and left no trail of itself being there.  The sky had a few cirrus clouds, the majority of the sky was clear.  There was only one and I could see it until it met the the line of trees that border the horizon, it continued to glow the entire time.<n>

My initial impression was that of a hang-glider due to triangular shape and lack of sound emination. The object was approximately 300 feet in length and was at a height of 500-1,000 feet heading due south.  Best guess of speed was approx. 150-200 kts.  I observed 5 reddish-orange lights on the right/starboard side of the craft.  I was not able to see the lights after the craft had traveled a quarter-mile from me.  I am a retired Navy veteran with extensive air controll experience.  It was a very clear and bright night with CAVU conditions.  Had I not been looking upward, I would have probably not seen the object.  I live in a highly populated rsidential area.<n>

The object was low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a trip when a young man mentioned seeing a triangle-shaped ship in Columbia/Waterloo, Illinois.

He stated that the ship was gian, cigar-shaped, silent and moved very slowly over the lake - they witnessed this from a balcony of the place where they were staying (hotel/condo?). They said that the ship slowly turned and then shot away at extraordinary speeds. Also, they said that some of the lights were intensely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates approximate date.

12/15/01 19:20|Greensboro|NC|Triangle|5 Minutes|Faint amber colored, Triangular shaped object with moving spheres within the structure|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20833.html|96|ndxe200112| Faint amber colored, Triangular shaped object with moving spheres within the structure<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday night, my wife and I with a friend went out to eat at the Carrabbas resturaunt in Greensboro, NC.  We had a two hour wait, and we waited outside.  We were sitting on the bench looking out to the north and I noticed a very, faint amber colored triangular shaped object moving to the southeast.  The UFO phenomena has always interested me and I am always looking in the sky, but most of the time I am able to rule out a classic UFO.  99.9% of the time I can identify it, but this time, it was strange.  As it got closer, to overhead, but not completely I noticed that within its triangular structure it appeared to have many spheres or &#34;orbs&#34; interchanging within it.  The entire craft remained the faint amber color, although the spheres appeared to be more translucent.  My curiousity in the object, attracted a crowd who also were waiting to go inside and they all saw the same thing, including my wife and friend.  One lady even let out a startled yell.  A few gasps were also heard.  Out of the group of us who witnessed the event one lady said that they were just ballons, but the size of the object at that altitude would have meant the balloon cluster would be huge, and it retained a definitive shape, at least the outline did, the rest of the craft did appear to morph somewhat.  We watched it as it went off in the distant night sky toward the southeast, towards Fayetteville, NC.  I&#39;m not sure of the altitude, I approximate it at probably 1000 feet or so.  The first sight of it looked like a jetliner with its lights on coming into land, but shrouded by heavy cloudcover(thats what the shape appeared as intially) It was a clear cold night, only high level cirrus clouds were barely visible.  It was not a helicopter, jet, or hot air balloon or geese.  This was clearly unidentified, in my opinion.  I have also reported this sighting to MUFON.<n>

I thought it was just an airplane as I couldn&#39;t see it clearly at first, but I kept looking at it as I was surprised in the large amount of area it was lighting up.  It was moving from North to West, now very rapidly, still blinking, then I saw its huge enormous size as it was blinking and realized that this wasn&#39;t an airplane, and had to be a ufo, no doubt in my mind. Triangular shape, very large, moving down West closer down into the mountains, outlined in red blinking lights.  I saw it out of the window as my mother was driving down the freeway.<n>

As I crossed the White River Bridge there apeared to be a large blue-white light in about 20 to 30 feet above the treeline. I watched as it came towards me at a high rate of speed. When it came even with a Bunge grainary about a quarter mile from me it abruptly changed course and flew south at an amazing rate of speed, dissapearing over the river and trees in a matter of seconds.<n>

The brighter of the two was actually three lights in a triangular formation.  The smaller light followed the triangular lights back and forth across the sky.  They were faster than a jet airplane but not extraordinarily fast moving.  They seemed to be at a medium altitude, perhaps 5,000 - 10,000 feet or perhaps less.  This made the actual size of the object undeterminable. After some time the triangular light vanished in an instant and the other light turned in the opposite direction and flew off towards the horizon.  Living near Andrews Air Force Base, it was assumed that this was an air force action but the triangular shape is what sparked my curiosity and made me think that something unusual was going on.  It may very well be an air force plane of some sort but it remains for me a UFO none the less.<n>
12/14/01 22:00|Arcadia|CA|Light|Slightly over 1 hour|Large, bright stationary light in sky over eastern LA county.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20839.html|102|ndxe200112| Large, bright stationary light in sky over eastern LA county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I left my office about 10pm I looked up into a clear sky in the east, and noticed a bright manilla colored light about 45 degrees above the horizon. This is also a view of the approach to LAX so you see the various aircraft at their various levels during approach.  This light was much larger and much brighter than the lights of the approaching aircraft. The light, at that distance was about 3/8 inches in diameter, and did not appear to be moving, as the other aircraft on approach were.  I took a minute or so to look at it, tried to figure out what it might be and when I couldn&#39;t left.  On my way home, I stopped to get something to eat which took about a half hour. When I got home and out of the car, I couldn&#39;t help but notice it was still there...still unmoving...total elapsed time from my first sighting of it was no about 1 hr. It was east of the belt stars of Orion. Being an amature astronomer I first tried to equate as an astonomical body but couldn&#39;t. It was much larger than Jupiter and Saturn which had already set by this time. It was too large and too yellow for Venus. It&#39;s color was like that of Saturn through a telescope. I ruled out astonomical and commercial aircraft. I gave up for the night and went in and went to bed. When I turned on the Coast to Coast program to listen to until falling asleep a guy called in from Santa Barbara and told the host (AB) about it. He said he and some friends were leaving an eatery in Santa Barbara when they spotted it. He described it exactly as I saw it to AB who began to ridicule him. He finally got angry and told the host to go out and look into the eastern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon. Finally the host said he&#39;d do it at the next break. Given Santa Barbaras proximity to Los Angeles, it would have appeared lower on the horizon than it did from my vantage point. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t believe the show host could&#39;ve seen it from his desert location. My best guess is that the farthest east it could&#39;ve been would have been Palm Springs, CA. I hate trying to guesstimate distances and heights but I&#39;d say it was probaby at about 7000 ft over the area of Riverside or maybe even further west. To rule out an astronomical body, I went outside the following night at the same time and there was nothing there. Had it been astonomical in nature it would have been there for a number of nights at least. I rued out a law enforcement helicopter which are prevalant in the area because they away&#39;s circle or move in some way...this object simply wasn&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness may have been observing.  However, we note that Jupiter currently is very prominent in the eastern sky during the early evening, and that it &#34;rises&#34; in the sky toward the zenith throughout the evening.  Unless there were two, prominent bright lights in the eastern sky, our first guess is that the observer might have been looking at Jupiter.  PD))<n>

It was clearly as high as an airplane would be. But there were mountains in the background. I kept my eye on it for sometime. Um, don&#39;t worry, I wasn&#39;t driving and looking at this thing at the same time! But I kept a close on it and in a blink, it vanished.

There were sometimes strobe-like flashes of white lights. The object also seems like it is spinning.It has moved very little since I seen it, but I have noticed that it will move to the left or right.

I looked out onto the street and saw nothing. When I looked in the air, however, I saw 5 cigar shaped craft. All of them were heading west and were in a V type formation. There were 2 lights emitted from the crafts at each end and they were flashing on and off. They were all going at a fairly fast pace and kept the same pace through the entire sighting. When I was about to pull out my camera, they pulled up and started to go faster and faster until they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this individual&#39;s grade-school.

I was gazing at a star/planet and for a very brief time 15-20 seconds I saw 3 lites in a lopsided triangle shape slowly moving right to left below this star/planet that I was looking at. I am not an astronomer so I don&#39;t know if it was a star or a planet. But the very slight movement caught my eye and I followed it for the 15 sec or so until it slowly drifted left and down until it went out of sight. The sky was clear with no clouds below but it appeared as though it drifted down into the haze or cloud layer below. It may have been one UFO or three flying in the lopsided triangle formation. The size and intensity of the white lights were similar in brightness and size to the star I was looking at. It was not an aircraft and it appeared and disappeared again so quickly I did not mention it to the Co-Pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Star......&gt;          + .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .  .     &lt;.........Lights Movement was Right to Left and down at about a 30 deg angle.<n>

Between Napa and Yountville i noticed something in my perhiperal vision (slightly to the left).  When I turned to look I saw a massive green fireball headed down towards the ground.  It approached the ground at about a 75 degree angle.  I would compare the size of the object from about one quarter, to one half the size of the moon.  Just before hitting the ground, the object apparently burned out.  Distance was approx from .5 to 1 mile away.  We called 911 and notified the Sheriff&#39;s Dept, told them we had seen an object fall from the sky, but that there was no explosion or impact from what we could tell.  The easiest thing I can compare it to would be anti-aircraft fire, when seen from night vision.  You know the white/green streaks?<n>

It was starting to get dark out.  We live in a very wooded area and it was snowing lightly.  There was a light breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we walked the clouds seemed to seperate and there was an almost scary silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could see the stars!  We continued walking and my husband stopped and said, &#34;LOOK&#34; I turned my head to see this terrifying large glowing white object hover above the trees making no noise at all.  As a matter of fact We could hear nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gliding through the tree tops slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember standing there and couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  I feel like we stood there for a half an hour or so.  My husband said, &#34;it felt like an instant&#34;.  When I had realized what we saw I wanted to run.  &#34;Run where&#34; my husband said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home very startled, and I had called the police asking if anyone had reported anything unusual and had explained what we saw. We went to our neighbors and asked if they had seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure about UFO&#39;s until this.  My four children have also seen something.  I find it very scary and my children to this day are still having nightmares and will not go outside alone. We don&#39;t so much is let out children watch wrestling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I did not tell our children about our encounter and what they say was very different.  They ran in the house one day crying and screaming saying,&#34; there was something in the sky changing shape and chasing them&#34;.  I have four children that saw the same thing.<n>

My brother-in-law was familiar with similar sightings and drew our attention to it. It was blinking at a steady rate (not like a natural star), and not moving. After a moment, it began to move slowly through the sky. Unlike a satellite, or aircraft, this light was moving erratically through the sky: left, right, up and down - very abrupt movements. The movements were at times slow, others fast with no apparent pattern. It would come to a complete stop for as long as 5 minutes. It would begin as a single blinking light (white), and then would appear as two lights, regardless of the direction it was moving, and then back to a single light. When it would move quickly, the lights appeared orange-red in color, when stationary, white. At times, the lights would be synchronized, others alternating. Viewing through binoculars, I was unable to determine the shape (I would try to focus on brighter stars behind it to determine if they were two separate craft, or one when the two lights appeared. It did appear to be a deeper black in between the two lights, but it was too difficult to hold the binoculars still enough to determine for sure). However, when the lights were brightest and blinking, it appeared that it might possibly be triangular in shape from the way the light would reflect out. The size of the lights would change giving the appearance that the craft was moving farther into space and then descending again. There was absolutely no sound in the quiet countryside to lead us to believe that this was a commercial jet, or aircraft of some kind. It was a very clear, very cold evening and the stars were very visible in contrast to this light. We also saw two distinct satellites cross the path above the lights. My 10 year old wondered if perhaps the satellites may have taken a picture from above??<n>

It had three really bright lights at each corner and a number of other light inside but not as bright. These lights were a piecing yellow in color. I knew it was not a airplane because it was flying very low in the sky I knew this because it was a clear night sky. The thing just stood in the same place for a bit then flew away at a high speed.<n>

I looked outside and saw something in the sky with red flashing lights.  It wasn&#39;t really moving.  Mostly, it was staying in one place(almost hovering).  We went outside;occasionally this thing would move a little(one direction or the other).  It was dark.  It was hard to make out the actual shape this thing was.  The lights weren&#39;t really in a uniform pattern.  The lights were flashing in a zig-zaggy formation.  Neighbors came out because they also heard the LOUD rumbling noise.  We talked about the possibility of it being a helicopter.  However, it did not sound or look like a helicopter.  And it stayed around, for at least, over an hour.  A couple of cars had also pulled over down the street.  They were also looking at this thing.  In checking with the Police, no helicopters were dispatched at that time.  We have no idea what it was!  We didn&#39;t see it go away because we came in the house due to being spooked.<n>
12/9/01 00:28|Lombard|IL|Chevron|3 minutes|Huge Black Transparent Silent Chevron|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20750.html|122|ndxe200112| Huge Black Transparent Silent Chevron<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 00:28 a black chevron was seen west of Lombard, traveling south in a plane-less sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 00:20 I looked outside and was surprised to see a clear &amp; star filled sky, as generally the planes keep spraying something which creates perpetually cloudy sky over Chicago. I got out my Russian panoramic viewer, the best night vision available in my opinion, and started scanning the sky. No air planes could be seen or heard, which is unusual because I live under the landing path to ORD. I looked to the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon and almost missed a solid black chevron slowly moving silently across the midnight sky. Absolutely no light was emitted from the craft which was itself darker than the sky behind it. As this wide, chevron shaped wing passed in front of the star studded sky - the stars did not fade behind the wing but appeared to keep shining through an invisible structure. I assume the ship was able to bend the light around it adding to its stealth. The event lasted about 3 minutes and this object moved slowly due south - aprox. over Wheaton, possibly even farther west. No idea how far away or how high it actually was but it did not reflect the laser light that I directed at it. This ship was HUGE (my guess is one mile across) and I feel it is part of a larger geometric structure whereby 6 craft would create an immense, six sided ring with another - solid craft in the center. The wing was the same width from one end the other and each end was straight - like a straight cut on a piece of lumber with two 90 deg. Corners. (I could fax a drawing) This craft had a pointed leading edge and the chevron had about a 120 angle with the wings sweeping toward the rear. No curves could be seen, only sharply defined edges. There were no vapor trails. I could not determine the thickness of this craft, but by its darkness and how I almost missed it with my high power nightvision - nobody would &#34;EVER&#34; see it using binoculars. Video would never have revealed this object in the night sky either. It was not an airplane.<n>

M38 was almost at the zenith when I saw the two craft.  They went amazingly fast.  I followed them to the best of my abilitiy but they went down over the horizon in less than thirty seconds.  I&#39;m not sure what velocity a craft would have to be going to get from horizon to horizon in a minute, but I know it doesn&#39;t happen with any craft known to me.  The two triangular/chevron-shaped craft were in tight formation, and did not move from it.  They went in a straight line across the sky, always staying the same distance from each other.  There were no lights on the craft, but they were visible by ambient light.  There was no noise following their pass over me.  I checked ISS visibility for my town and it was in South America when the occurance happened.  Also, the objects&#39; direction of travel was wrong for the ISS.  In addition, the ISS is visible for 5-6 minutes when it passes over any place on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

The lights moved in a west to east direction and maintained a steady speed.  Elevation was difficult to assess, however, I estimate it at approximately 1500-2000 ft.   The pattern of seven (7) lights formed a &#34;V&#34; similar to a flock of geese.  The lights were very dim (similar to a 25 watt bulb at about 100 ft.).  There was no visible body to the object as it moved eastward at an increasing rate of speed.  There was no audible jet, propeller or rocket sound.  The night sky was totally clear and the path of the object did not intersect or come close to the flight path of either nearby major airports (within a 60 mile diameter).  The size of the craft would be at least that of a B-52 if not slightly larger, however, the rate of acceleration and our geographic location made me question that assumption immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My interest in UFO&#39;s has been skeptical at best ... that is until I became the unexpecting witness to an object which does not fit any available logical explanation which I can arrive at to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The text above was deleted from the original text, for some reason.

The soft glow, about a medium magintude star in strength, defined a line that wavered and undulated in the manner of a flock of sparrows, but generally described a &#34;V&#34; shape that  - if I remember correctly, pointed southward. There was enough glow from the ground that I could not distinguish whether there was a solid object defined by the line of light, or if it was just a glowing line in the sky. The line of light moved from left to right - southward - for a few seconds asI called my wife&#39;s attention to it. It continued to move and she saw it as well for another 10 or so seconds (estimated) before it either faded from view or came so close to the ground glow and horizon that I could not see it anymore. My wife described what I had seen closely enough I knew that it was not a vision problem on my part. No sound was associated with the event.<n>

It was dark and about 7:40 PM MST.  Our exact location was near the water tower on the bluff  overlooking the Pueblo Resevoir area, on the eastern edge of Pueblo West.  My friend and I had stopped for a moment and I walked behind a tree to relieve myself.  As I started to walk back I noticed 3 bright lights which I thought were flares.  These lights were about 15-20 degrees off of the horizon in the SouthWest portion of the sky over the area of Wetmore Colorado (25-30 miles Southwest).   When the lights disappeared I walked back to my bicycle and asked observer #2 is she had seen the lights?  She saw them too because they reappeared about then.  We looked to see if they might be landing lights of a plane disappearing and reapperaing behind the clouds,  but there were no clouds.  We saw the blinking light of a plane in the same general area but saw no association between it and these lights.  The sky was  star filled. We got a reference to the mountain range that sits below and they were definitely above the mountains.  We wondered if they might be distress flares from someone in the mountains, but the lights never moved downward like flares do.  They just stayed in the same spot, disappearing and reappearing.  Each appearance lasted  20-40  seconds for about 4 times.    There were always 3 lights.  They were always in the same position but  their positioning was not symetrical.  They each had about the same intensity of light and were of the same size (about 1/4&#34; in diameter on the scale we were viewing).  One was  slightly higher than the others and slightly to the West.  The other two were closer together with the lower one slightly East of the center one.  They disappeared after about 4 or 5 minutes.  We do not know what these lights were.  Perhaps someone else from Colorado saw them too?<n>

The object appeared to change shape every few seconds. At first I thought I was seeing things because I&#39;ve been driving for 3 hours non-stop. But when the object started to glow a greenish colour I woke my girlfriend up who was sleeping at the time. I pointed to the object but when I pointed there The object turned into a red glow and vanished into the woods nearby. I tried to call a friend to tell him what just happened but when I turned my mobile on all I got was static and a buzzing noise through it. An hour later my mobile started to work again but when I tld my friend what happened he just laughed at me and hung up. I can&#39;t explain what happened.<n>

The colors were green, red, white and blue. We don&#39;t think anything of it until we see the lights swerve to the right and turn. This is where you can actually see an object. It is a triangular form, except at the bottom it is wavy with curves. It is in front of us in the sky. It is as close to us that u can actually see the textures and graphical features on this object. I would have to say that comparing the size of this object to the sun, it was smaller because of its actual distance though. My mother then stops the car, but at that very moment the object goes flying in the opposite direction and we lose contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, driving down the same road we tend to spot the same object again. This time the object appears from the right. It makes a semi-circle in counter-clockwise motion. It starts to hover over some trees. When at that moment, it enters the forests and flies between the trees. This is when we lose contact. I&#39;m not sure what this was. I&#39;m also not saying that this has any relation to aliens. All i know is that i know what i saw, and if u call me crazy, go ahead because im not blind when i&#39;m telling you exactly what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be convincing.

After a few seconds they changed formation into one large triangle, and one object was acting like a rover circling the whole triangle, then it added itself on to the formation, and they dissapeared into the distance. They were at a very high altitude. I have never seen anything like this or reported anything in my life. I come from a family of fighter pilots and airline pilots, I have been around all kinds of planes and airshows my whole life. The speed and manueverability of these objects was something I haven&#39;t  seen before. If anyone else witnessed the same formations I would like to know. They were flying directly Southbound away from North star. This happened in Anaheim, CA at 21:00 on 12/04/01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If antbody witnessed this event or has seen simular events, please email me at ((address deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankyou,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite level-headed and sincere to us.  We suspect that his report has no relationship to the sighting from Santa Ana/Garden Grove from the same date, but two hours earlier.  Apparently, the movement of the objects was quite uncharacteristic of migratory birds, aircraft, or any other phenomenon the witness is familiar with.  The witness identified himself as being a private pilot.  PD))<n>

Suddenly, I saw a flaming object falling out of the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.  I would guess that it fell at about a 30 degree angle.  I lost sight of it when it fell below the tree line.  I screamed and prepared for an explosion, but there was none.  I have no idea what I saw, but I thought it was an aircraft in flames.  Just seconds after that, I heard sirens and thought emergency vehicles were on the way to the site.  They passed me and turned up another street.  I followed them, but they went to the scene of an auto accident. I found out later that there would be a meteor shower 7-10 days after the sighting and wondered if this could have been an early arrival.  My 7-year old son was with me and saw it also.  I am a college graduate and fairly intelligent.  I am pretty logical and have never witnessed anything like this before.  If it was a meteor, it was extremely close to the ground.  As I said, I really expected to see an explosion when it hit the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a bright, round object with rings around it.I grabbed my binoculars and was amazed at what I saw. The object inside the rings seemed perfectly round and had a silver grey color. There were bright flashes of light on the surface.It looked like Saturn. It moved very slowly down the river and at times seemed to hover over the water.After awhile it drifted behind the clouds and we never saw it again.This was definitely not of this world.I have always felt that there must be other intelligent life now I am convinced of it.<n>

This lasted 5-6 seconds and then a spherical craft shot into the air with a bright white and yellow tail. It had a diameter of approximately 200-300 feet. It&#39;s tail turned red and then yellow and it continued straight up until it was indistinguishable from a star. This process took about 5 minutes.

It turned, and was flying away from me then.  It was a large light that got smaller and smaller until it disappeared.  There were many other people on the highway, people coming home from work.

What was unusual, was that the sun was rising, and there were no other stars out.  I was driving to work a distance of 20 miles, and throughout that drive the star was still visible.  Even now, with the sun entirely risen and sun beating down on the ground, the dot, though very faint is still visible.  The position of the dot stayed constant relative to the moon which leads me to believe it was very far away.   It is possibly a satelite in synchronous orbit or a planet?... but I&#39;ve never noticed such a thing before, and certainly not with the sky so bright.  It did not make any movement while I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body.  PD))<n>

In amazement over its intensity for being about the size of the end of a pencil eraser, I told my spouse that &#34;even if it was Mars it sure was bright.&#34;  I then went into the house to get my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the four to five minutes that lapsed while I was in the house the red star appeared to have dropped and/or moved down about 15 degrees and was slightly larger than previously noticed.  The object dropped down to about 35 degrees above the horizon before it changed directions towards the West, now moving horizontally! After moving horizontally for approximately four to five minutes, the object suddenly expanded at least three times its initial size into a fire pulsing motion (for about two minutes), before the glow of the object succeeded back to its initial size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another three to four minutes, pieces or parts appeared to be falling from or breaking off the flying object while it continued moving horizontally.  Eight of the nine glowing objects that fell straight down, faded or burned out with 20 seconds, while the largest falling glow did not fade in intensity and appeared to fall intact somewhere Northwest of Gila Bend.  The flying object continued West for approximately six minutes before it disappeared.<n>

Following this, the spheres in an organized fashion beagn to form in a straight line after each had circled the airplanes rear fuselage, then after formation took of upwards at high speed dissapearing behing the grey sky clouds as the plane took off, an airbus (smaller model).   Funny thing is that we all rememberd and commented briefly but remained silent and no further comment was made but then, after a few months they all sort of forgotten the whole episode except me recalling the event time and time again trying to make sense of it.  This is not my first experince and in additon to that I have also experienced outer body and seen the earth from above only to wakent feeling the most unexplainable happiness and fullfilment in my inner self.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All lights had orange streaks eminating from the rear except for the leading light.  One streak seemed to be at an angle towards the ground for a time.  Each light was traveling at the same speed relative to one another.  This made it appear as if it could have been one object with lights on the corners.  It appeared as if the color between the lights was darker than the background of the sky.  There was no aircraft sound.  One of the fainter lights were blue.  After the formation flew a few miles north, it began to turn east and out of sight.  A police officer was in the parking lot behind us.  He told us it was fighter planes with their after-burners on. I suppose this could be true but I work outside at night and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

These objects are best described as a group of slow motion shooting stars with bright tails, only closer. These, 5 to 6 objects appearing in the west, low in the horizion, was the closest distance to the observer, these objects were maintaining the same pattern as they moved from the drivers left, across the north bound path of the driver, this would be a north-easterly direction coming from the drivers left rear and crossing directly across the drivers front windshield.  The pattern and spacing of the objects were the width of a hand held @ arms length. The length of the &#34;tails&#34; or streaks of light were approximately four times the width of the pattern, or a distance of one foot @ that same arms length distance.  The initial sighting was outside the drivers door window and the objects were within this viewing window. The objects kept a low profile or low distance which could be viewed without bending down to view from inside a pickup truck.

There was a trail behind it, much like you would see behind a comet.  I knew it was not a meteor, because it was moving slowly from south to north.  After about 5-10 seconds of this &#34;phenomenon&#34; moving slowly across the sky, it shot off in it&#39;s continuing direction towards the north.  There was no sound emitted by the craft, nor any ensuing sonic boom.  I got out of my car to get a better look, but by that time it was gone.  I also noticed two airplanes passing by the area where the event had occurred.  I have no knowledge as to what kind of aircraft they were, or whom they belonged to.  I talked to several other people in the general vicinity whom had viewed the same event.  We speculated what it may have been, and came up with a few things- possibly a fighter jet?

As it got closer we could see that it was not a cone but a grouping of lights with one very bright light and several smaller lights with tails streaking behind them.  When I first distinguished the individual lights I thought, could this be a formation of helicopters coming towards us with search lights?  But there was no noise.  As the lights passed we jumped back in the vehicle and turned around thinking maybe we would see it go down.  We were in an area southwest of Ozona and there are a lot of canyons and high hills.  We were able to see it as it went out of sight over one of these hills.  The hills were about five hundred feet above the road we were on and because the lights disappeared over their horizon very quickly, we believe the lights were at a very low altitude.  It did not seem to change elevation.  I don&#39;t know if it is possible but it was like a slow moving group of meteors of various sizes being projected in front of us like a hologram.

Two streams were originating from the cylindrical objects.  Within the light streams were gold looking objects that on first observation looked like sparks.  Intermixed within the sparks and blue rivers of light were many round shapes which were in reds and greens.  These objects held formation.  The blue streams of light appeared to be approx.1/2 mi long though it was difficult to judge the size as it may have been very large and far away even thought it appreared to be very low and close. The whole thing was humongous.  I guessed it to be 1 1/2 mile total length and moving at a very high rate of speed.  There was absolute silence as it glided through a cloudless sky.  This was preceded by two small light sources that looked like the eyes of the craft.  We were unable to make out any structure and could only clearly see the streams of light.  The light coming from &#34;the eyes&#34; was very contained and had no light between them and the craft, and the light source did not create a beam.  They appeared to be totally independent.  There appeared to be shades of red, green and blue lights around the cylindrical objects that we could see.  When we switched off the headlights and engine to the car, it flashed a green light in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fifteen minutes prior to this sighting, we had noticed a light in the sky falling straight down towards the earth that we thought was a meteor.  We were just East and South of Winfied by Strother Field (approx. 10 miles out) when we saw this.  We drove into Winfield, and were about 5 miles North of Winfield when we turned to the West and had gone about a mile down a county road when we saw this craft.  It came from the Southwest, almost out of no where and was going very rapidly to the Northeast.  From the inside of the car, the view filled the whole windshield. At first it appeared to be 2 B1B&#39;s Bombers flying in very close and low formation.  I got out of the car because I could not believe what I was seeing and realized there was no sound.  We watched intently for the next few minutes until it just disappeared behind some trees.  We headed in the general direction and never caught sight of it again.  We tried to use our cell phone but had a huge echo and a lot of static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a recently retired Numerical Control Programmer for Boeing aircraft in the tool engineering department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

12/1/01 22:20|Richardson|TX|Fireball||This encounter consisted of a brief sighting of several fireballs and related streaks seemingly flying in formation.|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20646.html|184|ndxe200112| This encounter consisted of a brief sighting of several fireballs and related streaks seemingly flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of December 1, 2001, my mother (54) and I (35) were walking our dogs when we observed an unusual aerial phenomenon.  With the exception of some high, thin clouds, the sky was clear; major constellations, such as Orion, were plainly visible.  As we were walking north on Yale Road in Richardson, Texas, between its intersections with Blake and Linda Lanes, we observed a formation of two large fireballs in the sky to the north, perhaps twenty-five to thirty degrees above the horizon, apparently accompanied by several smaller streaks of light.  They moved across the sky from west to east, at a speed similar to that of an airplane; I got the impression that they were quite distant.  One of the two larger fireballs was slightly higher than and ahead of the other; the smaller streaks, which were very faint, lay between and behind the two.  Another thin streak seemed to lead the leading fireball a small distance. I got the impression that the fireball was attached to the thin streak leading it.  No such phenomenon was observed for the lower, trailing fireball.  The entire formation was moving at a very slight angle to the ground, only a few degrees at best; it seemed almost parallel to the ground.  We observed it only briefly before it passed behind some trees and was lost.  The presence of nearby streetlamps also affected our ability to view it more clearly.  We heard no unusual sounds during the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting I noticed at least one aircraft pass nearby, so there may have been other sightings of this phenomenon as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large fireballs themselves each consisted of a large, luminous head trailed by thick contrails of smoke or vapor.  The were primarily white, but toward the end of the sighting seemed to sputter briefly red/orange, then green.  The other, faint streaks may have been smaller fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me stress that I am certain that these were not conventional aircraft.  We live relatively near both Dallas Love Field and the Dallas/Fort Worth airport (one of the busiest airports in the world), so we see planes constantly, and are familiar with their night-time appearance.  Neither do I believe that they were alien interstellar craft.  I thought at first that they were some sort of burning objects being towed by small aircraft, given the faint streak I saw preceding one of the fireballs.  However, I saw no running lights that would indicate the streak was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment, I believe that the most likely explanation is that we saw a large meteor in the process of breaking up.  The annual Leonids meteor shower occured just two weeks ago.  In this scenario, the fireballs were portions of the meteor that included low-density icy or organic materials (common to the Leonids, which are fragments of Comet Swift-Tuttle, if I&#39;m not mistaken), while the faint streaks were smaller, rockier fragments.  This would explain the impression that they were flying in formation.  The sputtering and vapor trails would have been caused by outgassing as the objects burned up in the atmosphere.  However, this explanation fails to explain why it was moving so slowly, or why it passed across the sky at such a shallow angle.  I do know a small asteroid has been observed to do this before bouncing out of the atmosphere (in 1974), and that there is theory that hundreds of mini-comets burn up in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere daily.  Clearly, I prefer to consider this a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other possibilities -- that this was indeed several planes towing burning objects (but why?) or we witnessed some sort of government experiment.  The latter theory seems overused an unlikely.  Why test something near a major population center.  I suppose it could also have been a satellite burning up in the asteroid, or even the space shuttle, except the next shuttle mission is on hold for the moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, I&#39;m not an astronomer, though I am very interested in astronomy.  I am a technical writer with degrees in history and anthropology, and I worked for more than five years as a professional archeologist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

The road is hilly and offers a decent view of Tulsa and the surrounding area.  I had noticed a single light (what I casually thought was a low-flying small plane) to the south-southwest.  The light was sustained and did not pulse.  It didn&#39;t occur to me that it should be blinking, because not long after I saw the light, my wife exclaimed that the &#34;object&#34; had just emitted or split into several lights.  At least one central light suddenly became 5.  One in middle and 4 or more around it kind of in a staggered formation.  My first thought was that it was a formation of helecopters or F-16s (Air Guard has a squadron of both within 30 miles of the area).  The lights did not pulse, however.  They were sustained.  There was a main glow to the lights and a slight streaking or trail.  We slowed to observe the object as it passed across or field of view from South to North.  As it passed the lights seemed to glow with different colors (Orange to Red, Green to Blue, and Gold).  It was hard to get a good view of what the exact shape of the object(s) were.  However, we were able to make out what seemed to be an outline of the central object.  It looked tubular (almost like an airliner fuselage or a missle).  The central object&#39;s outline looked much longer than any commercial or military aircraft (I&#39;ve seen C-5s up close and this looked bigger).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slowed enough to role down our windows and listen...no sound from where we were.  The objects seemed kind of &#34;hazy&#34; and yet were pronounced enough to see points in the sky in addition to the presumed outline of the main body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as the objects moved to the North out of our view.  From the backside, it seemed that the lights had more of a green hue than orange or gold.  Although our vantage point may have been poor to determine altitude, it really seemed like not more than 10,000 feet.  It seemed like it was an object that would land (rather than crash) because the nose seemed to be pointed upward from the tail as it traveled from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home and immediately tried calling News Stations (all busy).  I reached the Air National Guard after hours Security Office who referred me to the Tulsa International Airport Tower Security.  TUL stated that it was a Satellite that fell out of orbit and crashed in Kansas.  That was mindboggling as we had seen the objects less than 10 minutes before and we are 70 miles south of the Kansas line.  The objects certainly did not seem to be traveling fast enought to descend and crash somewhere in Kansas.  That&#39;s neither here nor there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nevertheless, KJRH News reported it in the news broadcast as a crashing satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> KOTV News reported it as &#34;space junk.&#34;  KTUL didn&#39;t report it until Sunday, December 2, 2001 as a Russian SL-12 Rocket re-entering the atmosphere.  KTUL said it probably did not crash to the ground, but burned up before it hit the ground.  KTUL went on to clarify that if the object did hit the ground, it probably crashed somewhere in Kansas.   If so, I want to see pictures of the crash site.  I want to know what satellite or rocket it was, and why it&#39;s crashing over U.S. soil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

West of Olathe, Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving west on 135th Street just opposite Lake Olathe. Looking west, strings of light appeared from SW horizon. color-reddish to orange. I would estimate a 55 degree angle from the western horizon and the objects covered about 10-15 degrees vertically.The objects were two (or three) strings (possibly &#34;slashes&#34;, or a combination of strings and slashes) of very bright light. It was as if it was a meteor but it was not. The object(s) covered about 1/3 of the sky. It was very clear and the full moon was to our back. The object proceded NNE in the sky toward Kansas City and disappeared over the horizon. There was NO sound.It was difficult to tell the distance. However there were at least two, possibly three blinking lights (as in aircraft) escorting the object. The blinking lights were small to indicate a good distance. If this is the case, the object(s were HUGH. It could have been one object trailing strings of lights, or a perimeter of lights. From the angle we viewed the object it was hard to tell. They were very bright and could have been connected. The object did not &#34;burn&#34; as in a meteor but trailed away from direction of movement. We stopped the car and got out to view this phenomenom. Again, NO SOUND. We have seen meteors, and images of reentering space junk. This was NOT like that at all. The two main trails of lights traveled parallel to one another. One trail consited of two brighter trails and could have been a third trail. It was close to the other trail. We originally thought it was an airplane having difficulty but this was not the case.

12/1/01 21:45|Goodland (@10 miles east of)|KS|Unknown|1 1/2 - 2 minutes|Lights over I-70 in Western Kansas|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20754.html|196|ndxe200112| Lights over I-70 in Western Kansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving east on I-70, just east of Goodland, Kansas, Dec. 1st around 9:45 pm, I suddenly noticed a large long light in the sky.  It was south of the freeway, about 30 degrees above the horizon, and about 30 degrees to my right ( 0 degrees being directly ahead of me).   I&#39;d noticed it out of my upper right peripheral vision.  At first, I thought it might be a long strip of moonlight shining from behind clouds.  But as I looked, I could see a line of separate white lights (more distinct towards the front).  Underneath it, towards the front, and perfectly parralel to it, was another line of lights about 1/3 the length of the top line.  And this is what first jarred me out of the thought that it might have been moonlight :  these lines of lights were ruler-straight.  Although I could hardly process it, I realized I was looking at some kind of HUGE mechanical object. It appeared to be VERY long and rather flattish.  I say this because the sky seemed darker above and below the lines of lights  (i.e. it appeared a lot longer than it was high).  I cannot tell you how far away or how high it was, since I do not possess this skill.  However, it was obviously at plane-flying height, so to speak, and not way out &#39;in the atmosphere&#39;.  At any rate, as I watched it, I realized it was moving, apparently north and perpendicular to the the freeway.  It traveled very slowly, parralel to the horizon, and straight across the sky.  As I watched, it came into view directly in front of me, above the freeway.  This thing was truely huge.  I could barely process what I was seeing, and I can only tell you that this thing looked like some kind of giant moving complex.  Although I still hesitate to utter it, the words &#39;space station&#39; did come to mind.  It continued to move north.  At about 30 degrees to my left, north of the freeway,  I noticed it was angling downward.  At this point,  I strained to keep it in view.  It appeared to me that the lights went out, from the back to the front, until all I could see was one peachy-pink colored light, which then dissappeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon. I called 911 and got a Goodland operator.  I told her what I had seen and from where.   She related that 4 other calls had come in.  The next day, I described the event to a couple of people in Kansas City who each told me they&#39;d seen a report on CNN.  One person told me it was being explained as a Russian &#39;spacestation&#39; which had re-entered the atmosphere, broken apart, nothing to worry about, folks.  I myself watched the local Kansas City news at 10 pm that night and heard it explained as a Russian &#39;rocket&#39; re-entering earth&#39;s atmosphere, complete with an image of what appeared to me to be a couple of meteors - &#39;shooting stars&#39;.  This image was NOTHING like what I witnessed.  As I had told the 911 operator when she&#39;d asked me if  perhaps what I&#39;d seen might have been a comet or &#39;space junk&#39;, I&#39;d replied, &#39;definately NOT&#39;  -  not unless objects falling to earth are suddenly defying the laws of gravity, and traveling in slow horizontal trajectories across the sky.  Additionally, since when does a Russian anything fall to earth without further comment or inquiry?  I will add that on my return trip to Colorado through Kansas 4 days later, I called the 911 operator back, as I&#39;d said I would.  She told me that a total of 7 calls had come in to her; one from a sheriff, 2 from deputies,  3 from local rural citizens, and mine.  I also stopped in Goodland to see if any locals were talking about it.  At a convenience store, I asked the cashier (40-ish) if he&#39;d heard anyone talking about the &#39;lights&#39; in the sky the previous Saturday night.  Apparently that night, a man had rushed into his store, sworn he was neither drunk nor taking drugs, and had told the cashier that as he&#39;d been driving to Colorado, west on I-70, he and another driver had both stopped their cars on the freeway owing to what they were seeing in the sky.  The only description this casheir relayed to me was that the man had said there was a large light underneath this thing.  When the cashier had suggested that maybe it could have been a blimp, the man had said &#39;no way&#39;, as this thing was much bigger than that.  Then I told him what I saw.  During my conversation with him, I turned to another man standing behind me in the store who&#39;d been listening in.  Judging from the somewhat frozen look on his face (40&#39;s, clean cut, athletic looking), I ventured to ask him if he&#39;d seen &#39;it&#39;.  He nodded wordlessly, &#39;yes&#39;.  I asked him if he thought it was a meteor or some &#39;space junk&#39;, and he said, absolutely not.  He had been in Goodland at the time and I asked him to describe what he saw.  He said, &#39;It was just like you said.  It was big, moving slowly and horizontally across the sky&#39;.  He left shortly after.  I have subsequently spoken at some length to the sheriff mentioned by the 911 operator.  He had seen &#39;it&#39; from 20 or so miles south of where I had been at around the same time.  He described seeing brightly colored lights traveling parralel to the horizon across the sky, adding it was the most beautiful thing he&#39;d ever seen.  He tried to take a poloroid, but only nearby lights on the ground were visible in the picture.  I asked him if he thought it was a meteor or &#39;space junk&#39;, and he&#39;d said no, citing the same reason  -  its slow, horizontal movementl.  He asked me, &#39;how big do you think it was?  A mile long.....?&#39;  I told him I am unable to judge, but that like him, what I had seen was very large.  He said &#39;it&#39; had been moving from north to south.  We discussed this discrepancy in our &#39;sitings&#39;, yet agreed it was unlikely that these were 2 entirely unrelated events, since we&#39;d both seen it around the same time.   Anyway, that&#39;s my story.  I am a professional woman in my mid 40&#39;s with no interest in UFO&#39;s.  Until now, anyway..…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for 01DE01.

I didn&#39;t witness the crafts myself, I&#39;m just repeating my uncles story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle flies med-vac choppers from Columbia, MO to Springfield, MO and Kansas City, MO.  Two - three weeks (exact date unknown to me- between 11/25-30/01) ago he witnessed two Unidentified Flying Objects en route between Springfield and Columbia.  He said it was pretty close to Fort Smith(?) off of I44 between Rolla and Springfield.  My uncle described these UFO&#39;s as practically undescribable or unviewable rather, other than that there was a fiery aura around the actual ships, or flames (redish orange with a blue mixture as well) unlike any fire that is common on earth and that he&#39;d seen for that matter, blanketing the crafts outward appearance.  The ship itself wasn&#39;t even distinguishable.  He said he was travelling at about 2500ft and they appeared infront of him, like a cars headlights, at a height of nearly or exactly 3000ft, and at around 700 - 800 mph passed directly in front of him, flying exactly parallel to the earths surface, one slightly behind and caddy corner to the other.  He witnessed them go out of sight, as they had come into his view.  He even said they flew directly inbetween his chopper and a cesna flying not to far off beside of him (distance unknown to me), and when he made the call on his transmitter he was told that they were not seen on their radar, yet the cesna and him were obviously there.  He also said that they were not small either.  Very large.  He didn&#39;t go into exact detail on the size of the crafts.  I don&#39;t know where he was speaking to exactly, but he said that he spoke directly to an Air Force (representative) also and was told by him that it was &#39;Space Debris&#39;.  There is no way that this was space debris given it&#39;s path of travel.  If space debris it would have been heading towards the earth!  He said that the Air Force representative was adamant, and he realized that immediatly and complied.  The local Ozark media also ran the story telling of many eye witness accounts of the UFOs, but followed with the Air Forces guise agreeing that it was &#39;Space Debris&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunatly this is all I gathered from him.  There was a nurse with him who shared the experience as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (personal note to previewer - omit from description) ((NUFORC Note:  So omitted.

They seemed to be very close,guessing less than a mile. They appeared to be stationary with large spot or floodlight shining from center of cluster to the left or west.The lights gave the appearance of different size tails but were definitely not tails, they were light beams, as landing lights on an aircraft. The scene was definitely not a returning piece of space junk.It didn&#39;t appeal to me to be anything but some sort of a military manuever.Looked like an area of refueling helicopters. We didn&#39;t stop moving,and it appeared that the lights were still in the sky and we were passing them. From the passenger seat of our rig,I counted out loud ,6or7 red strobe lights,along with an indeterminate number of green,white and orange lights in no particular pattern.We were moving about 70 mph,and they were in sight about 4 mins. from 30deg.in front to about 15 deg behind us and to the right. My wife saw them about 30  sec longer than I did.At arms length,they appeared to be about 12&#34; to 14&#34;in length,and about 7&#34; to 9&#34; high.They appeared close because of the clarity of the strobes and we seemed to be passing them and the pattern appeared to change noticeably in perspective.  Another driver getting to OK city about 10 mins behind us told of seeing the scene accelerate &#34;fantastically&#34; ,but we saw no such movement.Must have happened after we passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a space debris re-entry.

It had misc. red,green and strobe lights on it and TWO large spot lights mounted on a mast,about 1/3 the way along the craft. the spots were different sizes and mounted above each other but both facing straight ahead.   This scene,if reproduced as a hologram and projected skyward, would have duplicated exactly what we saw in Dec.  It would explain how the &#34;object&#34; could have moved at a fantastic rate,as was told by another witness, just by turning the &#39;projector&#39;from side to side, and then shutting off the power, to make it disappear altogether. This explanation , for me,  at least gives me a sense of possibility.  This setup could be used by anyone ( government included) to create at least a diversion that could be  moved even electronically,from place to place to be seen by as many different people as the perpetrator wished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Please see other reports for this date.

One object was slightly lower and ahead of the other. With respect to appearent speed and path, these might have been airplanes - heading toward DIA. However, we quickly saw that both had very distinct tails of glowing light. We continued to observe the objects keep the same slow horizontal path for about 40 seconds. Then the objects appeared to break up into an number of smaller objects - followed by their disappearing from view. The observations were definately inconsistant with a comet-type object. It is possible that these could have been military craft using afterburners - but that would not explain the break up into smaller fragments. We are puzzled. Have others reported seeing the same thing?

At approximately 9:20 pm (N.M. time) we observed a formation of 5 very bright spheres with long, arcing, glowing tails traveling slowly from south to north.  The first 3 were in a triangular formation and much brighter than the last 2, which were offset from each other.  The latter 2 abruptly disappeared, and the remaining ones continued to travel all accross the sky, disappearing behind the northern mountain range.  They were too slow to be meteorites, and we could see them very clearly.  My son is a physicist &amp; amateur astronomer and I am a teacher &amp; book illustrator.  Neither of us believe that aliens visit or &#34;walk among us!&#34;, but we could not explain what we saw.  We discussed all the possible explanations for our &#34;sighting&#34; and came to the conclusion that they moved too deliberately to be &#34;space junk&#34; or huge bright comets.  They were definitely not airplanes, as they had very bright, glowing trails that followed their arc of travel.  Occasionally they would flash with blue light.

It was a clear , full- moon night.  I saw a rather large red light, rather low,  in front of the western border of the Sacremento mts, which are across the street from my house..  It was moving slowly in a northern direction above and in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I could see three lights, as with a stealth fighter plane. The lights were red and possibley blue and green.  I said&#34; it&#39;s too low and slow for a stealth&#34; and it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move in a straight line due north.  At this time it appeared to be about a few inches, visually, above the house roof across the street. So it was low, still not a sound.  My friend has excellent hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just to our right when it stretched out and there were a series of colored lights- red, blue green, yellow, and not in a staight line.  From a few, there appeared to be a vapor-like trail.  As I looked at it , it was about 6-8 inches long in my field of vision, of course it was away from me and up, so it was actually many feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in up and down positions, not in a single line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN, the object again resembled a stealth, with a few trailing lights. It started slowly turning on its side,like it was banking to turn.  At this time it was directly in front of our line of vision.  The object got large, about 3-4 times the size of a stealth and had three lights on the underside- red, blue and maybe green.  The underside looked whitesh or light grey.  It PAUSED in front of us, in that position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then ran in to get her husband.  The next thing I saw was it going behind Hershberger Peak, which is directly in front of my line of vision.  There were only a few colored lights at this time.  There was a large orange, glowing light which wasn&#39;t there before.  It was about 3-4 times the size of the other lights I had seen and there was a long straight vapor-like trail.  It went behind the southern edge of the peak at about a 30 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just moments before it had been way in FRONT of the mts., right behind my friend&#39;s house.  So it changed direction, and moved straight east , about 5-7 miles to Hershberger Peak..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us have ever seen anything like this before.

An approaching cold front was drawing clouds from the south and the cloud cover was fairly dense and moving rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the east which was in he direction of Rosenberg, Texas and could see the lights of that small town displayed against the flat horizon.  Above the lit horizon was a very brigt cloud nestled among many others of a normal grey appearance.  When the cloud drifted to the north there was a huge display of lights about 35 degrees above the horizon just behind or maybe inside the low clouds.  The lights appeared to be like those seen from a distance at a football field, but they were lined up right beside each other and there were at least five rows of them.  Each sat next to the other and above and below the rest.  There seemed to be very little space between them in any direction I counted five rows, but the clouds around the light display seemed to be obsurng more rows because the brightness kept showing through even when I could see five rows distinctly.  I don&#39;t believe the set of lights moved, but that the cloud movement kept covering the display and at one point I could count nine lights in the longest (and center) row.  At arm&#39;s length the object was almost three inches in width and about a inch in height.  The lights appeared to descend in number from the middle to the top and in the same manner from the middle to the bottom.  Occasionally, a cloud would totally encase the lights, but the cloud would then be luminescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the formation for about ten minutes before turning on to another road.  Trees close to us loomed over the part of sky we were watching.  By the time we could see that horizon again we had driven fairly far from Rosenberg and there was nothing but normal cloudcover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually, you&#39;re correct in that the sighting took place on December 1st.  I checked my original report posted to a message board that very night.  My memory can be faulty so I wrote it down as soon as I got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the timing goes it was definitly 8:30 pm CST so if you are taking about Midwestern time for the reentry the two don&#39;t really match up.  However, if you are talking Pacific time that would be just right.  (Well, I just read a lot of the reports at NUFORC and realize the timing isn&#39;t right for when we saw what we saw.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no tails or auras and the lights didn&#39;t seem to move at all, but with the clouds moving so rapidly I might have become confused.  The lights were side by side and extremely bright with perhaps six lights in a row just above the row of nine and perhaps another five or six below that row.  There were even fewer visible in the top and bottom rows and I&#39;m referring to the best view I had with clouds passing.  The lights never varied in size, they were all of equal size, so whatever the object might have been I doubt it was moving.  I neglected to make the report to you at the time because what I saw didn&#39;t look like any know UFO shape other than a disc literally made entirely of white lights.  Really strange and as I said, they seemed to remain stationery for ten minutes or so.  I&#39;ve also been waiting to read reports of something similar before reporting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also forgot to mention that we made the same trip on the night of December 23rd and saw Rosenberg&#39;s lights on the horizon on a clear night, but there were no lights in the sky other than stars.  It might be a good idea if I called Rosenberg&#39;s police department to see if there were any other reports or if there is some explanation I haven&#39;t thought of.  It&#39;s a small town with no reason for a large tower extending into the clouds, but I think it&#39;s worth a phone call or two even if I have to listen to a chuckle or two.  If there were similar reports I&#39;ll let you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for letting me know others have made more than one report to you.  If and when you might find the time I&#39;d appreciate knowing what sort of sound you heard a UFO make.  I was sitting in a quiet house alone several weeks ago and heard a very strange, loud sound outside, a buzzing of something electrical, but it seemed to be &#34;skipping out.&#34;  It sounded to me as though it were passing overhead, but I can&#39;t be sure of that.  The sound progressed and then seemed to pass away.  I&#39;m sure there are any number of reasons for such a sound, but I&#39;ve never heard that before.<n>

The craft appeared to emit a surrounding glow and emitted long tail plumes which also glowed.  Some craft were seen as solid (not blinking) yellow lights that traveled in formation.  The speed was greater than helicopters and no sounds were heard to be emitted by the flotilla.  I seriously have no idea what this flotilla of craft could have been, but there were a lot and it was spectacular and many people saw the event.  Whatever it was, it was big, as the lights stretched across half of the sky before fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

I heard on radio that night, theat  lights from the Oklahoma border to near Kansas City. I can tell you &#34;it&#34;was not space junk.  Very, bright light that crossed the horizon from southwest to northeast and broke. The press is lying. It was a clear UFO. It had four long streaks with objects, in front. It looked like a &#34;armada&#34; of UFOs.It appeared to break up into about 30 little balls, all white, broken up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NORAD monitors satellites and space debris that re-enters the atmosphere.

Either it was one large craft or three single.  Flew at low altitude almost appearing within 200 feet above tree line with no noise.  The siting is within 20 miles of Chicago&#39;s Ohare airport and planes were also visible at this time and were significantly different.  THere was no mistaking the siting as being a plane and given its low altitude with no sound, I would tend to discount a helicopter.  Unfortunately, we were driving in the opposite direction so I could not view this for more than a minute.<n>

Dec. 1st 2001 a heavily advertised meteor shower was to happen with its greatest show at approx. 02:00am from the east.  I stayed up for event and it was indeed a spectacle.  As I viewed the show I noticed to the NorthEast a stationary extremely bright star or planet.  It was so bright that I wondered what planet it could be this time or year.  I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image, it didn&#39;t really present change differently from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it, it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn&#39;t move for approx. 2 hours.  I, like most people didn&#39;t report it because of the possible stigmas attached to the person reporting such things.  I feel though that it is an important picture for those concerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is something that happened years ago but most of the details I still recall very cleary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in Kenai and Soldotna for my brothers basketball tournament. It was december and many of us drove together down there. We were going to stay the night but my brothers friend wanted to go to Girdwood the next day. I was driving a motorhome so i Loaded up the boys that wanted to go and headed home. It was a very cold night no clouds with lots of stars in the sky. We were about 10 miles approx.? from the rest stop in Turnagain Pass.  two boys were playing cards in the back of the motorhome, one was sleeping and one was sitting in the front seat by me. All of a sudden I saw a red light in my windshield. Thinking I was tired or something I continued to stare trying to figure out what it was. I looked at my  dashboard to see if any lights had come on and were reflecting of the windshield. Then i looked again after rubbing my eyes and  now the light belonged to something it was almost like it was clearance lights on the bottom of a GIANT obeject in the sky, I don&#39;t think there is ANY airplane near the size of this. This object was was circular in the front... the lights ran in a semi circle under neath this circle. It had a long body with lights runing in a strait line down it. It looked metal (but it was black) to me and the almost like a manmade object, Yet I have never seen anyhting like it. This object just hovered it was even with the mountain tops on closer to the left mountain  instead of the right. I didnt think it was possible for an object that large to hover in the same spot for so long. It wasnt that high up becuase we were pretty much at the top of pass. At this point I am still think I have lost my mind I hadnt said a word I just drove and stared in the air. I finally looked over and the boy sitting in the seat next to me was doing the same thing. We looked at each and almost at the same time asked &#34;Do you See that too?&#34; it was at this point the other two boys playing cards came to the front of the motor home. Becuase of how clear it was and bright the stars were it looked even bigger than it probably was becuase it blockled them. w3e watched it for a while just staring at it trying to let our minds figure out what we were seeing. Then it was gone it didnt diappear but it took off at lighting speed. we watched as you could see the red lights on zoom away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
