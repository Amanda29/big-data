I was looking at the craters on the moon(quarter) and then I started looking at the stars to the left of the moon. I observed through my binoculars a light moving downward at a very rapid rate of speed. I moved them from my eyes and I could no longer see the object.I looked through them again, and again I could see the object still moving down rapidly. All at once it stopped. I looked again without the glasses and I couldn&#39;t see it, placing the glasses back to my eyes I could see it. It began moving down again rapidly, all at once the object moved vertically right in a straight line very rapidly covering a great distance. And just as quickly it moved back vertically left past the center line it had been decending at originally.It did this five times in a diamond type shape very rapidly. When it stopped doing this it again started in a rapid straight line decent until out of sight.<n>

We 12 friends were going to one temple we were on our bikes and at everage speed. Suddunly one of our friend saw a white masked little person under the tree, actually at that time we 4-5 freiend were looking at same place and there were actually 2 &#34;persons&#34;. But shape of those guy were likw onion. And eyes of those guys were like dark, black and sparkling. One of my friend was really afraid of those things and he got fever and laterly he was hospitalized.  Still we have bounded that space with steel rods, and still we have images of foot steps. In our city one banana seller was telling that story that he saw the same guys many times but we were not believeing in that. But the thing is to be worth noted is that as per the description of that banana seller he saw those guy generally on Wed. So now we have prepared one scheme for catching those guys.....It is really interesting.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not spoken with the witnesses, or the banana seller, yet.  No other reports filed with NUFORC.  PD))<n>

After a few minutes the two craft began to descend and then rose sharply at high speed and disappeared in the blink of an eye. as soon as the craft had left our mobile phones switched back on and the car engine started by itself.<n>

It moved west and seemed to join up with 2 other lights(I could not make out details of the otherlights)and then they seemed to start a search going up and down stopping and hovering and  then they moved on<n>

She said she seen a circle of lights to the north By Grand Coulee dam on the horizon moving west to east. If you held a quarter @ arms length it was that size. She is an avid astronomer so it was nothing that should be there. She was pretty excited when she called. She will write everything down that she observed.<n>
2/27/01 01:35|Duvall|WA|Egg|1minute|saw an egg shaped ball of yellow light at night that flew like a slow plane but was below treetops|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16663.html|9|ndxe200102| saw an egg shaped ball of yellow light at night that flew like a slow plane but was below treetops<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up late listening to the radio, laying in bed with my head propped up and gazing toward my window. The lights were off in the house. I have lived in this same house for over 10 years and never saw anything unusual until last night. I suddenly noticed an egg shaped ball of light that looked like it was glowing a solid yellowish color. It was moving very straight accross the sky but only about 40 feet from the ground and at about the speed of a slow hellicopter. It was getting blocked by a tree so I bolted for the door with my binoculars and looked at it from there. I didn&#39;t get a chance to get the binocs out of the case before it continued out of sight behind more trees. There are pretty tall trees here and it looked like it was only about one fifth down from the top of the trees. There are few trees behind the first row so it would have plenty of space to travel, but I know no manmade plane or copter would fly so low day or night. The light of this thing was very bright but seemed self contained and didn&#39;t shine toward the ground. Also, while at the door I heard no sound in the still night air. The size of the thing is hard to say but I was only about 100 yards from it and it looked like it was as big as a small plane. This was in the vicinity of Lake Marcell about half way between Duvall and Carnation. ( I happen to be reading a book on abductions called &#34;Witnessed&#34; by Budd Hopkins.......strange eh?)<n>

There were clouds to the north and south, but above me it was very clear. I first thought I saw a shooting star emerging from the cloud cover to the north. As I watched it I could clearly make out 6 definite white lights fly in close formation. They did not keep perfect formation at one point. It looked like the three on the right swirved slightley toward the three on the left and then went back in formation as they disapeared into the clouds to the south. They were visible for a long distance but moved so fast and silent, they were gone in about 5 to 7 seconds. It looked as though they banked to the west as they disapeared into the clouds. I saw no colored lights. I saw nothing in front or behind the objects. I also saw no vapor trail and heard nothing.<n>

We were outside around 8:30P.M. looking at the stars, and saw a very long streak of white light. Sorta like a string. Just one. It looked like it was just floating in the sky. We tried to strain our eyes to try to figure it out. Then it just got too far away and dissapeared. We only saw it for about 20 seconds. A few minutes later, about 5 military jets from Luke Airforce base, flew by above.<n>
2/26/01 01:34|Portland|OR|Chevron|2-3 minutes|2 V-shaped objects with bright lights seen near NW Portland.|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16643.html|13|ndxe200102| 2 V-shaped objects with bright lights seen near NW Portland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 UFO&#39;s were first seen when my roomate was out on the fire escape of our apartment complex smoking.  The 2 objects appeared to be stationary for about 2 minutes in the sky to the South.  I got my camera and when I came back out the objects began to move North towards us.  The objects appeared to have 3-5 very bright white lights on the bottom side of the craft and turned without banking.  They were V or boomerang shaped objects.  No flashing and/or colored lights to classify it as a plane.  The objects were flying very low and made no sound.  I managed to get two pictures before they dissapeared around the side of our building.  We ran out to track their movement but they&#39;d already vanished.<n>

As I walked towards my dorm a light suddenly appeared in the sky (in the direction I was facing). It appeared to be losing altitude fast, and after about three seconds my view of it was obscured by the buildings. I had the fortune of gazing in it&#39;s direction when it appeared, so I had complete focus on it.  Though it was late night I was not tired. I ruled out a shooting star For one it was a very large light (half the size of a full moon), and neon green (how cliche). It also traversed alot of sky for a shooting star. I also ruled out an aircraft It appeared suddenly in midair, and was completely silent in it&#39;s &#34;descent&#34;. There appeared to be a shape to it, but the light was too intense to make out any detail.<n>

It was very far away and about the size of a dime from our view point.  It crossed our horizen in about four minutes.  Moving much too fast to be an air craft. We were facing in a southwest ward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It seems to us that a high-flying aircraft would be visible for the amount of time indicated by the witnesses.  However, we do not know what it was they witnessed.  A dime at arm&#39;s length is approximately the percieved size of a full moon.  PD))<n>

I was pulling a bag of clothes out of the car. I just happend to look up at the stars as I often Do. We live out in a rural area where the stars are easy to see and shooting stars can be seen from time to time. I noticed a bright triangualr object just north of Orion. It caught my attention because of the size and shape. It was about an inch on all three sides(juding by - at arms length). I shut the car door and the the object flared shortly and split into two equal sized objects. The two objects then headed quickly in opposite directions. One headed North the other headed South. The one headed North satyed visible for no more than one or one-and-one-half seconds. The object headed South was visible for as long as three seconds. The whole incedent took no more than 10 seconds.<n>

2/25/01 17:45|Covington|TX|Egg|45 seconds|UFO sighting Over President  Bush's Tx White House?|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16630.html|19|ndxe200102| UFO sighting Over President  Bush&#39;s Tx White House?<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working Sunday evening online with my compter upstairs in my kitchen, I had an unobstructed view to the S.W. through two large windows which had the blinds pulled 3/4 of the way up... when I happened to notice an UNUSUAL CONTRAIL ARCING TOWARD THE NORTH FROM the direction of Waco, Texas. I am situated approximately 48 miles S.S.W. of Fort Worth and 45 miles North of Waco, Texas. As a former commercial pilot, with instrument and multi-engine ratings, I noticed that this particular contrail had a base which appeared over the apparent S.W. horizon and the angle was so steep (probable 60 degrees) that it immediately caught my attention- I went to the window for further investigation (thinking, perhaps this is an airliner in distress) - runaway elevator or loss of control, etc.--when much to my amazement, this object did a abrupt verticle ascent from a fixed point- that&#39;s right- no pull up with a normal curve at contrail bottom- I&#39;m talking about a change of direction, speed and ascent almost instantaneosly to the verticle- 90 degrees ascent and it accellerated as it went forward. Since the sun was setting in the Western sky and we had a clear sky this contrail and object was clearly visible, especially since it was reflecting in varying intensities as it passed throgh our upper atmosphere. I caught a very good reflection of the object with binoclars I keep in the kitchen- it HAD NO WINGS- EGG SHAPED, (not tublar like a missle) METALLIC SILVER WITH REFLECTIVITY OF BRIGHTLY POLISHED CHROME-- my estimate of altitude would be in the 25-30 thousand feet range when I first saw it... as it accellerated upward, the contrail was not continious, but rather sparoidic as if it were passing through different temps... I watched it till it disappeared from the sky..still in a verticle ascent- Good God, I thought this might have been a missle launch the way this craft behaved. The only major military based south of me is Fort Hood (approx. 100 miles as the crow flies) however, President Bush&#39;s Texas compound is prob! able 60 miles S.S.W- I called my parents, who live next door out to witness the event, but by the time they made it outside all that was left was the tale-tale sign of the lower contrail, except that the portion of the contrail that went verticle was still evident and they were also amazed as to the phemonenia. Hope this wasn&#39;t Saddam&#39;s avowed 1st attempt at retribtion. If it was however, our missle defense worked, because I&#39;m still here to report this sighting. There was no sound involved in this incident. From now on, I will replace the binnoclars with a video camera. Keep up the good work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be credible.  We addressed the possibility that he might have been observing an airliner reflecting sunlight, but he thought that was not the explanation.  PD))<n>

It was dark on an saterday night. Every one was asleep, i woke up to use the bathroom and i could see three balls of light.

2/25/01 04:00|Emporia|KS|Circle|1 minute|I saw a round, flying object in the middle of a field.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18213.html|22|ndxe200102| I saw a round, flying object in the middle of a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from a friend&#39;s house, out of town.  I was in the middle of nowhere, here in Kansas, near Americus.  As I come over a hill, I looked to my right, the passenger side of my car, and noticed a bunch of lights.  At first I thought it was only a cattle yard or something to that nature, until I looked a little more closely.  I seemed paralyzed when I saw what I saw.  I don&#39;t, or didn&#39;t, believe in ufo&#39;s or aliens, but what I saw was unexplainable, and unbelievable.  I seen a round object, about a quarter or a half mile from the highway.  I know it was round because of the bright lights that went around it.  They weren&#39;t colored lights, just white lights.  It was hovering above the ground, motionless.  Not horizontally, but at a slight angle.  Stunned, curious, but honestly and regretably a little frightened, I slowed my speed a great deal as I drove by.  I stared at the object as I drove right by it.  I wanted to stop, to go toward the object, but something inside me said to keep driving.  I have no doubt what I saw, even though I know I can never tell anyone close to me about this, because it sounds ridiculous, like there should be some kind of explanation.  But I&#39;ve driven that road many times and I know it well.  I know what I saw, I even try to dispute it to myself, but I can&#39;t, because I know what I saw.  Now I feel like I&#39;ve done something about it.<n>
2/25/01 01:16|Plymouth|MN||very brief|One beam of light that was bright white, covered the whole sky as far as the eye could see, followed by another bright white flash|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16622.html|23|ndxe200102| One beam of light that was bright white, covered the whole sky as far as the eye could see, followed by another bright white flash<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see an actual craft.  However, we saw a brief flash of bright white light that covered the ENTIRE sky.  It covered as far as the eye could see.  Right after this, we saw another bright white flash of light, with a blue streak in the middle of that.  There were just two flashes of light and we know it was not lightning because there was no sound whatsoever after the flashes of light.  The night that this was witnessed on was 2-25-01 in Plymouth, Minnesota.  It happened at about 1 am.  The weather was bad, with lots of snow coming down hard, and about 25 degrees.<n>
2/25/01 01:00|Sugar Land|TX|Sphere|10min|red and white sphere craft in sugarland tx|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17146.html|24|ndxe200102| red and white sphere craft in sugarland tx<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving along hwy 59 at the early hrs of the morning I and my friends saw a flash of light in the sky.  At first we thought it was the beginning of a storm but the flash occured again though this time it had beams of light that shot out like spotlights.  The beams and light zipped thru the clouds and behind some trees.  We followed to see if a small plane had come down.  As we got closer we could see light illuminating thru the trees and we proceeded to exit the car.  As we got out of the car the lights lifted and rose above the tree line directly in front of us and then above us.  To our shock we saw a sphere like craft with white and red pulsating lights about the size of a garage.  We could make out from the light beams designs in the metal.  The craft paused above us then spun furiously and shot straight up into the clouds again and headed north.  We could see the lights still in the clouds as it ascended and left into the distance.  This was no military craft that we have ever seen before.  But with living near an airforce base we chose to believe maybe it was something experimental.  We took long stares at each other and were quiet on the way home.  The next day we decided not to discuss the matter openly and take our experimental aircraft explanation as the logical explanation, yet we all know what we saw and have yet to see any ship or craft like that so make of that what you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has elected to remain anonymous.

It was a fairly dim, difuse red glow, circular to oval in shape, and about one and a half to two times the size of the full moon.  It was a cloudy night and I may have been seeing it thought the clouds. As I watched, the glow moved slowly to the east.  As it got nearly to the horizon, it seemed to get somewhat dimmer and more elongnated.  Just before it reached the horizon it seemed to fade quickly and disappear, although it&#39;s hard to be sure about that because soom branches were in the way.  I continued east three to four miles, but saw nothing further. I am a letter carrier in this area and have never reported a UFO before.<n>

We were staying at a place called the childrens house. The designated smoking there was outside, while I was outside, I looked up, it was late in the evening, there were many lights were like hazey, but moved in a way, like rotating, like a square dancing kinda thing. I stood and watched for as long as I was smoking, and I went inside and mentioned it to someone, they didn&#39;t think anything of it, and I went back out, the lights were gone. Its been on my mind all this time, cause it was right over my head. We were there for another week, and every night I would look for them, and they didn&#39;t come back.<n>

Rainier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the left rear passenger seat of my car with my husband driving (my mother was in the front passenger seat).  First I saw what I thought was a falling star, a bright stream of light in the Eastern night sky falling in a slight curve for what, in my visual field, was approximately 4 inches, but was located a great distance away, so of course would have been far greater in length.  A minute or so later I saw a bit farther south but still in the Eastern sky a fast moving light that was first bright white, then red, alternating.  This object was moving very fast and again a great distance away.  The object, continuing to change from bright white to red, to bright white, etc,  then began to move in an erratic fashion, jumping forward quickly, then up and down in a zig-zag fashion--not straight up and down but more in a pointed sine wave pattern.  At this point, I said something to my husband, and he pulled the car off the freeway.  After he started watching the object, we saw it move backward, in addition to up and down.  We continued to observe this odd motion for as long as we could.  The lights from oncoming vehicles on the freeway made it impossible to continue observing the object.  I observed two objects (the &#34;falling star&#34; and the red and white lighted object) and my husband saw only the red and white lighted object).  I didn&#39;t think about it at the time, but on telling my sister about it today, she pointed out that the direction we were looking was toward Mr. Rainier, where there have been repeated sightings over the years.  Neither, she nor I nor my husband have ever seen (or reported seeing) a UFO before.  I am a medical transcriptionist and my husband is a skilled laborer in a paper mill.  We are not given to flights of fancy.  We do not drink alcohol nor consume drugs.  We are honest, God-revering, regular people.  I am 49 and my husband is 45.  As we both saw the same thing, I am sure that what we saw was a UFO.<n>

I started tracking a jet which was moving rather slowly to the naked eye, as it was seemingly at a high altitude.  The jet was moving from Southeast towards Northwest.  Suddenly, a circular row of lights moved right over the jet and kept going the same direction the jet was going, only much much faster than the jet.  The circular row of lights appeared much higher than the jet and much larger also.  It travelled from horizon to horizon in what I have estimated to be about 5 seconds and was gone.  I found this rather odd; I have seen satellites before on a few occasions and this didn&#39;t vaguely resemble any I have seen.  I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m reporting this, just thought you might like to know.  This is the second oddity in our South Missippi skies that I have seen in less than 6 months, which is how long I have lived on the coast.  Any suggestions as to what it may have been?

With me was one of the store owners in his sixties, and the delivery man he is in his middle fourties.  As I walked out from under the awening covering the back door on a very clear and bright day I noticed the contrail of a commercial jet at roughly 30 to 40 thousand feet.  It was traveling in a south to southwesterly direction, probably more southerly.  The thing that caught my attention though was the fact that it&#39;s (the jet&#39;s) contrail was bent in an immediate if not severe ninety degree left turn.  I could see the jet and it&#39;s contrail clearly.  The jet continued on this new course for only a minute or so and then made another severe ninety degree turn to it&#39;s right to resume his origal heading.  As the airliner completed this manuever I noticed a tiny bright object immeadiatly to the right of the airliner.  This is where the jet would have been had it not changed it&#39;s course.  I then ran to my truck to get a pair of binoculars but by this time it had disappeared. The object appeared very small compared to the size of the airliner and had a highly reflective surface.  There were no visable characteristics other than this due to the high altitude. I asked the delivery person if he could see what I was seeing.  His reply was he could see something but could not tell what it was.  The store owners eyesight is severly impaired so he saw nothing but heard everthing we said.<n>

2/22/01 17:19|Murdock/Port Charlotte|FL|Other|:02-:03 min.|Possible exotic new stealth aircraft witnessed.|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16608.html|45|ndxe200102| Possible exotic new stealth aircraft witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TIME: 5:19 pm, U.S. east coast time, still daylight out, sun was above the treetops. LOCATION: Charlotte County (northern southwest Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico). EVENT: I was outside my home, returning from my mailbox and spotted a contrail in progress above my location. There were other contrails in the sky nearer the horizon, some criss-crossing. With the unaided eye, the size of the contrail was about half the width of a pencil at arm&#39;s length, with an elongated object about half the size of a pencil tip traveling in front of it. What was unusual was that the object was displaying a single reddish-orange glow or light along its length. I rushed and got a pair of binoculars and observed that the object appeared to be a conventional looking passenger or cargo jet, except for one big difference: its fuselage, at least the underside portion observable to me on the ground, was glowing or radiating a uniform bright reddish-orange color (not a point of light, but the entire length of the fuselage). The wings were normal in appearance, not glowing or lighted, and appeared, from the great distance, to be white, tan, or gray. Two contrails were forming a short distance behind the aircraft, which then combined into a single contrail (a normal occurrence). The aircraft was traveling southward along the Gulf Coast of Florida, yet slightly inland. The nearest international airport it could have flown out of is in Sarasota, and then north of that, in Tampa, where there is also a major headquarters-status  U.S. Air Force base (the Gulf War was managed from there). Since the sun was still above the treetops and there was no evidence of any sunset activity in the sky (even if there was, the aircraft would have needed a mirrored  fuselage to reflect the level of light seen), I lowered my binoculars and rushed inside the open side door to my garage to get a video camera I keep on a shelf and back outside. I timed it after the event and my eyes were off the aircraft only 8 seconds. When I looked back up in the sky, all I saw was the contrail cut off in its tracks where I had seen it last and no aircraft. I searched with my binoculars and couldn&#39;t locate any evidence of it, which should have still been visible. I wish now I had kept observing the jet with the binoculars for those 8 seconds. Was what I saw an exotic new U.S. stealth aircraft fitted with a skin of light panels that could allow it to blend into the sky upon activation, or is there a conventional explanation? I don&#39;t know.  All I can do is report what I observed. I&#39;ve witnessed one other definitely exotic stealth aircraft earlier in my life, totally different than this incident, but some things need and deserve continued secrecy.<n>

I opened the door to the outside to take a deep breathe of the cold morning air to help wake up.  I happened to notice what I thought was a meteor entering the atmosphere from the East coming in from the North.  I wanted to tell the others because it looked like a good one.  I decided just to watch it because it would be gone if I yelled for the other two people who were working.  It was coming in from the north and I was looking to the east it had a tail and appeared exactly like a shooting star or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it appeared to turn east and as it came closer it had 3 circular lights in the middle of it in a row.   It then cleared the sky from about 10 o’clock West to as far as the eye could see East in about 1 minute.  It cleary wasn’t a jet because after the incident I watched there speed in the sky to confirm my sighting!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I told them I was checking out this bright light, I put the object in my binculars and saw something I have never seen before in my life it was disk shape with 4 panels of lights two on top and two on the bottom, at that thime I grab my wife out the door and showed her she said  oh my god what is it, at time the object moved to our right and followed the ground on the mountain you could see like a beam or light from the bottom of it you could see this with your eyes you did not need the binculars to see it. the object followed the ground to the top of the ridge it went over the top of the ridge and stop just on the other side of it it stayed there for about 5 min then it was gone. at that time my son yelled look to the right and this object was moving left,right up and down with such speed I never seen anything be able to move like that it was not a helicopter or plane there was no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken numerous times with the witnesses to the events they describe, and we find them to be exceptionally credible and serious minded in their report.

2/21/01 20:15|Fishkill|NY|Diamond|10 Minutes|Black diamond-shaped object w/three bright white lights crossed I-84 and headed west paralleling highway towards Hudson River.|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16592.html|51|ndxe200102| Black diamond-shaped object w/three bright white lights crossed I-84 and headed west paralleling highway towards Hudson River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading west on I-84, approaching exit 13 (Fishkill, NY), as the highway crests a ridge and drops into a valley there is a panoramic view of the sky.  As usual, I scanned the sky for lights, and saw the usual assortment of recognizable aircraft lights.  However, at my 1:00 position (approx. NW), I saw a group of three very white bright lights in a straight line, close enough to each other that my initial reaction was that they couldn&#39;t be separate aircraft.  They were also much lower than aircraft in the area typically fly.  As I continued west, I tried to gauge the object&#39;s motion relative to mine.  While I initially thought the object was travelling east, opposite me, it began a banking manouver which carried it perpendicularly across the highway directly in front of me, approximately 1/4 mile away, and only a couple of hundred feet up at most.  Though it was night, there was more than enough ambient lighting from the surrounding area, so as the object crossed my path while banked to it&#39;s right side I could see it&#39;s bottom, which was a black diamond shape, with three bright white lights across it.  There were no discernable wings - it was as though I was looking at a large, black kite.  Two of the lights were at opposite points of the diamond, with the third in the middle.  Since the object was banked over, the three lights were in a vertical line.  The object continued it&#39;s turn, then levelled out at treetop height and continued westbound towards the Hudson River, paralleling the highway but on the other side from me.  My exit came up and I pulled off, then watched until the object left my field of view. When I first observed the craft, I called my girlfriend at home (appox. 2 miles from my position) intending to ask her to go outside and look for the object.  When she answered I didn&#39;t have a chance to ask, as right away she started telling me that she was watching an object from the house.  We agreed that it was the same craft, and she was able to view it for a minute or two after it left my view.  She had initially noticed it through the living room window, due to it&#39;s bright, unusually configured lights and low altitude. Though I&#39;ve always believed that our planet is (and has been throughout history) visited by extraterrestrials, I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like this myself.  This area of the Hudson Valley is known for many sightings, particularly during the early 1980&#39;s.  Having spent five years in the Air Force with a keen interest and familiarity with most types of aircraft, I know that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft.  This was not an instance of ambigous/anomalous lights in the sky.  I saw a distinct shape to the object.  Furthermore, it&#39;s flight characteristics were unusual.  Not in the sense of speed or extreme manouverability, but more regarding it&#39;s flight path.  Even if, for arguements sake, it was a military aircraft of unconventional design (Stewart AFB is nearby), I can&#39;t understand why it would fly so low as it crossed over a heavily travelled interstate highway, then descend to treetop level and parallel the road... As soon as I got home I continued to search the sky for another glimpse, and turned on the scanners, all in vain.  The morning paper didn&#39;t carry any stories about it, but hopefully others saw it and will report their sighting(s).  Tonight I plan to call the tower at Stewart and ask if they received any reports or tracked anything themselves.<n>

While on my way to my other job at one of the hotels driving north bound on I-215 I happened to look in the direction of the Las Vegas Stripand I saw what appeared to be a formation of about 10 lights in an oval shape floating in the vicinity of Mt. Charleston.  No strobe was apparent on the formation and there was other air trafic in the area.  These lights were of a yellow -orange color and faded with in intensity from time to time.  They also did not mantain their original shape, becoming a triangle at times and returning to their original circular shape.  I tried to keep them in sight while I drove but by the time I arrived at my destination they had disappeared or were obscured by objects in the distance.  They were over the North western part of the city and my prespective was fron the southeast heading north.<n>

We watched the object turn into three black dots, then into a cloud, then back into one large dot. The object appeared to transform into three small dots, going to horizontal, then vertical shape. The objects then went back into the large dot again. While watching the object, I looked up at the tower and observed the control tower personnel also looking into the direction of he object. They were watching with a very large pair of binoculars. Approximately 10 minaues into watching the object. Two small planes landed from different locations. the object then faded out and was not seen after that<n>

Searching the sky I could see the tiny, sporadic contrails which are often emitted during these daily flights.  Then I noticed a white light in a stationary position in the Northeast.  It was in the general area of where the jet had been training but it did not move for several minutes.  I had to take my eyes away for a few moments to attend to something.  When I searched the sky again, I saw that the object was now perched much nearer and appeared to have some solidity to it, though it mostly appeared as a reflective type of light.  It did look bigger and was in a more overhead location.  I positioned myself just under some telephone wires so I could better gauge any movement of the light.  It either remained very stationary, or would drift in irregular movements from time to time.  I watched it come into what appeared to be a nearer location- more overhead.  Its appearance of some kind of hard object grew more apparent.  I could almost determine the object to have a slight cylindrical, or oblong shape.  The jets that had been present earlier faded with their sound into the distance.  Just as the object was nearing a directly overhead position, I went to see if I could find my friend M who was outside somewhere nearby.  I did find him and we proceeded to both observe the object hold still, then drift, now apparently away from us.  Soon, I left M to watch and I went to find a pair of binoculars.  My son helped me look but we were unsuccessful.  Then my son and I joined M in observing the object for several more minutes as it alternated between moments of stillness and movement.  As it continued in a southerly direction, it appeared to either glow brighter with its own light or reflect more off of the sun.  This continued until it faded in the southern distance.  This daytime sighting comes after 2 nightime sightings of similar events at night 3 and 2 nights before- which were not reported here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a helium balloon.

I had been sitting there for an hour or so just relaxing and listening to geese, owls, cows and watching the airplane. I had rolled my window down and laid in the car sideways with my head resting partially out the window so I could see the sky. I saw a polar satellite go by at one point. I also saw a meteor which appeared to come from the constellation Cassiopea moving towards the west. I was thinking about leaving when I spotted a dark object moving from the southeast to the northwest rapidly. It didn&#39;t appear to have any lights and made no sound. It was in sight and out in less than 2 seconds. Needless to say I had a hard time getting a fix on it. It was about the width of my pinky finger one inch from my eye. This object appeared to be less than 1000 feet high. Here&#39;s what spooks me... it looked like it was alive. It looked more like an entity than a craft which is why it changed shape. NOTE: My wife and I have seen one of these before a couple years ago flying over Sedalia in the evening. It moved a little slower and was illuminated by the city lights. We were baffled. She thought maybe it was an angel... I&#39;m not so sure. Has anyone seen anything like this? Surely I&#39;m not the only one.<n>

It stayed in one place for a very long time and then simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:00 hrs. I saw a round object that I at first thought was an unusually big and bright star. I was driving at the time, so I was not sure if it was moving or not. I sopped about two miles from my house to look at it. It did not move. It was over my left shoulder. It was fairly high in the sky, but looked big. At times it seemed as if a halo was around it. I continued home and when I got there the &#34;star&#34;was over my right shoulder. (I&#39;m not sure whether it moved or not while I was driving. It seemed to, but who can be sure when they are moving themselves?)I got out of my car and watched it for a while. It stayed in the exact same spot. I had my neighbors outside light (1/8 mi. down the road if that) and trees as a reference point. I finally went in and ate. I went back out to check on the star. It was still there in the same spot. I hadn&#39;t called anyone nearby, I was afraid I&#39;d look stupid. There was a whole lot of activity in the air, which is unusual where I live. I&#39;m way out in the country. None of the aircraft approached the object that I could tell. I went back in and picked up my camera, not really thinking I could get a decent picture but I might be able to get a better look at it through my 300mm lens. It was gone. But there were other strange things happening. Across the road, I could see lights moving through the trees. The lights were fairly big so I could not justify what I was seeing with my own eyes. they were kind off light pinkish orange. This is the best I can describe them. This continued for another 1/2 hour or so at random. When the big &#34;star&#34; had left, the air traffic had also calmed down. This star was big and I don&#39;t understand my hesitation in calling for a witness. I didn&#39;t call anybody until it was all over. Ther&#39;s one thing I left out and it might seem crazy, but I got really sleepy at one point and went in to lay down. I fell asleep, but it wasn&#39;t long. the dog was barking like crazy and my cell phone was ringing,so I woke up. That&#39;s when I grabbed my camera ! and went outside. Like I said it was gone. I looked all around the sky to see if had moved with the rest of the stars. It simply was not there. That&#39;s why I am convinced I saw something unusual. I called my local airport, they were of no help. I also called the county communications department, they didn&#39;t know anything. I called several other places to no avail. I called the Richmond Air port this morning and they referred me to your number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wintess, and she seemed serious and credible to us.

No other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. Anyone else see the object?<n>

On several occasions have noticed a bright light to the south west.  Thought it was venus, however, this evening there were no other stars visible.  In addition, I did see a jet approaching Indianapolis from the east  and it was clearly moving.  The bright light (or lights) I saw disappeared after about an hour although another set of lights, directly above but much higher, were still visible.  I&#39;m not sure what the object(s) were because 1) they did not move; 2) the one set of lights disappeared; and 3) no other lights (e.g., stars, planets, etc.) were visible in the night sky other than the jet that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus currently is quite prominent in the southwest sky at the time indicated.

2/19/01 18:48|Irwin|PA|Light|4 minutes (?)|Very slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interference|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16553.html|69|ndxe200102| Very slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interference<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving US Route 30 East from Forest Hills (just outside Pittsburgh) to Irwin.  This is the usual route I take home from work.  My wife was in the car but was dozing and laying down.  As I came over the hill near Norwin High School I saw a light in the eastern sky - nothing unusual at first.  As I approached the intersection of 10th Street (Irwin) and Rt. 30, I noted that it was getting very much brighter (white) and was slowly &#34;pulsing&#34; in brightness - about one second from bright to dim and one second back again.  When I got closer, perhaps 1/2 mile from directly underneath it, I could see that it had two close-set front lights like headlights, both white, which no longer appeared to be pulsing.  It also had a red light on its port &#34;wingtip&#34; (relative position of the lights implied &#34;wingtip&#34;, but I could see no silhouette, only the lights), so I concluded it was a plane. It was moving to the west very slowly, though.  When I got closer still I could see the starboard &#34;wingtip&#34; light which was also red.  This struck me as a bit odd.  It was passing nearly directly overhead at this point.  My car&#39;s digital clock read 6:48 PM.  I was listening to a Pittsburgh  station (1410 KQV-AM) which breaks up and fades back in a lot in Irwin, but the static is typically just white-noise.  As the object passed overhead, the signal was lost in a wave of loud &#34;angry&#34; buzzing, which caused me to shut the radio off.  The car was not otherwise affected. The object was moving west very slowly indeed at this point.  Since neither size nor distance were known I&#39;ll put this in terms of objects at arm&#39;s length.  Its length was about 1/2 the width of a normal music CD at arm&#39;s length, and it was moving (when directly overhead) about 1 CD-diameter in about 7 seconds. Since it was moving in the opposite direction to me, I thought this was unusually slow for a non-hovering aircraft, so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear it (thinking perhaps it was a helicopter and the &#34;wingtip&#34; effect of the red lights was an illusion).  I could hear absolutely nothing but the other cars - no &#34;airliner roar&#34;, no chopper blades, nothing. I should note that I work near several hospitals in Pittsburgh.  If a helicopter is sufficiently low to appear that large (and they often are), I can easily hear it going overhead, even over the roar of a busy Pittsburgh street and my car&#39;s engine with the windows rolled up. So between the red (not green) starboard lights, the radio interference (which was gone after I passed about 1/2 mile &#34;behind&#34; the object), the slow motion, and the silence, I&#39;m very confused.  Again, all I could see was two white &#34;headlights&#34;, closely set, with two red lights at &#34;wingtip&#34; positions.  I guess you could call it a &#34;triangle&#34;, but again I emphasise I saw no silhouette, only the lights themselves. It may have been a perfectly conventional craft, but it was nothing I&#39;m familiar with.<n>

There were no sounds, but the object(s) had to either be extremely large or close to the earth, as they were much larger than the running lights of several airplanes that were overhead at different altitudes around the same time. I thought at first it could be the space station or shuttle, or, maybe a sattelite, but realized it was travelling East to West. The lights never blinked or changed intensity, And I think they actually jumped a bit to theNorth as they approached the Western horizon.

I think I can explain these sightings. I was on patrol and saw a white, disc shaped object approaching from the eastern sky on that same evening. Object was as previously described, white glowing disc shape, apparent colored lights on the side, moving at aircraft speed with no sound. At the time I first saw it, it would have coming from the Cabazon/Redlands area, passing over Moreno Valley and heading towards Mead Valley. It was quite spectacular to see. I took out some binoculars to observe the object more closely. On closer inspection, I could see that it was a small advertising blimp which was illuminated from within by bright white lights. The skin was translucent, giving the impression of a glowing disk or cigar. The blimp had multicolored lettering on the sides (I couldn&#39;t quite make out what it said) giving the impression of rows of colored lights. This is the only time I have seen this particular type of blimp locally. There is/was a company which makes blimps located at the old Norton AFB site, possibly a test flight of a blimp for delivery to some other part of the country?<n>

Our ranch is situated between low hills to the north and the south in a rather remote area; three families live on the property in separate residences.  At about 7 p.m. on Feb. 18, our neighbor&#39;s 14-year-old daughter started knocking on our door yelling that there was a flying saucer in the canyon.  We didn&#39;t believe her, but we rushed outside to see what was up anyway.  When we got outside we saw an enormous glowing oval-shaped object hovering in the sky to the south.  The object was about a quarter of a mile away and about 300 feet off of the ground.  It was a bright flourescent pale, pale greenish silver.  I perceived a domed top, and a row of different colored lights running horizontally across it.  It had a white light on the bottom of it.  It was hanging very low above the field, and then it slowly moved west behind a hill.  We ran and got our quad-runner out of the barn and raced up to the top of the hill along the power road to see if we could get another look at it, but there was nothing up there.  Our neighbor suggested that it might be a blimp, but it looked nothing like a blimp, it was much too large, and there was no good explanation as to why a blimp would be flying so low through the canyon at night in the dark.  We called the Redlands PD to see if anyone else had reported anything unusual, but we told no.  We&#39;ve been trying to get through to March ARB which is near our home, but their line has been busy.<n>

I thought wow an owl. But thier was no flapping wings and after a long look I was thinking, &#34;That is the biggest owl I have ever seen.&#34; So started to think it was a larg grey balloon. Like the ones you to advertise with but it was a waired color for that Grey, Black, and white. The white was dirty and bloochy streaks. Going with the balloon I stepped on it. Well I was going 65 MPH and the balloon was accelerating away. Then was just plain gone!!! I fallowed this balloon from Pheasant Dr in Gilbert to 74 St in Mesa this is a distance of 1.5 miles maybe a little less. Thier was a balloon going plus 65 MPH in Southeast Mesa on a Friday night? No. This was no balloon or an owl. It made no noise or smell and had no lights. In thinking about it The only reason that I saw anything was the fact that this thing was &#34;flying&#34; just above the light polls along the side of the road. It could not have been over 50 feet off the ground. It stayed at that height for the whole encounter till it was gone. I wonder why it was so low. This is really odd because half a mile to the South thier is a line of high tension power lines. The fallowing day their was a flight of three F-18 Hornets that where fly around that part of the valley. They could have came from Luke or Davis-Monthan, I never see those type of aircarft on this side of the valley.<n>

I went out with a hand gun hoping to shoot one when I saw what looked like a blood red star in the north west. I went back in the house to get my rifle because it has a very good 20 X scope. I had my wife come out to see it.  In the scope at full power it still looked like a blood red star. I watched it for a few min and it took on a slight greenish color at the top but stayed mostly blood red. It moved side to side just a bit and got smaller. I was left with the impression that it was moving away to the north west. It reminded me of the way the space shuttle looks when they have a night launch and it is moving away and all you can see is the engine burning as it fades away in the distance. My wife thought it looked like a kite moving side to side. I told her that it could not be a kite because there is no wind.  We watched it till it got so small it was getting hard to see it. My wife is in the insurance business and I do some precious metal investing. We have lived here for about 16 years. My e-mail is the best way to contact me.<n>

There were no objects at either end, it then moved across the sky at a brisk pace west to east, retaining its form. I have observed many contrails, and this was different, it moved retaining its shape, (no windrift shape change or spreading).  As it passed the visible planets Jupiter, Saturn and the stars Aldebarab and Sirius it occluded them, but a private plane flew overhead about 2-3 thousand feet on the flight path from Burbank airport and the plane was much lower than the beam. It was hard to determine if it was a cloud or a beam of light.  It may have been the edge of an O-ring type formation of which we could only see one edge, (radar ring?).  This comes on the night following the Bombing of Iraq and several Russian missle tests.  None of us have ever seen anything similar in over forty years each.<n>

I live out in the country were there are a lot of rice farms and it is usually very dark. These lights look very similar to the light reflected from planets, yet they turn on and off and move.  This event:  There were two bright lights, approx. eye level to myself 5&#39;-10&#34;, one on top of the other with an outstreched hands thumb space between.  The bottom lights path then rotated clockwise till they were side by side.  At this point we noticed that the space between them was decreasing as the lights appeared to merged.  We noticed three more of these lights just south of these that stayed stationary while the others moved.  This was a steady motion that took around 2 - 3 min. When the moving light merged, the others went out.  This is a fairly common event seen from my home and witnessed by atleast 13 people that I know of.  I have also notice an extreme increase in air traffic at night.  I am a police officer and have talked with some of the sheriff&#39;s deputys that work in that part of the county but none offered any info.

2/16/01 19:00|Lemoore/Hanford|CA|Other|approx 2 minutes|Unidentified Silent Aircraft near Lemoore AirForce Base|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16517.html|91|ndxe200102| Unidentified Silent Aircraft near Lemoore AirForce Base<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were traveling back from San Francisco on Friday, February 16, 2001 and on our trip we both saw something that was really weird... We were on the I-5 going south and we realized we had gone to far south of Fresno (where I live) when we hit the 198 going east/west.  Realizing our mistake we got on 198 heading east towards Hanford with the intention of transferring to the 99 Northbound in Hanford and heading back up to Fresno.  However, about halfway there (not far from the Lemoore Airbase, I found out) I saw something out the window that made me do a double take. I saw several pale &#39;twinkle&#39; lights like those seen on airplanes and helicopters, however they were all white (no red or blue or green) and there were several beams of pale light moving across the ground.  My very first impression was that there were 3 helicopters flying in very tight formation using spotlights to look for something....  my next thought was that maybe it was a crop duster or something doing some sort of night job... but after a few seconds I realized that neither of these were correct.... I pointed it out to  my friend (who was driving) as it was out his window (to the north) and I think maybe less than 100 feet off the ground... and it seemed to be moving very slowly and gracefully.... it then arced upward and turned back towards the freeway (coming south) that we were on and as it passed overhead I managed to see a really faint silhouette against the black night sky... I could barely make out an airplane shape with very long thin wings and large, ellipsoid shaped bulbs at the tips of both wings... and as it flew overhead there was absolutely no sound whatsoever...  it then performed a very graceful but tight turn and flew back over the freeway again (this time heading north) and as it flew over the field to our left I saw again 3 faint, silvery nimbus&#39;s of light (almost like searchlights) coming from what looked like the underside of the nose and the 2 ellipsoid shapes at the tip of the wings, and the light app! ared to be sweeping back and forth over the ground.  At this point I was really excited because I had never seen anything like it before. My friend told me to dig the camera out from the backseat and try and take pictures of it... so I dug around in the back really quickly and by the time I got it ready, the object had once again flown over us and was pacing us to the right (south of 198 heading east in the same direction as us) maybe a quarter of a mile out and a hundred or so feet off the ground...  I then attempted to take several pictures... but as the craft was completely dark and there was no real light reflections the only thing I could see were its steady blinking lights... So I tried to time it as best I could to try and capture a picture when the lights were actually on instead of off, but as I write this I don&#39;t know how they&#39;ve turned out...  However I&#39;m pretty sure its not a UFO but some sort of secret plane from the Lemoore Airbase... and I was wondering if I draw a picture of what I think I saw, do you know someone who might be able to tell me what I saw based upon its outline and its behavior...??  My friend thinks it was maybe an A-10 Tank-killer, because what he saw differs from what I saw by a little... however, I don&#39;t think this is correct because of the 3 lights and the fact that it made no sound at all... So anyhow, I am trying to find out if the plane is something common or if it is might be one of the top secret ones that you hear about (like the aurora)...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness.  He seems to have ruled out most possible explanations for the sighting, and he apparently will speak with personnel from Lemoore Air Base in the near future.  PD))<n>

All 4 in-line, they stopped for about 4 seconds, front 2 moved on, then 2-4 light piston engined aircraft appeared within 3 minutes and flew in a criss-cross pattern near the lights. Contacted UK UFO groups, and local airport, East-midlands at Castle Donnington.  Then contacted local newspaper.  6.20PM was about 20-30 minutes after sundown. All I saw I have described, and I have never seen anything so unusual in all my life! Lights very like lights people have been capturing on video in recent years.<n>

I thought I noticed movement to the north looking about  30 degrees up, just over some tall pines nearby. I then noticed two stars traveling west to east, one behind the other,  separated by what appeared to be a mile or more. I  thought it was probably a couple military jets but I did not see any blinking lights so I went in to get my binoculars. Through the binoculars the objects appeared as stars,bright white lights and nothing else. There was no sound  heard after their passing as there normally would be with jets. I got my son to take a look and we watched them disappear. They seemed to fade out or enter high clouds. Lights from the town tend to hamper the view of the sky in the direction they were traveling.<n>

I know there might be normal explanations for this observation, but it just did not look normal to me.<n>

There is a road about five miles south-west of Sullivan, WI. A few other people along with myself have witnessed strange lights and objects along this quiet road. The lights are red, white and sometimes multied colored. They move strangely in ways that plane could not. They appear from below the treeline, skim atop the trees and then will dip below the trees again. I have seen so many different lights and objects that I couldn&#39;t possibly explain them all. I have spent countless hours gazing upward. There was also a mentally retarded individual that disappeared from a nearby town, who was medically dependent and could not survive long without his medication. He was gone for four days in late October, and then reappeared 100 feet off of this road, unhurt, suffering only from slight dehydration. There is also a federal weather station located near the road. I always wondered if the weather station was a cover for something els. Or perhaps a landmark used by ET life. All I know is that I have seen things that I can not explain. The sightings usually occur between 21:00 and 24:00. They last sometimes 15-20 minutes. For the best chances face due east on the road. Most of the sightings are seen in the eastern sky. The name of the road is Herr Road. From Sullivan, WI take Hwy E south out of town about five miles. Herr Road is on the east side of the road. The best view is on the straight away facing east.<n>

You must understand that this is a very small community nestled in the hills with no airports within 20 miles. While on my deck watching this event my next door neighbor came running out...this copter was SO LOW and so LOUD that the house was shaking...and asked me what was happening...at least 2 children were in the doorway watching...we exchanged a couple of words on the matter and he asked me what I thought it was and I told him &#34;I dont want to say&#34; as I glanced at the children. From the perspective of the movies the helicopter sounded large and POWERFUL...like a &#39;huey&#39;...the only light on the copter was a single small red light...I&#39;m not sure of the location on the copter because my attention was fully focused on the orange light which by then had moved completely out of sight. This &#39;circus&#39; of light and sound seemed to be following Vt. Rte 346 in a &#39;northerly&#39; direction.<n>

What I saw was an Impulse contrail just below the cloud level. There were two trails which appeared to be no more than 10 to 12 feet apart. They both had the tell-tale impulse shape ie: puff of smoke straight line puff smoke straight line etc. The trail that was to the right had an almost spiral look to it. I observed this for about 10 seconds then turned towards our front door and called my wife out to see the trail. It took her no more than 5 seconds for her to come outside. By the time she got there the contrail had almost completely disipated. I ran to the back of the house and went out the back door to see if I could view the aircraft that made the trail. Where the trail was at the back of the house  seemed to be where it had started. The trail went from East to West. I went out to the front again but there was practicaly nothing left of the trail at that time. My wife and I heard no sounds during this event, nor did we witness any vehicles in the sky around our home.<n>

As soon as we passed it, it flew across the road in somewhat of an arch and then came up behind us and followed us at about tree-level.  It seemed to fly curved to its side instead of a straight path.  It followed us for about 2 or 3 miles getting closer than slowing down.  We were the only ones on the road and then another car started to come down the road and it flew behind the trees and stopped.  We didn&#39;t see it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No date is indicated for the event.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date for the night before the report was written.

I called MCconnel AFB the guard I spoke to had seen it but had no idea what it was. I met someone at our local mall years later who also had seen it but had no information. I also called our local tv station and cosmosphere, very few people saw it and it didn&#39;t seem like a big deal to them. I emailed coast to coast but no response there either, For such a weird event with multiple witnesses there is very little documentation.

The family has a very good view of the city of Calgary. One evening the family watched a craft over top of Calgary back in 2001. They reported observing an object for approximately two hours. The lady told me the family got a new telescope for Christmas and this evening in February was the first time they really tried it out. It was cold outside so they set the telescope up indoors and viewed the skies from the comfort of their home looking through one of their large living room windows. The lights were turned off as they did not want to have their view obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The family noticed a bright object high in the sky and first thought it may have been the planet Venus. So they turned the telescope slightly to have a peek at it. (At this point I should tell you that the weather conditions were good and the skies clear and the temperature down to about minus 29).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they lined up the telescope using the view finder and then looked through the scope they were surprised to see an object which was shrouded in clouds. There were no other clouds visible in the sky that they noticed. The object that was witnessed had an elliptical shape to it. One end of it was poking out of the cloud cover and they were surprised to see windows on the craft. She said she could clearly see through the telescope that the object had windows which ran down along its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady said it looked as if whatever this was, was trying to impersonate a star. The object would move around the sky very slowly and if anyone on the ground would have seen it, they may have just thought it to be a star or planet. She said it was very high up in altitude. After taking roughly a five minute break from looking through their telescope she came back and now viewed two bright objects. One was stationary over top of the other and offset by half the length of one of the crafts. Both objects still wrapped in a cloud cover and she saw a long tube which was connecting the two objects at roughly a forty five degree angle. The woman said it was a beautiful, cylindrical shaped tube wrapped in cloud. Also it was reported that the cloud cover stuck very close to the shape of the objects and not spread out across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the bottom object, or the end which was sticking out of the cloud cover that she could see had windows, which were the same shape of the objects or roundish. When the objects moved directly overhead of Calgary all of the electricity went out. When the objects moved to the outskirts of the city the power came back on and eventually the crafts moved out of sight. The lady said it was a very exciting night and one they would never forget.

We were facing south, and in the background are hills and Mt Wainui and in the foreground are trees to our left and to our right. We noticed a point of light in the sky facing due south at about an angle of 55 degrees. It was the behaviour of this &#39;point of light&#39; that caught my eye. When I first observed it, it was about the size of the star Canopus. It was only seconds after this that it rapidly expanded in size and brightness to the size of about my fist held straight out in front of me and the suddenly shrunk rapidly back to a small point of light, smaller then what it was to begin with. It then proceeded to peform unbelievable maneuvers, climbing vertically and down again, turning at right angles and moving in a zig-zag fashion at incredible speeds as if intelligently controlled. It eventually disappeared moving at high speed in a SSE direction. I love observing the sky and have been stargazing for years so I can quite confidently say that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, satellite, planet, shooting star or meteorite. There is a flight path that passes over us from Wellington and a small aerodrome about a kilometer west of us so I&#39;m 100% sure it wasn&#39;t a plane, as all planes that pass over are easily identifiable. Although it was an outrageous sight to see, I must admit it left me a little unnerved.<n>

It was quiet in tone but could hear a constant noise that was soft,in nature. But defined there was some sound, but faint. The UFO then turned to the north. It appeared to be traveling at a good rate of speed. I then went inside to get my parents but when we went outside it was gone.<n>

It was very near the brightest star in the sky and almost as big.  Two similar looking airplanes in close proximity flew together and circled the area once.  Then the planes flew off in different directions.  Immediately following this, the light began to wane and flicker slightly and move up (which is the only way we can describe it) in a seemly westward direction, but definitely up.  It was also moving side to side in quick movements as it went away from us.  The light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared into the clear night sky.  As we saw it, it seemed to go out of the atmosphere as opposed to any direction imparticular.  We watched for several minutes afterward, but nothing returned.<n>

The first day the object actually came straight down from above the volcano and looked somewhat like a huge silverish colored cylinder. It took at least 15 minutes to make the descent and when it impacted Popo, whoever was manning the live cam actually zoomed in on the explosion. The next day I saw the same type of thing, only this time there was no explosion, though it looked like it would have impacted the top of the volcano. Then this morning I checked the live cam for any increased volcanic activity and couldn&#39;t believe it when I saw a disk shaped silvery colored object, at least the size of a huge jet or football field, approach from the left side of the screen. It hovered over the volcano at about a 45 degree angle for at least fifteen minutes, and once again, I captured the still pictures. The object today actually hovered up there in the steam and smoke directly above the crater for a long time, so I captured a total of 50 pictures of the thing. Each picture is about 25K so would have to be emailed separately, but I would send them to you if you&#39;re interested. This is from the Cenapred live cam and each captured picture has the date and time on it by Cenapred so you can see how long it stayed over the volcano, before it simply vanished. Please email me if you&#39;d like any of the pics. I have series from 3 days in a row now. If not, you might want to watch the Popocatepetl live cam for yourself. I am concerned, because if this is some kind of attempt to control the volcano, it could have repercussions in other areas, affecting earthquakes, or at least the movement of magma below ground. Could they be experimenting? And what kind of craft could hover up there right over the volcano in those extreme temperatures and air currents for long periods of time without being destroyed???<n>

I was looking up the street for the bus and suddenly saw what looked like a large white spotlight shining down on the cloud layer from above. It was at least the apparent width of two fists at arms&#39; length, and although it was clearly visible and had well-defined edges it was not extremely bright. It was moving from north to south (approximately) when it first &#39;switched on&#39;, and moved across about 1/3 to 1/2 of the sky before it went off again. There was no sound, and the entire sighting lasted about a second and a half. No searchlight beam was visible coming up from the ground, and in any case the light appeared to come from behind the clouds (smaller and lower clouds appeared dark against it).<n>

This amount of witnesses may seem high, and you may be asking how can you be sure they all saw it.  It was so phenomenal that everyone&#39;s eyes, regardless of their location, went straight to the U.F.O.  It was a big red object, in the shape of a heart, and at first scared all the girls.  We then felt warmth radiate from the big red object, and our smile&#39;s grew.  It was an unstoppable force, from the unknown.  We all started hugging eachother and longing for our boyfriends.  This thing had such power!  As the shape came clearer, it was obvious it was a heart!  It hovered around for about 20 minutes then whizzed out of view.  If you know what this/where it is please let me know.  We are all curious and dumbfounded about what this powerful object/force was.  If you need additional informantion please email me ((e-address deleted)) Thank you------HAPPY V-DAY!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Valentines Day had something to do with this sighting.

The passenger was a bouncer at a night club in New Rochelle.  I was driving down Palmer Ave in New Rochelle where the passenger lives and before the passenger got out of the cab a space craft flew right over the cab at tremdous speeds that we were both able to observe this sighting for at least 3-4 seconds before disappearing.  It was like a starwars space craft flying through our atmosphere at Hyperspeed motion.  I was able to see thrust coming out the back for a split second.  We looked at eachother and the passenger thought it was fireworks.  I said no it was a flying UFO we just witness together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We  acknowledged the lights for only a second at first, until they got so bright we pulled over. It was one&#39;o clock in the morning but the lights were so bright we could see all around us like it way day. When we pulled over another car parked and watched with us. Then our car radio began making this noise, not at all like static, but a banging frequency sound is the only way to describe it. There were about four to six of them, hovering the sky above us. They were vey small but were very bright. They were red at when still but a whiteish-blue when moving. They had no particular shape to them, round when still and flat when moving. They &#34;whistled&#34; when they moved, a very high pitched sound. They were so close at one time we had to cover our ears because of the sound. They were flying in all angles, speeding and stopping freely. They had no particular formation but they stayed in a close group. Lights shot out from them that looked like it was behind them but wasnt. They stayed directly above us, and it was strange because we were the only part  of the area that was lit up. This lasted for about half an hour then they shot across the sky and vanished.<n>

It traveled from north to southwest. As it was traveling southwest, it broke up into two stars, one continued southwest and the other spun out and dropped down and then disappeared. It looked liked there was a short but breif lazer light exchange between the two stars. This is not the first time i&#39;ve witness this. ALWAYS in the same area or location. I was out looking for the space shuttle, and was viewing the other side when I saw this.<n>
2/13/01 18:20|Rochester|NY|Light|30 seconds|Red and white lights moving in unison at high speed with very quick zig zag directional movements ((90 degrees).|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16465.html|118|ndxe200102| Red and white lights moving in unison at high speed with very quick zig zag directional movements ((90 degrees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:20 pm on February 13, 2001, I viewed an unusual light in the SW sky as I was looking at Venus in it&#39;s early evening brightness. My sighting was made in the parking lot of my apartment building on a very clear early night sky. Traveling in a more or less straight line from west to east were two lights in close proximity, one red, one white. They were blinking on and off in rapid stroboscopic fashion. As they moved at a fairly fast rate of speed (faster than a jetliner trailing contrails) the lights moved in unison in rapid jinking or zig zag movements along the straight flight path axis. The very swift directional zig zags veered of the flight path axis about 20 degrees above and below the flight path. Directional movement angles were extremely high, approximately 60 to 90 degrees every one or two seconds. I watched these lights move along the fairly straight flight path for approximately 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the roofline of my apartment building. What caught my eye away from the bright light of Venus was the rapid and severe directional zig zags of the lights as they moved forward. Their changes in direction were instantaneous. I&#39;ve never seen a light or discernible object in the sky make such quick movements. There was no shape or object visible in the darkening sky, only the white and red lights moving as a unit. I am a writer and illustrator who specializes in aviation and space technology and history. I&#39;ve had 6 books published on the history and technology of aircraft and 8 books on space exploration technology/history and astronomy. I am very knowledgeable about the flight capabilities of existing (officially acknowledged)aircraft and spacecraft. No current aircraft or spacecraft is capable of the very quick directional movements that I observed. I don&#39;t know what the lights were, but they were not the lights of any known vehicle. This is my first UFO sighting and was quite a surprise to me considering the extremely mundane sighting environment and conditions. I am wondering if there have been any other reports from this region on the date and time described?<n>

After about a second or 2 it re-appeared in what must of been 20 miles to the east over the ocean. It remained there for maybe 10 seconds or so and then glowed brighter and vanished. The light was white and it did seem like it was flickering or hazy but it was really strange how it glowed before it vanished each time. After the second time I couldn&#39;t find it again (I wanted to pull over but was on an expressway) I noticed one of the planes had stopped leaving trails (I&#39;m assuming to make a turn) I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it but I intend to watch the news tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite credible.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light hovers over western Olympia, WA for over 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was close to 9pm and I was listening to the local community radio station, KAOS, out of the Evergreen State College. A woman who sounded like she was in her late 30&#39;s-early 40&#39;s called in to ask if anyone else had reported an unusual light in the west. The station&#39;s talk show host disregarded the caller, but I ran outside and looked to the west. It was a very clear night sky. Low on the western horizon was a very bright light that was magnitude 1 in brightness compared to the rest of the night sky. It was very slowly drifting to the north-northwest. After getting a winter jacket, I ran from my backyard to a better vantage point. I positioned myself on the Capital Blvd. bridge over I-5 and sighted the object in the west. It was just sitting low on the horizon and after a few minutes, it would drift north and then stop again. The bright light was white in nature with an impression of red, but at my distance it was difficult to tell. I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft taking off from the Olympia airport to the south and I noticed that several planes had taken off, but changed their flight patterns from the normal pattern that would have taken them within close proximity of the object in the west. The planes were all banking sharply to the northeast. After about 10 minutes, the object had drifted behind some evergreens in the foreground. I decided to run back home for a pair of binoculars. Upon reaturning the object was no longer in view from the bridge. I changed position but still didn&#39;t see the object again. I did notice that several more aircraft had taken off and still they veered to the east. I thinking that since I heard of this object on the radio I&#39;m not the only person who witnessed this light. I know that there was at least one other person; the woman who tipped off the radio listeners that Monday night.<n>

We were traveliing state route 261 west, as we crested the top of a hill and I notice a triangular shape hovering over several houses.  At first thought it was a tower because of the light configuration and the height off the ground, approx 300 ft. high. Then my wife asked if I seen the lights.  She said, &#34;I didn&#39;t know they put a tower up there.&#34;  I responed by saying there is no tower there, only houses.  As we got closer,  We could clearly see the triagle shape.  My wife looked to the north and notice a similar light configuation not to far away hovering.  I then looked the the south, I noticed the same thing to the south.  With out thinking, we came up to the road near to the lights, I turned down the road to get a better look.  We came about 500 ft from the object and could clearly see the object was grey and had three red lights on the corners with a white light in the middle.  It was completly silent.  When we got closer and object slowly moved to the east.  My wife noticed the other object to the north moved in a paralle line to the large object.  Then the radio went out.  As we went around the circle at the end of the road, the object began slowly moving west.  We past under the object.  My wife said we should go staight home.  We were only several min. from home.  My wife continued to watch the object until she could not see it any more.  We also noticed the other objects were also gone.<n>

2/11/01 22:35|Virginia Beach|VA|Diamond|1-1.5min.|Solid diamond shaped craft moving incredibly slow and silent E/SE in VA Beach on 2-11-01|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16441.html|127|ndxe200102| Solid diamond shaped craft moving incredibly slow and silent E/SE in VA Beach on 2-11-01<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:35pm I witnessed a very unusual flying object. Heading East/Southeast above and just South, if not directly above Interstae 264 (formerly Route 44) there was an &#34;object&#34; which was diamond shaped and had 4 red lights on each &#34;corner&#34; flying relatively low to the ground and absolutely silent. I would say it was probably a half mile up in the sky and about a half mile away from where I witnessed it. This  &#34;object&#34; was moving so slow! If it were a plane, it would have fell from the sky! No planes fly this slow. I couldn&#39;t beleive it! Its lights were not blinking or rotating. They were solid red and stayed in the same posistion for the duration that I witnessed it. When I first saw it, It was just a red light in the sky that was slowly getting closer to me as time passed. As it got closer into view, I could easily make out its shape. It passed my view roughly a half mile from me. Last night was a chilly night with absolutely no wind at all. It was completely still outside except for the very faint sound of occasional traffic in the distance from the interstate. If it had any moving parts or a combustable engine on it...I would have heard it! With the angle that I had witnessed this (about 30 degrees), it was a solid object, and the diamond shape of it was very distinct. After it passed out of my view I ran outside to get another perspective while I still had the chance and was able to witness it again for about another 10 seconds as it silently passed out of my view for good. I do live in a city which has a lot of Military and flying aircraft which practice out of Oceana Naval Air Station which is is the general direction that this &#34;object&#34; was heading, but I see and hear these jets all the time as anyone who lives near me will say too. This was not a fighter jet! Nor was it a helicopter. Before I witnessed this &#34;object&#34;, I could hear plain as day other aircraft in the far distances which were miles away! This thing was within &#34;rifle range&#34; of me and wasn&#39;t making a sound. Every aircraft that I have ever seen in my lifetime has had at least one blinking (beacon) light on it, and/or at least one white light. What kind of &#34;craft&#34; flies around with 4 solid red lights on it, and no beacon light?! Lastly, and most certainly, I mentioned that this &#34;object&#34; was roughly travelling over the interstate highway...well the vehicles which were occasionally travelling in the same direction as this thing (east/southeast) were moving much faster in the same general direction than the &#34;object&#34;! So my guess is that it was probably moving at about 30-50 mph.<n>

It looked sort of like a big white flare, except it didn&#39;t movefor a bout 4 or 5 minutes, when it suddenly faded to a pinprick and moved right, then vanished. I was fascinated by the object, and couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it. fterwards I felt passive, not excited by it or anything.

It was also changinbg colors!  Yes, it was changing different colors, right in front of our eyes!  It wasn&#39;t moving too fast, however, it was moving fast enough, so that we only saw it in the sky for 2 minutes.  It seemed like there was no opening, as though it were just a full, perfect sphere.  That&#39;s all we saw of it, but we&#39;re sure it was a UFO.<n>

I thought at first that it was a head light to a plane moving toward us through the trees as we got closer to the light I started telling my daughter that it looks like a bright star or planet. As we drove down the road it seemed to follow us just above the trees . I stopped the car and rolled down the window to listen for any sound .There was no sound. I continued down the road passed the turn home because I could not believe what we where seeing . We came to the end of the road where we stopped to look at this bright star when it flickerde out of sight. At that time my daughter was tired and when I got excieted about the incident and suggested that it was a UFO she quickly stated that we han seen a comet. We went home and told every one about what we thougt was a comet . The reason I say that is I saw the bright star again tonight about the same time as the last encounter. I was on my way over to my sisters house and noticed the bright star again. I could not resest driving back down the same road to look at it again. This time it was just hovering in the sky like agreat big star. Iwent to my sisters house and told them to take a ride with me to see this awsum star . this would be 20 minutes or so later. the star had changed its position. My sister and her children could not believe how big and bright the star was and as we watched ,it would become real bright and then fade alittle we watched it slowly move out of sight. Wedrove to a small private air port to ask if they had witnessed any thing but it was closed. I came home to share the experience with my family and of course my husband thinks that I am nuts. I decided to get on the net to find information on the reporting of UFOs and here I am. We are located near a Navy nuclear power plant , is it possible that it could be related?<n>

We were facing north. The lights were stationary for awhile, then one light moved rapidly to the left. Suddenly, there appeared another light with the remaining four. We could not determine what the lights were. At first we thought they were helecopters, but when one would suddenly appear, we knew it must be something else. The couple we were with, who lived in the area, had never seen the lights before, and were as baffeled as we were as to their origin.<n>

I thought this was strange because it was not holiday, fireworks are illegal in this area. None-the-less, people do shoot off fireworks sometimes but I had only see people shooting them off on New Years and Forth of July so I was curious what was going on in my back yard.  My house is on the bay and I got out of my truck and went around the house to the back yard and walked out on my dock to see what was going on.  The dock is pretty long and extends about 300 feet into the bay.  When I got to the end, I didn&#39;t see anyone and and started walking back to shore and to my house.  I was looking up in the air for the source of the lights I had seen earlier and at the exact second my I was looking in its direction, bright color lights came on.  The object was just above tree level and very close. It was not moving and I am positive it was reacting with me.  Several different color lights flashed on in sequence in a horizontial band around what I could best describe as an oval shape.  I was well aware of the hundreds of reports in this area from the late 1980s but generally thought they were fakes. At that split second, I questioned my belief and quite frankly got a little scared. The object was between me an land and I wasn&#39;t sure what to do.  It was dark and after the light display, I think my eyes dialated because I lost some of my night vision and I didn&#39;t see anything else in the sky.  I paused for a moment and walked, with a little fear, back to my house and went into the back door of my house.  I never told anyone but my wife about it. Some of the things that were striking about it was that it was so close, it was a relatively small object (maybe two automobiles in size), it was low, just above the trees, perfectly quiet and what was most rememerable was the crisp, clear color lights. They were very bright! but wha t I most recall was thinking how clear and pure the color looked.  I am an engineer, a general skeptic (read The Skeptical Inquirer regularly), professional and well known in the community. People around here don&#39;t talk much about UFOs because of the bad publicity we received in the late 80s and early 90s and I worry about my professional reputation by telling people. I can say for certain this was no airplane, helicopter, firework, ballon, star, swamp gas or anything else my rational trained mind can explain. It is by all accounts an unidentified flying object.  The funny thing is that although that was the closes I have been to an unidentified object, over the years that I have lived in the Gulf Breeze area, I have seen many unexplained objects hovering around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Of course I had no clue either, but we noticed that we were not the only ones seeing it because most people driving the same way we were were pullng over on the side of the street to take a good look of the lights, which were traveling in a southwest direction. We pulled over in a Restaurant&#39;s parking lot, and we noticed all the patrons at that restaurant were outside watching those lights, despite the cold temperature which mut have been on the teens. he lady standing next to me theorized that they were some kind of memorial lanterns lit up and launched from a nearby hospital and that were being carried by the wind. However it was interesting to see that the lights were shfting positions very slowly and it was interesting to see that at the end of the sighting one of the lights started traveling in the opposite direction as the other lights.<n>

About 2 then flew off and disappeared, then another 2 or so until there were only 2 left which then traveled directly S, at first close together and then more apart.  They were able to make pin point stops and continue.  We couldn&#39;t see them after they had traveled so far S. Then at about 22:30 they reappeared in the same spot in a diamond formation. I phoned a neighbor. A plane flew past and behind the formation.They disappeared as before but only 1 traveled S, stopped directly W, disappeared and I saw a white shooting star straight from sky to earth where the light was last.<n>

It hovered just above the tree line in Abita Springs for a few mins, I was in my friends car, the passenger seat and him driving. I spotted and he confirmed it was out of the ordinary. From what I can tell, being at night, it was a large, black triangle moving very slowly. There may have been three lights, not sure... was just in awe when I saw it and didn&#39;t pay notice to the details. We turned the radio off to see if we could hear anything, but we heard no sound coming from this craft. If it were a regular craft, even with the radio on we&#39;d still be able to hear it. As we drove on it disappeared behind the tree lines, whether it did or disappeared altogether I&#39;m not sure. My brother claims there is an airbase somewhere near because he always hears army helicopters in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband was getting ready to go to bed when he yelled at me to look at all of the airplanes flying by.  When I went in to look at the planes, facing the north, I glanced through the window that faces west.  There was an odd shaped bright light.  When it started bobbing around, I got my videw camera and started taking pictures.  It danced around, disappeared, came back, and came so close the first time that I got a stunning look at it.  It was round, except at the very bottom, it looked flat.  It had two lines through the middle, a round circle in the center of the paralell lines, and an emblem in the middle of the circle.  There were designs on the top and bottom parts.  I viewed this for about 5 seconds, then it gradually moved away and across the trees, then into a bright ball again, going further away.  It had a dark side and a bright side.  When it was bright, there would be a jagged streak of light moving upward, dimming the bottom part as it went.  After it dimmed, it would then get smaller.  It bobbed around, disaappeared and did all sorts of things for several minutes.  Then the dark side got very close and was very large.  It had the same markings on that side as the bright side.  There were red, yellow and orange lights that I could not figure out.  It came very close 3 times before it finally disappeared.  I have great movies of this.  What do I do with them.  I would love for someone to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness, and found her to be a good witness.

Through a telescope, two craft were seen, both shrouded in clouds - the only cloud in the entire sky. The objects were maintaining positions parallel to one another, but offset by about half their length. Joining the two appeared to be a tube-like construction, also wrapped in cloud, but not to the extent that the cylindrical shape wasn&#39;t obvious. Windows were clearly apparent at the end of one craft, which was poking out from behind it&#39;s cloud cover. The joined pair traversed the night sky in about one and a half hours, and when directly overhead, North Calgary lost its electricity. On a cloudless night, the small wisp of cloud covering the craft remained in position at all times.<n>

I was driving North on Route 15 between Selinsgrove and Wiliamsport and I saw a cigar shaped metallic craft in the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds, maybe 10 and then it went behind a hill to my left, when I passed the hill it was gone.  It had been a little to the left of center in my windshield, but directly in the middle vertically.  I looked for it after the hill but it was gone.  It was pretty low, not high in the atmosphere, or else the craft was extremely large. I drove on about 5 miles further up Route 15 and saw it again only this time observed it until it dissapeared in the sky.  It was cigar shaped again, vertically, and as I watched it; it changed into a more normal looking UFO and suddenly dissapeared.  This time it was about 30 seconds I watched it because it was directly in my line of vision.  It was metallic just as the previous one I&#39;d seen.  It was a clear day with a couple of wispy small clouds in the sky that were burning away pretty quickly as you watched.  I noticed the time and where I was but I don&#39;t know the name of the town I was passing through.  It was about 7-8 miles south of Williamsport when I saw the second one, or the same one but the second time I noticed it.  This craft had no contrails at all, nothing coming out of it and when I saw it the first time it was moving, but the second time while it was cigar shaped it was not moving at all until it changed shape.  Then it moved slowly and just dissapeared.  It was bright day out and the reason I noticed it was because the sun shined on it caught my attention.  It was clearly metallic in colour.<n>

I sat out for a few minutes, but decided to go in because of the cold MN temperatures.  On my way back into the house, i noticed a brightness coming from behind me.  I thought it may have been my neighbor&#39;s motion-activated floodlights, but when i turned around, the lights were off.  The neighbor to the east&#39;s horses were also riled up.  i coudl hear them running around and making noise.  When i brought my eyes to the sky, i saw two triangular shaped glowing objects.  there was definately light coming from them, but not from any specific source.  It was more as if the craft itself emitted the glow.  They zoomed southward across the sky, encircling each other, then zoomed  away further into the east.  They were not so much a color as they were a light.  But if there is any color they&#39;d be, i&#39;d say a silver, blueish color.  i can&#39;t say for sure how big they were, seeing as they were far away.  Definately bigger than any car or bus, though, i&#39;d say.  And maybe it was because i was so fixated on them, but for some reason, when i saw them, the cold air seemed to dissappear.<n>

This was in my view about 6 seconds. The second sighting happened within 8 seconds behind the sighting mentioned above and this was an armada of at least 50 to 100 lights moving in the same path from the East to the West at the same apparent speed of the first sighting. The lights were like looking at a well lit city from an airplane where all lights were of the same color and intensity. The formation was a wide angle V taking at least a 10 degree angle of arc, tip to tip. There were more lights in the apex of the formation and these tapered off at the tips. All objects were in a tight formation, travelling at the same speed. the lights of were of equal brightness. Ther were a few objects in front of this formation and a few behind the formation travelling at the same speed and direction. No noise, a silent passing. Sighting lasted 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is known to us, and we consider him to be quite credible.

There is, however a small town called<n> <n><n> Moravian Falls, and it is approximately 25 miles north of Hickory, where I<n> <n><n> live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anyone with your organization has followed up on the report.<n> <n><n> I tend to agree with your comment that if a UFO had crashed there, it is<n> <n><n> likely that there would have been other reports at that time.  However, since<n> <n><n> I do live near the area and had occasion to drive out to the site in question<n> <n><n> last Thursday (3/1/01), I made a point to look around to see if there was<n> <n><n> anything unusual.  (Granted, this was nearly 3 weeks after the sighting was<n> <n><n> reported.)  I did not see any signs of a crash at all.  In fact, the<n> <n><n> construction site mentioned in the report is about ten feet or less from a<n> <n><n> well-travelled highway, so I believe it would be difficult for something like<n> <n><n> that to go unnoticed in a town of that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

I assumed it was a planet as it is usually where we see what we believe to be venus (to the west) It was so bright though, I thought I would make a note of where it was in the sky, and see if it would move. For the first half hour or so, it remained stationary. After that however, I started to notice it slowly moving to another part of the sky. It was very suttle to someone who might just be looking up, but it was definitely moving. It didn&#39;t seem to be of conventional origin for the mear fact that it moved so slowly. I was watching it by myself until my wife came in the room. She usually poo-poo&#39;s the idea of UFO&#39;s but when she saw it and saw it was moving, it kind of spooked her. We had binoculars handy so we watched it and saw a better view of the object. It was very bright, and every so often would change to part red. Sometimes more red than white. Now we knew it wasn&#39;t venus- plus it had moved so far. It took a little over an hour for the object to finally disappear over the mountain. When I first viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared as a huge ball of light. I could not see any indication that it was a conventional craft. I am not an expert, and have only seen something peculiar one other time, but this one stumps both my wife and I. Please let me know if someone else saw this object or somehow this can be explained away. I am a believer, and for all I know, this thing has been sitting there before and I just didn&#39;t take the time to watch it. I would be very interested in knowing if others saw it.<n>

2/9/01 03:00|Wheaton|IL|Unknown|90 sec. ??|strange sound|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16410.html|156|ndxe200102| strange sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an author/editor, and live in Wheaton, Illinois, about 30 miles west of Chicago. Around 3 this morning. I awoke to a sound unlike any I have heard before in my life--the only way I can describe it is to say, if you can imagine a gigantic, hi-tech helicopter that was the size of a battleship, that might give some idea. There had been a storm earlier in the night, but this certainly was not thunder--it was a steady but pulsing drone that was so loud and extended (and very mechanical sounding, VERY unlike thunder in that respect) I felt as though it must have spanned over a distance of five or ten miles. The entire house was mildly rattling at one point. So the next morning, I wondered whether I had simply hallucinated the entire thing, and asked someone who lives about a mile away if they heard anything last night, anything odd or different from normal. They said, &#34;As a matter of fact, around 3 in the morning, it sounded as though a gigantic helicopter was hovering right over my house. It woke me up.&#34; I regret not looking outside the window when it happened--have no idea why. I even wondered this morning if it was an earthquake of some sort, as I&#39;ve heard there can be unusual sounds associated with those. By the way, I called the local police department last night and they heard nothing about this. I have seen military helicopters flying in formation over a nearby region (there are several airports around here), once during the night--but this really didn&#39;t sound quite like that (the &#34;thump-thump-thumps&#34; of your ordinary helicopter tend to be spaced closer together, stacatto-like) --plus, there was quite a fog around here most of the night, and I have a hard time imagining there were many flights in the air as a result--but I can&#39;t say for sure. If you happen to know of any sightings or other odd phenomena that were reported last night in the midwest, I sure would appreciate hearing about it/them. Thanks.<n>

I live near the Bibb/Jones county line on Hwy.49. I drove from Gray to my home,and at about 9pm Itook my telescope out set it to check out the light. Object was traveling directly from east to west. Viewing the object through my scope it looked round and very bright. It seemed to move around and roll back and forth. It looked like it had lines on about two thirds of the right side surface. On the left side was a port or a crater looking thing. One large and one small.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> White circular light seen in sky, splitting into four distinct white lights, dancing in a circle. and converging with a kiss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feb. 8th my son and I went outside to walk our dog at 8:15pm.  It was very cloudy and damp.  We both noticed a glowing light over our heads that would split into four distinct balls of light through the clouds, cirle counterclockwise and then converge back to a central ball of light.  This convergence was like a quick kiss and then the four individual balls of light would wisk out to the outer circumference and do a circle dance counterclockwise and repeat the movement to the the center kiss/convergence and out again in seperate forms of light.  Whatever this was-it must have been very high up because it truely seemed to follow us.  We stopped at several houses and collected several neighbors observations, as well. They saw the same thing, as well. I did report this to our Rochester Planetarium and was promised they would get back with some possible explainations. It was very unusual the way it seperated into the four soft wisky while light balls and did this circle dance with a kiss.  It appeared like watching angels or ghosts dancing in the sky.  The circle it made seemed to take up about a baseball fields circumference.<n>

It was about 1000-2000 feet high and moved southeast at a fast but steady pace. As it got closer it appeared to have Yellow and red flames coming out the back. I filmed the object with a 50x zoom video camcorder and zoomed all the way to the object and it was multi colored broken up into little cells. At a farther away view it seemed silvery metallic colored and was as if the moon was reflecting off of it.  The object blinked what seemed to be 3 red lights once and then it was gone.<n>

I looked up and saw a string of white lights with 3 bright ones with several dimmer ones in between.  There was a red light flashing away from the white lights.  The craft seemed stationary , however I could not make out the shape as I was driving.  I pulled up to a red traffic light about 15 to 20 seconds later and got out of the car and it was gone.  My daughter got a better look at it than I did and describes it as a triangular craft with the white lights along the back and the red light toward the front tip.  It made no noise.  We were less than 1/2 mile from the craft and it appeared to be only 300 to 500 feet high.  Judging from the spacing of the lights I saw I would say it was about 250 to 300 feet across the back.  It was pointed East by Northeast.  It was dark out and the craft was dark in color except for the lights.<n>

The time was 6:36 PM CST And the weather was mostly clear with a few thin clouds and a full moon. The fireball had a white head about the size of a dime held at arms length and a greenish tail 3 to 4 times the diameter of the head. It was moving from our right to left or south to north and at an angle of about 30 to 40 degrees toward the ground.We lost sight of the object when it went below the tree line. The object was visible for aproximately 4 seconds.<n>

Thats when I saw 4 lights on one side then 3 on the other.Saw the shape of it huge triangle shape as big as a football field.Then it put those lights on me like a flash from a camera (twice).I was like why is this craft so low on this windy night?Then in my thoughts I was like this is not making a sound.It was huge!! and very low to ground.It had me if it wanted me.So I wasnt scared at that point. So I tried to get closer,got in my truck to get a better look.Took my eye off of it for a couple of seconds and it was gone. Not a sound, beem of light, nothing. Ive lived her for over 30 years and I have never seen anything like this.Before or after. I wwent and got a girlfriend after that and to my disappointment it never come bac! k.People thing Im crazy but now I always have a camera.Started to call airport but didnt.Told many people but without witness and footage no one believes me. So just thought I would tell what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/8/01 06:30|Oakton|VA|Light|1 minute|small glowing object moving slowly among the trees|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16374.html|166|ndxe200102| small glowing object moving slowly among the trees<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 06:30, on the morning of 08 Feb 2001, I had an early meeting at work so I left about an hour earlier than I usually do.  It was still dark, and there was a very bright full moon.  As I was about a tenth of a mile from my apartment building on Bushman Street, Oakton, Virginia I looked at the moon which was bright and low on the horizon.  To the left and below of the moon I saw an amber colored light moving slowly from right to left, approximately over the A T &amp; T regional headquarters building compound.  At first I thought that it was an airplane taking off from Dulles Airport which is about twenty miles away in that direction but I realized that it was far too low on the horizon for it to be an airplane and it seemed to me that it was almost at tree top level.  I realized that it was quite near. I made a right turn on to Borge street and noticed that the object had turned towards my vehicle.  It blinked or pulsated once, and then held a steady amber color. It seemed to stop and hover over the edge of a small childrens playground.  At that time I had turned left onto Jermantown road and had to concentrate on my driving,though I was still looking towards my left where it was hovering about 200 feet away, at the height of a street lamp or so. I had to get gasoline and after that, about ten minutes later I again passed the spot where I had seen this object, and it was no longer there.  At first I thought that maybe I had seen a street lamp or something as it was earlier for me than usual but the object was no longer there on my second pass by the area, so that was not it. Nor could it have been the full moon as I had seen both at the same time. The object seemed to be a small glowing sphere or so, maybe the size of a basket ball though this is very difficult to ascertain.<n>

My friend suggested it might be a wing-light to a plane that was turning directions or something, but as he said that, the lights dimmed and began moving quickly in different directions. They were moving pretty fast and eventually they began following each other but at a distance, changing to much dimmer lights. They were not planes. I know that. The initial light I saw was as bright a light as i&#39;ve ever seen in the sky. Did anyone see that in the Boston area last night?

My mom yelled down the stairs &#34;Katie did u see that light out of your window&#34;.  I thought she meant something in the yard but she said look over the mountain in the sky.  So i llooked out my window downstairs which faces the mountain and i looked at it.  It was very bright. My mom thought it was a planet but after taking astronomy i am pretty sure with the visible eye a planet is not that bright or close to the earth.  So i took my mothers pretty strong binoculars, and looked through them.  The object was white colored and looked like many dots put together.  It was outlined in thin red.  It wasnt visibly moving yet it did look like it was a little more North then when we first saw it.  It got lower and lower as the half hr or so went on. Again we couldnt see it drop but it got lower. At 8:30 it finally dropped on the other side of the mountain and it was no longer visible to us here.  I tried to take pictures and draw some quick sketches but i realized as i kept observing it that it changed shape.  It was somewhat of a disc shaped a little deformed,, then it looked more like a cigar, then it looked round.  The shape looked like it was a formation of lights but it was definetly something i have never seen before.  My mom said maybe it was a sattelite but again it was pretty clear and visible to be a satelite.  My mom and I both believe in UFO&#39;s but i wasnt planning on &#34;looking&#34; or seeing any tonight.  For me to write a report about it means that i really do believe it was something.  It did not look like a planet, nor has the sky been very visible lately.  It was not a airplane,, but it is possible it could be a satellite im really not sure. It eventually dropped lower to the horizon and over the mountains so we were not able to see anymore,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect they may have been observing Venus, but that is just a guess.

It&#39;s speed was rather slow, like a conventional aircraft, however it moved in the form of an arc across the sky, then proceeded Eastbound.  The intensity of the light was still bright even when it was several miles away.  I could not make out a shape of the object, other than that remembled a round orb.  There was no sound from this object, either. End of Statement<n>

I did not get there in time to see it but my mom describes it as &#34;about the size and briliance of a light on a radio tower, but not strobing&#34;.  The object had apparently zoomed off into the distance before I got into the room.  My mom and I then sat at the front window looking for this thing, when I saw a small red dot rise above the trees, move a small bit to the left, and then zoom upwards on an angle at incredible speed.  I went outside to check to see if I could still see it, but by that time it was gone.  I came back upstairs and looked out the window again, where I could see a small pin prick of red light floating in the distance.  I am positive it wasn&#39;t a star becase it was moving side to side in an ovular motion. I then went back outside, but still couldn&#39;t see anything.  That was the last time I saw it.  My mom didn&#39;t see anything that I saw.<n>

Look at that! I said to myself. I pulled the car to the curb and got out for a better look. I saw four very brightly lit domed circular craft!  Each was illuminated totally in brillent white light. They were each four to five inches in size from where I stood.  The domed top was clear on all the craft. They were moving from south to north in a diamond formation. Each swayed back and forth and traded places, still maintaining the diamond formation as they collectively traveled forward to the north.  I watched them as they grew smaller, and smaller until they disappeared in the distance.<n>

When I noticed a black cylinder object hovering above the buildings (est. 200-300ft). I noticed there was no sound from the object that I could tell. I stopped to men at the corner of Bourbon St. and asked them if they where seeing the same thing. They looked up and saw the object and stated it must be a UFO here for the partying, at that time other stopped and noticed that we were looking up and they notice the object. The object was moving at a slow rate heading in the direction of the Mississippi river. I know that people think I was drinking but, I was not and I know what I saw was real and that others saw it too. If anyone else saw that object in the New Orleans area please report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  He had the presence of mind to call the object to the attention of other witnesses, and his description of the object was quite precise.  We do not know what it was he witnessed, but similar objects have been reported to NUFORC.  An object, apparently similar in appearance, was reported from Houston, TX, on the morning of 08SE00.  It was reported to have been seen hovering over the outer ring road at approximately 0615 hrs. (local) on that date.  PD))<n>

There were 2 objects in the sky at the time between 45 and 65 degrees off the horizon. One closer (the parachute) and the other was further away (what I thought was the plane). I thought that this guy was crazy because this was in the middle of Dallas and it was very high up. This was going to be on the evening news for sure. I ran inside and got my friend who came out and I showed him and what appeared to be a parachute. When I returned it changed into a circular silver/white object that didn&#39;t represent the first object that I had seen, but still remained in the same location. I was gone about 15 seconds. The two objects matched each other now in color, size and movement. I asked my friend what do you think it is.. He said &#34;a plane of course.&#34; We turned around and I showed him a plane in the sky that was moving at a high altitude 180 degrees from the location of the objects. No comparison. The two objects were moving very slowly together in a northerly direction. Their movements were very calm and not jittery. I asked my friend if he had some binoculars or a zoom camera. He brought out a Nikon 35mm with a non-zoom lens. I was able to capture pictures of the objects, but not as close as I wish. I captured several pictures of the two objects and as they continued to move slowly across the sky an identical 3rd object appeared. Within 4 minutes all 3 objects were no longer visible. The sighting lasted a total of 10 minutes. I was able to capture about 5 pictures. Pictures will be sent in this evening (I hope!).<n>

But since yesterday morning, I haven&#39;t been able to get it out of my head. The way it happened, all seemed to perfect, to be real. First, I was driving home while listening to 640AM which was educating us, the people, of this website. I get home and go straight online to look up this site, (I am always eager to educate myself; currently reading the book Chaos- Making a New Science and I also read philosophy.) While I&#39;m researching this site, my cordless phone gives off half a ring, mind you it&#39;s about 3:30am, and I was startled. Last year I had 3 strange incidents occur with both my home number and old cell number at about the same time. I even have witnesses for those incidents. (A sound like a baby&#39;s heart through an ultra sound.) So again, I was startled when my phone rang yesterday morning. I got off line quickly, and for some reason went to go look outside my kitchen window. That&#39;s when I saw the red and white lights coming forward, yet in sort of a side to side motion. I was thinking to myself, &#34;no way, this can&#39;t be happening.&#34; And continued to stare at the object to prove myself wrong of it&#39;s side to side motion. I went outside in my backyard and watched it fly over my house. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle because of the white lights at the front point of it and on each end of what would be it&#39;s wings. On the bottom, there were two red lights that seemed to be pulsating and made a quiet humming sound. I tried to analyze it as best as I could so I would then be able to confirm to myself, that it was only a plane. But I was unable because of a glare or something from the white lights. I have no idea whether it was a ufo or not, I only know that the nature of it, seemed unfamilar to me.<n>

One was about 300 yards from my vehicle and was triangular in shape with a dome top with a yellow light on in the dome.It was perfectly still at approximately 50 feet from the ground.  It did not have any engine noise, perfectly quite.  On the tips of the triangular end, was a red light on one side and a blue light on the other.  It appeared to be as large as a medium sized aircraft but not the shape of any aircraft that I have ever seen including the Stealth.  The lights began dimming and the craft began crossing the road and headed west silently and then flew away very fast.  I have seen these several nights while driving home from work.<n>

We spotted a plane to the south of it and noticed that it was going to be above this light, as soon as the plane was over it, it disappeared completely. We then noticed it but it was now in the south sky, how it got from being east at one moment and then to completely disappear and then show up without us seeing it move. We then watched it head towards the west a little more then it headed sort of northwest, it had several lights on it, a strobe, and a green light and a red, but it made no sound, and there were several plaanes in the area that did not match this thing at all. Also. about two weeks ago we saw a similar light more towards the southwest and it basically did the same thing except it never disappeared like it did last night.<n>

On the way I noticed an extremely bright light in the night sky.  It was west of the town and stood motionless in the sky.  I was much brighter than any star or planet.  In the magnitude of 100 times brighter.  The light also had six points...one top and bottom and two on each side.  The light was viewed for approximately 20 minutes.  I went into my house and looked for it again about 30 minutes later and it was gone.<n>

We were looking for an open drugstore and were in a strip mall parking lot when I happened to look up towards the sky.  I saw 5 or 6 pale grayish white lights in a row on an angle (imagine a backslash only dot it with lights) slowly moving across the sky from right to left.  I alerted my supervisor and he confirmed that he saw them also.  Both of us had been in the aviation industry for several years each and very familiar with different aircraft types and their lighting and did not recognize these lights to be anything we had seen before.  We watched them for a minute or two, we even rolled down the windows in the car and craned our necks to get a better view.  We noticed that the objects did not seem to make any sound.  We asked two local men walking in the parking lot if they know what they were and they responded that they did not.  We left shortly after speaking with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I am unfamiliar with the Scottsdale area and I am unsure as to the direction we were looking when we saw the lights I believe it was southeast, however, I may very well be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

2/5/01 18:40|Boise|ID|Diamond|5-10 minutes|A kite-shaped object with white lights in each corner was seen flying over central Boise and toward Meridian.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16434.html|195|ndxe200102| A kite-shaped object with white lights in each corner was seen flying over central Boise and toward Meridian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feb. 5 2001. Boise Idaho. When driving southeast on Chinden Blvd at approximately 6:40 PM I noticed a set of two very bright lights about  10-20 degrees above the horizon that at first appeared to be stationary. My first impression was that this was a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. After a minute or so I noticed the aircraft was not following the normal airport approach. (I live near the airport and have a good feel for the normal arrival and departure patterns as well as the appearance of various aircraft at night.) The aircraft proceeded in what appeared to be a straight line over Garden City directly toward west Boise. (Plotting the flight path on a map indicates that the object passed virtually directly over the state capitol building downtown.) As the object approached, a white strobe light between the two &#34;landing&#34; lights became visible. For a moment I got the impression that an aircraft was in trouble and considering Chinden as a possible landing strip. Then I got the impression that the object could possibly be a slow moving blimp or perhaps I was approaching a balloon over the fairgrounds. (I was searching for rational explanations that I dismissed one by one.) I was stopped at the intersection of Chinden and Kent Ln. (next to the fairgrounds) when the object passed overhead and to my left. I was able to roll down my car window and look up at the object. It consisted of four white lights (two bright ones on the &#34;wingtips&#34;, one strobe on the &#34;nose&#34; and a dim one on the &#34;tail&#34;). There were no conventional (red/green) aviation lights. There was no additional &#34;low flying jet&#34; noise above the normal traffic noise.  I caught a glimpse of the vehicle body as it passed in front of an upper level haze lit by moonlight and it appeared to be black and diamond shaped with four white lights at the tips. It was about 1 thumb width (at an arms length) from wingtip to wingtip. It also appeared to be leaving behind a vapor trial that was about the same width. It was difficult to estimate the altitude, and whether it wa! s ascend ing or descending.  Unfortunately, I could not observe the shape at length because the traffic light changed. At this point, the object clearly seemed peculiar, so I made a U-turn when I could and attempted to pursue it in the direction of its travel. The rear light was dim and the object was much more difficult to make out from the rear. I noted once again that the normal red and green navigation lights that would otherwise clearly mark a conventional aircraft from the rear were absent. The object seemed to move away and disappear much more rapidly than it approached (Probably because the brighter &#34;forward facing&#34; lights made it visible from farther away.) It disappeared over the rim of a ridge above Chinden. My total observation time was approximately 5-10 minutes. Two acquaintences of mine mentioned the next day that they also noticed some strange lights. One was traveling west on I-84 approximately 7-10 miles SW of my location. She reported that she saw strange lights moving west and south of the freeway, about 20 degrees above the horizon. The direction and time are consistent with my observations. I also monitored the sky at the same time on subsequent evenings to verify that this was not part of a routine daily jet flight. While preparing this report, I conducted a casual search of your database for similar sightings and found the following report with a description that matched what I saw: Occurred : 12/28/2000 18:00 (Entered as : 12/28/00 18:00) Reported : 1/5/2001 18:30 Posted : 1/28/2001 Location : Holyoke, MA Shape : Diamond &#34;… described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points…&#34; That describes exactly what I saw. I&#39;m a 44 year old electrical engineer who works for a well known high-tech company. I&#39;m not fully convinced I observed an unconventional vehicle, but I do know that I saw what appeared to be an uncommon shape with a definite lack of red/green aviation lights on a strange flight path. I&#39;m posting this in the event that it provides any additional useful information in combination with what others have seen.<n>
2/5/01 17:50|Riverside|CA|Oval|3-5|Oblong or ovoid luminous object,|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16257.html|196|ndxe200102| Oblong or ovoid luminous object,<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost 6 PM (about 5:50, I think). As I sat down at a bus stop I noticed a bright oblong or oval-type shape toward the west. It was perhaps about 1/3 the apparent size of the full moon, and I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was. It was low on the horizon--that is, just above trees, buildings, etc. It was bright enough and big enough to be very noticable, and yet its luminosity was kind of dullish--that is, it didn&#39;t &#34;shine&#34;--it had a kind of uniform brightness and tone. It had a bluish white color--very much like the moon. Now, it could have been an ordinary object for all I know--but I noticed it immediately, and couldn&#39;t identify it, even though I am (I think) pretty familiar with the sky, astronomical objects, aircraft, etc. I thought it might have been a blimp--maybe it was, but it didn&#39;t really seem like one. It was elongated vertically rather than horizontally, though that might be due to perspective. I watched it move with reference to various objects on the horizon: it hovered, and moved slowly a few angular degrees both horizontally and vertically. After I watched it for a few minutes, the light went out, but I could still see the silhouette of the the object against the twilight sky (the object was darker than the surrounding sky). As I recall, the dark silhouette that remained after the light went out was rectangular, not ovoid. It was in plain view of the city--I am reporting it simply because it was interesting and unfamiliar to me, although it might have just a mundane explanation!<n>

I ran home as quick as i could and grabbed my Digital Camera to get a picture. When i ran back outside, I noticed that about 30 more lights appeared in the sky.Looking at the objects,I was so stunned.In fact i almost forgot to take a picture of the flying objects.Now the werent lights,they were shiny objects in response to the sun.About i would say 25+ of the objects suddenly moved into a formation seen in the picture i took,that you should get along with my report.As you can see,the formation is a spiral of some sort. with very unique dots to the left of it.I think those dots mean something, Maybe mathematical or something else?<n>

I slowed down and it stayed there even as I passed it.  Then I saw anther closer to the airport in the distance and thought maybe they were planes but neither was moving.  I thought maybe they were helicopters hovering but they usually have blinking lights and make a little noise but I didnt hear anything.<n>

I was looking up at the sky when the object appeared.  The object entered the sky at approximately 70 degrees above the visible horizon and appeared to be heading straight down toward the ground.  It began looking like a falling star.  One to two seconds after appearing, it began to break apart into an orange fireball, with pieces trailing behind it.  The color then changed to a bright green.  It looked like it made it relatively close to the ground, because the clouds were illuminated, which made that entire portion of the sky flash green for a moment.  It looked like it made it to the top of the layer of clouds.  The clouds to the north of my location (where the object was seen) were broken at about 40,000 feet.  Skies over my head were clear at the time.  I heard no sound from the object.  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds.<n>

The object myself and passenger witnessed was EXTREMELY bizarre and unlike anything either of us have ever seen both in person or on a UFO tv documentary. Was a very bright white light in the sky that both moved about slowly in the sky 2 - 5,000 feet up and also hovered absolutely motionless above us for minutes at a time.  The object also displayed very peculiar behaivior as described:  Completely dissappeared for approx. 2 seconds at a time on 3 separate occassions (or at least turned off all lights), eminated Red &#39;spikes&#39; or short lasers of light which were very defined and not diffused light.  These were arbitrarily &#39;turned off and on&#39; at different points of the sighting.  These spikes appeared to be in somewhat of an X form around the object and defintely moved or spun about the object.  Additionally, a white spike or laser type light  that appeared to acutally be 2 parallel lights projected out from the object in a downward direction.  These extended about 5 times the size of the object but did not go any further and also would be arbitrarily turned off and back on at different points. We witnessed the object about 10-20 miles south of Baker, CA and pulled off the side of the road to observe it for about 15min. as it hovered motionless in movement, but displayed the active lighting characteristics of the &#39;spike lasers&#39; as it hovered.  Estimated distance from us was maybe 10 miles or so.  The object had no regularly flashing beacon lights as a domestic craft almost always does and it was much brighter than any aircraft i have ever witnessed at night or brighter than any star or other objects in the sky.  Visibility was clear with a full sky of stars.  Partial moon i believe was out because we could see the horizon of the small mountains in the surrounding area. Please reply to let me know of any similar reports or findings on this date. Thank you. Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

We were coming up on a stop sign, when out of the eastern sky came this huge fireball, it seemed to have come from nowhere, it fell to the ground in a wooded area.  As we passed by where it would have fell to, there was no lights or explosion, so we thought it could not have been a plane crash landing.  No one in the area has reported, to my knowledge, any thing strange that night. Less than a month ago, the same thing happened on a busy highway and hundreds of people reported that, only to have local news stations say it was a weather thing.<n>

EVENTUALLY, IT FADED FROM THE SKY AFTER 20 SECONDS. MY FRIEND SAID IT WAS NOT GEESE, BECAUSE WE HEARD NO HONKING. IT MAINTAINED A PERFECT BOOMERANG SHAPE EVEN WHEN IT INVERTED AND CHANGED ITS DIRECTION.  WE HEARD NO SOUND AT ALL.  IT IS HARD FOR ME TO ESTIMATE HOW FAR AWAY AND HOW BIG THE OBJECT WAS.

It seemed to move in small circles, and back and forth, and up and down. I saw at times a flashing red light coming from behind the light.  The  light would also go green, red, yellow  and just a bright clear light.  It stayed in the same spot for approxametlly an hour. In the mean time, I called 3 neighbors to see if they saw it and they did, some even made a call so there were 9 households who saw this.  At around 9:00p.m.it seemed to disapear and reapear it would get dimmer and then brighter and at these times the red seemed more dominate than the clear light, then it finally went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems to us reminiscent of a celestial body, a star or planet.

The object was less than a mile from me, about 1,500 feet above ground level and 100-150 feet in diameter.  It did not change speed or altitude.  There was NO sound, lights, trail, aura or vibrations.

At the same time it was swaying from side to side. I ran into the house to get some binoculars and when I came back outside it was gone.

A starlike object, i.e. a point of light, was moving faster than an jet but in a smooth trajectory, from the 7 o&#39;clock position a few degrees away from the moon and headed up past the moon on the upper left side of it.  This is when I swiftly ran back into the house to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I came back out and it took me a few seconds to find the object, which was now heading more in a downward fashion and was between 5 and 10 degrees to the lower right of the moon, at about 4 o&#39;clock.  Unfortunately, I could not locate it in the binoculars so it was quickly gone.  It appeared to be reflecting light rather than self-luminous.<n>

We thought at first it was an aircraft from the local airport (approx. 5 miles away).  But, because of the tremendous acceleration of the objects, we knew that it could not be an airplane.  As the objects passed almost directly above us, we heard no sound at all, even though they were travelling at a high rate of speed.  As they sped away, they seemed to change direction very abruptly.  The weather was overcast, so we could not maintain visual contact for very long.<n>

The light was flashing as if off and on and it moved so slow that it couldn&#39;t be an air plane.   And then I observed in the north an air plane and the speed was faster that the object in the sky.   It kept a steady even motion as it went across the sky and when it was in the west part of the sky it just vanished.  It was if someone turned off the light.   The thing that struck me was that it would move and at times seem to stop and stand still then move on.<n>

Up ahead  in the sky was this big light.  I knew it wasn&#39;t  a star or a plane.  It was low in the sky and bright.  It looked red in the middle and white on the outside.  I slowed down and pulled over.  It scared me because I didn&#39;t know what it was so I turned around and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of a celestial body.  We are not certain, however.  PD))<n>

At first we thought it was an approaching aircraft with unusually bright oddly colored landing lights on.  It was bright white with  shots of blue and red or yellowish red coming off it, sort of like a diamond reflecting sunlight.  We thought then maybe some sort of satelite reflecting the sun which had set an hour or so earlier.  However it moved to the south continuing to flicker the different lights until lost behind the mountains.  It was much brighter than a plane for the distance it was.  A close plane with its landing lights coming into our local airport would be about the right brightness, but when it moved away it was obvious that it was several thousand feet if not several miles away.  No sound was heard, a private plane was circling between us and it and we assumed they were watching it as well.  Another couple in the parking lot with us watched it for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witnesses may have been observing the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; also known as the &#34;Dog Star.&#34;  It is very bright, in the southeast sky at the time and date indicated, and it &#34;twinkles&#34; quite prominently, giving off principally blue and red flashes of light.

It was early evening but still quite dark.  The moon was visible and next to it venus (I presume).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the moon I noticed what appeared to be 3 small stars (very dim and white in color).  On closer observation I noticed an outline of a dark spherical craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and very high in the sky but was clearly outlined. the little lites changed briefly from 3 to 5 and then back the lights were on the bottom of the craft.  The craft was motionless and seemed to just hang there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing must have been huge!  There was no sound or any motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the craft out to my friend and she glanced up and said that she thought that i was seeing stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to my moms house and I pointed it out to my mother who was able to see the crafts outline as well.  It had remained in place for the entire 20-30 minutes that I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night and for the last week I have been looking for it and haven&#39;t seen it or any small grouping of stars that should have been present if that was all I was seeing.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else has had a simular sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected that a UFO would be bright and saucer shaped not spherical and dark.  I had the feeling that it didn&#39;t wish to be observed and that it was observing something --- there is a great deal of military stuff in the springs like NORAD and the SDI-testbed and the consolidated space operations center etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.

After inspecting the house we walked the fenceline around the acreage and inspected the fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stopping for a short rest we continued on and back towards the house.  By that time it was dark and once we returned to the house we signed papers with the landlord and he went on home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in the city at this time we decided to stay for a bit to look at the stars and the milky way.  It was getting cold so we were preparing to leave.  I got into the car to warm it up and my wife came around and waited for me to unlock her door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before she climbed in she looked up towards the sky again to take in the view and she called my name.  I told her to hurry up and get in the car I was cold she asked if that was the ISS...  I got out and looked for the light crossing the sky and she pointed me towards the southeast horizon.  I thought to myself wow, finally I get to see it.  I caught the light in my vision and watched its ascent overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the point of light ran across the sky we had to turn and look back the other direction, towards the northwest.  As it streaked towards the northwest it stopped just above that horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally we believed we had just lost the object to our vision and we were now staring at a star or something we decided to head back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife climbed back into the car, and I adjusted my Ham radio antenna from 40 to 75 meters.  I turned back one more time and looked.  To my suprise that &#39;star&#39; was moving back in the other direction.  Back towards the South-South East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my wife to come take a look.  I didn&#39;t think the space station could manuever that way.  The light or object stopped at 30 degrees from our position in the sky.  We sat and watched it for about 5 more minutes and the light disappeared.  We climbed back in the car and talked about it abit.  We thought about what it might be, maybe an airplane or helicopter but it was too far out and moved too fast to be either of those.  And I know of no helicopter that can travel at that altitude or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that appeared odd to me was the fact that it turned back and came about a third distance back across the sky and stopped.  No space station or satellite I know of can do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to submit this in case someone else had seen the same thing, and maybe get to ask some questions or see if any radar had captured this.<n>
2/1/01 20:00|Bowling Green|KY|Fireball|5-10 minutes|Fireball Light Seen|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18608.html|229|ndxe200102| Fireball Light Seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read your report about a fireball being seen in and near Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Well, I too have seen this object many times traveling on the Nashville Road going to or from Franklin, Kentucky.  This object(s) does not appear every night-just at various times.  I cannot explain what we (my friends and I, and others) are seeing, but it IS real.  Most of the time the object(s) seem to be to my left as I am driving toward Franklin, Kentucky.  The object glows really bright with a red light sometimes appearing at the bottom or center of it.  Then, all of a sudden the light will go out.  At times the light wil zig-zag for a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night as I was going home from Church, I looked up and there it was, glowing like fire on a very dark night.  The object then began to move at a very slow pace and was getting nearer to my automobile.  I was a little concerned to say the least.  Then I looked underneath this object and saw 2 more smaller lights flying faster underneath it.  They were very visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached Bowling Green, the fireball light was still there.  As I got closer to the light the object seemed to take on a triangular appearance.  I cannot be sure because the trees were obscuring my view, but it appeared that something was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must mention that one time previously at my friend&#39;s house we saw the object, and we took out his binoculars to take a look at it.  The object looked rectangular or diamond shaped, and had a purple glow to it.  There could be a reasonable explaination for this-but I don&#39;t know what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, on various nights this glowing fireball can be seen clearly, and it seems to big to be a glowing star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He provided a really good drawing of what he observed with a &#34;halo&#34; around the object.  Incredibally, this object is very similar to the object I reported seeing on your web site from Bowling Green, Kentucky, back on July 24, 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shockingly, the drawing is what took me back to remember that strange night.  Yes, this object he saw is very much like the object we saw that dark night through a pair of binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our object too had a &#34;halo&#34; around it, and it was somewhat diamond/kite shaped.  This object we saw had a purple color to it, and it also glowed really bright in the sky.  It did appear as a really bright fireball until we used the binoculars to get a closer look.  All three of us witnesses saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What these things are I don&#39;t know.  But I do know that they are REAL, and still being observed in the skies of Warren/Simpson Counties here in Kentucky even today.  Friends of mine have seen them.  They look like large fireballs which move around at times.  Smaller bright objects also have been observed flying close to these larger fireball ones too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story is no lie.  It is the truth, and I propose that the Seattle man is telling us the truth about his sighting too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You!

IT was about 5:45am. We look out over lake Washington and hanging in the air are 3 bright lights in a triangle. They just hovered there, not moving for about 5 minutes or so. Then the lower left one started to move off towards Tukwilla, couple minutes later the top one moved off and then finally the third one moved off, all pretty slow and very smooth, not like hellicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
