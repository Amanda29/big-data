I was motivated to write this by the recent Stephenville, Texas sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a teenager in the summer of 1956, three  friends and I, were traveling by car from Thibodaux, LA. to Houma, LA., after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the entire night sky lit up for a few minutes, bright as day, and disappeared in the night sky toward Houma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us were in awe of what we experienced and we speculated at length what it could be.   We speculated that it might be a crashing plane, but the light was too bright and was traveling too fast; that it was a meteor crashing into the swamp; or that it was an alien space craft shooting across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Dad had gotten to the end of the field some time before I did and he was stopping at the end talking to a neighbor over the fence by the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both saw these two lights on the southern horizon at a far distance that followed each other closely across from east to west at a good rate of speed---faster than any airplanes they had ever seen at the time.  The light seemed to remain consistent till they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no explanation except they being a UFO type sighting.  Was a clear evening with the stars coming out already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1958 is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/58 20:00|Fort Worth|TX|Disk|4 minutes|In 1958 witness 3 flying saucers from a distance of only 20 feet.|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80534.html|3|ndxe195806| In 1958 witness 3 flying saucers from a distance of only 20 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened during the summer in 1958 in Ft. Worth, TX.  I can’t remember the exact date since this happen almost 53 years ago, but I will never forget the moment I saw a UFO up close and in such explicit detail.  The colors and the moving parts of the spacecrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in the only two-story house on my block when I was 8 years old.  My double bedroom window faced the East. I always had to go to bed at 8 PM.  As I was climbing the stairs I began to hear a faint humming sound.  As I arrived at the top of the stairs and turned left to my open bedroom door, I walked across my room to my opened windows, as the humming became easier to hear.  As I looked out my window, hovering over my neighbor’s house were three small flying saucers hovering.  They were not just hovering in a stable state, but were tiltering slightly as they were in their suspended state.  They were around 5 feet in diameter in a formation of a triangle, one in front and the other two behind the first.  They were roughly 5 feet below my window seal and no more then 20 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the 50’s we didn’t have shows that were about UFO’s much less thought about them at my age.  I froze in disbelieve.  For at least a minute I watch and listened.  All three were identical. First being saucer shape with a 2-foot diameter dome no more then a foot high, the outer skin was like frosted glass, barley transparent with a soft light within.  Around the edge was a 6-inch blue ring resembling dominos side by side.  In the middle of the dome was a pendulum that went counter clock wise around and around.  It was easy to see passing under the frosted glass shell and the blue ring, which encircled the outer edge of the top of the spacecraft..  As the pendulum past under the blue ring of adjoining blocks, each block darkened as I watch it pass going slowly counter-clockwise around and around.  All the time making the humming noise as it revolved.   saw no movement of life inside except the moving part of the pendulum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to prove to myself that this was real.  I turned around with my back to them, but still heard the humming sounds they were making.  I turned back facing them and watch in amusement for at least another minute.  I again turned my back to them.  As soon as I did, a few seconds past and the humming sound stopped. I turn back towards my window and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t expect anyone to believe me.  My parents just laughed just as anyone else would have who has never witness such an unbelievable sight.  I even don’t expect whoever reads this to believe my story.  I never told a soul till a few years back to my wife of 22 years.  As I told her, I am probably just a few people on earth who ever saw a UFO up close, much less three.  Most sightings I read about are lights in the sky, not something as clear as looking at your TV set across the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not mind being tested under hypnosis or any other test to make believers of what I witness when I was eight years old, but I doubt if even that would ever happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of my sighting I have no doubt what so ever that there are others in our universe.  As I became older I figured the small spacecrafts were more of a surveillance craft sending images back to the Mother ship.  Not occupied by small aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1958 is approximate.  PD))<n>

He and his mother were looking at the ocean, when they both suddenly witnessed a large, silver, disc-shaped object suddenly appear in the eastern sky, and fly very fast from east to west at a shallow angle of descent.  It then struck the water in Penobscot Bay, disappearing from their sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness reports that his mother told him to never talk about the event.

She was a hairdresser and worked downtown; my father had died in 1955.  It was Sat. and I called mom to see when she&#39;d be home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I did, I looked out the screen door.  Being summer, the trees were full.  Out the edge of some trees, I saw something that did not belong.  I just hung up with no answer and slowly walked outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle had a lake in that direction and this object was just coming out of the pines.  I walked into the dirt road keeping my attention to the sky.  In about a minute, I could see the object completelt.  It was going slowly with no sound at all.  I could estimate the size from the trees it was above.  It was long (about 200 to 300 ft.) and was a sideways teardrop shape, bigger at one end.  It was definitely not a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in awe as it made transit.  The color was a dim orange and still no sound.  This is the first and only time I have related this to an organization.  Sorry it took so long to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1958 is approximate.  PD))<n>

Lets all go outside and see what it is.” We all ran out the front door, and that is when things got screwy; my Dad and Mom as well as my brother Bob were watching the house, like they were in a trance, however my dog Boe and myself were not affected, and I was able to see a four story cylindrical craft over our house that had lots of  colored lights, blue, yellow, red, green, and violet lights that moved back and forth. Being free of whatever had my parents and brother standing there, my dog Boe and I walked to the south side of the house, at which point I noticed a porch like thing slide out of the bottom side, with a solid four foot railing. A hatch opened up moments later, and a Man with yellow wavy hair and gray eyes came out and told me “Do not to be afraid.” I then looked at my dog Boe for a reaction that maybe I should be afraid, however Boe was as calm as could be, so I replied “I am not afraid.” He then told me many things  Eph. 2V2 Satan is the Prince of Power of the Air (Atmosphere), (spell) 1st Heaven Surrounds the Earth 2nd Heaven Night Sky (Universe)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3rd Heaven God&#39;s Throne  	Satan is a Supernatural being angel or demon if you will he is also a Rebel. We live in God&#39;s law of Nature, Satan however makes his own laws. No Enertia, “gravity”, “Friction”, “Pressure”, etc. His UFO&#39;s can go any speed they want,  and turn 90 degrees at that same speed if needed, they also can shrink or enlarge as needed, and has invisibility. They carry no Mechs on board to control their craft, they are all Supernaturals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bible says to test the spirit for you know not if it be Angelic or Demonic.

No sound or other disturbance.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04381.html|10|ndxe195806| Observed disk while driving. We stopped, got out and stood watching disk as it stopped directly over us. No sound or other disturbance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, mother and father  were west bound on Hammerly road when my father started looking at something in the sky. He stopped the car and got out and saw a saucer shaped object to the northwest of us. It was dark while a red light was on located on the bottom in the center. When the red light went out there was a glow coming from a circular area out from the center. This glow was greenish-blue in color. We stood next to the car for about 2-3 minutes watching the object as it was stationary directly above us. It did not wobble, there was no sound or distubance to indicate a propulsion. It then moved to the east following hammerly Road. It went over a Parking lot at Wirt rd. and Long Point Rd. where there was a carnival being held on the parking lot. It stopped over the carnival as if it was watching. We could see the lights reflecting off the bottom. It then started moving east bound following Long Point rd. We got back in the car and went home, which was about 3 miles north- west from that location. We were able to keep it in view the entire distance. We called my uncle that lived about 10 mins away and he came to our house where he and my father tried to observe the object through an eight inch telescope. They only said it looked like it had some type of windows. We last saw it following Hempstead highway to the north west After this night we rarely discused the sighting between ourselves and never with anyone else. The object was the classic saucer shape and would be about the size of a 24 inch plate held at arms length while it was above us. While it was above us and when we saw it over the carnival it appeared to be about 300 feet up. I only realized several years ago that the red light on the bottom was like a lazer light in the scanners used in stores. There could have been missing time. My father, mother, and uncle have since died of cancer. My mother had a rare form of eye cancer. This was not a balloon, helicopter, ect. or any other type of craft we would have had at that time let alone now.<n>

We felt that whatever it was there in Pescadero must have been the same curious thing we had seen on the east side of the Skyline - just before whatever the boys saw there in Pescadero.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

But the memory stayed with me all these years.In 1997 living in Los Angeles I went home to visit my mom who is still living and 78yrs young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conversation started out one day as Mom I know Im not dreaming this but do you remember...before I could finish she said I know what youre going to say and yes you did see it. So, I went on to describe what I remembered seeing which was a silver cigar shaped object flying above this old school building in the background. She said talk to your aunt she remembers it too.At that time I didnt have the opportunity to do so.  But in March of 2002 I was visiting my mother again after her stroke.And at that time my aunt was there too. So we talked about it and she verified the same thing my mom had said yes we did see it. The lights around it and everything.  It scared everyone so bad it wasnt talked about except between the two of them.It wasnt discussed even with my uncle nor my father.  They checked the papers to see if anyone had reported it because this happened in broad daylight. They listened to the radio but nothing reported.At that time they didnt want to appear &#34;nuts&#34; so they just kept it to themselves.  They felt that being it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and since we saw it others had to have seen it.At that point my mother said no one said a word the adults had been sitting on my aunts front porch and we kids were playing on the sidewalk running in and out of the gate.They just gathered up  and we got in the car and were taken home. Now, thats where our memories differ. I remembered everything they described.  But I also remember more. What I can add to the memory is that the object came down and hit hovered above the ground in the field next to the school.  It had to bemaybe 4-5 feet above the ground. Given the fact that I was just a child and not tall. I remember looking at the star ship and the lights around it was pulsating around the middle of it like a neon light goes around in a circle. The windows were rectangular panels but their were no seams. It all looked like one piece.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it wasnt a shiny metal craft but it was a silver color.  For whatever reason I wasnt afraid.  Next, I remember being on the sidewalk across the street from it and in one of the rectangular panels was a little being about my size.This little person was in proportion in size. He appeared to have large eyes and tho his dress was like part of him it was as if we communicated through telepathy and he was saying goodbye and he raised his hand as if to wave at me.  This is the even more strange part...Nothing was moving but me and as I ran back to the gate opening at my aunts house all of a sudden motion started, I felt a slight jolt as things started moving again.  Everyone was jumping up gathering us up and getting home in a hurry without saying a word as to what had just happened. I had buried it in my mind til my own son had turned about the same age I was at the time and began to show me he had some special &#34;gifts&#34; from God. It triggered that memory in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on the left with my boyfriend next to me and my girlfriend on the far right.  As I was facing and talking to my girlfriend, a light caught my attention.  It looked like Venus would look - the size and brightness - but in the daytime - and moving - parallel to the street I was on; not too fast/not too slow, until it was almost directly overhead.  Then it stopped.  It stayed there for about 3-4 seconds, then in a flash, it made a right angle turn and sped away.  Obviously, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

England.UK  Saucer. 5mins    Moved from one side of wilndow view (house side) to opposite side. 04/30/09<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1958 living in hostel (nineteen year old males) sharing a bedroom with one other male. Early in  the summer morning (it seemed quite light outside but not really dawnlight). I was awoken by my room mate (the room was small and narrow, he slept at one end and I at the other, we were on the first floor up, the hostel being on the outskirts of a small village, our room had a large, long window which looked out above a small conservatory, flat roof, and over the large lawn, then into the middle distance of field and hill, then skyline. My room mate called me from sleep, saying, what&#39;s that out there, I eventually got up and went to the window (his view from his bed was to the left of where I stood, so I looked in that direction I did not see anything but I instinctively looked up to my right and there, above a leafy chestnut tree (it seemed just a few feet above, against the clear sky)was this saucer shape object (in the 1950s I, we, did not know anything about &#39;flying saucers&#39; or &#39;ufos&#39;, and indeed I had completely forgotten about the incident when wakenig up in the morning proper.)The size of the saucer was, or seemed, about four foot in diameter and about three foot in height. It was completely silent, I did not know what it was, it had, on the raised &#39;bulb&#39; shape on top, (or I&#39;m not sure now, whether it was lower down on the main body) a horizontal row of oval-like windows (frosted as I coud not see into them)I looked really hard into the windows and at that moment it just shot away, totally silent, no lights and in a blinking of an eyelid it had gone (oddly, I puzzled over at the time concerning the distance and speed which it became so small, to a pin prick of white light, then gone into the middle distance yet against the background of the hill, so it did not seem to go high and away in the sky but more of a trajectory curve - that&#39;s my adult word knowledge.)Years later I thought that my peering into the windows was an energy interference and so it made off. The saucer had a short s! tream of red behind it which seemed to be a connected to it, till the saucer had pinpricked into a tiny white light.I wondered why it, seemingly, had moved from left to right outside the window (only about eighty feet up in the air, and our window was say twenty feet up and I wondered and felt sad that if I had not of eagerly peered into its windows whther it would have stayed longer). Apart from another friend coming up to me the next day, saying that my room mate had seen this object in the sky, I had completely forgotten about it and then, I had never had it in mind until twenty five years later when my young son was all into ufos (1980s) that the memory suddenly shot into my mind, fresh again and since then it has been in and out of my thoughts. This place was in a Hertfordshire village, Waterford, in England, United Kingdom.(Incidentally,and a big coincidence, in early 2002 I went to visit a friend up in the north of England, Newcastle, and he introduced me to a female friend of his and as she and I chatted we discovered that in the 1950s she had lived in the same, Waterford,village and at the same time. I told her of my saucer sighting, surpringly she and her family had, often, seen &#39;lights&#39; over the common land of the village. I have wondered why would the saucer and the lights visited this small village in the countryside. (Sorry for going on, but this is the first time I have relayed these experiences to any &#39;official&#39; body, such as yourselves).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was on a trip from Alabama to Florida with my parents sometime between 1954 and 1960, yea I know lots of years to consider.  This is the whole point I can&#39;t remember all the details, time, how long object was sighted for, etc.  Anyway, I keep asking my Father to stop the car because I had to go to the bathroom (not many service stations stayed open all night back then, also the interstate was not yet constructed. We were on Hyw 231 some where between ALabama and Florida, I believe it must have been near Florala, Alabama.  Here is what I remember. My Father pulled off the hiway onto the shoulder of the road, stopped the car got out, opened the back door for me to get out, and he and I walked to the rear of the car. I am not sure of what time it was but it must have been very late, we did not see any other traffic. I do remember it was very dark, kind of warm weather. I was about to do my thing, when I looked over my right shoulder and saw an object with red lights around the bottom of it, it appeared to be a disk (circle) shape with me looking up at it from an angle. The object was at tree top level, no sound, I asked my Father, &#34; What is that?&#34;. I don&#39;t remember him saying anything, but I watched the object cross over the road behind us and get to the trees on the other side. This is all I remember. Both sides of the road had trees about 30 feet tall. I believe my Father and I were as close as 50 feet to the object. My parents never talked about the sighting, perhaps it never happened, then again maybe more than this occured that night somewhere between Alabama and Florida on that lonely streach of hiway. If you have any information please forward it to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards, ((initials of witness deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I guess around 1950 &gt;to 1960, my grandmother lived in Mountain View, Missouri. She said &gt;they would go out at night and sit on the patio. They would look out &gt;above the outhouse and watch these strange lights. she said they had &gt;two lights side by side, with a third light like a tail (her &gt;description reminded me of a manta ray). She said that around a &gt;certain time of night, they would see one &#34;zip&#34; over and stop high &gt;above the outhouse. Soon after, another one would come &#34;zooming&#34; up &gt;next to it. The two UFO&#39;s would sit there for a few seconds next to &gt;each other. Then all of a sudden, one would shoot off one way, then &gt;the other would shoot off the other way. After a few minutes, one &gt;would &#34;zip&#34; back to the same place then the other one would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;She said it looked like they would sit there and talk, then &#34;zoom&#34; &gt;off, then come back and start over again.This occurred weekly, if &gt;not nightly . I&#39;ve always wondered if anyone else had heard about &gt;this in Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was out in my front yard and just looking around and at the area where the rock breaking machiner was, and I saw a long, cigar shaped craft not far off the ground and it was huge.  I rather remember it being brownish-red in color.  I never mentioned it to anyone, after all I was eleven and who would believe a child and even adults are not often believed.  I have never spoken about it, let alone written about it.  Reading reports and making note that there are cigar shaped crafts made me decide to make mention of the fact that I had, in fact, seen one.  This was quite a long time ago and, since I was a child, I cannot readily remember how long it was there.  I do remember, however, that it was hovering, standing still in the air and that it was huge.  I think I saw what appeared to be windows as well and they appeared down the length of the craft.  Since it has been over forty years ago and I was rather young, that is about all I can recall of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure it was not a dirigible or blimp or baloon.  It was very low in the horizon as I remember and it was more longish rather than roundish as a blimp tends to be, although I have seen blimps with lights that could have fooled one into believing that they something else until seen clearly.  It was quite a long time ago and I have always remembered it as I have always been one to read books on UFO, science fiction, mythology, theology, etc.  I am a bit higher than normal in intelligence and I don&#39;t imagine seeing things so far.  I am not great in remembering names, but extremely good at remember faces and events, some events are almost cellular and/or visceral in their recall; remembering conversations, emotions, scenes of events, textures, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I recall was a longish, cigar shaped (which really threw me because all the movies about UFOs showed disk shaped objects - War of the Worlds) object suspended not too far off the ground, at horizon level, it was rather flat there, unlike where I live now (not too far from the Hollywood Hills).  It appeared to be a brownish red color and really long.  I didn&#39;t stick around too long and, more than likely, went inside.  Uncommon events tend to make one unsure of the true nature of things and since I was only about 11 years of age, I had nothing to relate what I saw to.  I tucked it away in my memory banks and there it has stayed until I started reading some of the sightings listed on your site.  I never realized others have seen flying cigars also.  Cigar, in my mind, is the best way to describe what I saw then.  Rather bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I am now 53 years old, I know what I saw as a child infact I reported this to the Sydney papers and for my trouble about two weeks later received a cheque in the mail for 1 Pound which in those days was a lot of money.I was also told at the time that other people had phoned in to report this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now know that the distance from earth to the stars and starting from the bottom Alpha Crux 321 light years Beta Crux 353 Light years Gamma Crux 88 light years Delta Crux 364 light years Epsilon Crux 228 light years  I would not blame you for sending this straight to the wast bin as I have in the past told people about this and been laughed at, and even today with age and logic even I can&#39;t comprehend the speed that this object must have been travailing at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time taken for this event was around 45 minutes Kind   Regards ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the very interesting report.  We will post it  sometime in the near future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to point out that just because the object appeared to be  traveling between the stars you cite, I don&#39;t think we can conclude that it was actually outside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  I readily admit that it would be unusual for an object in the atmosphere, or in proximity of our planet to coincide exactly with those stars, but I find it difficult to believe that the object was actually traveling between the stars you cite, and that it was also visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,  Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I fully understand your reasoning, at the time that I saw this light there had been 1,2 or 3, I think man made objects put into space I had seen these.This was not like that, the light was as bright as a star and as I said no bigger than the point of a pin. With age and knowing the distance of these stars from earth even I find it hard to believe.However I know what I saw, in the finish I was laying on my back watching this display.

It was just a couple of hundred feet in the air, it was hugh, silver and made no noise and it stood perfectly still.  We all looked out the window at it in awe.  The saucer then flew pass our house two blocks over.  We ran to the back of house and looking out the window we could see it hovering over a busy intersection.  I expected to read about it in the paper and hear about it in the news, but nothing was said.  Anyway, while it was two blocks away, I grabbed a flashlight and started waving it toward the saucer.  I wanted to go outside but then I hesitated.  The saucer came back over our house to its original position and just stayed suspended in the air, not making any noise.  I then started counting the tiny lights that were underneath the craft all around the bottom of it in one big circle; I counted about 18 lights and then it suddenly took off in an upward direction, it was so fast that it looked light it disappeared.  The craft looked like it could have held 100 people in it; it was huge.  My brother and sister recall that night in wonder and amazement.  I felt that something may have come back; one night I heard the strangest noise outside my window, but I was too scared to look out; it was a high pitched noise that that higher and higher; I had to cover my ears to keep from going crazy.  I personally remember my adolescent period as one of chronic insomnia and I was always checking the windows to make sure they were locked.  I do not have any memory or inkling that I may have been taken nor does my brother or sister.   The day after this happened, in school a brave boy stood up and told the class what he saw.  He saw the saw saucer from his house; he lived maybe 4 blocks from me.  No one believed him; I did not say a word.  If I had seen a strange light in the distance or an object too fuzzy to make out, I may not be as strong a believer, but what I saw was so close to the grou! nd and so clear; I wonder why the majority of sightings are not of this type.
