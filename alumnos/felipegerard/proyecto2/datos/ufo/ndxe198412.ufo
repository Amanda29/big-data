12/27/84 21:00|Capricorn Coast (Australia)||Light|10mins|A super bright, sharp, red light travelled at supersonic speeds around a tropical storm cell, in Australia.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43357.html|1|ndxe198412| A super bright, sharp, red light travelled at supersonic speeds around a tropical storm cell, in Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was 14yrs of age, but I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on vacation with my family on the Capricorn Coast west of Rockhampton in Australia, we were preparing for bed when a severe electrical storm was brewing from the west so we decided to stay up and watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The storm core missed us to the north by a few miles, and the lightning show took the stage until my sister pointed out a red light in amongst the clouds.  It was a pin-point super bright laser like light source, it was so small it seemed to have no body.  It was so bright the surrounding clouds glowed the same color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved very fast in all directions as it weaved in and out of the clouds, all turns it made were smooth but way to fast for any aircraft.  The THING made no noise at all.  It&#39;s altitude seem to vary from the ceiling of the storm cell to almost sea level, this lasted for approximately 10mins and seemed to move with the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father/mother/sister and both my parents friends witnessed it.  No report on the next days news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/24/84 23:15|Tocca|GA|Triangle|3 min|Three bright light in a triangle formation moving very rapidly across the sky|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53243.html|2|ndxe198412| Three bright light in a triangle formation moving very rapidly across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran across this websight by accident, and as I began reading I realized I was not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night mentioned 12/24/1984 I was to leave to take on a new job, moving from Toccoa GA to Montgomery, AL to work as a computer technician at the local greyhoung track.  We had to be there no later than christmas day, and I had turned of all utilities, given notice at our apt. and off we went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feeling tired my wife and I pulled along a dirt road into the woods in toccoa to catch a power nap.  As we settled back in our seats looking south at the beauty of the stars...I saw 3 lights in the form of a triangle, just kind of sitting in the sky at a great distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought I saw them move about 3 inches as viewed in a linear measurement from my view...then after about 30 seconds the lights did not slowly, but at a great rate of speed moved from one side of my windshields view completely to the other side of the windshield in about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat amazed and didn&#39;t say anything, trying to rationalize what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also without my knowing had seen the same thing, after a few seconds she replied somewhat amazed and unsure, &#34; Did you see that?!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I replied, &#34;What?&#34; to check if she meant the same thing as what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said: &#34;Those three lights !&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew she had seen it then, to confirm I knew what she meant I said, &#34;..in the shape of a triangle?&#34;  She was just as amazed as I was and just said &#34;yeah&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have both since then had several &#34;supernatural&#34; events of various types happen in our lives.  I was amazed when I came across this web page and found that several of the sightings were identical to the one we saw.<n>

It looked strange enough to comment on. Then suddenly vanished into thin air. Perplexed, I asked if any of my friends noticed what had occured and lucky enough a chick standing behind me agreed that she had witnessed the same thing in the sky and with the same breath asked me not to mention what we had just seen again. It was obvious to me she was startled and upset at what she had just witnessed where as it had the opposite effect on me. I felt privileged to have caught this phenomenon take place.<n>
12/15/84 20:00|Santiago (Chile)||Changing|30 min.|First: One Object, Second: Few colorfull objects, Final: Again One object|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03419.html|4|ndxe198412| First: One Object, Second: Few colorfull objects, Final: Again One object<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning from a trip, we were near Santiago (a the east): Suddenly we saw a object looking to the west. It was a little white but brilliant point. It moved fast great distances (about 2 kilometers) to the north, south and again to the original position, maintaining the altitude. Suddenly it exploded showing a lot of coloful lights (red, blue, yellow dots). Some minutes after that it was again only one object like at first. The sight was at night so the light were well seen. The distance between us and the object was maybe approx. 5 to 10 kilometers. At the end the object appeared to flight towards us, so all of us were exited and more or less frightened. Finally the object made a fast change of trayectory and dissapeared.<n>

May  have entered Florida, crossed Alabama and landed in Tennessee. Reported  written up in The Montgomery Advertiser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stopped for a traffic light I viewed through the front windshield a large burning object which I assumed to be a meteor. It was on a trajectory which would let it crash about 3 or more miles to the Northwest of my position.  Another viewer saw it from a position on a bridge about 2 miles to the East from a higher elevation and said it looked much higher to him . This same viewer said it was noted in the local paper, either The Montgomery Advertiser or The Alabama Journal. He also said he read that it had crossed Florida and had gone down in Tennessee .The object appeared red to me and the other viewer said it lit up the sky. He said a piece of the tail split off and drifted behind the great ball of fire.<n>
