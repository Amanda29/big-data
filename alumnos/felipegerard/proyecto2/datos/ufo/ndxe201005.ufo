We pulled over onto Aldine Ave, 10:10 p.m. Got out of the car and watched it fly across the sky it didn&#39;t seem to have a flight pattern, it slowed down, it&#39;s movement was kind of jiggly and then hovered.  It seemed to have an arc shaped sail or wing on it, like if you were looking up into a hot air balloon and saw the glowing shape of the balloon thru the fire.  After hovering for a bit it started moving again and increased speed upward into the sky.  We knew it moved up, it got smaller as it went and finally disappeared.  It move across the sky towards the horizon, it went up.  We did not hear any sounds or a sonic boom when it disappeared.   After that we watched a plane fly across the sky for comparison, and it was not a plane of any sort, or a helicopter or balloon.<n>

Had digital image printed into an 8x10 and a 4x6, and UFO is visible in both photos (so it is not a processing smudge); pulled original digital file and the UFO is visible there as well.  Pulled the tornado images shot immediately before and after this one -- and the UFO is not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tornado touched down just south of Campo, Colorado on Memorial Day 2010.  There were NUMEROUS weather spotters shooting video and photos of this monster tornado.  Some of this photo was featured of the Today Show by one team who was within 50 yards of this storm (this interview should be available online at NBC or on youtube).<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO appears to be a saucer shape, and when blown-up 300% in i-photo you can see that the image has a reflection on it (is not a solid color).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are unable to identify the object in the photo.  It may be some type of optical aberration, but we cannot confirm that fact.  PD))<n>

I noticed a small light coming from the west, nearly straight overhead, moving fast. I pointed it out to my neighbor, who also saw it. It traveled east and blinked out before it reached the tree line. The light was bright white, and blinking, but there’s no way an airplane was moving that fast-it literally took only a couple of seconds to cross the sky. There was no engine noise, no sonic boom, just the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather was partly cloudy, and there was a storm to our south, with lightening that we could see on the horizon. There were fireflies out-however, this was definitely not a firefly, because the color of the light was too white to be a lightening bug (our local fireflies are usually green), and the blinking was too fast. I’m not exactly sure what we saw, so I’m hoping someone else saw it too!<n>

I observered the same type of object about one month ago.  I am a former Police Officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During todays occurance I was sitting on the Southern back deck of where I live with a clear view of the Southern sky above about 45 degress from ground to sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a white object moving at slow but consistant pace toward the west at an unknown altitude and it seemed to flow the basic flight path of flights leaving from McCarren Airport.  However its pace was a lot slower than the planes that I could clearly see leaving the area.  The object changed direction at a full ninety degree turn and proceeded north.  That&#39;s when I took notice of it really. I watched it come toward the north, stop and then go west and then came to complete stop for about five minutes.  I used a Telephone pole as a guide of movement.  It then darted south and stopped. Another white object streaked throught the sky a little way west from the stationary object.  That object stayed there until I came inside to find somewhere to report it.<n>

Then I thought maybe it was an advertising sign of some sort that was flying behind a plane, but there were  no planes around and the way this thing moved was WIERD. Then it just lowered itself down behind the trees. I couldn&#39;t see it after that and unfortunately I had to take my exit.  I don&#39;t know what the thing was or if anyone else saw it, I hope someone did and will also report it so that I know I am not crazy.<n>

The objects moved with a very fast zig zag path never straight unless it was stopped and then it appeared to be hovering.  We live near an army base so at first thought it could be manuevers until the objects became more numerous.  They were directly moving from the east to the west.  The lights appeared to be moving around in a circle simultaneously while the entire object zig zagged it is very hard to explain without seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was first noticed toward the right hand portion of the sky, and at the time, didn&#39;t seem much higher than around a few hundred feet up (judging by the speed it was traveling, and the movements it made).  The object was round in shape, and moved across the sky towards the left, all while it&#39;s color changed from a vibrant blue, to green, purple, red, orange, and so on.  It wasn&#39;t making any sort of sound, and didn&#39;t seem to be moving like it had a distinct front/rear and left/right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then changed direction with seemingly no effort, and did something similar to a figure 8 (still only moving at a medium pace). Just after the erratic movement, the object then proceeded to change it&#39;s shape from being round, to a more cigar shape with what looked like a bend in the center (it almost looked like a DNA strand in shape).   At this point, the object&#39;s two &#34;halves&#34; both started to change their own colors, all while the object started to move south and in a straight line.  The shape slowly morphed back into being round (as well as it&#39;s color back to a white), as the object increased speed and continued straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that my first guess of it was being a few hundred up was wrong, because after a minute or two of this, the object then started to flash 3 times consecutively, every few seconds, as if it were exiting the atmosphere.  The object eventually disappeared after another minute or so, and no further lights/objects were seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am an avid lover of UFOs and their mystery, but had yet to see anything abnormal in my life until this happened.<n>

It had a green and orange or something similar lights that were not flashing until it moved.  It was very late (around 2am) and my house was the only one with the lights on in the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something hovering so I opened my window and reached for my glasses.  As soon as I did so, it turned around (to my east, it was facing my west) and flew away at what seemed like a constant speed.  Then the lights started flashing.  It was gray, and wouldn&#39;t be possible to see in such light, but it was visible. I have been a non-believer in such crafts until recently, and having witnessed one first-hand is more freaky.  There is no such officially licensed patrol aircraft here in the UK, so I have no idea what it could be apart from a UFO.<n>

Not only do I have a strong knowledge of what things in the night sky such as meteors/”shooting stars,” satellite/ iridium flares, planes, helicopters, etc., look like, but I also have a healthy dose of analytical skepticism from my father which I always apply when something out of the ordinary presents itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the topic of a UFO is brought up, I always think of the story of the “Tucson Lights” ((NUFORC Note:  ((sic))  Phoenix Lights))  that is shown on UFO shows on TV often and hoe my father finds it slightly comical how much that incident is still hyped despite the lights so clearly (at least to him) being from A-10 flares (he was an A-10 pilot for 20 years, with over 4,000 hours in the cockpit).  However, my father has always been deeply fascinated by UFO stories/sightings, and he is a firm believer that much more happened at Roswell in 1947 than what the government ever told the public.  My father has instilled in me a profound love and curiosity for all things flight and/or outer space related, as well as a strong sense of the importance of thoroughly reviewing/examining something before drawing any conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDITIONAL NOTES ON SIGHTING]   The object did not enter from one end of our line of sight and exit at the other, but rather, it suddenly appeared in the middle region of the night sky visible in front of us, and seconds later, disappeared directly in plain sight.  It did not have the movement, luminosity, or any of the distinguishing characteristics of a meteor.  Although it appeared to be an illuminated aircraft of sorts (not just a streak of light), it moved far too fast to be a plane as well as in a somewhat hard to explain irregular path unlike that of any airplane.  Additionally, its light was not constant like that of a plane in the night sky. It simply appeared in the middle of plain sight, moved across the sky in a way and at a speed that I have never before witnessed demonstrated by anything else, and then abruptly vanished while still in a clear area in the middle region of the night sky visible to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having observed a comet, several meteor showers, a satellite flare, and of course, more planes and helicopters than I could ever hope to count, move through the night sky, what I saw in the sky this past night was almost bewildering, due to it being absolutely unidentifiable in any right.<n>

Down two blocks from our house and now facing north we saw 5 bright lights hovering way up high in the sky.  They were a yellow-orange color.  They initially hovered in the sky in no distinct formation.  Slowly they started to float(?) downward and one by one faded out.  It was so dramatic that a car stopped and 4 people jumped out to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I realize that this could have been a firework but it would have to have been an industrial/military type thing because these lights were really high in the sky.

I always take time to scan the skies while outside after dark. Sometimes I take my night vision scope out because there are so many more stars and other objects that are seen with the night vision monocular than with the naked eye. Last night I took the scope outside with me again. I was able to see, what I believe were, two separate satellites traversing the night sky. These are usually always seen at least once a night through the scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after looking at the sky for a good 10 minutes I was able to see an object that I could not identify. This object was traveling from west to east very high up. Because it was only visible through the night vision I could not discern if this object was within the earth’s atmosphere or if it was out in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moved much slower than the satellites I see every night, much slower. It also brightened and dimmed in a rhythmic pattern. While the object moved through the sky it would slowly brighten, stay bright for about a second and then slowly dim again to nearly invisible, staying dim for approximately 4-5 seconds. This pattern repeated itself during the length of time I watched the object. It didn’t flash quickly or erratically, nor did it move briskly or erratically. This object stayed on the same course repeating it’s brightening and dimming as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was at its dimmest, it blended in with the smaller, less visible stars in the sky. The size and shape of it was very much like the rest of the stars. I was not at all able to see this object without the use of the scope, even when it brightened to its maximum luminosity. Eventually, this object flew out of sight. Given the slow movement, size and the fact the object was not visible without the scope, I believe this object to have been in space. If it was, it had to have been extremely large!  There were other aircraft in the sky during this sighting. I could hear and see an airliner coming from TIA in Tampa heading north and see smaller aircraft to the west heading south. These planes were much lower and faster than the craft I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a paranormal investigator and have some experience in investigating and reporting unexplained events. I have seen satellites, the ISS, shooting stars and all kinds of aircraft as I have served in the USAF and currently reside in an airplane community; this object did not fit the description of any of these things. If anyone knows what this thing could have been or also saw it, I’d love to know! This sighting really surprised and excited me.<n>

It wasnt a shooting starr or anything like that. I estamate the altitude to be between 5 and 10 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was truley a weird deal maybe there have been other reports.<n>
5/29/10 22:00|Oregon City|OR|Light|5 minutes|Oregon City Sighting on 5/29/2010 - Approximatley 12 red-orange lights ascending in the east.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75611.html|26|ndxe201005| Oregon City Sighting on 5/29/2010 - Approximatley 12 red-orange lights ascending in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May 29th, 2010. At approximately 10:30pm I was leaving my office in downtown Oregon City.  I was walking to the place I normally park under the bridge when I remembered it was Saturday and I had parked right in front of the office where the meters don’t run on weekends.  As I was heading back, facing east, I noticed four (4) lights over the cliff where the big Oregon City elevator is - Which coincidentally is shaped like a UFO. They looked fairly high up, about as high as a plane would be coming in for landing at PDX from that distance - Ten thousand feet, (10,000) maybe? They ascended slowly upwards, appearing over the cliff. Although they were shaped like a triangle, it was apparent they were separate objects in a triangle formation. As they rose the formation began to break up and they criss-crossed each other.  They gradually faded the higher they climbed, eventually disappearing altogether. As one formation began to fade another rose up over the cliff a! nd as similar pattern was repeated. They moved slow and consistent, like balloons being released on a calm day. There was no mistaking them for balloons, however, it was very dark and they were lit up by their own light sources, not the sun or moon.  There appeared to be 12 total but I could be wrong.  I was frantically trying to call my workmate who was still up in the office to get him to come down and see. He made it down in time to see about 4 of the remaining lights before they faded. The lights were red-orange in color and they did not blink, flare up or change shape.  They were simply very bright as the rose over the cliff and faded the higher they climbed. We waited about 10 minutes to see if anymore appeared, but that was it.  End of show.  On a personal note, I am 34 and have never seen a UFO before, of any kind, except on film.   The behavior of these lights reminded me very much of some films I have seen of UFO clusters in the day time. Silver orbs floating arou! nd like balloons, eventually ascending and fading out.  Only t! his time they were at night and emitted a bright, red-orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I do not know the zipcode since I&#39;ve never been here before.  My friend and I looked at the sky and two almost circular shaped things were in the sky pretty high and clearly not an airplane.  They are still there rite now. they look orange and red and yellow.  A few minutes ago another one weirdly popped out of nowhere. The colors on each craft seemed to oddly spread and then go back to normal.  As I&#39;m writing this the crafts are gone now... my friend jus looked at the sky and told me there not there anymore.  I&#39;m not joking I swear.  I don&#39;t know if it was ufos but its clearly a big possibility.  My friend and I are 15 years old and the other people here are drunk adults so the other 8 witnesses won&#39;t be good.  They were just looking at the sky laughing and saying it was probably weather balloons.<n>

The sighting looked like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A tiny and white blinking point appeared first as me and my friend were watching at the sky and talking. That night there was no electricity in the area and we were waiting for it outside.  The blinking light was very tiny at first, and it started in the middle of the orion belt.  As we followed it, it continue to to get bigger and bigger. the blink repeats every 5 seconds.  Then the blinking got bigger and started moving in the east direction, and it was getting a little bigger again.  As we followed it, it continue moving, getting more  bigger, and finaly it equaled shape of a liitle bigger than mars.  The blinking also got red. This thing was blinking red, and moving in the east direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continue to follow, it moved very far, blinking every 5 seconds, until it disappeared. it was moving at a constant slow speeed. Because it&#39;s too far, we couldn&#39;t identify its shape.  But as it bliked it was possible to tell that it is flat and round shape. it accelerated to the ea! st continuing to blink every 5 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finaly it was moving far to the east direction, and we were following it, untill it gets out of sight.  We were amazed, what could be this thing, that it first starts in the three stars of the orion belt, and it continued to get bigger and redder and moved.<n>

Three were in a triangle formation and one to the right was seperated from the others but with the group.  This was S.E. in the sky.  The were not moving they were seditary, seeming to just sit in the sky .... then they just disappeard. ????<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an odd sighting.  And the fact that is was very low in the sky and flikered like red stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting.  We have changed the time above to reflect that fact.

They were in a perfect formation of approximately a 25-30% angle triangle with the center point above the other 2 outer low points. The points of light were way to far apart to be any plane or aircraft I have EVER seen!  I didn&#39;t see any distinct blinking lights like those from an airplane or any other common aircraft.  The individual lights would somewhat pulsate in intensity but not a true blink. One light would get brighter though the light didn&#39;t radiate outward to appear any larger, just brighter, as another would dim in unison. They seemed to &#34;take turns&#34; dimming/brightening.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any odd colors just white/yellowy lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned onto the freeway ramp I lost sight of it for a moment then regained sight of it to my right as I was heading north.  At this point it seemed as if the formation had slightly shifted but gone up a bit higher in altitude, though still too low to the ground for this to be a military type plane formation maneuver.  Now the northernmost light was slightly lower than the southern pointing light and it appeared closer to the center light, like how the perspective would warp if you had a solid triangular object and pivoted it slightly clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point a fourth light appeared just barely above the tree line and even further back in the south direction than the back corner of the triangle and much lower.  This light seemed brighter and larger than the other three and seemed almost to be a tail???   Upon a quick glance at this point it would almost appear as if the little dipper had lost part of it&#39;s tail, it&#39;s bottom star, gotten very close to the earth and hovered there above Oregon City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was not in a position to stop and shoot footage as I was running late for work.  I called home quick to see if my husband could see it but he could not even though we are on a slight hill.  The object was just hovering too low for it to be seen from many locations.  I say object, yet strange thing is I didn&#39;t see any solid object holding these lights in this formation.  It was BY FAR the oddest thing I have EVER seen! I have looked all over the internet, called news channels and even the local dispatch and NO ONE else seems to have reported this.  This is why I&#39;m posting this here. I am not crazy or anything but some verification that ANYONE else saw this would ease my mind!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading.<n>

Around 9:30PM saw bright stationary large orange light with smaller blinking lights.  Light moved up, and then moved sideways behind a tree line.  Hour later the light reappeared with a second light.  Lights moved in formation and faded until you could not see them...the lights appeared and disappeared several times.  Witnessed by two of my brothers.  Later that night after one of my brothers and I retired to the camper, other brother began yelling at us to wake up around 1:00AM.  When I opened the door of the camper there were 5 indentical lights in the sky motionless in formation.  One by one each light went strait up and then moved off to the east(?) and faded like a dimmer switch...last light held position for about a minute and then followed the expact pattern of other lights.  There was no sound associated with the lights, estimate 5000ft alt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us are former military and are very familair with copters and fixed wing airplanes.

It was late afternoon before sunset.  The objects were two large craft and a group of smaller craft that were flying to the north east.  The smaller craft were randomly dispersed around the two larger craft, and as the group of craft kept moving to the north east the smaller craft disappeared.  The smaller craft did not crash, nor was there any light emitted from them.  The two craft stayed at altitude as they moved through the sky and my co worker and I lost sight of them due to distance.  The craft did not leave an exhaust trail  I estimate that the craft were traveling near the speed of sound, and below the flight ceiling of commercial aircraft.  This is due to the fact that a commercial flight flew overhead at 20:18 MDT and did leave an exhaust trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my position the craft were approximately 5 to 7 degrees above the horizon and within 5 miles of my position.

We arrived @ Smith Island approx. 9 AM.  We anchored and finally began fishing on the East side of the Southern tip of Smith Island @ 915.  @ 930 we started hearing a rumbling sound.  It was a very clear, sunny day with one or two small clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The water was like glass - no swells or wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rumbling sound became louder and louder, seemingly emanating from the South/Southwest.  We looked around for any aircraft overhead but saw nothing - not even a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rumbling turned into a deafening, thunderous roar - the sound slowly moved from the South/Southwest to the North/Northwest and eventually died back down as quickly as it came - the whole thing lasting about 6 minutes.  It was so loud at one point I could feel the roaring/thundering sound within my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember telling the Captain I expected to see a wall of water coming from the West.  The Captain had 4 years experience in these waters and was adimant that he had never heard anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw an aircraft or contrail.  The next thing that came to mind was possibly a meteor but given the deafening roar and how long it lasted we should have seen something.  The consensus on the boat was some kind of hypersonic experimental military craft or a UFO.  I was considering the timing - memorial day weekend - and wondering why the military would be operating on a Saturday over memorial day weekend over the skies of Prince Williams Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time it&#39;s occured to me to report it to somebody.

It was approximately 15-20 minutes before actual sunrise, when the sky was just lighting up, very clear out, we were standing in front of the Westin on A1A just north of Las Olas Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the water&#39;s edge and after a couple seconds I looked up and my eyes immediately fixated on something moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s very difficult to describe what we saw. The object was black - at first I thought it might be a bird very high up, but I couldn&#39;t discern any wings flapping, it just looked like a solid object moving slowly over the ocean, over and past us and continuing inland. There were no flashing lights, and as there were quite a few planes on the horizon, it was quite easy to see that this was not one of them. It was hard to focus on also, it seemed far away but quite low at the same time; for a second I actually thought it sort of looked like a person flying, but I dismissed this for obvious reasons. My girlfriend described it as &#34;an asymmetrical rectangular blob floating westward, not like a bird that varies direction and flaps its wings, but more like a balloon&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very creepy, no sound at all, and again this thing flew in from the ocean, maybe 1,000 ft (?) up, and proceeded inland. There were several planes on the horizon, several miles away and clearly discernible as conventional aircraft. The object that passed above us most definitely was not.<n>

5/28/10 22:12|Green Bay|WI|Unknown|30-45 seconds|Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change size|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75666.html|41|ndxe201005| Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change size<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday 28MAY2010, a friend and I were visiting a third friend at his house in Green Bay.  The residence is located just southeast of St. Vincent Hospital  (The hospital is visible from the backyard).  This residence is on the east side of Green Bay, approximately 3 miles north of WI-172, and 3-4 miles east of the Fox River (Distances are rough estimates!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:10 PM, the three of us were sitting on the back deck of the house.  I was sitting on a bench at the edge of the deck and right next to the house, facing north-northwest.  Friend #1 was sitting directly to my left, facing due North.   Friend #2 was sitting on a picnic table in the middle of the deck facing us.  As we were talking, Friend #1 happened to look up in roughly northeastern direction and see something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He remarked &#34;Is that an airplane?  That&#39;s not an airplane!&#34;.   At this point, I cannot remember if he indicated the direction the object was traveling.  I could not see the object from where I was sitting because the house blocked my view.  I instinctively turned to my left and looked upward over my shoulder, where I was able to view a patch of sky not obscured by the house or the stand of trees at the edge of the property.  I managed to see the object as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be an orange &#34;fire-colored&#34; object, very roughly circular, but nebulous in appearance, moving across the sky at a rapid clip. It was about as large as the thumbnail on a man&#39;s pinky finger, if held at arms length.  There was no trail or halo around this object, nor did it change size as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object was obscured by trees, I dashed for the west end of the yard, where the line of trees ended (about 15-20 feet past the end of the deck).  The object again entered my field of view.  Its characteristics had not changed in the few seconds where I moved my position.  The object continued on a straight-line course from east-northeast to west-southwest.  It did not change speed.  It did not appear to change altitude.  The object did not change color or size either.  Everything remained constant until it appeared to fade just before it left our available field of vision.  One characteristic of the object that struck me is that the center appeared darkened somewhat compared to the outer edges.  When the object disappeared, it did not flash, &#34;blink&#34; or explode, it just faded in about a half-second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear that night. Despite there being a large volume of commerical air traffic in Green Bay, there was no air traffic sighted other than the emergency medevac helicopter that periodically flew in to land at the nearby hospital. I do not think the flight path of incoming planes intersects with the helicopter&#39;s usual flight pattern. This helicopter was not in the area during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friends and I discussed this object, we were of the initial opinion that it was some type of celestial body which entered and then exited the atmosphere.  However the absence of a trail, and the constant shape/size of the object are disconcerting when considering this theory.  Growing up in the country, I have seen my share of &#34;Shooting stars&#34;, meteorites, orbiting satellites, and what have you.  Most meteors I&#39;ve seen actually moved FASTER that the object in question.  The absence of trail is not all that unusual, but a meteor travelling at what appeared to be quite an oblique angle, visible for 30+ seconds, would seem to be large enough to expect to see a trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted about one minute, or one minute 30 seconds, from the time my friend spotted the object to the time it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to my uncertainty about what I saw, I am submitting this report with hopes that:  1) it can be compared to any similar reports submitted from 5/28/2010 or otherwise from Brown County/Green Bay  2) The experts at NUFORC can indicate the likelihood that this was indeed a meteorite or similar (re-entering satellite?) and NOT a UFO  Thank you for your accepting this report<n>

We are in the flight pattern for the airport where we are so I had thought it was just a plane but it had no flashing light on it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from left to right then to the left again.  Then it looked as it was coming back toward us and then looked as if there were 2 orbs of light in the air then that were very close together.  To me they looked very white in color.  My husband saw it a little different through his video camera on his phone. In his camera they looked as they were changing color from like a pink to blue to white but I could not see that with my bare eyes only on his phone in the video.

My 5 year old son was the next to see it.  Daughter called it to the attention of my wife.  She (wife) called me on my cell phone. I was in the garden.  I went to my apartment on the third floor and saw it out the window with binoculars.  It was a long black tube with a small protrusion at one end at a 90 degree angle respective to the body.  Wife said it had a long split running the full length of the body that was slightly lighter than the surrounding body&#39;s black color.  I could not see that from my location.  It was 1/2 mile from me and about 400 feet off the ground. Wife saw it from 9:10 to 9:15 when she had to make a turn to get the kids to school.  I saw it from 9:13 to 9:17 when it disappeared.  I didn&#39;t see the direction but it was definitely gone from the sky.  Wife said it kept coming closer then going farther away.  It was completely vertical to 10 degrees when she saw it.  It was 45 to 90 degrees slowly varying when I saw it.  It was coming closer to me when it disappeared.<n>

The driver, myself and another passenger were in the vehicle. We saw 2 lights coming toward us. It looked like a LARGE craft.  We could not make out the shape or see the craft itself, but it had 3 distinctive lights and was maneuvering back and forth and from side to side and zoomed off into the dark before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you could connect the dots (3 lights) it would probably make a &#34;boomerang&#34; shape.  We could not tell how far or close it was from us, but we all saw it clear as day.  No helicopter or airplane could move the way this craft moved, nor did it have any sound.<n>

5/27/10 22:15|Ventura|CA|Light|10 minutes|I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75643.html|47|ndxe201005| I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, &#34;Okay, well, I agree that it&#39;s a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.&#34;  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, now let me describe my sighting to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, I&#39;m walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I&#39;m walking, being a nature lover that I am, I&#39;m looking towards the sky.  And I thought, &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah&#34; sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that&#39;s strange, so I stopped walking.  And that&#39;s when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here&#39;s where things get even a little more funky, so I&#39;ve stopped and I&#39;m looking at this light in the sky and I think &#34;Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.&#34;  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might&#39;ve been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I&#39;ve seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I&#39;m saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might&#39;ve beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I&#39;m holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.<n>

I was at Summer Lake Hot Springs for a concert. This place provides a view of at least 15 miles of surrounding area for approx. 270 degrees. these ufo&#39;s were spotted above Summer Lake. At first: I noticed what looked like a streak of light across a large part of the sky. something had gone by at high speed at the edge of my vision. I kept my attention on that part of the sky. within a minute I saw it again, but this time it was more visible (brighter / slower movement). I ran to the tent and grabbed my camera. I witnessed what looked like balls of light moving in groups. these lights were a golden color and could be seen changing at a high rate between red,green,blue,and white. they faded in and out, as if they were disappearing and reappearing. some of the time they would stay in a semi-transparent state. I took pictures of the area whenever I saw them. much of the time they were moving so fast t! hat I wasn&#39;t sure if I caught them. *** Later in the evening multiple balls of light appeared above the horizon. They seemed to be a few miles away. after taking a few pictures, they disappeared. moments later they were spotted by my friend. they were within a mile or less and where moving extremely low to the ground. My friend and I then witnessed the lights go into the lake and disappear. the lights then reappeared and were within what seemed to be about 1000 yards of us. the dark pictures are of these lights when they were what seemed to be a few miles away. the lights then disappeared back into the lake. they were seen moving at a high rate of speed and then disappeared. that was the last we witness of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original images can be found here:<n> <n><n> http://imgur.com/7C3S7&amp;33ww0&amp;4rOMK&amp;TVTrwl&amp;fFDvZ&amp;Gpyw6&amp;6DviJ&amp;Y4kgr&amp;xhpGL&amp;0yme0&amp;Ya6fD&amp;wGiqp&amp;QFadJ&amp;qZjqj&amp;YVmWx&amp;f2arL&amp;Fxtxb&amp;j7o14<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars?

I seen, I don’t know what type of air craft it was, most planes have lights flashing on them. This object I seen had light that ran straight across, they were like a faded yellow color, and they were not flashing. The lights were different sizes, i know they were more than 5, id say about 8 lights total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying really low… it was moving really slow, almost hovering.. after a few seconds, it was gone. Usually when you hear a plane go by, you would hear its engines as well. I heard nothing… it was quiet. but I also saw a trail that followed behind it. A trail that looks like a smoke cloud, going across the sky. The same trail a plane leaves behind when flyng way above the sky, their trails also are mostly straight and a constant line. This trail wasn’t straight, it formed a strange shape and wasn’t a constant line, it was thick as well towards the end and curved upwards at the end. Also, the trail was close, it wasn&#39;t way above the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband I saw a ufo, he didn’t believe me  he did admit he saw a strange trail of smoke riding across the sky that was at a strange close range.  I was thinking it was a jet maybe, but jets are loud. And usually don’t fly this low at this time of day. this was not a jet, nor a plane.  I wonder if anyone else saw something tonight.<n>

After looking through binoculars it looked triangular with 3 lights.  One was amber,red,and white. It seemed to move in weird ways. It would shoot left,right,circles,and a zig zag pattern.  I had 2 friends come over and they witnessed it doing the same thing.  I even called friends in a different county about 15-20 miles away and him and three others saw the same thing I was seeing.  It always stayed near the same spot in the sky but moved around.  I have witnessed satellites,asteroids, shooting stars,jets and planes in the sky at night and this moved like nothing I have ever seen.my 2 friends were in the military that also witnessed it and they said no plane in the military they know of can move that quick in that type of formation that they know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also every now and then seemed to shoot out red beams of light out the side of the object.either it was shooting something out or something was coming in.<n>

It was a clear night sky so we decided to pull out a couple of chairs in the back lawn and chat while the dog did what dogs do outside.  Within five minutes of looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a satellite or a plane at a very high altitude moving steadily across the sky.  The object appeared almost indistinguishable from a star except for the fact that it was moving.  I turned to my girlfriend to ask her which one she thought it was and when we both stared back at the moving light it was sitting in the night sky stationary.  I was immediately a little spooked because I was unaware of any plane, satellite, or other flying object that was capable of moving and then coming to a complete stop.  My girlfriend thought I was just seeing things but I convinced her to keep an eye on for a few minutes.  It is important to note that the light that was moving! was now sitting still at about an arms length distance, from my vantage point, of a small bright star.  We watched the object for what seemed to be five to seven minutes, and just when I convinced myself that I was just seeing things the object clearly moved another arms length distance north of its current position.  My girlfriend confirmed this movement and as we were talking about what it could be the object quickly moved east of its position.  The object started at a six o’clock position, in relation to the small star near it, and when it became stationary again it was hovering at about a ten o’clock position from the star.  We were so intrigued by what this could be that we watched the object for a total of two hours.  Within this two hour time period, the object made several more movements, displayed a red tint at times, and changed the level of brightness it was emitting several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/26/10 22:00|Johnstown|PA|Light|30 minutes|Bright Orange (oval shaped) object over Johnstown PA flys for short period then remains stationary in sky for over 30+min|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75657.html|61|ndxe201005| Bright, orange (oval shaped) object over Johnstown, PA, flys for short period then remains stationary in sky for over 30+min<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday May 26, 2010,  my girlfriend and two children ( my oldest being 6 and youngest 2) decided to go get ice cream at a local creamery ,located at Roxbury park, in a section of Johnstown known as Roxbury.  After we got ice cream we proceeded to sit at some benches at the perimeter of the park and eat each of our ice cream desserts there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were beginning to eat the dessert My daughter (age 6) asked me , “what is that light in the sky Papa?” I took a look in the direction that she was pointing and noticed a very bright object approaching from a distance (It came from the direction of Westmont, another suburb of Johnstown) towards the direction where we were standing. (Note: The four of us were not the only ones out at this time of night.  There was another family, eating their ice cream desserts beside us as well. They did not seem to be paying attention to what we were looking at)  My initial answer to my daughter’s question was that the object was a helicopter, possibly with a spotlight on. I mentioned the spotlight, as the light the object was emitting was extremely bright, orange, and looked like what you would see, if looking at a spotlight head from a distance. I stated to her that the helicopter was probably coming in for a landing at the local hospital (Conemaugh hospital).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to observe the object, it came to a gradual stop. (Note: as it approached our location, it did not “fly” very fast at all, which led me to believe it was a helicopter)  We continued to watch the object and as time past, I came to the realization that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object remained stationary for a period of 30 minutes or more. (The length of time we were at the location eating our ice cream).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became perplexed as to what this object could be.  It was a pretty clear night, and many stars were visible.  This object however was in our atmosphere, much brighter then even the north star, or planet such as Venus, and after having seen it move initially, it remained stationary for an extended period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend mentioned at some point during this event, that there was in fact quite a bit of  “aerial” activity in the vicinity of this object.  We both notice several smaller aircraft flying in what I call &#34;an observation flight path&#34; at various locations in the sky near to each other and in the direction of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say that after looking at the smaller aircraft for some time, and following their flight paths, At least one of the aircraft came to complete stop mid air and seemed to be observing the object that I am reporting on.  The smaller aircraft looked to be a “conventional aircraft”, as it had both white and red blinking lights. The only abnormal behavior that this small aircraft exhibited was the “hovering” maneuver it was able to do when “observing” the bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will mention that I was able to take some photographs and video footage of this event with my smart phone.  As you may already know, the quality of this media is not very good. I also do not have flash on the camera, which definitely did not help my cause in attempting to capture good footage for the purpose of evidence. You are welcome to this footage if you so desire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After at least 30 minutes of observing the object, I packed the family in the car and took them home.  After being home for about 20 minutes, I decided I needed to go back to the location where I saw the object and ensure that what I saw was indeed not a star or planet.  When I arrived at the exact location I had initially seen the object, it was no longer there.  There was no aerial traffic either. The skies remained clear of clouds, allowing me to see the stars. This object was most definitely not a star or planet.<n>

As usual, after getting out of the car, I stood there a while and look at the stars.  I was looking N/E and caught a flicker to the East.  I looked and saw, what I can only describe as, a fireball.  It was moving so slow that I actually watched it for about 30 seconds.  30 seconds!  It was moving easterly on a steady path and had a faint, but visible tail.  Whatever its distance was from my eyes, I can assuredly say that it looked the size of the full moon.  I could actually see movement in the color probably due to excessive heat. It was kind of like looking straight into a jet’s afterburners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either a HUGE object or it was very, very close.  From my viewpoint, it looked like it was at a level where I would normally see jets coming in for a landing, but I’m sure that was just an optical illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing coming off the object like pieces or sparks.  It was round, clean and almost photoshopped-looking except for the faint pinkish spray of the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was a meteor, it was far too close for my comfort and there was nothing at all mentioned on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I’ve seen something like this. The first time, in the late 70’s, was not nearly as spectacular, but just a thrilling.  As we were driving back from Newport Beach at 3:00am, that object went right over our heads, like a plane going down, then shot up at a very sever angle and out of sight, all in about 10 seconds.  No sound at all. Neither of us talked about it.  The people in the car driving next to us also saw it.  I looked over at them and they just shrugged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to have taken a picture of either object it would have looked exactly like the gas bubble (without the fiery outer layer and red tail) on the ‘In the News’ section of the C2C website, under &#34;Black Hole blows huge gas bubble.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen ball lightening in California. In any case, I doubt it would be as big as these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Staff Assistant for an Engineering of a Municipal utility.  I worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years, loving my company and every minute of work.  I have been intrested in everything to do with space, planets, astronomy,and etchnology since I was 1st grade - all due to a large panaramic picture my teached had posted on the Science Wall that dipicted the birth and death of planet Earth.  I didn&#39;t quite accept that particular concept of Earth, but it was colorful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep binoculars in my car just so I can look at stars.  (Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t about to take my eyes of the May object to grab the binoculars.I now keep them under the front seat.)   I often get up at two or three in the morning just to go outside and look at the sky.  It&#39;s very calming, but somewhat hard on my neck.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of extremely interesting things up there that, and that just keeps me hooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you keep looking down, you might find money, if you keep looking up, your discoveries can be priceless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was clouded with a solid cover behind some darker cummulus clouds medium altitude and different shades of gray.  Over the treetops to our left, out of the corner of my eyes I saw what I thought to be smoke from a rather intense fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being curious, I slowed down, no traffic behind me, just to look over.  When I managed to fully stop to view what this stream was, it did not originate from the earth.  It was dangling from the clouds in the western skies from over the Pacific Ocean.  The only way to describe it is :  imagine a  slinky made of a flat black ribbon.  Pull it open, attach one end to the clouds and let the other end dangle for 10 miles downward and inland for 10 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I was pointing the thing out to my friend, I noticed a shorter version hanging from the clouds over Los Angeles County.  We were in disbelief! because the last time I saw something big in the UFO arena, it was with the same friend in Lauderdale by the Sea, Florida a few years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not drink, smoke nor do we take any medication.  It was a shame that we were on our way to her job and couldn&#39;t take more time to go home for cameras and so on.  They were rectangular coils of something which was solid black and didn&#39;t dissipate like smoke would. Absolutely not smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly delineated rectangular slinky made of wide flat black ribbon being pulled open and dangling from the clouds downwards towards the earth. Very wierd!<n>

I can see the Jemez Mountains and Los Alamos.   There was spotty cumulus cloud cover with blues skies.  My eye was caught by two gold (“star like”) objects in a staggered formation, completely silent, moving in a NW direction.  Based upon my altitude (7,000’) and the cloud base of approx 15, 000’, I estimate the objects were around 20,000’.  One object actually passed behind a small cloud which was thin enough for me to still see it.  The objects continued toward Los Alamos, appearing to gain altitude until out of range of my sight.<n>

Silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the crafts, look to be triangular in shape, w/ a large solitary light (fixed to the bottom.)  The second craft, shapeshifted, almost immediately after i first saw it.  (It went from a large cigarshaped light, right to a ball of light) and its been pulsating in colors, wildly.<n>

In the Northwestern sky I stared at a light that was flashing looked to be a constant white and red.  I then pointed it out to my husband, at which point we noticed there was a triangle shape of two additional bright, flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get some binnoculars to get a better look of the image.  When I returned the brighter light of the three I initially saw now was a constant white with a red flash on the left of the light, green flash to the right and the occasional yellow/ orange flash.  There was at times a set pattern and at other times no noticeable pattern.  About 15 minutes into the phenomenom there was a sudden brilliant blue almost indigo light that emitted and the object moved slightly up vertically.  The object then went back to the original light flashing of alternating the multi-color flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point I called my sisters that live roughly 3 miles away to see if the could see these lights.  I called neighbors to see if they too, were still awake and could see.  All that I was able to get a hold of, confirmed that they too saw what we were seeing.  My sisters stated that they could see 2 additional triangular shaped flashing lights of 3 in two different groups.  We looked to the southern sky and could immediately see two more triangle shapes with the same flashing.  Those were further out than the original that was still staying in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live just south of Louisville which is a huge UPS hub, roughly 11pm is a very major time for a lot of incoming airplanes.  All of these planes didn&#39;t appear to react in anyway to the flashing lights.  It also helped give us an estimate to the altitude, the planes were much higher.  The flashing lights were just above the tree line from our patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried on multiple occasions to use a camera to photograph but all we had was an iPhone camera which isn&#39;t of good quality and couldn&#39;t pick up anything on the image.  We drove closer to where we thought the light was directly overhead to get a picture but could never get a decent quality shot.  When we came back home the original flashing light was much dimmer and had moved quite some distance away.  While watching it, faintly in the night sky I watched as it appeared to zip over to the other two points of its triange shape and then all three immediately disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a fairly clear night, tons of stars out etc, but in the triangle masses there was nothing but pitch black.  No stars inbetween or clouds.  I believe.<n>

When directly overhead the intensity of the light grew as bright as the ISS does and then slowly dimmed out again as it was when I first started watching opposed the flash i saw with ther object.  The total time of the visible object was around 30 seconds. I could see the extreme humidity outside was very thick and can only see 1 or 2 visible stars.  After checking the ISS flyovers of St.Louis, there are no orbital paths flying over here until June so it wasn&#39;t an ISS flyover or a satellite, because satellites always give off a reddish hue due to the infrared light reflected back off the earth.  Again it was a bright white object started out as a dim light then in the middle of path grew extremely bright as the ISS is and then slowly dimmed out with a speed about as fast as the ISS flyovers are from what I can reference.  There were no FAA lights, just one solid whi! te light, nothing blinking or flashing. No other planes in the sky before or after event.<n>

We both were looking at the night sky, and she pointed to the southwest of us, and that&#39;s when she said &#34;Spaceship!&#34; and we both saw two &#34;flames&#34; (emitting a bright orange-red glow) in a perfect circles, from what looked to us, usual cruising altitude for normal jets, except, at that altitude, they are never that large. They both looked to be about 96 feet wide, and about 128 feet apart.  The one on the left disappeared, in what could be described as a dissolving manner, and the second one did the same about 1 second after. That was the end of that.<n>

After getting him on his phone he stated that he was at the car so I went to my bedroom window to check on him. As I looked in the direction of the car I noticed a bunch of lights in the sky. The majority of the lights were white but a few were red. The lights were very clear and visible on the objects. I stated to my son that he should look out of the back window of the car and see the lights but at then at that moment I noticed that there was more than one of the objects. Two of the objects were very close together maybe about 100 to 200 ft. and the other three were further away in distance. I keep telling my son to get out the car and look that I was not trying to be funny; he stated that he saw the object earlier and that he thought because it was in the sky that it had to be a blimp. I stated that a blimp is not that bright and that blimps does not hover like that! the light were very clear I could not put a shape to the object but it definitely was not that of a of a blimp. I don&#39;t believe that I have every encountered (UFO) the shape before. By the time my son got out the car to look only one of the objects was remaining. We watched the object until my son got across the street visible. I had attempted to take a picture but was unable to because the phone I picked up did not have a media card in it.  I went back to the window shortly after to see if I could see the object again but the objects had disappeared. There was a plane or are craft in the air at the time of the sighting. You could tell the difference because of the movement that the plane had I know a plane when I see one.  I am reporting this because the object was an UFO not to make jokes what you do with the information is up to you. On August 27, 2001 I called (911) and reported the information to my police department that the airplanes were flying very low after obser! ving for a couple of weeks on my own, they informed me that it! was a b limp on Sept 11, 2001 the world trade center went down. I later found out that the direction of the plane was that of the World Trade Center. I still get chills to this day.  I don&#39;t know what the objects were but that why it is called UFOs I could not identify the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The feeling that I got from the UFO was soothing and the movement was that of something in observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first glance I thought it could be a planet but then after a few seconds it got much brighter as if it were moving toward me.  And all of a sudden it dimmed to almost unperceivable.  At that moment the object looked more like a satellite and then moved off to the south and within 10 seconds it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object was no longer visible, I saw what looked like a high altitude jet flying in the direction of where the original object flew off.  It was obviously a jet because it left a con trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible reflection from the metal skin of a jet aircraft??  Possible flare from Iridium satellite.

A large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was still fairly high at this time and was at my back.  In comparison the object would have been 1.5 times the width of the sun.  It could have been as long as a football field but what I saw at that distance looked like it took up the space a middle school spans.  Like a shopping plaza. It was white. WHITE.  It did appear to fade on the edge which was either some motion blur or reflection if it was shiny.  I can’t say it was shiny but it did appear to be somewhat reflective on the edges.  It looked a lot like a flying cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A white filter cigarette about the size of a shopping plaza passed over my area and looked like it was about two miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our entire town here is only 1.7 miles wide. The area is heavily congested with shopping districts and we are within 4miles of the turnpike. The commerce traffic up here is huge both on the ground and in the air. There are always balloons, small private planes, military stuff, black choppers all the time from Willow Grove and who knows where else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport within a mile of my home and others within two miles in neighboring towns. SOMEONE HAD TO SEE THIS.  There was heavy plane traffic all day and there usually is on nice days.  The thing that can clear this up is a pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking east on my lawn to look at one of the jets blowing one of those afterburner smoke trails traveling straight up.  My sight line at that point was looking upward more than likely 65degrees as the plane was traveling fast my gave follows it up and the cigarette either showed up or coasted into my site line and that damn thing just traveled real smooth from right to left even broke the plane of the smoke trail, no sound almost looked like it faded but I was squinting to see if this was an illusion but this thing traveled.  It did not dip, fade out, it was not smoke it did look like it could cloak itself. This is broad daylight……….. A WHITE OBJECT on a light blue sky, CLEAR day!  It could have been a giant Frisbee.  Please help me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for 30-60secs.  I don’t have the exact time of day either.  I was so glued to it I didn’t get to my watch, I hurried into the house to grab my binoculars that are by the door knowing when I came out I wouldn’t be able to locate it.  It was white.  I never would have seen it if I wasn’t looking at the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 90mins later my neighbor north of my home two doors down meets me and my girlfriend out front on the sidewalk and I asked him if he saw anything within the last two hours and he verified a cigarette traveling westbound.  His sightline was toward the south which indicates to me the object had to have made a hard left after I went into the house.  His iteration to me has the object traveling towards the highway.  When I saw the object it was traveling parallel to the highway.  Our homes are in a row and his yard is about 60 feet from mine to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background information: I am 41yo and live with my girlfriend of many years.  I have spent much of my career in print publishing and design. I manage an advertising portal site and speculate stocks.  My neighbor is a 22yo cabinet maker by trade and is an import auto enthusiast.  He’s an honest kid and lives with his family.  He had a night sighting a few weeks ago and I brushed him off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know why this place was a flap at one time.  I want and explanation from someone so I can brush it off like swamp gas or something. They fly a lot of stuff around here someone had to get a shot of it and can tell me it was a new jetliner that flies with no wings or tail and I will believe it.  Just tell me something.  Please.  I am going to the two closest airfields tomorrow and ask some questions.<n>

I have been seeing an unusual amount of falling stars lately but this time I was look for a certain constelation and saw 2 stars sitting together.  One of the &#34;stars&#34; stayed in place and eventually disappeared, but at the same time there was another &#34;star&#34; sitting right next to it and it went to the north in a steady stream across the sky.  It could NOT have been a falling star, (falling stars head &#34;south&#34;, this one went parallel.  It went across the sky for about 2 min. tops in a &#34;straight&#34; direction before it disappeared in the distant sky.  I know I could not have been the only one to see it.  I called the hotline you have twice, (twice because I didn&#39;t think I gave enough info the first time).  The star that was next to the one that I am reporting seemed to stay in place before decending backwards into the black sky.  This is not the first time I have exper! ienced something like that, I usually kept it to myself out of fear of being called &#34;nuts&#34;, but this time I know for sure what I saw and I refuse to keep quiet about it, someone else HAD to have seen it as well, if not, someone is not paying enough attention!<n>

5/24/10 21:00|St. Catharines (Canada)|ON|Fireball|5 minutes|Dazzling fireball drifts over St. Catharines|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82671.html|79|ndxe201005| Dazzling fireball drifts over St. Catharines<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on the evening of May 24, 2010 which is a national holiday (Queen Victoria’s birthday) and a traditional fireworks night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house is located on the side of the Niagara Escarpment (near the top) where we have a due north view over the city of St. Catharines to Lake Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right around 9 pm it was getting dusk and I went to the north facing window in our bedroom to see if any fireworks were starting.  A soon as I pulled up the blind, right there - less than 100 metres away - was a glowing red ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought it was a typical fireball fired from a roman candle.  Then I noticed it was hanging there; neither rising nor falling.  Within seconds a real red fireball fired from a roman candle shot into the air within 25 metres of my original ball and then fell back to earth.  Then a green fireball did the same thing.  This didn’t seem to perturb the original ball at all as it moved very slowly to the left (west) and at a slight incline (no more than 30°).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on this trajectory and pace and went behind a large tree.  At that point I went around the west side of our house and stood on my front stoop as the fireball slowly moved off. As I was standing there, pondering what it was, one of the neighbourhood kids hollered out, &#34;“Hey, look. A UFO!&#34;, and it disappeared behind trees in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball was about the size of a subway token held at arm’s length (slightly smaller than a dime).  The best description I can come up with: It dazzled, because it was more than a glow. The colour varied between a solid red to a dazzling orange/yellow.  The &#34;fire&#34; was completely contained within the ball. No rays projected beyond the edges.  If I had to estimate, I’d guess it was about the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled very serenely and was not apparently disturbed by any wind gusts.  From my perspective,  it did not make any changes in course and travelled off at a walking pace, 3 or 4 km per hour maximum. There was no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.<n>

I have seen this in several different parts of the sky as well as closer and further in distance but usually generally in the same area. I have witnessed this  on three occasions with several different people.  I am finding others have seen this as well and are questioning themselves.  Is it a star?  Is it a space ship?  Is it the space station?   WHAT IS IT?  But we have never seen a star so bright before. and its new. only a few weeks old and doesn&#39;t appear to always be there.  Is it a space ship?<n>
5/24/10 14:30|Charlestown|RI|Other|1 hour|Strange aircraft again over southern Rhode Island|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75533.html|81|ndxe201005| Strange aircraft again over southern Rhode Island<n> <n><n> <n><n> While resting at East Beach in Charlestown, RI, at the above date and time, enjoying a beautiful clear blue sky and warm sun, I noticed a twin engine plane, with rows of windows on each side, and having pods at the wing tips (fuel?), white in color, flying a continuous loop over the beach, circling, slowly, then going away to the west, but coming right back.  I thought this continuous pattern of low flying, low level observation, was odd, especially after the fourth time of it flying right over me.  The beach was almost unpopulated, it being a Monday, and it being a very long 3 mile stretch of beach, and I was down about a quarter mile, away from most people at the entrance.  So, there were about fifty people on the beach but all but me and three other people were at the entrance.  I had my binoculars with me, so I decided to get a close up of the plane as it kept flying directly over me in its circling.  I first noticed no FAA identifying markings of any ki! nd on it...no numbers or letters, etc. I saw only one small blinking red light at the tip of the rear &#39;fin&#39; (aeleron?), and then I noticed a conspicuous large dark spot, like an oval camera lens, on the underside of the fuselage behind the wings.  I then thought this was some kind of secret government plane taking photos.  The plane continued its pattern of circling over the beach where I was, so I decided to leave and head for my trunk in the parking lot.  The plane made another pass, this time right over me in the parking lot, whereupon I took out my binoculars again to get another close look....while looking at the bottom of the &#39;plane&#39; I was shocked to see a quick flash of green light, very bright, come from what I thought previously was a camera lens!  This quick flash of green light was directed toward me, as if they were letting me know that they saw me, and maybe even were reading my thoughts.  It freaked me out, as I said, &#39;oh my God.&#39;  It was so unnatural a thing ! that it did.  This  was no ordinary plane by any means, but a ! craft ma squerading as a twin engine plane, but having a whole different propulsion and technology, as in the green light underneath.  There were no wing tip lights or any thing which I thought should be on a registered FAA plane.  It made a sound very similar to a prop plane, but different.  The windows were all blacked out, including the cockpit windows.  I then left in my truck and drove to Walmart about 5 miles away.  After shopping for a half hour I decided to go back to the beach parking lot to see if the &#39;plane&#39; was still there in its same circling pattern, and it was!  It flew a couple hundred feet above the shoreline, then circled over the salt pond in back of the beach, headed West again, and then repeated this pattern, over and over...nothing normal about it.  This is just one more strange aircraft sighting in this area.  My belief is that aliens are masquerading their craft as jets, passenger jets, and small prop/commuter planes like this one.  The strange &#39;camera&#39; spot/l! ens that flashed bright green at me while I was looking at it through the binoculars was the strangest event, and a bit intimidating...maybe that was &#39;their&#39; intent.  Something very strange in going on in southern Rhode Island...very strange.  By the way, the flashing green light did not emit a beam that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I couldn&#39;t get the size of them but they seemed to be traveling fast I&#39;d say something around 400 hundred miles an hour.but the clouds were going fast from east to west from Molokai to Oahu and the spheres were traveling from north to south.  But then all at the same time and when no clouds were near them they just disappeared then after a few seconds they reappeared and then again gone then very clearly reappeared .  I&#39;d guess altitude was 4to5 k ft,I was 82nd and jumped for years sport jumping as well so I think I know altitudes.then 5 min.1 more came into view and this one was small same direction.then I saw a friend who I told and he didn&#39;t say much,then again this time 3 more ,same direction all small then gone into the clouds. I tol! d my friend &#34;look there 3 of them right there&#34; but he said he had bad eyes.  just like turning the off switch of there cloaking device twice and then left it on.cool.I can&#39;t stop watching the sky.<n>

5/23/10 23:45|Rolling Meadows|IL|Circle|5 minutes|We saw a circular object flying low in sky with 3 bright blue rotating lights, and it was silent.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75563.html|85|ndxe201005| We saw a circular object flying low in sky with 3 bright blue rotating lights, and it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, May 23, 2010, my friend and I were standing in his driveway talking, on Jay Lane in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.  It was approximately 11:45pm.  I glanced up at the sky and I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane, flying in the southern sky, heading north.  The first thing that caught my eye was three, bright blue lights, almost the color of the lights on a black light.  I pointed this out to my friend, and he noticed how unusual the object looked also.  It was flying low enough that if it were an airplane, you would definitely be able to hear it; however this craft was completely silent. It was then that we realized this was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately called my cousin and his two friends outside to look at the UFO. The five of us ran behind the house into the St. Collette church field. The three blue lights were flashing on and off, about every 3 seconds or so. When they were off, we could clearly make out the shape of the UFO.  It was a dark, circular shape. As the lights came back on, they were rotated, as if the UFO was slowly spinning.  We tried to get pictures of the object on our cell phones, but apparently it was too dark out and the UFO was too far away to get the shot, which was really frustrating.  We watched the UFO flying south for approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the UFO was almost out of our view, about to go behind some clouds, all five of us noticed that it appeared to quickly move upward in a diagonal direction, and then move back down, as if it were making an upside-down “v”.  About 30 seconds after that, the UFO was out of our view.  Although we are not sure the size of the UFO, since we don’t know exactly how high up it was flying, it appeared to be at least the size of small airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For thirty minutes I witnessed a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Mt. Pocono area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around the NJ/PA border, I spotted a star as I faced west and a light approximately a hand’s distance below that star.  The light appeared to be red and green from afar, so I assumed it was an aircraft of some sort.  As I drove approximately for thirty minutes or so, I noticed that the light just above the horizon was getting brighter and larger.  As I came upon the intersection between W-80 and 380-N, I noticed that the craft was to my left (south of the W-80 road).  It appeared twice the size of a full moon, approximately 9-10 building stories above the ground, hovering.  It was very large in appearance.  At the time, the sun was setting so I had a little light to make out the bulk of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed metallic in appearance, and seemed to have vertical metallic grooves going down the sides.  The object was dreidel or cross-shaped and had white lights on the upper, lower, right and left extremities.  It also had a red light in the middle of the craft.  There were also some blinking green lights along the top of the craft.  The craft emitted no sound, nor did it move.  I was close enough to make out the silhouette of the craft in the dim of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was reflecting the sun`s light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it could have been a satellite visible from the ground but it was changing position very fast....My wife saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while it disappeared and I was thinking that thing was probably a ufo and it was a shame I did not have my camera with me when suddenly another different one appeared it much lower in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a bit scared and I tried to see and understand the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was black not circular. I would say “squared”  with different sections with one part in red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still I did not have my camera. I thought if I would have gone upstairs I might have lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I`ve runned upstairs  and when I went down it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I see ufos everyday. Today the 31st of May 2010 I saw another different shaped one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was triangular with lights on the angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to take pictures but I don`t know why the images are not good at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe I do something wrong with the automatic focus? Now I start thinking to buy a camcorder with a good zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment I use a binocular.<n>
5/23/10 02:15|Dallas|TX|Disk|10 seconds|UFO|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75540.html|89|ndxe201005| Ok, first of all I want to say that I DO NOT wish to gain popularity, money, fame, etc. from this, all I want is to let everyone know that there are very mysterious things going on and I wish I could know exactly what.  I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don’t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends’ birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said “Look” to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn’t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n’t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren’t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don’t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn’t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don’t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn’t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is “something” out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn&#39;t shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I’m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to &#34;look&#34; they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t even think about it.  I will go there again and try to capture some proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I see this large, slow moving UFO that has balls of lights at each end of the UFO(N,S,E,W) and one in the middle of the UFO that was flashing. It was a really dark figure and it was about 60 ft above the ground, which is very low for any type of plane. I would say it was going about 15 mph ground speed. Many other people heard it, but didnt know what it was. I am one of the few that actually saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved slowly south, then shifted direction west. Couldn&#39;t have been too far from the ground and just lifted. Stayed in the sky for about 5 minutes, maybe more.  Got smaller which I&#39;m guessing was going higher up, and split into 3 lights, forming a triangle... orange lights.  It floated for another minute I&#39;d say before It dimmed in and out, then to just disappear. 8 witnesses.  Maybe a few more across the canal who were in their back yard.<n>

If you looked across the bay, you could see the Texas City Refinery Plant on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking to use the ladies room in the parking lot, I looked over the bay and saw what I thought was a fire trailing up towards his side.  I called out to him to look above his head and tell me if he saw the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it was a bag blowing upwards with a fire inside (like the kind used at a Thai wedding or something).  It was so windy that night; I knew that had to be ridiculous, so I called out to see if he saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and two others, fishing at the end of the pier saw the orange glowing object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a dark object with a series of bright orange lights on the side.  I do not want to make an observation on the shape of it because all I could tell was that it seemed to be an object and I could only see what I thought looked like a half moon set of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It floated left to right (from my vantage point), hovered for a few moments and then faded from bright orange to nothing.  Total duration seemed to be approximately 60-90 seconds total before fading out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought they were helicopters, but we quickly noticed that they were too high up to be helicopters.  The lights were a bright orange/red and were moving in irregular patterns from a south to north direction.  One of them stopped.  Another one sped up past it, and then slightly changed direction. The last one continued its speed and eventually all the lights “went out” starting with the one that stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights went out we were all trying to figure out what we just witnessed.  We live 5 minutes away from Hopkins airport, these were not planes.  Not helicopters.  There was no starboard or starlight, the lights were not blinking it was solid.  This was nothing any of us have ever seen. The thought of it being an asteroid was brought up, but there was no trail left behind in the sky, and they were changing directions and speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An older couple pulled over to the side of the street and confirmed that they have “never seen anything remotely close to these lights in over 60 years of living in Cleveland, OH.”  The actual amount of time we witnessed the lights was not longer then 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later we saw another light, a single one moving slower then the previous.  It started to change direction and head east.  Within a minute of watching, the light “went out.” I could still see the shape of it through the clouds.  It appeared to be large, dark, and round.  I tried to follow it for as long as I could but when I blinked it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called into FOX8 News to see if they knew what it was, and they told us that they were following it from Lakewood, OH and that they didn’t know what it was.  I have no doubt in my mind that what I witnessed was beyond anything I have ever seen.<n>

They seemed to move independently, and moved in different directions and different speeds. They were also different sizes which I guess was to do with distance, some must have started to come closer as they were getting bigger, some getting smaller and dimmer. Over time they seemed to go out of visable range, getting smaller/dimmer before dispearing into the horizon, or shooting up into the sky. A few minutes later there seemed to be 3 more launch off from the ground into the sky, these were in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually they all disappeared, but over the course of the next 20mins, more were seen, to be moving around the sky. My guess is they would be over the Clipstone or Ollerton region of Nottinghamshire, England.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a few blurry photos, and a movie, but as there from my mobile phone there not great.... but they do show 2/3 orange firey balls launching off into the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked home about 20 minutes later, and the sky seemed to have 3 or 4 low flying jet type aircraft, possibly military in nature. This is unusual as we are not in any normal aeroplane flight path. Also as we walked home my sister called me saying she saw another going across the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the 1st time I have seen weird firey orange lights in the sky moving at high speeds with sudden direction changes... I saw one quite close back in Nov 2007... This time though, the fiery balls were witnessed by 5 different people including adults and a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 other sightings of the same objects all over England were also witnessed, accounts of these are on<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.uk-ufo.co.uk/<n>

It looked like a satellite, or star, but then it started to change directions.  Almost like a goldfish swimming in a tank.  Not fast moving.  The movements were very subtle.  It was too high to be any known aircraft and too low to be a star.  The object was situated about northwest of the position of the moon around 10:05pm PST.  While I was staring at it I did happen to see a satellite passing through.  The satellite was moving at a constant speed and one direction.  This object would move then stop for a moment then started moving again.  It did this several times.  Also a bright blue flash occurred around the same time the two objects came close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to grab my cousin to confirm what I was seeing. Just to make sure it wasn&#39;t my mind playing tricks. He too witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/22/10 21:24|Lee's Summit|MO|Triangle|10 minutes|Black triangle in Lee's Summit, MO near Lake Jacomo|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75509.html|101|ndxe201005| Black triangle in Lee&#39;s Summit, MO near Lake Jacomo<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 17 year old daughter and I were on our way to my oldest son’s home at approximately 9:24 p.m. on May 22, 2010. We were driving west on Colburn Road heading toward Highway 291 in Lee’s Summit, MO. The sky was clear to partly cloudy and there was little or no wind. There is a small airport near Colburn Road on Douglas Road in Lee’s Summit and I often watch the planes come and go while driving that strip of road. Tonight I was watching what I thought was a plane. The object had one red light and two white lights, pretty typical of the small planes which fly out of the tiny airport, except none of the lights on this plane were flashing like they usually do. I did not think anything of this because many times when a plane is coming at me head on, I cannot see the flashing tail light. As I got closer to the object I realized it was not a plane. The object was in the west heading east. I was driving west on Colburn Road. We had just passed Lake Jacomo and were i! n the outskirts of Lee’s Summit. As I got closer and finally under the object I looked up and realized the object was a black triangle and not a plane. It was completely black except for the three lights. I am an educated person who has a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Counseling. I am aware of the Gestalt Theories and this was not my brain “filling in” lines. The sky blackened and there was no background filter light between the three lights on the object as it flew past me. The object was flying low and the night sky was not yet completely dark so I was able to get a very good look at it. I said something to my daughter who then looked at it and got very excited exclaiming, “I see it mom it is a triangle! I see it! I see it!” My next thought was it was a B2 bomber because Whiteman Air Force Base is only about 45 minutes away. However, as low as the object was flying it definitely was not a B2 because it was way too small. I have seen those fl! y around our area quite often and they are huge, especially wh! en flyin g low. I asked my daughter if she could track it, and she said she could. I made a u-turn to try and follow the object so I could get ahead of it and stop the car to get a really good look at it while standing still and hopefully take a picture on my cell phone. Unfortunately I lost the object in the street lights when I started heading east. While I was driving west the lights had been on the north side as I looked west. I was basically looking away from the lights and they were on my right side, which was the passenger side of the car. Now that I was driving east, the lights were shining in my eyes on the driver’s side of the car and I could not see the object anymore. However, my daughter still had the object in her sight and I followed it as she guided me. Then as I approached the intersection of 7 Highway and Colburn Road, my daughter stated the object had suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared into some clouds. We lost the object and I was unable to get! a really good look at it while standing still. I don’t know if anyone else witnessed this object in Lee’s Summit tonight and I don’t know exactly what it was. I can only say what it was not. It was not a B2 Bomber because it was too small; and it was not one of the small planes that fly out of the municipal airport in Lee’s Summit because I have never seen any of those planes make that triangle shape. I drive that area daily and nightly to and from work and school and I have lived here for 10 years. I have seen planes come and go from that tiny municipal airport day and night and none of the planes have ever made the triangle shape I saw tonight. Though I am a believer in UFO’s, whenever I observe anything in the sky I do so with a very skeptical mindset. I always think of all possibilities before saying what I saw was “unexplained.” Tonight I honestly cannot think of anything that is as small as the object I saw and makes the shape of the black triangle which I saw in the! sky earlier this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving from my left across the road I was on.  It was very low and at first I thought it was a helicopter circling towards the hospital.  But there was no blinking lights. Just a bright orange glow.  There was absolutely no sound from the object. Instead of making a left to where I wanted to go, I continued straight towards the light.  As I got closer I couldn&#39;t believe that it was like a flame with a glow around it, floating across the sky.  Flickering and moving straight across the sky at a steady speed. I quickly made a right into a parking lot so I could stop and watch it.  There was another car there with a guy standing with one leg still in his car, also watching it.  It was extremely windy that night, but the flame continued at a steady pace. It seemed to stop at one point and hover.  Then it began to move at a steep angl! e and disappeared into the clouds.  I sat there for several minutes stunned, trying to figure out what I had just seen.<n>

It could not have been an airplane because there was no flashing. The lights were not so bright that I could not see well, but bright enough to notice from 2 miles away. I stopped to look and from its original SE heading it turned, going NE. While turning it pitched about 70 degrees and I saw three lights. These three lights made me report this as a triangle shape from their position in respect to each other. The light that I did not see until it turned was slightly red in color. I could not see the body for it must have been transparent. I only saw the dark blue sky behind it. After turning, I could not see it because it went behind a tree. From that point, I did not see it again. I went around the area and noticed aircraft, probably United States air force, moving around. There were at least 3 of these, which is very unusual for one area in the country. The planes did not appear to be chasing the UFO, b! ut rather as if searching for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling from West to East. I started seeing if above UCSF and ended, I guess, somewhere above the Bay.  The flight was not very stable (oscillating on its axis) but was flying very fast.  It was faster than planes taking off from SFO which can be seen from our place.<n>

As we were leaving to come home, I saw 25-30 circular lights in the sky overhead.  Instantaneously, and only for a second, I thought there must be some type of fireworks show going on.  However, the lights did not disappear.  At this point, I did not believe there was anything other-worldly about them (I just thought it was unusual and I wanted to see what these things were).  I pulled the car into the nearest stop (a Hess gas station).  My 2 children and I got out of the car and saw what now only seemed to be about 10 -15 fireballs in the sky directly over our head.  I knew then that this was something spectacular as these fireballs seem to move deliberately in pairs of two or three and at a very slow pace.  They emitted no sound, but they definitely moved in patterns that were not random and there was an ebb and flow to their movement.  Again, all these fireballs see! med to be grouped together in packs of 2 or 3 and seemed to be interacting with one another.  As they went over our head, they seemed to suddenly disappear.  By the time I got my I-phone out to take a video, only a couple remained in the sky.  I will send that video to you so you can get an idea of their movement, but unfortunately they appear smaller in the video than what we saw with our own eyes.  The entire sighting took less than 5 minutes, and by the end of the 5 minutes, both my children were very scared.  I was not (in fact, I felt incredibly blessed to have witnessed something I believed was very special), but we quickly got back in the car and headed home as I did not want to unnecessarily frighten my children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the news that night looking for a report on what I saw (I even suspected there might be some breaking news on it as this was over downtown Raleigh, a very public place).  However, there was no mention of it.  I even e-mailed my video to the local weather guy (a friend of mine), but he did not comment on it.  I just let it go until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM tell the listeners to report something even it is was several years ago.  So that is what I am doing here.  Again, I will also send that video to you right now.<n>

Luckily we were in the right place, at the right time.<n>

I have been watching them for over 20 minutes, and they have not faded or disappeared.   I don&#39;t see any aircraft, just three lights made foggy by the cloud cover.  They are moving very fast, going out in three directions and then briefly converging.<n>

We live near the Riverside Airport, so we always see helicopters, commercial airplanes and jets fly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:34-36ish at night, I&#39;m looking up at the night sky taking a drag when I notice a twinkling, moving light.  Thinking it&#39;s probably a plane or chopper, I just kept watching the sky. But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother&#39;s attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was &#34;Oh my G-d!&#34; and &#34;Look!&#34;.  My mother didn&#39;t see anything except the larger twinkling light.  From what I can recall she was either staring at me to try and understand what I was saying or behind me putting something away in the backyard.  I wouldn&#39;t call her a witness because 1) she wasn&#39;t looking at the sky and 2) she wears triple-lense reading glasses and we were outside in the dark with no lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would call myself an observer.  Every-night I look into the night sky.  Every time we&#39;re on a road trip to Vegas, I see at least five shooting stars on the way there and back.  When I was three months pregnant with my boy, I saw what I believe today to have been a comet.  But what I saw about an hour and a half ago was nothing like this.  It was just so surreal, I almost had an anxiety attack.  Funny thing is, now there&#39;s a bunch of loud choppers flying over my house, there&#39;s been at least three already.  Whoever is reading this may choose to swallow it with a grain of salt, but only those who saw it too can vouch for me.<n>

These lights covered approx. SSW to WSW from my location and appeared stationary the whole time until I lost them.  I&#39;m hoping to find others who saw them since this is very close to I35 and they could have been visible from there.<n>

As we returned after our walk we sat in the back of his pickup truck and into the cloudy sky.  Towards the Eastern Horizon, just north of the city of Findlay, we spotted a bright light darting back and forth. The object would move at different speeds and changed directions north and south instantly. It also seemed to change altitudes as it proceeded towards where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached closer to our position it fell to a lower altitude and maintained a steady speed and direction westward.  We then could see that it was in the shape of a triangle.  When the object was above it you could see a white spotlight shining through the low stratus clouds pointing strait ahead of it, and a row of four pulsating red lights on either side.  I can estimate that it was less than a football field above us and made no noise.  Judging by the ! trees around us, it was probably about 20 feet across, an equilateral triangle.  As it passed overhead the rear of the object consisted of four red lights that stayed a constant brightness in the pattern of a square.  As it proceeded west it instantly increased speed and flew out of sight of us.<n>

I am interested in astronomy and know a little about stars and planets.  This was no star or planet that I know of and seemed unusual because it was so very bright.  It was moving very slowly to the west northwest.  Through binoculars, flashing green, amber and red lights were noted. No shape could be seen as it was dark and only the lights were visible.  There was no sound but that could have been because of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that the lights were changing color, and maybe changing configuration although it was difficult to tell because of the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched for a while, then my husband went in the house and I stayed and watched until it disappeared behind the tree line.<n>

The entire event lasted a few seconds.  When I saw the light first appear I was going to comment to my husband so he could see it but it disappeared and then reappeared and then disappeared again before I could even get the words out.  The sky was very overcast that night.  I couldn’t see any stars or the moon.  I told my husband I thought I just saw my first UFO.<n>

I immediately looked out my window and saw a sphere. I ran for my digital camera/video recorder and started filming.  I recorded a white, round light/sphere moving away from my location in a northwest trajectory for several minutes and could still see the object between the trees until I finally had to give up due to trees blocking my view at about 12:39am.  The object did not move vertically or horizontally or change color, but did seem to &#39;flicker&#39; in light intensity a little.  This time of year the night sky is still quite light and no stars or satelite lights are visible.   Also, in this area we get an abundance of air traffic of many types including helicopters, small planes, military, and commercial at high altitudes, and this &#34;UFO&#34; did not fit any of these.  No tail was seen immediately behind the object as I have seen on meteors or meteorites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the object on video and am willing to release it to your organization, but seem to be unable with dial-up internet.<n>

There were no visual obstructions and no wind.  After watching it for approx 5-6 min there were 2 smaller flashes of light that came from the bottom of it and then would disappear.  The object would hover for a little longer then it would vanish.   This ritual happend 3 times in the course of approx 40 min. Besides myself there were 2 other witnesses. There were various aircraft to be within the vicinity as well.<n>

As we turned west on rt. 78/24 we could see clearly that it was outlined in very large white circles of light around an irregular triangle. The body was pale green light and above and below the triangle was a shimmering red light.  It made no sound and hung in the air about 10-12 minutes that we saw it.   It was low--maybe 600 feet high  and very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the roadside 4 motorcycles were parked and the drivers were standing watching it.

5/20/10 21:00|Aransas Pass|TX|Light|2.5 hours|I saw floating lights dissapear and reappear many times over widespread areas going slowly west.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75529.html|124|ndxe201005| I saw floating lights dissapear and reappear many times over widespread areas going slowly west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:46 PM 5/23/2010 Aransas Pass, Tx, 78336   At 9:00 pm on 5/20/2010,Thursday, I was at my home, sitting on my front porch. At the time I was working on a song that I had been writing, using a handheld synthesizer.  The sky had been mostly clear all day, but it was beginning to get a little cloudy. I needed to urinate badly, so I got up and walked to the side of our property and began my bussiness. It was then that I noticed that the moon was becoming extremely bright, so bright that I began worry that someone might see me, and become offended.  I then noticed that the light that was shining so brightly was not the moon at all, the moon being white in color.  This was yellow, so close to the color of a street light, that I thought for a brief moment that maybe someone had installed a telephone pole and street light in our yard.  That ridiculous notion was taken from me when the &#34;street light&#34; began to slowly move in the direction of the clouds.  The light had been so close to the ground that it had eclipsed the moon, but as it moved, I could see the moon again.  The light then seemed to shrink in on itself, not unlike a dimmer switch connected to a light bulb.  It startled me to the point that I had forgotten I was still indecently exposed.  As I stood there, mouth agape, I was starled yet again. This time it was bone chilling.  As a hole in the clouds opened up, I saw the night sky clearly. The stars were easy to see, and were clearly stationary, because the clouds were moving very fast, but the stars were remaining still.  But what startled me was the sheer number of yellow stars.  They were moving in the same direction as the clouds, and these &#34;yellow stars&#34; were above the clouds, because they would be covered up by the clouds as they moved.  It occured to me then, that the yellow lights were in our atmosphere, because they were much clearer to see than the stars.  I know they were just above the clouds, because some of them were doing what I had seen the first one I noticed doing. They  looked like they would have been part of the star field, but they were too many and too clearly observed. To be honest, I thought that we were being invaded. I know, I know, I watch alot of movies, but this was the real thing! I was honestly scared, and I figured that maybe I had better go tell my loved ones that I love them.  I was a little shaky as I ran inside to get my brother and mother. I got into the door, and stopped, realizing the enormity of what I was about to say to them. My mother looked at me expectantly, knowing somehow, that I had some important news. At this point I thought, if they are going to think I&#39;m going crazy, then I&#39;m going to force this on them, instead of just telling them. So I said,&#34; Mom, you have to help me now!&#34;  Then I turned, and ran out the front door. They followed me, but when they saw the lights, they came up short.  There were dozens, maybe hundreds, above the clouds, and they would show up in the dozens below the clouds.  However, when they would show up below the clouds, it seemed that they were there already, but not shining. Then the light would intensify,  sustain, then dim. Sometimes they would just dissapear into a cloud, and would actually &#34;burn&#34; holes in the clouds. I then called my grandma, my best friends, my other friends. Several of my friends were in different places, a couple miles away, but when they went outside, they were amazed. Many people saw these lights, and I think many people are afraid to admit it. I was just watching them, when three jets came roaring in a speeds much faster than lights were moving. The lights did not appear to flee. Instead, they just dimmed down, until you could not see them. They would appear in different intervals in many different places, only to dissapear again. After that there were helicopters flying in really low. They could not get near a light, but it was clear that the pilots were aware of the lights, and desired to close in on them. But it was the same thing as with the jets.By this time there were very few showing up close to the! ground, instead they all seemed to slowly move on to the west! . At abo ut eleven  o&#39;clock, I had decided to get the little camera we have. I was waiting for another to come  low enough to photograph, but I had to settle for one that was actually at a high altitude. As I took the picture, and the flash went off, the camera died from loss of power. It was probably only coincidence, but the wireless internet at my house was knocked out of service at that exact moment. Upon recharging the camera, I found no picture recorded. That is too bad. I was so excited about seeing these things, that I lost my priorities. Next time I see anything like that, I&#39;m going to have a camera waiting.<n>

I honestly thought it was a 747 making a crash landing on Woodward Ave,  it was that big!  This is in a highly populated area so surely someone else saw this thing.  I thought it might possibly be a blimp, but after checking around the web, there are no events where you might find a blimp in this area.  Also, I&#39;ve never seen a blimp move at that rate of speed.  This was at 7:15 PM, still very sunny outside at that time of day.<n>

THE SKY WAS CLOUDLESS AND DEEP BLUE, WITH A STEADY 8-10 MPH WIND FROM THE SOUTH.  I HAD JUST SET UP CAMP AND WAS GETTING ORGANIZED WHILE I WAITED FOR MY WIFE AND SON TO JOIN ME FROM GLEN BURNIE, MD.  I NOTICED SOME COLORFUL KITES ALOFT IN NEIGHBORING CAMP LOOPS AND WATCHED THEM FOR A WHILE.  I GLANCED OUT TO THE DUNES FACING EAST LISTENING TO THE CONSTANT CRASH OF THE WAVES, WHEN I NOTICED THE OBJECT IN THE NE SKY, OUT OVER THE SHORELINE.  MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT SOMEONE WAS FLYING A KITE ON THE BEACH, BUT THAT THOUGHT QUICKLY ENDED WHEN I SENSED THE OBJECT MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD, AGAINST THE WIND.  I GRABBED MY WW2 7X50 FIELD GLASSES FROM THE TRUCK AND EXAMINED THE OBJECT NOTING IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH BOTH ENDS FACING THE ATLANTIC.  IT REMINDED ME OF A DARK GRAY CRAYON WITH A BLUNT END. AT THIS TIME I BECAME AWARE THAT THE THING BECAME STRAIGHT LOOKING EXACTLY L!

AFTER A MOMENT HE WAS ALSO ASTOUNDED TO WITNESS SUCH AN UNRECOGNIZABLE WHATEVERITWAS. WE WATCHED IT TOGETHER FOR A SPELL AND I RETURNED TO MY SITE.  NOW THE CRAYON WAS DIRECTLY EAST, EASILY VIEWABLE BY AYONE LOOKING TO THE OCEAN, AND VERY EXPLICIT AND VIVID WITH MY TRUSTY GLASSES.  SOMETIMES THE BRIGHT SUN GLINTED OFF THE LEADING PORTION AND SIDE OF THIS THING.  I TRIED TO PHOTOGRAPH IT BUT MY CAMERA WAS INADEQUATE, AND LATER SAW THE OBJECT VERY SMALL IN THE PICTURES. ESTIMATED ALTITUDE AT THE CLOSEST POINT WAS 4-5000 FEET, VERY APPROXIMATE AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO, MOVING 20-30 MPH MAYBE.  IT WAS IN SITE FOR 30 MINUTES AND FINALLY CONTINUED SOUTHWARD, AND GOT HIGHER UNTIL I COULDN’T SEE ANY LONGER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT A GREAT DAY IT WAS!

I looked up to the point of that sound and saw four chemtrails, very obvious and very high in the sky, all close together, as if from one plane with four jet engines.  Through my binoculars I saw, rather, four tiny objects extremely close to one another producing these enormous chemtrails.  The objects, of what I can say were chevron shaped, and silver, traveled at a faster pace than an airliner, heading SW, and at an altitude,  I would guess, of 15 to 20 thousand feet.   What struck me as very odd was the precision of these four small craft and the much larger chemtrails they produced.  They were so precise in there close proximity to one another and produced identical chemtrails that it appeared to be one object, like the four engined jet that I first thought it was.  However, I did see through the binoculars that they were four distinct objects.  The only time I have ever seen this procession was from watching the Blue Angels air show in Rhode Island many years ago.  There has been a lot of strange air traffic in Rhode Island recently and this only adds to it.<n>

I say this because they came into view as I was looking toward the back fence which runs parallel with a street that runs in an East/west direction. One light was in front of the other but not in a straight line like single file, they were slightly offset from one another. They stayed the same distance apart. The speed remained steady. They did not zigzag or bounce around, or waver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound from the lights as they passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t decipher any definate shape to the objects. The edges . They were diffused or hazy; the same way street lights or headlights appear to me, with a kind of halo effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be going slow but in reality they had to be going fast as they disappeared out of sight within seconds. Because we live on the outskirts of the flight path of an international airport and airplanes pass over all the time I&#39;d say they were considerably faster than any airplanes I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s kind of hard to judge the size of the objects as there was nothing relative to compare the size with, but I&#39;d say they were at least as large as a commercial airplane, maybe larger.<n>

Half way down the drive way, I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky which quickly turned into two lights. Then to the right of the lights another one appeared, then two or three more on the right side.  The lights were almost in a hooking pattern like they were around a disc-shaped aircraft.  Quickly, almost the exact same thing happened to the right of the first set of lights.  One light turned into two then quickly into five or six. It was way too big to be a plane.  The lights were not as high up in the sky as a plane would be. The lights were also too far apart to be anything like a plane.  It was like they were lights on a disc-shaped aircraft.  I immediately picked up my phone and tried to call someone else who lives in my house (this is how I know it was at 10:43pm), then panicked and drove my car as fast as I could down my drive-way and into my garage, jumped out of my car without even! turning my lights off and ran inside to wake someone up. I was terrified.  I was so scared that I couldn&#39;t speak for two or three minutes. I ran back outside to look back up into the sky and they were gone.  I was shaking bad for about thirty minutes. I continued to shake the rest of the night and had goose bumps for hours afterward.  I have never believed in this sort of thing and it really shook me up.  I have never been anything even close to as scared as I was for that night.  I was shaking the rest of the night and ended up sleeping with my lights on, afraid to go back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there is no way this could have been any sort of star (they was too close and were bright yellow), aircraft (they were too close and appeared out of nowhere), or any thing else that I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  It was too far up to be any kind of animal and too close and big to be any type of aircraft I have ever seen.<n>

He described them as red and blue lights moving back and forth like a kite (they saw it from 10-10:13pm prior to calling me @ 10:13). At approximately 10:13pm on May 19, 2010 I looked out the back window of my house and saw four red lights lined up horizontally, they were stationary at this point.  They had an LED look to them, very bright and focused points of light, not beams.  I immediately told the two friends I had at my house with me to come outside and see it.  When we came out it was gone, but there were many helicopters in the air circling (at least three).  Then the four red lights came back into view as they quickly moved straight upwards from behind the buildings directly to my West until they were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, at this moment the object transformed instantly from four red lights into one slightly larger blue light and headed in the exact oppos! ite direction straight down.  The change in color, direction and number of objects seen happened simultaneously and it appeared to move sharply with no acceleration or deceleration and did not seems to make any noise.  The four red lights from end to end were approximately two to three times as wide as the moon was from my vantage point and the blue light was about a third as wide as the moon.  I was located at Nutmeg Avenue and Lexington Street in Sarasota, FL facing between W and WNW.  My friends who called me were standing at Superior Avenue and Gulf Gate Drive in Sarasota facing directly North, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon from their point of view.  The helicopters that were in the sky circled this area for about twenty to thirty minutes after we last saw the lights.  Afterwards, I called every news station in town and they all confirmed that they either did not own a helicopter or it was grounded at the time.  I also contacted the County Sheriff’s Departme! nt and they confirmed that they did not have their helicopter ! in the a ir.  I called everyone again the next day (5/20/10) and asked if they would confirm that they had no helicopters in the air at that time.  They all confirmed.  Next I called Air Traffic Control at the Sarasota International Airport, they said that they knew of nothing, but gave me the FAA Flight Standards contact information.  After asking about the helicopters, I explained my story to them.  About an hour later I received a call back from the FAA, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful but could not give me any answers.  He suggested I contact NUFORC at that point.  That leaves me with two lingering questions: 1) What did we see? 2) Whose helicopters were in the air, why were they there and what do they know about the events we witnessed?<n>

I was on my way home from the store and my daughter,who is 5yrs. old, said she made a wish on the wishing star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the star she was pointing at I noticed that it was not the planet Venus, which was the largest star besides the moon in the sky and in the wrong place, it wasn&#39;t a star at all.  It was just a very large, very bright light hanging low in the sky.  I was driving home about 10 minutes though open fields and in a large valley which you can see the mountains in the distance.  I kept it in view as much as I could, it was very low to the ground and varied in its brightness, but I couldn&#39;t get a good look at the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached our road, I realized that it was hovering somewhere around my house, so I turned in my lane and when I got back to the house it was over the woods directly behind my house. I got my camera and took a few still pics with the! night vision.  I would have taken video but my disc was full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I watched it for several more minutes and talked to my husband on the phone outside while watching it and then after we hung up I decided to get back in the car and try to get a better look at it on the next road over, because it was dancing behind the trees.  I took my daughter and we rode to the next road over, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a fly through area and we get lots of planes and aircraft, but nothing like this. It was silent and very bright, much brighter and closer to the ground than a star could ever be. Im not sure what it was. I hope someone else saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

I could see a very bright object coming thru the night sky just above tree-line. My wife was very excited and said one just shot off overhead before the other one got to us.  The object stopped almost in front of us as it pulsated dark orange to light orange.  It seemed to be shaped vertical with 3 evenly spaced enlarged areas.  No sound was heard.  They seemed to move slowly at first but disappeared very quickly.  We were able to watch them for about 15 minutes.<n>

When I returned I looked for it in the same area and found it again, I proceeded to take several pictures with my 300mm zoom.  I am afraid the pictures are still fuzzy but the object is clearly visible, then the craft shot out another object which flew away from it at great speed the main craft then left the area slowly and I lost track of it!<n>

When we both looked out, we saw a strange black triangle shape craft flying slow in the sky above our house. It had three white lights on each of the corners and a big red light in the middle that flashed in a slow pattern. I looked through  binoculars and saw another small tiny shape that looked exactly like the black traingle except it glowed with all red lights. It looked like it was following the big triangle on the right side of it. We also thought we saw another white orb/craft that was also following it on the left side. It made a low, sound that sounded nothing like an airplane - almost quieter. These three crafts were moving and curving very slowly. Then, suddenly, they all simultaneously zoomed quickly out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Retired now, a gold prospector with the time to fulfill my quest for the big nugget, my thoughts then were of gold and only gold…that was about to change.  Just about midnight and just South of the middle of nowhere, I had stopped and pulled off the road to relieve myself and take a break from driving, and it was at this moment that I first saw what I thought to be a helicopter with a bright searchlight circling the area southwest of me.  Having served with the U.S.A.F., I have seen many types of aircraft, but this was something I had never seen before. It was a red light intermittently beaming a brilliant, focused white light down to the ground as if to be looking for someone or something, and I thought what or who would be way out there, and why there were no strobe I.D. lights on the helicopter.  I didn’t ! give it much more thought and got back in the car and grabbed a cigarette, lit up and gazed back towards the southwest. The chopper was now circling closer to me and although my window was down, there was no noise…and I thought that was really strange.  Suddenly, what I thought was a helicopter flying at 500 feet was much smaller and much closer; in fact, it was now just on the other side of the road and was about 10 feet off the ground, hovering. I flicked the cigarette out the window.  I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. Am I hallucinating? “What the ____ is that?” My heart beating fast and my mind spinning, I watched as the object as it moved through the sparse vegetation, stopping now and then to illuminate the ground beneath with its powerful beam of white light, and then it appeared to morph into two tiny red lights, like twin LED’s (light emitting diodes) and started to cross the road towards me.  Now as it approached my car, it suddenly morphed back into its former shape:  a spherical orb about the size of a softball, bright red (DOT emergency red, like a tail-light).  Was this military?  Is this a living organism? Perhaps an alien probe?  It was now six feet in front of my car, four feet off the ground, just hovering. What the ____is this thing???  Somehow, I don’t think it’s military…no stars, insignia or guns…(chuckle) I noticed that although the red light emitted from this thing was very bright to my eyes, it wasn’t casting shadows and did not reflect from the surrounding bushes or from the polished surface of my hood.  I could see the surface of this thing seemed to be fluid-   like, and composed of what appeared to be millions of tiny dots of light swirling around very fast and was very hard for my eyes to focus on it.  The perimeter seemed to fuzz out at the edges, like an aura or halo.  The light seemed to be luminous rather than projected, and was not radiating any heat that I could feel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s amazing what goes through your head when confronted with an un-known like this… a memory of Dr. XXXXXXXX of  S.E.T.I. explaining that most UFO sightings are mostly swamp gas or weather balloons…Hey Doc!  Here’s one that will fit right up your telescope! At this moment, I was toying with the idea of getting out of my car to approach the orb and try to communicate with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the orb started to move a little closer to me, and my curiosity was overcome by fear… I felt panic consume me and simultaneously engaged the engine and hit the lights.  The orb reacted by backing away slightly.  Illuminated by my headlights, I could plainly see that there were no mechanical parts or structure. I slammed the gearshift into drive, and floored it.  I wanted to put as much distance between that thing and me as fast as possible.  I warily glanced in the rear-view mirror and was horrified to realize that it was pursuing me down the road at 90 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my cell phone and hurriedly called 911.  NO SERVICE.  I started laughing out loud.  Who the hell would believe me if I reported being chased by a hovering, glowing red softball?  They would think I was drunk or stoned out of mind! The little town of Congress had already rolled up the sidewalks and turned off the lights, and not a soul stirring…well, it was 1:00 a.m. Arizona time.  I decided to park in a vacant lot near the Fire Station right off the main highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next two or three hours, I watched odd lights moving through the dark moonless night.  I found that my eyesight had been affected by looking at the orb, and I could not focus on any bright light source. Whatever I tried looking at seemed to move away into periphery. Needless to say, I stayed parked there and tried my best to go to sleep and forget about what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, when I arrived home in California a couple of days later, I also noticed that my eyesight had not only been temporarily affected, but it had improved to some extent, and now can read small print without the use of my reading glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have shared this story with a few friends, but I notice that their eyes glaze over and I realize that they don’t believe what I saw.  If someone told me this story, I don’t think that I would believe it myself.

ISS not to fly over tonight wed may 18, nor was it a satellite which are visible longer with a reddish hue usually, or a plane unless it turned off all FAA lights, nor a meteorite cause there was never a tail. Visibility was very clear.  Flash was as bright as the ISS flyovers, then dimmed out slowly, slower than a meteorite, was traveling as fast as a commercial airliner but no FAA lights just one solid white ball like, and too big to be a normal commercial airliner at the distance.  Live 10 miles from airport and see flights all the time.  Also, came through right before the brightest star of Virgo.  Also no planes were in the area around St.Louis airport or flying by for the past hour and up to 10:15 pm when I went back inside.  Bigger than regular com! mercial airplane at the distance it was, would have been the size of 4-5 707 and light as bright as the ISS.<n>

5/18/10 16:20|Saskatoon (Canada)|SK|Other|30 seconds|Bulbous looking object seen moving through the sky|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75459.html|147|ndxe201005| Bulbous looking object seen moving through the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had stepped outside to sit in my back yard around 16:10 (4:10 p.m.) CST today for a brief rest after spending a long time working at my computer. I recently bought a pair of Nikon Sportstar 10 x 25 binoculars and so I thought I would pass some time looking at birds, clouds and aircraft. There were scattered light cumulus clouds in the vicinity, but most of the sky overhead was clear and brilliantly blue. There was also a lot of air traffic. I watched three Boeing 737s pass directly overhead, a few minutes apart, and a four-engine jet somewhat south of my location. The larger jet was too far and too high to identify, but the engines left pronounced contrails.  The 737s showed up very clearly in my binoculars, although there was a slight atmospheric haze, but I had them sharply in focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 16:20 (4:20 p.m.), just after watching the last of the 737s pass over, I began lowering the binoculars toward the horizon, when another object appeared in the field of view. I thought I had happened upon a small aircraft, so I steadied the binoculars to follow the craft through the sky. At that point, I realized that it didn’t look like an aircraft. It was filling a greater portion of my field of view than any of the jets had earlier. If it was a small aircraft, it should have been close enough to hear the engines, yet there were no aircraft sounds to be heard. If it was an aircraft, my view would have been about 45 degrees off its right front, with the aircraft banking in a right-hand turn, such that the wings would have been “level” with my point of view, but it was traveling perpendicular to my position, not turning toward me. For a second, I thought it was an aircraft similar to a de Havilland Tracker, with brightly painted engine nacelles. Then I thought it mig! ht be some kind of bird, first thinking that it must be soaring, because there was no motion of beating wings. But it didn’t really look like a bird. The object consisted of two large red-orange spheres, separated by a distance that was somewhat less than the diameter of either sphere, with a white body or fuselage between them and also a white body or fuselage attached slightly below them. The white shape(s) could have been spherical, about the same size as the red-orange spheres. It was hard to make out the shape of the white part(s), i.e., whether it was one body or separate pieces. the red-orange spheres were very bright in the direct sunlight, almost as if they were lights, but I don&#39;t think they were illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object with my binoculars as it continued a wide, steady, unwavering arc in a clockwise direction, until I lost it from sight as it passed behind my house. At that point, I got up from my chair to try to follow the object further, but I could not find it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the object was, it had to have been some distance away, as it was as sharply focused in my binoculars as the 737s had been. For that reason, I ruled out the possibility that it could have been an insect and most smaller species of birds. If it was a bird, it would have been very large. The largest birds we have around here are pelicans, and this certainly was no pelican. I thought it could be a cluster of party balloons, but it was moving contrary to the wind and on a very steady path. Also, it was apparent that it was some distance away, both because it was sharply focused in the binoculars and because of the atmospheric haze between the object and me. Party balloons would not have filled so much of the field of view at that kind of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I saw it for only a short time and was not able to see it by the naked eye, I really can’t say for sure what I may or may not have seen. I’m reporting this mainly in case someone else saw it and either can explain it or would like confirmation that they were not alone in seeing it.<n>

The shape of the object was rectangular and it had lights around the perimeter.  It looked like a flying building.  I was traveling down a state highway in the east central town of Hephzibah, Georgia.  This is a four-lane highway with a median and cars travel very fast on this road.  As I saw the object in the sky, other drivers saw it as well and started braking and pointing at the object.  I witnessed the object for less than a minute when it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view in about 3 seconds.  It was clearly visible; there were few clouds in the sky.  It looked nothing like a plane or a balloon or a helicopter or any other terrestrial flying object.<n>

I left the kitchen and went to my living room and I still had that   pressure in my ears so I walked outside. When I got outside I just kinda looked up at the   stars and above my house was what looked like a plane but with very little lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the thing didn&#39;t seem to strobe and there was no sound coming from it.The   plane or elicopter or whatever it was wasn&#39;t moving so I thought it must be a helicopter   until it disappeared and reappeared closer over my head, and just as soon as it done that   it done something that&#39;s kinda hard to explain it moved like if you moved your hand  in  front of the TV or computer monitor But it was moving extremely fast to the point of were   it was hard for me to track it with my eyes. Then it stopped and it moved really slow for   about a second and that&#39;s when I noticed two lights on it one was green like a Christmas   tree color and the other was orange or maybe red but they didn&#39;t strobe instead they seem   to pulse on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing moved again really fast but in a way like your hand waving in front of the tv  then  it suddenly shot off and started fading out and completely disappeared.  After all of that I  noticed my ears didn&#39;t have that pressure anymore and I went inside sorta terrified  by what  I saw because I wasn&#39;t sure what I saw it seem to look like a plane with hardly  any lights  but had characteristics of a ghost. The only description I can really give is  that it  looked a little like a plane because of the lights but moved extremely fast like a  shooting star and it made my ears feel like there was  a lot of pressure on them I also  heard it in my left ear before I did in both of them when I had first heard it in my  kitchen. It  was to dark to actually see the crafts shape and it didn&#39;t really stay still  for to long. The whole time it took it to get from one horizon to the another or to where I  could see was all of five minutes maybe tops.  Also, the whole time this went on it ! never  made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn&#39;t want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway.  Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left.  It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving.  We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn&#39;t our UFO at all. It was a second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFO’s were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn&#39;t nearly as much traffic on this highway as I&#39;d like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I&#39;ve ever heard, &#34;Did you see that, over in the trees?&#34;  I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking &#34;lights&#34; next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she&#39;d seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it. The mere thought of what it might be scared me enough to immediately pull out onto the highway and drive quickly away. We kept searching for the UFO’s as we drove toward Huntsvill! e. We were unable to clearly identify the crafts again.<n>

The lights were pentagonal in shape and were red with yellow and orange appearing occasionally.  They traveled slowly from east to west before stopping over what might have been interstate I-35 for a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they moved north at a rapid speed, judging for reduction in size of the lights.  Once far away, each on simply disappeared.<n>

Our balcony provides a great view of the sky and we can always hear the jets and helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was still, and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see two very bright, clear lights, to our eyes 30 centimeters apart (that is to say if you held a 30 centimeter ruler at arms length, that was the distance of the lights from our perspective) They flew one behind the other, the 2nd light a tiny bit to the left of the first, with no deviation of this formation. They were flying directly North to South. They were going dead straight at a steady speed, slower than helicopters that give city night flights, after 10 seconds they passed behind a all building and out of our sight. They were on a course that we have never seen flown by any other aircraft, heading out in the direction of the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were remarkable, because they were absolutely silent. Even the jets at high altitude can be heard on our balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later the Tokyo sky was filled with the usual 3 or four helicopters, and we could see 4 jets at varying altitudes passing over the city on the regular flight paths. After 30 minutes the sky had been covered with dappled clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would love to know if any other reports cam from Tokyo this night, and what the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This time I filmed it along with a really goofy helicoptor.  Then I noticed another of the objects that just seem to appear in the day time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to capture it on my camera but had a really difficult time sighting it in the screen so instead a ran over to this man that was just hitting some golf balls and asked him if i could record him describing what he saw.

Then the light from the object became brighter and brighter, finally it turned into different colors like green, pink or red, and blue and got brighter where youb couldnt see the original shape.  Then the light shrunk back into the white color i saw originally and at an instance was gone, almost as if it shot out of the universe in a matter of seconds, then me and my friend looked at each other, and at the same time asked each other, &#34;did you just see that?.&#34;  When it took off. It headed towards a highway that 4 different of my friends have claimed that they too have seen a UFO over the area of thisn highway, which concentrates over a! n area of an old ammunition plant used in an older war.

The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I&#39;d catch some of what I&#39;d seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can&#39;t be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It’s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around. This persisted for another half hour. Also I noticed cotton like substance falling from the sky. I collected some of the material and am hoping have it analyzed. It was very hard to catch these objects with the video camera I was using but I did capture one of them for a brief moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source in Denver.

Air flight headed to Greene Airport in Warwick...I am on the flight line for flights coming from the S.W. and South).  As the passenger jet, flew over at about a thousand feet, I looked to the left a bit to see a small gray cylinder perfectly stationary, at a higher altitude than the jet...I said to myself, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;   The sky was very clear and blue with excellent visibility.  As I looked at the cylinder for a few seconds it started to move Northerly at increasing speed, while at the same time going from gray to white and then to opaque and then to invisible.  I had the feeling that it knew I was watching it.  I kept watching that area of the sky when I saw a dark bird-like gliding craft come from the S.W., at about the same altitude as the cylinder...it had wings, was blackish, and glided like a bird, but was not a bird.  I went inside! to get my binoculars but when I came out it was gone.  The only noise heard was from the passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back on January 20 and 21st of this year our area of southern Rhode Island was subjected to low flying odd jet-like craft (see my report for those dates).  There has been an increase in jet traffic in general over my area, as well as helicopter traffic, for no apparent reason.<n>

I went outside and set up a blanket and a pillow out back and turned all the lights out.  After about half an hour of clouds rolling in and breaking up I finally got a perfectly clear view of the sky.  As I turned myself to face more towards the clear patch of sky which eventually expanded to a completely clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes after the clouds cleared out I saw it.  The UFO or what ever it was was too high up to get a clear view of what it actually looked like besides an orangery light with a yellow and green strobe.  It moved from about middle of my view towards the north in erratic patterns.  It traveled north east quickly turned 90 degrees on a dime for about 4 seconds then turned back on its original course.  It finally disappeared over my treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a commercial airliner or a jet fly like this and im quite sure what i saw was not a falling satellite or some sort of space junk entering the atmosphere.  My only regret was that i didn&#39;t have a camera as evidence of what i saw.<n>

Present were: Myself, 28, stay home mom of two, Softball/Baseball coach, umpire, and player My Husband – 30, Installation Technician/Manager 7+ yrs My children – ages 3 and 6, 6 yr old in Kindergarten and one of the top students in class, perfect                  attendance My brother – 19, college student Cousin – 25, Warehouse worker, college student Cousin’s girlfriend – 22, 9 months pregnant with first child Girlfriend’s brother and cousin – 23 &amp; 25, males, background unknown My Aunt – early 50’s, preschool teacher 10+ yrs, Devout Christian  My cousin and I were outside at approximately midnight PST on the evening of 5/15/2010 turning into 5/16/2010. We observed about 12-13 much larger than stars size circles that looked like glowing, orange, pulsating globes. As we watched them float slowly towards each other into a pattern, he went inside to get the others present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds there was about 10 of us, ranging from my youngest of 3 years, and oldest of 6 years, to my brother, 19, my cousin and his friends and girlfriend, ranging from 19-25, then myself, 28, my husband, 30, and my aunt, early 50&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all stood in my aunt’s front yard we observed a few of the lights just disappear. The remaining lights began to move into a formation of a straight line, each equally spaced apart. They were moving from right to left across the sky at this point. This happened in Bloomington, CA as we were looking I would say South/South East and watched the lights move I’d say North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise. There were no other crafts in the sky in that area at that time or for any time after. After the lights assembled in their line and proceeded in formation, all but one of the lights disappeared. Just poof, gone. No fading, twinkling, or anything similar. Just gone. One final light remained that slowly started moving South/South East away from us. But it wasn’t just away from us. It was up. And I mean way up. It almost started going literally straight up into the air into space it seemed from where it had been. It lost its “Glow” but still had a very distinct light to it, and was easy to follow as it disappeared into the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son spoke of how scary the experience was, but he truly doesn’t understand, as neither do we, what truly happened. We&#39;ve also submitted photos we were able to get plus a picture my 6 year old drew to the website.<n>

The lights flashed in a rapid radial sequence, red, green, blue, bright white; but were not strobing.  The sighting lasted aprox. 30 sec. from first being noticed, and disappeared rapidly to the East.   While observing this object, airliners were evident on final approach from the East to McCarran Airport.  The observed object was larger and brighter than the planes landing lights on approach.<n>

I followed the light from west to east and noticed there were no blinking lights.  I thought I saw the light moving a bit chaotic, but the lack of stars to reference it against made it difficult.  It wasn&#39;t zigzagging, but sort of slowing down and speeding up, slowing down and speeding up.  I thought, since my reference wasn&#39;t great that it could be an airplane or helicopter, and i just couldn&#39;t see the beacons, and as I thought this, it slowly faded away to nothing.  The object was simply a light.  Again, I thought this could be an aircraft, but the lack of blinking lights made me think.  If it continued without fading, I&#39;d assume it were a satellite or the shuttle, but the fact that it disappeared made me question its make up.<n>

It was magnificent for 30 seconds and then it was gone.

5/15/10 20:45|Gila Bend|AZ|Fireball|10 min|Driving West on the I-10 Freeway moments from entering I-8, as the sun set, I gained sight of the crescent Moon and slightly North West|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75443.html|169|ndxe201005| Driving West on the I-10 Freeway moments from entering I-8, as the sun set, I gained sight of the crescent Moon and slightly North West to it, was the planet Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 8:30, 8:45.. I could see what would looked like &#34;star dust&#34; seemingly emitting from Venus in two trails in a 45 degree downward trajectory, headed by a very small  blinking white light. This &#34;object,&#34; from my point of observation, was moving at a very slow pace. The light and trail so faint, barely visible to plain eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the North, a white/blue light was shooting across the sky in a jagged flying pattern. Sometimes the light would disappear for a second, reappear above the moon, disappear again and reappear moments later in a position below the moon.. all the while heading South until disappearing behind the landscape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had entered the &#34;Phoenix Bypass Route&#34; which is where the I-8 meets up with 85 North heading back up to I-10 W. It was just before 8:55 pm.. I just made the switch onto the 85 North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What looked like a flare being &#34;shot out of&#34; Venus, and also at a 45 degree angle, started gaining acceleration towards the ground. As the &#34;flare&#34; flew closer to the earth, it appeared to change in color.. ranging from bright white.. to pinks and finally a white-blue. This streak of light.. or this &#34;fireball,&#34; also appeared to be growing larger and brighter as approaching the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling like I was about to see a spacecraft crash into a field just to the north of me. I remember preparing myself for the &#34;impact.&#34; Before the object touched down, I stopped my truck short in the middle of the freeway and did a 180 degree turn, with the intentions of following the object for the rest of its voyage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before it hit the ground.. the object leveled out in a seamless motion, and it shot across the terrain... a white fireball (the light smaller now), and in a &#34;zipping&#34; like motion, this object hovered and glided gracefully above the ground before disappearing behind some nearby desert terrain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also realize I was near an airport, but this was not a plane.<n>
5/15/10 20:30|Meldrim (closest municipality)|GA|Unknown|15 min|Saw triangular object with red and white lights hovering over the interstate.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76903.html|170|ndxe201005| Saw triangular object with red and white lights hovering over the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving from Savannah to Statesboro on I-16W.  Just as we were passing I-95 we saw, way out ahead of us, three lights a red light with a white light to the right and left of it just above the tree line.  Initially we thought that it was an airplane, but then we noticed that it was not moving.  Then we figured that it was a tower of some sort, but there were no lights above it or below it like on the legs of a microwave or water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching the object for about 12-15 minutes until we finally got right up to it, at Exit 143.  The object was almost directly above the interstate, just to the south side and maybe 300-500 feet up.  I slowed the car down to a crawl and rolled the window down and miraculously we weren’t rear-ended by the cars behind us.  I could hear no engine sounds and felt/heard no propeller wash, as from a helicopter.  From underneath the object we saw three large circular red lights in a line and perpendicular to that line was a curved line of red lights.  In between the red lights there were smaller circular lights which I believe were white in color.  At the eastern end of the object (the side we approached from, which I believe to be the front of the object) we saw what appeared to be to spot lights pointed east and angled slightly toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we passed by the object I immediately called my father (an Air Force vet who grew up on US Marine bases) and asked him if he knew of anything that could fit the description.  Dad could not tell me about anything that fit that description.  My wife and I quickly sped up and turned around at the first opportunity (Exit 137) to try to get a picture of it.  The object was out of our sight for two to three minutes while we turned around.  When we got back to the place where we passed beneath the object, it was gone without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am pretty familiar with military and civilian aircraft, fixed and rotary wing alike, having grown up in a military family and around air bases/air ports.  I haven’t the faintest clue what this object was, where it came from, or where it went.  Any suggestions?<n>
5/15/10 20:30|West Trenton|NJ|Light|1 hour|Static bright light witnessed on two separate nights.  ((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.  PD))|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76586.html|171|ndxe201005| Static bright light witnessed on two separate nights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night, May 15, 2010, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was putting something in the trunk of my car.  As I headed back into my house, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  I was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  When I realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, I became more intrigued.  I, therefore, decided to observe it longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and I called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  He first thought it was a planet or the &#34;north star,&#34; but as he observed it longer, he thought it was &#34;a little strange.&#34;  The light was not moving and made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 10 minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  I, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before I decided to go ba! ck into my house to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:15-20 p.m., I took photos of the light.  During the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [It is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the Mercer County Airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) I noticed that when I found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be MOVING very rapidly in a haphazard way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes! I took 8 pictures of the light on May 15th.  After I took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my observation of the light, I was ! not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what! I was o bserving.  It is also important to note that I was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did I observe flashing beacon lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.m.  My husband and I were returning home and I noticed the same very bright light as I got out of our car.  It was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter.  Again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light.  I immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light. I observed the light intermittently (i.e., I kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as I did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes.  Just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky. The final time I checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.m. or so.)   Since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), I am HIGHLY curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  I now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.  Further, I did check the flight data on the ISS, and it was nowhere near my position in New Jersey on either 5/15/10 or 6/6/10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.

It disappeared and reappeared three times before I lost it.  Then 10 minutes later I noticed two more. One was travelling southeast and the other (which I estimate to be about 5 times the brightness of Venus was travelling northeast. It appeared as though both craft were going to collide right over my head but they just missed each other.  I listened for the sound of aircraft but heard nothing.  Furthermore there were no clouds in the sky.  At this point I dialed 911 just to have an official reporting.  Then as I was on the phone I saw a fourth one appear.  It looked to me like it was following an aircraft that I noticed was far out in front of the light (maybe a mile).  I watched the light until it disappeared! and described it all to the dispatcher at 911.  By this time it was about 22:00 hours and I called my mom and her boyfriend who came out to bring me a coat and watch with me.  At approximately 23:00 hours we saw another one very similar to the first.  It appeared out of thin air directly over head moved around for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source in Denver.

The object had multi colored lights not flashing on and off more that they were dimming and getting brighter and possibly looked as if they were rotating around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also observed many planes being routed over us coming from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport that we do not normally see.  We observed this object for about 45 minutes as it finally moved very slowly towards the west until we lost it on the horizon.  As planes moved towards the object there was a white light that would emanate from the object towards the approaching plane.  This beam of light was wide and was white and very dim not bright.  The object seemed to be shaped to where it had a vertical section to a point and a larger mass at its center where most of the lights were at.  The object was in the direction of Luke AFB from our position.<n>

A Pitch black sphere slowly hovered, moving in a south-eastern direction.  There was a distortion effect around it.  Like a haze or something blocking the human eye from seeing more of it.  I didn&#39;t have a camera on me but it looked like the footage i have seen of the phoenix lights during the day when they appear to be black spheres...this sighting was in full daylight.  I tracked it while on the phone with my brother until it was out of sight.  The Sphere was close enough to me that I could easily see that it was NOT any sort of aircraft at ALL. NO sound, NO lights, NO markings.  Just a black floating sphere.  There was no way to truly know its size but my educated guess would be between the size of a minivan and possibly even larger.  Maybe the size of a house.<n>

We looked up in the sky and there were 2 orange lights in a direct line from each other moving northwest simultaneously.  I couldn&#39;t see any clear shape of a ship or anything, but the lights definitely looked like they were attached to something that was moving.  The way the lights were lined up made the possible shape look disc shaped or cylindrical.  It moved extremely slowly across the sky and then one light slowly started dimming and completely disappeared.  The the other light kept moving in the original direction until it started dimming as well and then completely disappeared.  We are so creeped out.<n>

It was dark due to overcast, so there were no stars in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was tracing the outline of a pine tree in her yard against the dark sky, and noticed at first what I thought to be a star, behind a branch of this tree.  I noticed it as the wind caused it&#39;s branches to sway, revealing this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this &#34;star&#34; began to slowly move out from behind this tree.  It was an orange-gold in color and spherical, much like a star would be, but it shone much, much brighter.  Also, it&#39;s movements were rather peculiar - it&#39;s rate of motion wasn&#39;t necessarily fast, but it definitely did NOT move at a constant rate.  It would move across the sky slowly, then speed up slightly, then slow again, almost like it was floating or dancing.  Also, it did not move in straight lines, it would wobble almost, and sway slightly as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object move around the sky in this strange fashion for about a minute, when I realized I should wake my sleeping girlfriend to show her too.  I woke her, and then we watched for about another minute.  Then, it slipped back behind the tree, and I struggled to follow it through the branches.  A jet or a plane then came into sight as it flew across the sky, and I knew it was a jet or plane due to the strobe lights on it, and its steady rate of movement across the sky.  It also flew out of sight behind this large tree, into the same vicinity as the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this tree closely, the jet passed out on the other side of it, but the object in question never re-emerged from behind it and vanished.<n>

I waited for it to reappear but it never did in that spot.  10 minutes later or so though, if it is the same star, it did reappear way to the right and a lot higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened way to fast to capture on video.

There were no blinking lights, no sounds, and when it got close enough it just hovered in the same area for awhile, slowing moving to the right, or getting higher and then lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camcorder and started recording it and at first it was a sphere and then it changed into a diamond shape when I would zoom in.  We both stood there trying to figure out what it was, he would look at it, then I would through the lens of the camera or binoculars but we couldn&#39;t figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, it made no sounds, no blinking red or green lights it just shown like a big bright light for a time. It lit up the area around, sort of like how a full moon lights up the sky, and after awhile of watching it we both just came in and didn&#39;t bother trying to figure it out anymore, and later on I checked and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s  so strange is a friend of mine had seen it to, and when I was telling her and showing her the video I took, she said, &#34;Oh my god, I saw that same thing this morning!&#34; and a friend of mines son also seen it around the same time but in different places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look up to where it was just about every night, trying to see if it was some sort of light or house but there is nothing… I think it was something though, but not from our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were three big yellow lights in a line in the middle and three small lights in a line at both sides.  The craft left a trail of light like spider webs and flew about 30 feet from the ground.<n>

No plum behind the object, as you do see behind meteoroids, I saw just one complete bright sphere descending.<n>

I posted the second time that was on April 28, but do not see that is has been posted to this site as of  5/13/10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were, once again, at her mailbox when we caught site of it again-in about the same place as the first and second time.  I turned off the headlights and kept on the parking lights to try to sneak up on it; but had to turn the lights back on pretty soon.  This time the lights were white and small like they started out that first time we saw it, but this time we noticed that there were small yellow flashing lights on the outside of each white light.  As we approached the thing, it started to immediately back away and the lights got bigger.  The closer we got, the faster it went.  We kept visual with it as it went into the air and went ahead of us down the farm road.  When it got to my daughter’s house, it was behind some trees; we could still see the two lights.  I tried to get a picture, but couldn’t get the object clearly in the view finder of my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my daughter, after being sure she was inside and the door was locked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was going out, I looked in my rearview mirror and the two lights were right behind me!!  Man did I take off!!  It was still behind me when I got to the end of the road near the mailboxes, So I stopped. When I stopped, it stropped maybe was 30 feet from me.  I took a picture, but in my excitement, forgot to press the save button!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this thing is, it likes where it is since we have seen it three times now.  We are realizing that if it wanted to hurt us, it had every opportunity to do so.   I even stopped half way down the road and stood up in the car and out of the top sunroof -cell phone it hand to try to see it and get a picture-lights off, of course, but kept the motor running for a fast exit, if necessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time we saw it, it took off in a great big hurry since it was a moonlite night.  Hope that account will be posted soon.<n>

The object was slowly moving over upper Riverview, it appeared to be a large, diamond shaped craft with at least 6 lights around it; two where closer to the middle and were flashing.  It stopped in mid-air and changed directions several times; moving smoothly and fluently. We made sure it was not a helicopter as it was far too large and did not make any noise as it hovered not far ahead of us.  We turned around to chase the craft which was heading towards the river.  It began moving faster and faster and eventually disappeared.  The sky was barely cloudy so we would have been able to spot it, but we did not.<n>

It just stayed there and then I went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother came over at about 22:37 (approximately).  I checked the sky to see if the light was there.  It was not.

On the night of May 12, 2010 I was taking a series of Images (over 80 images in total) of stars for a composite star trails picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image I captured that is of concern, shows a green streak traveling from northwest to southeast. Each exposure was for 5 minutes at a 400 ISO at f3.5 and was taken at 11:25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m used to seeing meteors and satellites in my images, but never like this. A friend of mine who is a professional astronomer and the Curator of an observatory in Washington state examined the image and can’t explain it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the image is zoomed in on, there are no others lights are visible (like red or white for an aircraft). The astronomer and I both thought that perhaps it was just a meteor that was heavy in nickel, that would show as green as it heated up. But on second thought, he felt that in his experience (which spans decades) he’s never seen a green meteor that would take up a whole trail like this and be this brilliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The laser idea also came up, but I’ve been doing this for a long time, and had green lasers in my field of view for star trails images; in my experience they’ve never shown this brilliant, if at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, if it were a laser, they would have had to hold it steady for 5 whole minutes, an almost impossible task. The streak also shows that it was very quick, because it doesn’t move in motion with the stars in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m open to any ideas…thanks!

It was still raining, but not hard.  There was a lot of lightning, mostly to the south of me.  I was following a semi-truck (cattle trailer), but was a good 15 car lengths behind him.  After passing the blacktop turn-off of E Hwy, I noticed a vehicle in the sky to my left, headed diagonally toward me.  I saw a large white light in the center or nose and smaller red blinking lights on either side.  Since the object was moving either very slowly or hovering, I rolled down my driver&#39;s side window and drove slowly by.  The object turned away from the highway, facing SW.  Lightning illuminate the dark backside of the craft, and I saw the V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving, thinking there would be no reason for an airplane or helicopter to be out in this weather in the middle of the countryside, besides, it was NOT an airplane or helicopter.

The red lights would then swirl up, loop and zig zag around in the sky, turning white after a period of five minutes.

It was slowly moving higher in the sky from the north and moving west to east.  When the sun began rising, it was difficult to see the smaller white lights dancing around, however I did notice that they moved closer to this &#34;binary star&#34; and began swarming around it like fireflies, winking in and out.

The light was too high and too bright to be a plane.  I followed the light for about 30-40 seconds then it got dimmer and dimmer even though it did not change its altitude or speed than at about the minute mark it just disappeared into the stars.  It didn&#39;t streak or fade like a shooting star it just slowly vanished like a flash light dying.  In conclusion it was definitely not a satellite, or a shooting star or a plane unless it was some super sonic s! ilent jet flying at an astronomical hight and speed in very turbulent sky and slowly dimmed its lights than turned them off all together and was flying in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, it got dimmer quickly and then COMPLETELY disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half hour afterwards, my cousin and I were watching what I thought was a star.  It is there every night in about the same place, and blinks red, blue, and other colors almost like a strobe light.  Last night, though, we were watching it very closely and in less than an hours time, the &#34;star&#34; had moved very slowly to the right, so much so that it could not have been a star.  Then, the star was moving up and down slightly, and left to right very slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after it was moving that way, another small, bright orange light appeared up and to the right of it, OUT OF NOWHERE went down and to! the right and back up fairly quickly, and completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, the bright &#34;star&#34; moved even more to the right and up, and right before we went inside, another small bright orange light appeared and flew right over us and the roof.<n>

I observed the UFOs first at about 2200, and saw two through trees.  I knew they were far away based on how fast I was moving and how the objects remained still as the trees obscuring my view of them zoomed past me as I drove by them. I saw two first.  They appeared as oval shaped amber lights.  My view of them vanished as houses obscured my view of them. I then proceeded with a patrol for work, then moved to another location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this location about 8 miles North of the first, I again saw them; about 30 minutes after the first sighting.  This time I saw 8 or more of these large lights. The first illuminated, about 3/4 the size of the full moon in the sky.  Then many more appeared to the left, and in a sort-of strobe like way the lights on the right went out and ones to the left came on.  They also zoomed around (though never moved far) they were not stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to some residents in a pool of the community I was at.  Only one of them locked eyes on it and only saw the tail end of it.  I told them to keep their eyes open in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred South of my position in Chandler, AZ.  It is possible they were South of Queen Creek and Mericopa, two nearby cities.<n>

At first we thought it was just the top of a light tower, but then 4 more of the circular light shaped objects appeared.  They didn&#39;t seem to be in any order as they were not in a straight line, but they were all spaced apart and different heights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not move at all, but just stayed in the positions that they first appeared in.  They remained for a few minutes, then all but the original one disappeared.  That one remained for another minute or so, and then it disappeared as well.  It was a clear sky with only a few clouds, and the objects were probably only a few hundred feet up in the air.<n>

It had white lights and one red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see it was silver color.  It was very low and was traveling very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to get my glasses to see better detail, when I returned it was gone.  I am not aware of any craft that looks like what I saw, that flies so low and slow that I could see the lights flashing in my window and the craft itself.  Before I looked out the window I thought it was a police car flashing it light at my house or someone walking their dog with a flash light being we haven&#39;t any street lights in my neighborhood.  People often walk their dogs before the sun comes up to avoid the heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day, I called the FH police department and the FH newspaper and nobody else had called in saying they saw the craft then I thought to google and got this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Noticed orange lights/fireballs in the sky. There was road work so I had to detour around the lake.  The 2 orange lights/ fireballs weren&#39;t moving. They were high enough in the sky that even when I turned onto a different street I could still see them. As I was passing the lake I noticed that they were right above it. I felt like I couldn&#39;t stop staring at it but I didn&#39;t want to wreck my car either. I checked the road again and turned my head back to the lights and a third one appeared...a bit smaller than the other two. They were in a diagonal line.  As I made my turn right to get onto the road behind my house, a Helicopter flew over the large apartment builings on the left corner and flew straight towards it.  I drove really fast home and ran and told my boyfriend what I&#39;d seen.  He looked out our bedroom window and said he could hear the Helicopter but he couldn&#39;t see it.  He actually got in his car and drove over to the lake ! but he said he saw nothing.  Even the Helicopter was gone. He&#39;s bummed because I saw something and he didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Our house completely shook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After investigating my house for a couple of minutes we heard some jets that sounded like they were flying extremely low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my girlfriend went outside to see if we could find out what was going on.  After a couple of minutes outside, at approximately 11:00pm my girlfriend noticed a glowing light hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 seconds it faded out.  About another 10 seconds later three lights appeared in the same area.  They were all staying still. They were there for no more than 5 seconds, and disappeared.  A minute or two later one single light appeared in the same area for no more than 5 seconds.  We are located on the North Side of Havre, the lights appeared South East of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assume the initial loud noise was a sonic boom created by the jets.<n>

All equally distance apart.

We suspect that he is a superlative witness, and reporter of fact.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight pattern of the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to start this &#34;reported sighting&#34; letter with the statement, I, or we, my 12 year old son and I, aren&#39;t looking for any special status or &#34;pats-on-the-back&#34; for what we viewed.  Nor do we want to be thought of as, &#34;out of our minds&#34; for saying anything at all.  We simply saw what we saw, and just want to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To add a little validity to our report our backgrounds are:  My son - 12 going on 13 real soon, an &#34;A-&#34; student,  7th grade, athletic, only child at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself - Retired Air Force, aviation was my career for 22+ years, aircraft mechanic 6 years, aircrew member, flight engineer, cargo and air refueling aircraft the last 16 years.  I worked in the airline/aviation industry for seven years after retirement from the Air Force.  I did finish college a few years after I retired.  Aviation Management with a minor in Aviation Safety; took a few courses in accident investigation which taught a person how to question and evaluate an &#34;eye witness&#34; to an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place on the night of May 10th, 2010 at approximately 21:40, (9:40 pm) PST.  We were outside enjoying a wood fire in a small mobile home park in Trinidad, CA.  A clear night, the rains had just gone through earlier in the day.  There is a small airport just south of our location about 11 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were engaged in a conversation when I noticed a brighter than normal light coming up over the tree line just to the north of us.  I wouldn&#39;t have paid much attention to it had it not been so bright.  Initially, I thought it was a late night commuter flight arriving out of the north, but then I noticed it wasn&#39;t the normal color patterns of an aircraft, the green and red lights from the wing tips and the flashing anti-collision lights the FAA requires. The light pattern we saw was a reddish orange color, maybe a little yellow mixed in.  And they weren&#39;t flashing.  The colors were &#34;glowing&#34; or slowly pulsating.  I questioned then whether it was an aircraft or one that I knew of anyhow.  Granted, I&#39;ve been out of the aviation field going on seven years now.  I then noticed its movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving a little quicker than the normal &#34;prop&#34; or small jet type aircraft that come into our local airport.  And, it didn&#39;t appear to be one of the Coast Guards&#39; rescue helicopters out on a night flight.  All aircraft have a distinctive sound to them; there wasn&#39;t any sound at all coming from the sky.  Just the occasional car or truck going down Hwy 101 and the rustling of the redwood trees from a slight wind.  But then I figured it was too far away to hear.  However, that would mean it was a large craft with the size they were and not being able to hear them.  A couple of weeks ago, someone said that was Venus in the night sky that was so bright.  I just noticed it was a very bright star or planet on a clear night.  Compared to that, this light was at least twice the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 30 seconds or so, maybe a minute.  It was traveling from our right to left which would be north to west or northwest direction.  It was then we both noticed two more similar lights appearing from the same location over the tree line.  Then a fourth one appeared following the two in front.  All seemed to be going in the same direction.  A tall redwood tree obstructed our view as we watched and I had my son move to his left to try and pick them up as they appeared from behind the tree.  They never reappeared.  He said,&#34; Papa, they disappeared!&#34;  About that time and I would say again it was around 30 seconds or so, a fifth light appeared, trailing all the others and moving in the same direction.  We then moved our position to be able to watch the craft without obstructions from tall trees.  We kept an eye on it and to our amazement, it all of a sudden got smaller and disappeared.  Wow! is all we could say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction of the flight pattern for the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle in the sky as referenced from the top of the tree line to the point where the last one disappeared.  It all took place within a three to four minute time period I would guess, but I wasn&#39;t keeping track of the time while watching.  I did happen to remember to ask my son what time it was when the last &#34;light&#34; disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only hope that others saw this and are reporting it.  As a military flight crew member I could only describe a few of the &#34;odd&#34; things I saw throughout my flying career as, well, &#34;odd.&#34;  Now, at least in my mind, I have some creditable proof to maybe I wasn&#39;t seeing things.....<n>

I was having a BBQ in the back garden/yard just standing there doing what i was doing and i noticed a load of these orange balls of lights come in from all directions very low at about 5ft high. They soon passed and that was the end of that. But anyway, soon after i looked up above me and their was this silent sphere which was basically just a black ball (the size of a Football) which had a dull orange haze around it just hovering right above me as if it was watching me. It reminded me of a probe. I had a small green laser pen on me at the time and i shined it at the thing a few times and it did not respond at all. After the the excitement i then realised that i could be in danger, so i ran in to the house to fetch my Mother and her friend who is also a RAF pilot. By the time we got back down in to the garden the object was already floating off below tree top level. So as we watched it i again zapped it with my laser pen until ! it vanished in to the distance towards other houses and the local river Wye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time we/i ever saw the objects was in Aug 06 at about 9pm when about 20-30 of these orange lights were coming in from the Wales direction in single column formation and they all vanished in the same spot as they got there. These things can be seen most nights here, and they often come in different colours. Mainly bright stars in disguise if you like. Its unlikely in my opinion that its the SAS camp down the road causing all this as many speculate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and another witness have also seen a massive black Triangle in Wellington ,Hereford , UK on Oct 31st 2007 at exactly 9.20pm. It was low, silent and simply amazing. It was accompanied by a small white/blue ball of light which was floating around fields and the sky. I know that their have been many local reports of these things around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was at approximately 20:50 EST.  The object appeared to be just a very bright star at first-- which was what caught our attention.  It was later determined to be moving, however, after a closer study.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~A few points to supplement this assertion are:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) object was eclipsed momentarily by tree limbs at several points and but would always return to open sky, as perceived from our position in front of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) it flickered as it moved back and forth along the horizon and in circular or arc-shaped, sweeping motions to and fro.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) the object&#39;s light would dim after it reached the peak of its arc-maneuver and hence begin to move in the opposite direction, and would brighten considerably when facing us. the path of the light&#39;s beam could be seen when facing from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) once in awhile, the light would juke every which way and at odd combinations of sharp angles, in short bursts of incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~It at first seemed to be hovering over one point but we found the object to be maneuvering away from our position, as it eventually disappeared over the horizon. We were both compelled by strange, anxious feelings for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ We repeatedly had to back up to keep the object in our view and actually had to move to my second-story balcony for the last ten minutes of the event, as if hypnotized to stare at this weird light until it could no longer be viewed. This was at approximately 21:19.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ I attempted to signal the object with a MAG-light-- in numeric combinations of numbers counting down from three-- but to no avail.  At one point, I attempted to use the 75-watt bulbs in the balcony lights as well. But still, the object retreated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~I judged the object to be three miles away at first and it was gone forty minutes later, still moving  in the direction of the Delaware Water Gap. This thing was very bright and very noticeable; I would find it hard to believe that nobody else saw it besides the two of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ All distance estimates were provided by the author of this report, who has worked in fields of occupation involving great heights and distances.<n>

First time, I was sitting in my backyard, which has a nice view of the refinery, when I noticed something strange.  I will admit, I was under the influence of marijuana, so I made sure I wasn&#39;t just seeing things, rubbing my eyes, and taking another look.  I was looking at what I thought was smoke coming from the refinery, but this smoke never disappeared into the air.  It seems like strings of light.  These strings were made up of the tiniest pieces of floating light, which some seemed to be astray from those grouped into strings.  They came together in a V-shape, sort of like how birds comes together.  I was totally freaked out but I watched them go across the entire sky until they were gone in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second experience I was in that same backyard with my sister, once again, marijuana was present.  This time it wasn&#39;t as noticeable because the light pieces weren&#39;t in a string form.  There were only little clusters of pieces of li! ght.  What I witnessed on my own though was remarkable.  It happened so long ago, I&#39;m not totally sure of the date, but I had come across this website and decided to share!

I belived him but my girlfriend didnt so i said lets go outside &amp; try to catch some UFOs. So we went outside on the porch of my house &amp; talked about what he seen &amp; about 10 mintues later a fleet of UFOs came over our heads goin south to north. They were about 8-15 of them all in a line, &amp; almost had a redish tint to them. We were so amazed! Even my parents came out &amp; saw it, so we all stood outside &amp; just talked about what we had just seen &amp; about 10-15 minutes later  another fleet passes over our heads! Now were shocked! Atleast 10-15 of them all in a row same color going the same direction, I went inside to grab my binoculars (keep in mind i didnt have a camera or video recorder) &amp; tryed to see w/ the binoculars. It was simply amazing we couldnt belive it, we stood there &amp; watched t! hem go by. 15 minutes later another fleet comes by! 10-15 same color going the same direction. Now we are in shock almost scared... We knew these were UFOs because @ one point one actually jumped from the left side of the row to the right side. Now my dad is actually calling the towns paper but it was late so he left a message on their voicemail describing what we seen about mysterious lights in the sky but in the morning we never got a call back. This phenomena continued for about 30-40 minutes. In total we had must of seen about 7 fleets (10-15) &amp; none of us will never forget that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be stars at first until the trailing object emitted a bright white light for about five seconds, then they resumed medium magnitude starlike appearence.

It was pretty high in the sky at about my 10-11 o&#39;clock. It was a very bright white light. Knew it wasnt a star but had no blinking lights that i could see. Then It got a little lower but what i really noticed is it started to become more parallel to me at my 9 o&#39;clock so I knew I was right beside it. Past the hills on Woodford I started to notice it become even lower and go even past my 9. So I pulled over on this dirt road (lee witt rd), and I couldn&#39;t see it all. I had lost it in the trees before i turned of 321, then through the trees I noticed a outside light prob from a house and another brighter light, possibly the light itself, much lower now. So I did a 3 point turn and turned back to 321. Then I drove about 30 feet, killed the lights and got out, looking directly NE behind the truck. I saw it again!! Much lower prob 100 feet above the tree line in the distance. So I got! the flashlight,  and went into the field about 6-7 feet and could see it perfectly. Due NE, have no idea if it was 1-2-4 miles away b/c all it was white light. I swear for a sec i thought it had a searchlight on but it was like 1/2 sec only. It moved slowly down and then i could make out a redish not really blinking but tinge to the outside of the white light, on both sides. No sounds, nothing. And North air force was running manuvers toward the SE but they had just flown over and didn&#39;t even cross 321, way away from me. It just sat there and i watched it for prob 15mins as it just went behind the trees. I have Iphone video and pics but so far all it seems to have captured is darkness...

I continued my star gazing and noticed the same blinking light in the exact same place about a minute later.  I&#39;ve seen satalites, the I.S.S. etc passing over and I&#39;ve even noticed occasional &#34;flashes&#34; of increased light from these which I assume is related to the rotation of mirrors or something catching the sun&#39;s rays.  This incident is different.  I continued to watch the light blink on and off every minute or a bit longer continually for an hour, and always in the exact same spot in the clear nite sky.  I imagine it&#39;s still doing so even as I write this.  Can you tell me if there is any type of natural or man made phenominon that can occur in this fashion?  It&#39;s got me curious as all get out!<n>

When I got in my car and pulled out of the drive way, I saw this  bright star-like object hovering high above the clouds. I was so blown away by its beauty, that I kept staring at it in amazement. I just knew that it wasn&#39;t Venus or a any kind of planet or star.  As I kept driving the road, the object disappeared and I could not find it. By the time I reached the end of the road to make a right turn at the corner, I saw it again, but this time it was lower and much farther away in distance. It also appeared brighter than before. I just held the brakes and stared at it for a brief moment before making a right turn. As I drove in the other direction, I came to a stoplight. When I stopped, I looked at my left and I saw the object moving in my direction, as if it were following me.  I don&#39;t know why I did what I did after this, but I guess it was a test to see if i! t was really following me or if it was truly in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. The creepiest, yet most amazing thing happened after this.  I drove down the road and made a left turn. I wanted to get closer and get a better look. I did not see it in the sky when I checked. Instead, the bright light came down and suddenly appeared above some trees on the right of the road and slowly moved across the street. It started getting really close to me. It was so close to my car in both length and height that I could see its spherical shape. I put my car in park and watched it hover right above me. I didn&#39;t hear any sounds coming from it. Then, suddenly, the white sphere of light vanished. As I drove away, it appeared once again high in the sky, but in a different position.  Once I reached my destination and got what I needed, I walked up to my car and saw that the object was still in the sky, but just not as bright.

A beautiful day about 12:00 pm.  Before I left, I opened all the windows and sunroof (forgot camera).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point in the trip, I looked up thru the sunroof.  I noticed a small black object fairly high up; nearly overhead.  It appeared to be a small winged plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half mile further down the interstate, I looked up and the object was at about the same position as before.  Concentrating on it; I saw the wings and tail fins more accurately and said to my self how odd they looked compared to any other plane I had ever seen.  I pulled over and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still looking at it overhead through the sunroof, I realized it was motionless!  I got out of my car to continue my observation of this black object (I was hoping some other motorist might stop to see what this guy was looking up at.) In the Navy, I was a 2nd Class Fire Control Technician; my action station was in the Fire Control Director at the controls and optics.  I had seen many planes in the sky and had a good feel for distance from my ship to them.  My thinking (at the time of the sighting) was that if this was the typical size of a fighter jet; it must have been about &amp;gt;1500 feet straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it for about a minute; looked up and down the interstate; glanced up and it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front/back of the object had a more sharp point than the attached rendering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What stood out for me was that it was motionless and the stabilizers were the same width with the ends being parallel and in-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I got up to have a ciggy outside the back door and as I usually do when I go outside at night  I glanced up up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just at that moment two bright white lights shot over our house, one just behind the other.  They were going at super fast speed, and I judged them to be quite low (About the same height as the local air ambulance helicopter flies over)  I can only compare the speed of them to war zone footage I have seen on TV of tracer bullets fired at night. they were that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like one was tailing the other, and both seemed to be darting slightly from side to side as they travelled forwards. They got to a point just over the school behind our house and without slowing just shot up vertically and then vanished in the cloud. They were completely silent. No noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Al this took maybe a matter of seconds. I was just stood there looking up with my mouth open. It really was a &#34;WHAT THE FU.....!&#34; moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hair on the back of my neck literally did stand on end!  I have never seen anything like it in real life. They looked just like those little things that fly around in the film &#34;Close Encounters&#34;. In fact, that is what I thought as I was stood looking up at them. (I know that sounds like a bit of a cliché but that is the best way to give you an idea of what they looked like.)   I have no bloody clue as to what it was.  I had no time to get my a camera and film them, and even if I did I think I would have been to preoccupied to think about grabbing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I would just like to add, even though I am quite interested in reported UFO sightings, I don&#39;t particularly go looking for them, and wasn&#39;t even sure if I believed in odd things flying around in our skies.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, and even though I am quite rational and like to find possible explanations for stuff like this, after seeing something for myself I have no idea at all what it was.)<n>

My guess was that it was a satellite, except within a matter of minutes a second light appeared in precisely the same spot as where the first appeared, was of slightly greater intensity, and moved across the same path as the first before disappearing.  The possibility of two satellites on the same trajectory only minutes apart seemed odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Isanti is about 50 miles North from Minneapolis / St. Paul.  We were facing east.  The sky was clear and visibility was excellent.   Although there were one or two aircraft in the sky, none of them were even close to the object we sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in question was very bright and would have looked like a bright star except it was moving extremely fast as compared to the aircraft we are used to seeing.    Also, unlike any other aircraft, this one has no discernable navigation lights – no flashing lights, no red lights.  There was just the solid bright light.  We observed it for 10 or 15 seconds until it suddenly started growing dimmer and in the course of only a couple of seconds, faded out entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not claiming this to be a “UFO” in the traditional “extra-terrestrial” sense.  My first guess was maybe a large military craft with afterburners or perhaps a rocket carrying a satellite.  I tried looking on line and saw several websites showing scheduled launches on May 8th.  One was for a dummy payload from Alaska for a test run of the Minotaur IV rocket and a military launch from Germany or France.  Perhaps we saw one of those, but we were curious.  Of course, if it is not, then our report is a valid one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>

At that time I noticed a formation of bright, orange balls that seemed to be roughly in the shape of a diagonal line.  (approximately two-o&#39;clock on a clock).  I say roughly because one ball appeared to be out of the line and further ahead.  I initially thought it was a military craft formation of some sort moving from the southeast, however as they got closer, it became apparent that this was not something mechanical.  There was absoulely no noise at all, and no trails of smoke or vapor were behind them.  They were located not too far above the horizon (meaning I did not have to look too far up to see them).  They appeared to be moving rapidly to the west and the pattern they were moving in changed as they moved.  There did not appear to be grouped in any shape now as they were moving.  Right before they disappeared, they clustered up together in two ci! rcles and then started winking out one by one.   The entire occurrene took less than two minutes, and it scared the heck out of my ten year old.  Most definitely not anything I have ever seen, and we have seen plenty of military crafts and manuevers in our area over the years.  They were not large in relation to the size of the moon, however they were much larger than stars and as I said much lower in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at home with my family watching TV. My sister who lives down the street called us and told us to go outside and look at the sky. When we went outside we saw six or seven bright orange light moving in the sky. They seemed to be in two groups and the lights were moving steadily in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, who had watched the lights for about ten minutes before she called us, said that when she first saw them they were above the horizon facing east forming a “T” shape.By the time we got outside they were above the horizon facing south. Then one by one they disappeared. This happened at about 10:15 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried calling the Air Force which is several miles away. They didn’t see anything or seem too interested. Which I can understand, I would probably say the same thing if I didn’t see them with my own eyes. I also tried calling the local news stations they probably thought I was joking. There are many videos on youtube that show exactly what I saw. Unexplainable orange bright lights in the sky.<n>

We pulled into a parking area near one of the formation.  The night was clear, the sky wonderful.  We stood and admired the shadows of the formations and quickly noticed a significant numbers of meteors.  My daughter saw one with a tail squiggle.  There were about 8 sighted in about 15 minutes.  We live in Glendale, so its been since the Leonids of 2001 that we saw so many.  My son sighted a mid-brightness star between a stand of trees.  I would guess the object was at least 20 miles ahead. It was just to the west of Polaris 15 degrees and below the outer ladle of the big dipper, about 15 degrees.  He pointed the object out to each of us, for the next ten minutes, the object would stikenly move to the east, the quickly to the west, also up and down, incluing movements to the 3 o&#39;clock and 8 o&#39;clock.  This object still appeared to be a star, ma! ybe being seen through heat waves, but it never stopped moving.  It also never disppeared from the separation of the two stands of trees.  As a skeptic, I do not know what I saw, but we all saw the same thing.  It was a beautiful moonless evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it until I went around a bend in the road with trees that blocked my view.  When I could see the area again it was gone.<n>

They maintained their shape and speed, until passing from my view into heavier cloud cover to the north.  No noise or flashing lights, and not an object breaking up in the atmosphere.<n>

He was standing looking out our back window that faces a field. He said, &#39;look at the light, it&#39;s not moving&#39; it was far too close to be a star. He decided he was going to go out and look for it. I stayed by the window, cell phone in hand. He called and said it seemed a lot farther out than he had thought. The object was moving lower and farther away it appeared until it finally disappeared from my sight. Right before it disappeared I called him to tell him I could barely see it. He said he couldn&#39;t either. Like that, it was gone. This is the second time my husband has seen this particular shape, although last time it was a lot closer. Roughly 200 feet off the ground and right above the edge of the field behind our home. He was walking 2 houses down to his moms, the object paced him. He could see the object had no markings with three lights under each point of the triangle. This took place on March 21s! t 2009. Like I have stated we have a field right behind our home and live about a half mile from a state intitution.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the dogs were sniffing around, the Western sky light up inexplicably catching the attention of both women who turned to look at each other in total shock.  The light was so big and so bright and so powerful it could not have been a spot light, search light or or anything of the sort.  There was no sound and it flashed and disappeared with no trace in about a second.  The flash of bright white light seemed to project from the Sierra de San Pedro Martir toward the Sea of Cortez meaning it appeared to projecting from West to East.  The landscape of this sighting is remote, barely developed, rugged desert flatland where there are no street lights or light pollution.  It was absolutely bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was small, very high up and it disappeared into thin air.  It moved across the sky (city) in just a few seconds. Immediately following its disappearance... I saw three jets flying near the area in which it disappeared.  It may have been the same jet circling. I&#39;m not sure! Because of the distance and speed... it was very difficult to make out it&#39;s exact shape because it was constantly changing back and forth from one shape or another, as well as from white to silver.  At first I thought it was a very big, white and silver bird... until I saw it moving extremely fast and then it just completely disappeared.  Immediately following it&#39;s disappearance a helicopter flew in the area as well as the jet planes.  There are no clouds today.  Also, please note that birds do not generally fly as high as the object was at.<n>

I turned right onto Hockaday road going south. There were flashings of circles of lights that appeared to be rotating around to the left. Each light was the size of a car. There was a mist around the lights but the rest of the sky was clear and starry. There was a car behind me that turned off to the left, i stopped and watched this for a few minutes the lights appeared to be going along above the tree tops moving south with me , eventually i got to Shock road which Hockaday turns into and the lights were gone. I turned left on Dale road and looked back North but the sky was clear and i couldnt see anymore lights. The sky was clear and starry out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Nearby Westover AFB was conducting nightime flight ops which is what drew me to look outside in the first place (close overflight of C-7s).  I watched the light for approximately two minutes when I went to get my binoculars in the kitchen. Upon my return to the front porch less than 20 seconds later, the light was &#39;gone&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/6/10 21:20|Sacramento|CA|Light|about 6 min|Three bright lights low in the night sky almost equidistant from each other over Sacramento, California.|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75332.html|271|ndxe201005| Three bright lights low in the night sky almost equidistant from each other over Sacramento, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to my home in Sacramento from my work in Roseville, California on southbound Interstate 80. As I approached downtown Sacramento I noticed four very bright stars in the sky over the city. Within seconds I realized that one was a distant airplane (because of the red and green lights that I noticed it exhibited as I looked more closely). The &#34;stars&#34; were about seven full moons apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side. The closest of the lights was about five times bigger than a very bright star or five times a magnitude 1 star. It seemed to be around three hundred feet in the air. I tried to notice how far the closest object was from me but I couldn&#39;t tell. At first it looked closer than my exit which was coming up (the 16th Street Exit) but as I approached the exit I could see it was farther away... perhaps twice as far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still, I knew these were not stars nor some other regular natural celestial phenomena. As I approached them they were in front of me; when I got closer they were next to me and then as I went further they were behind me and they were low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen them from the vantage of the freeway but as I took the exit which descended onto the surface streets the objects were lost amidst buildings and trees and I could not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all I saw the objects for about six minutes. Because I was driving on the freeway I could only view them intermittently but, perplexed by their strangeness, tried to make as good an observation as I could and remember as many details as possible.<n>

Dark was falling as I was waiting I looked up to the sky and just looked around. To my west I seen this bright light that appeared to be a star until i realizedit was strobing red lights too.There were a total of 3 large lights that spanned the western sky. All three strobbing red light and bright star appearances.My children 1 and 2 got back and i suggested they watch the sky whwile i put the fire out. Darkness had set in.Child 1 said she sees red lights blinking and soon points out 2 more.And then sees several more much smaller ones.Child 2 sees the same thing. We all 3 run up to the house and it appears they are following us,because they are all getting closer to our house.1 can only be seen from our kitchen window.So we get our old telescope out,but have 0 luck locating it.By this point i am shaking and scared for some reason. My 3rd child comes in ! facinated by what is going on.We get out the video camera and start recording.2 times our screen goes blank and i have to restart  that video. I zoom in and see an amazing light show.kind of like fireworks but only it is pulsating.We did capture it on video. We also seen helicopters and planes flying and surrounding the object. by this point i call my husband via phone,because i am scared...My child 2 comes in and says there is a white streak of light coming from the object. I didnt look. I was to scared. a few minutes later  child 3 comes in to tell me the object is GONE! I said whatever. I thought he was joking,so i got up to check and SURE enough it was!!! I scanned the sky and soon found it again FAR west of us.It is still there right now. I dont know what it is,but it terrifies me,befcause i realized that it was in the same location nearly everynight for the last 5 years. I have joked with my husband about it being aliens,because the first time i seen it was on the eas! t side of our house,but it moved a couple years ago to the wes! t. NO it isnt there everynight. I is there for a bit and disappears. this is just the first time we have seen it in person like this.I would love for someone to investigate my videos to try to explain what this might have been!<n>

I went outside @ 1227 for a Smoke-Break.  As I was standing there facing NorthWest I noticed an small odd cloud sitting @ about a 50 degree angle from where I was and @ my 1100. I looked down, then back up and the cloud was gone. In it&#39;s place was a small white oval looking ball.  The sky was clear Carolina Blue so it was obvious. I immediately pulled out my Nextel and got a Co-Worker outside to see it too.  We watched it sit still in the sky kind of morphing shape for roughly 3-4 minutes and then it started easing slowly East.  Right then, my Boss drove up and started watching it also. Just before the Sighting ended, I noticed another Ball just East of the 1st one. After maybe 20 Seconds, they both just Vanished. You could see them kind of Fade Out of sight. Not due to distance, they just Faded out. I watched them Fade in/out a few times before finally disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the Gen. Mgr for a Logistics Co. in Charlotte and have had Military Experience. I am an avid plane spotter and ALWAYS watching the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, as an observational note. The objects were hard to see without my Polarized Sunglasses. I kept pulling them off and passing them around so everyone could get a clear view. Had I not had my Glasses, I probably would have never noticed either object.<n>

It was heading from north to south and flying close to the San Jacinto foothills which I live across the street from.  There were no lights or any sounds coming from the craft. I first noticed it when I blocked out a start. If I were not looking up at the time I would have missed it. I can usually hear passenger jets flying high overhead while they are traveling either eastward or westward, but I heard nothing from this thing. I would estimate that the craft was about thousand feet or less in the air and its size was about the same as a Boeing 737. I have live in Palm Spring for nearly 10 years and this is the third time I have seen something strange flying through the night sky. I love this place.<n>

We live by the beach in Portobello Edinburgh.  The sea is visible at the foot of our street and we could both see a large black featureless rectangle about three quarters of a mile out to sea.  The weather was clear, calm and visibility was perfect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m always observing ships and am reasonably familiar with most the ships that frequent the Forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t make out any superstructure.  No masts, funnels, sails..anything.  No markings.  I don’t have the best eyesight so I asked my daughter if she could make out any details.  She could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went upstairs to get my binoculars and to check out www.marine-traffic.com and to see if I could still see the object from my sitting room window.  I couldn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked Marine Traffic and there was one ship displayed which was a great deal further out and it looked nothing like what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the binoculars down stairs and went to the beach.  The object had gone. The ship recorded on Marine Traffic was half as far away again as the object, but was easily distinguished as it was red and we could make out superstructures even from that distance, even without binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate I was no more than 10 minutes maximum upstairs.  Such is the range of view from the beach, a motorboat would have had difficulty in disappearing out of sight in that length of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked some people on the beach if they had noticed anything; they had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m reporting this simply because it was, by definition ‘unidentified’ and it may help should someone else report the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested clarification from the witness as to the time of the sighting, which was not indicated in the original report.

I think it was moving at a 45 deg angle downward, and then began (on a dime) to move in a line parallel to the earth, and directly in my direction (northward).  The speed probably about that of a fighter jet with afterburners going (based on past observations of those).  Object was a self-luminous body, grey-blue-white, not very bright, about like the moon behind thick clouds, and was retangular, with no lights whatsoever.  No sound at all.  The backyard is quiet, and it flew directly overhead.  It was about twice as long as wide (2:1), and took, I guess, between 8 and 11 seconds to traverse from 30 deg above my right horizon (about 800 - 1200 feet high?) to my left horizon and disappear.  There was no wind at all.  This was not a bird or balloon.  It was hauling straight line, overhead.  I was very careful to make mental notes as I observed, trying to see any extensions beyond the rectangular shape, but could not see anything more.  Honestly, it did appear to change its shape after it passed overhead and was halfway between me, and the point on the horizon where it disappeard... into almost a birdlike shape for an instance, and then changed back, then disappear.  The size was a one inch object held 12 inches from your eyes.<n>

Could tell it was not a plane as the planes were coming in from the NE with their landing lights on.  This light was about 30 degrees above the horizon and the sun was just beginning to rise on the horizon.  The light would blink, then go to solid, then back to blinking, then to solid and then almost strobe like it was blinking so fast.  This went on for a good twelve minutes brfore the light quit and the object shot across the sky to the NW.  It was so fast it seemed a blur.<n>

5/4/10 21:20|Santa Clarita|CA|Formation|12 minutes|It was around 9:20pm last night (May 4, 2010) and it was pitch black; the sky was clear and we could see the stars, and there was some|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75316.html|293|ndxe201005| It was around 9:20pm last night (May 4, 2010) and it was pitch black; the sky was clear and we could see the stars, and there was some wind, it was warm.  My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you&#39;re searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it&#39;s new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn&#39;t see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing – although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape &#34;/&#34;, with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn&#39;t behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into &#34;cloaking&#34; mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That&#39;s the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can&#39;t tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn&#39;t see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I&#39;ve seen sheriff&#39;s dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn&#39;t drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our backgrounds: My husband is in IT and I am a technology and sciences editor for a national publication. We&#39;ve never seen anything out of the ordinary before and have lived here 3 years, so we also know what&#39;s common in the sky here. My husband is a firm skeptic, and I&#39;m uncertain. I&#39;m aware of military testing at VAFB and I have seen missile tests at a distance from the 101, and this didn&#39;t look like that. I&#39;ve also seen small meteors and meteor showers and they don&#39;t hover and glide.<n>

We were at the baseball field and halfway through the game I was talking to a couple of people and looked up and saw this gray silver object in the air. I told everyone to look. It was very shiny as if the sun was reflecting off of it. It seemed to be mostly shaped like a rocket.  There was no sound, no lights, no smoke. It looked like it was floating with the front  of it a little lifted. It was not going slow or going fast.  Several people thought maybe a plane but it did not look or sound like a plane.  This time I had my camera and took several pictures. Some of them are hard to see but I am sharing  with you anyway.  There was also a lot of activity in the sky later that night and my friends and I observed  this at home after the game and it seems strange that I would witness this twice within a couple of days apart.<n>

As I walked further into the parking lot and looked up there were about 12 red lights in the sky. For size perspective they looked rather like low flying aircraft lights, but there was only one light per object and the light was all I could see of the object. The lights were grouped roughly in a V formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that there were two irregularly shaped disks leading the formation but as objects raised and lowered in altitude as they moved south it became clear that the fairly low (but light) cloud cover meant that as objects raised above the cloud cover the light from the object reflected down below as a dark disk shape through the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were moving fairly slow and not as steady as I have seen most aircraft fly (more of a bobbing motion). They were moving not in unison but definitely as a group of some sort. I did not get a firm count because I would loose/see more as they changed altitude. This took place in an urban area and I lost sight as the objects moved out of my line of sight into the tree line/buildings. About another 10 or so people witnessed this in the parking lot that I was in. There is a National Guard unit stationed ~15 miles away, and there are several small airports, but none that I know of that would be doing any kind of experimental aircraft work, etc.<n>

It was unusual in its shape and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very very bright and seemed to be unstable as if beams were shooting out from all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it within 3-4 minutes two white bullet  shapes objects came out of it,one on the left and one on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in and grabbed my video camera and started filming it. We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses: 1.

Wind steady 10 mph..The cloud the objects were in was at 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon..  This, mathmatically,calculates to be at least 4 miles away..  The objects traveled the cloud formation in 1 1/2 seconds.  They would reflect the sun leaving the shaded side of the cloud..  These objects reacted to the sun..  Soon as the sun shined on them they would swoop back into the cloud..  This means to me…  They are living creatures..Not only did they fly like living creatures,they reacted like living creatures..<n>

There are creatures that come and go in our atmosphere.  I say this because iv&#39;e seen them.  These were not your everyday earth inhabiting animal.  Flying in and out of a cloud.  My math is right on.  These were swooping at speeds excessing 500 mph. These were living things and not aircraft.  Nor were they alien aircraft.  These were living creatures flying in our SKIES........And yes I would like to talk with one of you.

I noticed movement flying about in front of one cloud. They appeared to be birds.  But they were flying in and out of this cloud.  The sun was lighting up the left side of the cloud. The under side was gray.  These large birds were reflecting light once they would swoop away from the underside of the cloud into the sun light.  Then would fly back into the cloud and disappear.  Picture 5 or 6 birds swooping in circles in and out of a cloud.  I need to find out what the cloud elavation was this day.  I know it was about one mile away. and by guessing the elavation to be 3 or 4 thousand feet.  And by judging the birds size.I compared them to a jetliner at thirty five thousand feet.I did the math.  I have a degree in eloctronics.  These birds were between 20 and 25 feet in large.  What was strange was that they were moving too fast for the size.  The bigger an animal gets the more slow it moves.  These birds would swoop and turn on a dime and fly,soar like back into the cloud. It seemed to me they were living in this cloud.<n>

At first I believed it to be a light fixture of some kind until I stopped the car to take a closer look and it began to move away from me slowly heading east on Southwest Highway. I still didn’t believe my eyes so I began to move slowly and the object came to a standstill again and I immediately stopped the car and the object began to move away from me once more.  It moved slowly at first but then picked up speed and did a quarter circle turn heading north. I kept my eyes on the sky and about 30 seconds after it was out of view a military airplane, flying low and silent, came flying over head moving in the same direction the object was going. I only recognized the plane because I had seen it before on 9/11 after all commercial planes had been grounded and only military aircraft was in the air that night. I called my girlf! riend and her dad, who live in Hometown, at 11:48pm so maybe they could see it from there house but they didn’t see it. I circled the area for 30min, in hopes to maybe spot it again, but nothing appeared. When I arrived home I was terrified of the events that had just occurred so I called my room mate to meat me outside. I told him what had happened and even drew a picture of the object and to my surprise he found pictures of the object being spotted around the world dating back to 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first thing I noticed was a small dog across the street that was barking excessively.  Up in the sky I saw odd lights hovering. There were two sets of red and blue lights with a large conical spot light in between. I could not make out the shape of an object around the lights in the dark.  I stared in silence and then it began to creep forward slowly. At that point I ran to my car, grabbed my phone, and called a friend. After I quickly explained it to her I ran to the door of my house and called for my stepdad to come outside being he was the only one awake, losing sight of the object for less than 10 seconds. It was moving a steady pace but seemed extremely slow in comparison to how low the object was in the sky. It also made no noise. It had the motion of a helicopter following a high speed car chase but the lights seem much too far apart to resemble a helicopter, and again it made no sound! .  My stepdad came out,  watched it for maybe 15 seconds, dismissed it as an airplane and went inside.  At that point it was a little past our house and I was losing sight of it so I jumped up on the roof of my car and watched until it disappeared into the tree line.<n>

While driving down Latta Rd. we both noticed two bright amber lights in the night sky.  The lights appeared to be around 4-5 blocks in distance from each other.  The lights moved in unision as if they were attached beneath an object.  My husband stopped the car and we both stepped out to get a better look.  The object and the lights continued to glide northward in the sky.  The object seemed to be less than a mile from the ground and floated noiselessly.  Another car came up behind us so we jumped back in the car and turned back to follow the object but soon lost sight of it.  The object did not bear usual markings of explained aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at a bright star when all of a sudden I  noticed a floating object.  At first it looked like a balloon the size of dime as it got closer the object looked oval like the body of a bird without wings.  When the object  floated over me it was the size of a silver dollar or larger that&#39;s when I realized it was a UFO.  There were two blue dots about an inch apart from each other forming a circle.  The blue light forming the circle would rotate in all directions.  It was so beautiful.  When the object would face me full circle the white light in the center would get brighter like electricity. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this ever before. It was breathtaking.  I couldn&#39;t get my eye&#39;s away from it.  This sighting has been an awakening moment for me.  I now know that we are being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

After I finished smoking my cigarette, I decided that it was nice enough out to merit staying out there.  I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane; I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn&#39;t have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare; but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed; a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east; at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn&#39;t able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I&#39;m posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs. I ended up on this website and decided to look at what other sightings have happened in my state. I came across a report in which the poster said they were on States Bridge Rd. near a subdivision named Double Gate. By car, I live not even 5 minutes away from that subdivision.<n>

It was a bit more jagged than the normal “saucer” with a slight rectangle/diamond design. There were no lights of any kind on the object but there was a slight haze around the entire thing. I watched it hover in the sky, for roughly 3-5 mins before I completely lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, take any medication, and I don’t wear glasses or contacts. While I do believe in &#34;other&#34; life forms out in space, I’m not one to believe UFO sightings or abductions. There were trees in my view but the object was above them so they didn’t cause any problems. This event did happen at night around 11:30PM but I was wide awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m honestly blown away by what I witnessed tonight; I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw. I’m not normally one to jump to conclusions or anything but I felt it deep within me that this was not a normal aircraft. I still can’t believe I actually witness this event, whenever anyone asks me about ghosts, etc. I tell them, I believe they MIGHT exist but I will never say they do till I witness it for myself. Well tonight, I witnessed a UFO sighting.<n>

I was on my way to bed around 11:30pm when I went for one last cigarette, and when I looked up into the sky I saw a strange flashing object way up in the sky above my trailer park. This would be in the North East. The object stayed there for a while and bounced around in the sky from NNE to the North. I had just purchased a camcorder about a month before hand primarily for use in recording precious moments of my baby girl, so I went in grabbed the camcorder came out and started filming the thing, this time it was down lower in the sky. I then went in grabbed a flashlight, and the object flashed brighter at me when I flashed the flashlight at it, before it slowly made its way due North through the tree line. I immediately filed a police report and the officers looked at me as if I were a kook even though I had showed them the video. Later that morning my husband told me it may have been an in ! flight jet refueling procedure, but over our town? So I phoned the Cold Lake Alberta Air force base and reported my sighting there. Needless to say although I’m a new mother with a sound mind and had many respected positions in my careers, I have been receiving flak about my experience. Upon researching websites, over the weeks following this incident, I was shocked to see how many reports of UFO’s there actually are, and that this object has been seen in this part of northern Alberta for over the past ten years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the first video of the object: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5R8i8XHt2g  I find I couldn’t sleep and I went out ever night watching and waiting for this object to return. On May 24th around 3 am, I saw the thing again over the Catholic school, so I jumped in my car told my husband to watch the baby and went to the field near the school to try to get a better image of it. I made sure I purchased a tripod for the camcorder and this time brought along a 3 million candle powered flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discovered upon flashing the spotlight at the object the thing seemed to get scared? It went dark took off and stopped over the sawmill that my husband later estimated is about five kilometers from the school straight to the east. After about five minutes, the thing disappeared. I turned to go back to my car in the parking lot, when suddenly the thing reappeared over the trailer park again. It made a white semi circle glare, went dark and then sped off towards the radio towers north of town. I jumped in my car and followed the thing that stayed stationary over the field north of the towers. I couldn’t get it on video because the thing had turned its lights off? But now I wonder if I was just following a satellite that disappeared, and I was just seeing things above the field? Needless to say I got really spooked standing out in the middle of a dark back road trying to get a (?) on video. I decided to get out of there, and head for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now I think I’ve gone crazy, my husband doesn’t believe me, and is questioning if I’m fit to raise our daughter. I keep watching the video trying to stop the frames to get a clear view of whatever it could be which I’m sure my husband was thrilled about. When on May 28th around 11:30 or a bit later before midnight, the weather had turned cloudy, so I decided to actually stop waiting for this thing to come back, and actually get to bed at a decent time. I was going for my last cigarette when low and behold there it was again this time up in the clouds to the NNW, shining away. The weather had turned overcast, and I checked the cloud ceiling on the weather network later to discover the ceiling was at 3900ft. So I’m estimating that the object was another 500feet into the clouds. I keep my camera on a tripod now by the door, so grabbed it and started filming the object, and finally got a clear image of the thing. Its maneuverability is unbelievable, yet I still question coul! d this be a night kite an old man supposedly flies in a field a kilometer north from my doorstep? I got my husband out of bed, and he now believes me Thank-GOD! He says this definitely is not an old mans kite with LED lights on it. I looked everywhere online for any new technology a person could buy and place on a kite that would make it glow and pulsate like that, but so far haven’t turned up anything remotely close to this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s the new clearer video I shot of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SOu7NTHY-w  If anybody knows what this might be, please contact me through this report, Thank-you.<n>

It made no sounds and floated by like a balloon but moved to fast to keep up with on foot . It passed behind some trees and i ran to try to get ahead of it , but it was gone as quickly as it appeared . With the exception of the glare on its sides whch appeared to me to be dim lights , it could just as easily been anything . The light could have been reflecting off something else because for what I could see , this thing almost blended perfectly with the night sky except for its reflective ability . Maybe it was a stealth , but I think that if I had a rifle , that it was close enough to hit . I just want to know if anyone else saw this thing in my area , and was this a real sighting .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It shined brightly, and pulsated, however, only white light that I could see.  I realized that the star was too low, compared to others in the night sky.  The sky was clear, with a few clouds.  The circle was over a house (at least it appeared to be) and was low in the sky.  I took out my binoculars and looked at the object, which glowed, then slightly dimmed.  I saw no aircraft lights, and it did not move from side to side, but appeared to hover over the home.  I called my daughter and my son to look at it.  They came out, and we were watching it, when it disappeared.  It was there and then was gone.  I have never seen anything like it.  Can someone tell me if there was any experimental aircraft in the area?  I know the base is nearby.  It was just crazy, because I keept looking for it after it disappeared, but didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a long distance away and difficult to make out, but looked elongated, almost like two lights, one atop of the other.  Unfortunately, couldn&#39;t find our adult binoculars and resorted to an old pair of toy binoculars...  when I looked through these from our driveway outside I noticed a similar light slightly above, distant from, and to the left of the big light straight ahead.  Through the toy binocs, the light periodically looked triangular in shape with a red center and white border (though this may have been a manifestation of the poor lenses).  My husband looked through and described the same color.  Both lights remained stationary for about half an hour until apparent cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this night however, three of us were present.  Unless you&#39;re using your peripheral vision, your eyes won&#39;t &#34;catch&#34; the flash of light high in the night sky, just above the atmosphere is my assumption.  This night, I caught the first bright flash and fixed the position to where I could point it out.  The light flashes are random, but the flashes happened often enough and they got progressively dimmer which indicates the object was moving away from us.  From our location, these objects are going towards the star system Orion.  It wasn&#39;t until a recent visit by US Navy aircraft that I noticed the same random light flashing pattern of their flashing beacon lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

United States I observed the following; I was sitting on the couch in the living room when I heard my wife yelling’ “babe you gotta see this”, I ran to the side porch and observed two large orange lights that seemed to be floating upwards. My view was obstructed by a tree in my side yard so I ran with my wife to the street where I observed a total of six (6) round, bright orange lights that seemed to be at a very low altitude coming from the North and gaining altitude slowly as they headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to follow each other in more of a floating manner like a balloon, than that of a helicopter or other aircraft. The objects made no sound. I do not believe these objects were balloons because of their size which on a pretty clear night seamed huge. From my perspective they appeared to be about a half a mile away at their closest (about a minute after we first spotted them). And again, (from my perspective) they appeared to be the size of a bus or larger only round and bright orange. I called my daughter and her boyfriend outside with her phone to try and get video but was unable, they also saw the object’s towards the end of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From beginning to end, we probably only observed the object’s for maybe two minutes, but I will never forget those two minutes. As the objects floated upwards they disappeared into high clouds, we also observed some type of aircraft flying towards the object’s as they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A passer by walked up and said, “Did you just see that, what was it!” we all went inside and expected to see “the lights”, all over the news and internet, but can’t find anything?? Still looking!<n>
5/1/10 21:00|Tularosa|NM|Unknown|~30 minutes|UFO shot down over Civilians?|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96528.html|324|ndxe201005| UFO shot down over Civilians?<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 years ago, in roughly the late spring/early summer of 2010, around 9 PM, I saw something that I can&#39;t even begin to understand.  It&#39;s even hard to explain, just because we don&#39;t have the vocabulary for what I saw, but I will do my best to describe it to you.  Maybe (hopefully), one of your readers saw the same thing and can help me TO describe it. (lol)<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, we live near an active Air Force Base and Missile Range, so hearing planes and sonic booms is nothing but background noise to us.  What made this night so unusual, was the number of planes SCREAMING over our house that late at night.  It literally sounded like a war was going on outside.  Complete with, what sounded like, explosions.  I used to be in the Army and supported the infantry guys, so I got used to the  sound of explosions, just not over civilians.  It got me VERY concerned.  I went out onto my back porch which faced the AF Base to see what in the heck was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look out my back porch door, and saw what looked like a flare shooting up from the base.  I kept thinking, I know those things are bright, but there is NO way I could see a flare that well from this distance (approx 20 miles as the crow flies from their testing area to give you perspective).  I realized then that it was a missile they were shooting!  And from my point of view, directly towards civilian houses.  It hit something REALLY big.  This is the part I will have a hard time explaining, we really don&#39;t have words for this next part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the missile hit whatever it was, and it looked like a dead on hit, it didn&#39;t act like any explosion I have ever seen.  This is the only way I can describe this so I&#39;m sorry, but you know the movie Independence Day, when they shoot all the missiles at the ships in the beginning and it hits a force field?  It looked like that, without all the green special effects.  The explosion wrapped around whatever it was.  I could actually SEE the explosion wrap around whatever it was.  It was no plane I&#39;d ever seen.  It looked like it was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. with a weird cigar shaped looking front and no wings.   I saw the bits of the missile fall down and then nothing after that.  The next day they had helicopters everywhere in the direction of what I saw, and way more jets out then usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that&#39;s my story, it&#39;s definitely the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen, and even now my brain has a hard time comprehending what I saw.  It makes no sense you know?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object appeared within moments after the fully set and visually appeared to be approximately 5-8 miles off the coastline.  The object was cigar shaped, it was vertical and looked like a ray of light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat stationary for about two minutes.  It began to move at the pace of a jet airliner although. Suddenly, it stopped and then sat stationary again for about 30 seconds, after that it began to move closer, maybe a mile, nothing more than that. It started to move around again at a jet airliner pace in the sky but it swayed back and forward. After about five minutes of witnessing the entire phenomena, it quickly dissipated and faded into the atmosphere.  Its camouflage mechanism made it hard to capture a phone picture.  Additionally, the twilight was not helpful in trying to get a photo as the entire sky blended in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Others that witnessed the sunset and the unusual sighting directly following the sunset that evening were talking about it amongst each other although no group made a big deal about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should probably mention that I posted a Facebook post about the sighting to my friends and after I posted that, Facebook on my phone coincidentally is all in Spanish and I cannot get it back into English anymore.<n>

After about 10 min they started moving at a what seemed a slow speed, both together but not as a formation and I had to get back to work so I left. Maybe weather balloons? I don&#39;t know what they were, haven&#39;t told anyone. Never seen anything like them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/1/10 06:00|Fruitland|ID|Triangle|5 minutes|Triangular shaped something hovering over a dairy farm.|2/18/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80101.html|329|ndxe201005| Triangular shaped something hovering over a dairy farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m actually a little embarrassed to be writing this, but here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened last year but I’m unsure of the exact date.  I know that it was spring or early summer because it was early morning but light outside, more like dawn when the sun was just coming up, and when I stepped outside, I wasn’t cold at first.  Everyone was still in bed except for me because I tend to get up at 4 or 5 in the morning to get a jump start on my day’s work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do medical transcription from home and the back porch has been converted into a home office.  There’s a large window behind my computer and as I sat working, something caught my eye through the curtains.  When I work I tend to get into a sort of &#34;zone&#34; where I space out everything that is going on around me and so I’m not really sure if it was movement or light that snapped me out of my work trance, but when I looked up and out my window I spotted something odd.  There were lights that were out of place and didn’t make any sense to me and it piqued my interest enough that I got up from my desk and stepped outside onto my back steps and looked to the east.  I live beside an interstate highway and on the other side of the highway is a dairy farm.  Floating over the dairy was a triangular shaped something.  It was massively huge and made the buildings look small.  It was triangular but not pointy and appeared to be silver and metallic but not really shiny.  The back end that was facing me had large square lights across the entire width so that the part that was facing me was lit up, but it wasn’t exactly bright.  It reminded me of windows in a skyscraper that are lit up that you look at from a distance, bright but not blinding.  I don’t think the sides had lights, but I can’t honestly be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just hovered there and I never seen any sort of movement at all.  I also heard no noise.  I just stood there in awe and kind of overwhelmed.  I honestly can’t explain what was going through my mind but I sort of snapped out of it and realized that my bare feet were getting cold and I went back inside.  I don’t have any sense of time about it so I may have stood there half a minute or it may have been 20 minutes, I don’t know.  I wanted to run in and wake my husband up but felt silly because when I looked out the window again the thing was gone and I have no explanation how it disappeared so quickly because it literally took me just a few seconds to walk inside and look back out the window.  The weird thing is, the entire time I stood there dumbfounded it never occurred to me to grab my camera even though it was only a few feet away in my office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve thought about this a lot over the last year and have almost convinced myself that it was a dream, although I know deep down that it wasn’t, it just was so unreal.  I’ve told a couple of people including my husband and mom, but I don’t tend to spread the word around because I feel embarrassed; it just sounds so farfetched.  On top of that, the how-could-no-one-else-have-seen-it factor comes in.  I mean it was over an active dairy farm and next to a freeway.  In the morning the freeway is slower than during the afternoon, but still, something that huge not being seen seems odd to me.  But then I think about the speed limit being 75 and so maybe people could have missed it.  Or maybe people seen it but zipped by so fast that it didn’t register with them.  I really don’t know.  Like I said, it feels very dream-like but I’m 100% sure it wasn’t a dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/10 01:00|San  Carlos|CA|Triangle|25 -40 seconds|I can't explain what i saw but it is the first time in my life i saw something that i couldn't  make up a story about.|3/16/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87716.html|330|ndxe201005| I can&#39;t explain what i saw but it is the first time in my life i saw something that i couldn&#39;t  make up a story about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back home, north bound up hwy 280 at around 1am from a friend’s house in Santa Clara which is about 25 miles south from where I live.  There was hardly any traffic in the south bound lanes so I didn’t have any vision problems from on- coming traffic.  I’m very observant of my surrounds and even the sky.  The pacific coast is to my left as I’m driving north ans I was looking up at the sky and I noticed to my left at 10 O’clock high, I saw this bright green object hovering and it was stationary and it was like a fluorescent color.i was looking back and forth from the hwy to up at the object and then it moved in a straight line because when  it moved, it left a green trail ,same color as the object.  This lasted maybe between 25 to 45 seconds but after it moved everything disappeared.  But while I was looking at the object, I made sure there were no reflections from the car hood, windshield, or any nearby objects such as traffic lights causing a reflect! ion on my windshield.  Approximate distance the object traveled was maybe 10-15 miles.  Sorry but I didn&#39;t have time to get my camera out since I was driving and it was only for a very short time.  I do not drink,smoke,or do drugs and my IQ is 155\<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
