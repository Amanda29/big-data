5/31/09 22:00|Grafton|WV|Light|45 minutes at least|Many strange blinking multi-colored lights video taped in the sky over Grafton, West Virginia.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70307.html|2|ndxe200905| Many strange blinking multi-colored lights video taped in the sky over Grafton, West Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not state for sure that what me and my husband both saw was certainly a UFO, but we can think of no other possibilities.  I am a housewife who has been interested in UFO&#39;s since young and my husband flies planes for CAP. My husband has never seen anything like this before. It was sometime between 8pm and 10 pm when I went onto the back deck behind my home and noticed a very strange light in the sky. I had seen it the night before in almost the same position at almost the same time.  Last night, it was again in almost the same place.  There are no towers of any sort in that place.  The light seemed to turn colors.  It seemed to change from white to blue to red and green.  It stayed in the same place for at least 45 minutes.  I went in after that as it was too cold to stay out and keep watching it.  I got some of it on video and I would be more than happy to share that with you if you wish to see it. When I zoomed in with my camera the light seemed to have a haze about it and it appeared to wiggle, although my hands were very steady. It appeared to be changing shape or size.  It was very difficult to see considering I was only using a camera. While taping the object, I noticed at least 3 other lights, perhaps up to 10 or more, going across the sky.  I cannot say for sure what those other lights were.  They appeared to be much smaller in size and white in color.  They appeared out of nowhere and would sometimes fly past the main light or in other directions in the sky.  They would fly very quickly by and then disappear or fly out of sight.  They blinked.  At one point, I saw a light fly across the sky that was bright orange.  It also blinked.  Later, I saw another light fly across the sky flashing red and white lights. I am not an astronomer, so I cannot say for sure what I saw.  I have tried finding this information on the internet to no avail.  I know that these lights are not like anything I have ever seen.  If anyone knows what I saw, please let me know.  It is bothering me.  My h! usband s aid that the main light was the space station.  However, I looked this information up on the internet and found that the space station does not sit still in one place nor does it change color. As I stated, I have the video tape if you would like to review it. Let me know if this interests you and I will put it onto my computer from the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Second sighting was 4 lights (V shaped again)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 05/31/2009 Approximately 9:40 pm Fostoria, OH 44830 Latitude: 41° 9&#39;39.59&#34;N Longitude: 83°25&#39;15.38&#34;W Weather: Clear, 65° F, no wind   My wife and I were sitting in our backyard having a campfire when I looked up to the sky.  I was just about to comment on how clear the night was when I noticed some lights to the north heading directly towards us.  Keeping my eyes on what I was witnessing I pointed to the lights and said to my wife, &#34;Look up, look up, look up.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw were two banks of four lights.  Each of the lights was parallel to one another and they appeared to have a similar formation to a flock of geese, or the delta formation flown by military aircraft.  The individual lights weren’t round, but linear in appearance.  They weren’t bright white, but rather dim and tanish color. Each bank of lights was swept back to the next, as if they were mounted to the underside of the wings of a fighter jet.  Four lights on the starboard wing, four on portside.  The lights didn’t blink.  They didn’t get brighter or dimmer, just a constant, steady light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights got closer, the formation became more disheveled.  When they were almost directly overhead, they stopped moving in a southerly direction, hovered for a few seconds, then headed northward, where they just came from, reforming the original formation.  Only this time, four of the lights were gone and the remaining four continued north.  As they flew away it appeared that they were either turning off one by one, or they merged into one single light before vanishing.  It looked more like they merged into a single light which then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the lights were, they appeared to be low enough for the campfire light to illuminate them (or at least appear so).  While my mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing, I thought they might be a flock of birds with their undersides getting lit up by the fire.  My wife quickly told me, “Those aren’t birds.  Birds don’t glow in the dark”.  And she was right, those were not birds.  The whole spectacle lasted for what seemed like fifteen to twenty seconds and we didn’t hear a thing.  The object(s) were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this, I went into the house to describe what we had just seen to my kids.  My wife stayed outside watching the night sky for any more signs of anything unusual.  A couple minutes later my wife came inside and said that she had just seen a shooting star off to the east.  She said that she had never seen a tail on a shooting star as long as the one she just witnessed.  I don’t know if this has anything to do with the encounter that we had just seen, but I figured I’d throw it into this story anyhow.  We seen no more “meteorites” for the rest of the evening and hadn’t seen any prior to this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, son and myself went back outside to watch the sky some more.  We noticed an unusually high number of aircraft flying in the sky.  I knew that they were planes because they had flashing beacons and the usual look of planes flying at night.  We saw three or four aircraft to the north, a couple more to the west, a couple to the south and east.  They all appeared to be flying in their own directions, no formation of any sort and they didn’t go away.  You could look in any direction and see planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes after the sighting my neighbor got home from work.  I was describing to him what my wife and I had just seen when he looked off to the west and said, “What the hell?”  I looked over and I said, “That’s it! That’s what we just saw!”  A bank of four lights was flying low, heading in a southerly direction again, coming from the north.  This time the lights appeared to be much farther away from us.  They weren’t directly over us this time.  The lights were moving pretty fast and then they turned and traveled in a westerly direction before converging into one light and disappearing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all kept scanning the sky discussing what we had seen, trying to come up with some logical explanation.  My neighbor went inside to call some of his friends and he told his dad what we had seen.  His dad came outside and we talked about the lights.  While discussing the evening’s events I looked up and saw a single light flying extremely fast through the sky.  There were no flashing lights and the object (which I think was a military jet) was flying in a southeastern direction.  I’m assuming the light was the afterburner from the aircraft.  It disappeared behind my house and I lost site of it.  The same aircraft, or maybe another one, then appeared from the same general direction, moving slower and in a northerly direction as if the aircraft we just saw slowed down and turned left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we had seen did not appear to be &#34;normal&#34; our geographical area.  We’ve spent many nights outside with and without campfires and never seen anything like this.  The sightings of the unidentifiable groups of lights and the large number of aircraft in the vicinity made this evening very unique to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t get any video or photographs of the object(s).  They never reappeared once we had the camera in-hand.  I hope my MS Paint sketch at least gives a decent depiction of what I witnessed.<n>
5/31/09 21:39|Cincinnati (Milford)|OH|Sphere|2 minutes|My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70299.html|4|ndxe200905| My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on I-275 South(east) towards Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. As I was driving south I looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me I saw a glowing orange sphere. I knew it was not a meteorite because I was driving for a good minute before I drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). I kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. She could not see it from her angle. I did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. As we drove underneath the object I made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. I have never pulled over for something like this before, as I have always been able to identify an object, until now. As I was slowing down I kept trying to look up and I almost hit the guardrail as I was pulling over. My wife yelled me to watch out. This did not make her happy since it was her car. As I stopped the car I opened the sunroof and said look! There it was just hovering above us. An orange glowing sphere. The time was 9:39pmEST. It was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. She thinks it was “too high for a helicopter”, but I think it was only about 5000&#39;-10,000’. It was the size of a (small) dime. Of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. It did not have any other colored lights on it. Just an orange glowing &#34;sphere&#34;. I should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light. Sphere matches the best visual description. The light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. My wife and I were going through a detailed Q&amp;A trying to discern what it was. It was not moving, on any plane (X,Y, or Z). There were no conventional Nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of t! here bec ause I woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. I did not want to leave because I wanted to wait and see it move. I wanted to see its propulsion. Was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? This would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. Very frustrated, I decided to heed the wife’s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After safely merging back on I-275, I immediately called my mother&#39;s house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). My stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. He saw nothing. We reached exit 59 within a minute (Milford Parkway) and looked to our right (north). You could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. We arrived home about 5 minutes later, then I made calls to friends and family and now I’m typing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The credibility of the witnesses (my wife and I) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. We are also well known and respected in the community. In addition I am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of ALL active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects). If it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can Google and contact me. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Strange unconventional movement  within the formation.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70293.html|5|ndxe200905| Formation sighted over Santo Domingo.   Strange unconventional movement  within the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Formation of 5 or 6  very dim lights (at first they tricked me into believing I was looking at the Pleiades),was first eye contacted about 45° elevation comming almost perfectly from the East; maybe 75 to 80°azimuth.  Passed directly over zenith (90°)overhead heading straigh West.  Total span about twice the diameter of a full moon; about 1-1.5°.  Triangular formation.  No Noise.  No visible bird wing flapping (usually synced from my experience).  Extremely linear movement without any signs of change of direction.  Very interesting and what to me gave this out as a UFO sighting is the fact that the most southern speck of luminosity in the triangular formation(almost seemed light emitted phosphorescently and not reflected from underplaced city lighting displaced itself from the pack in a most graceful, smooth and harmonic manner.  This displacement was maybe equal to the width of the pack.  Once the diplaced light assumed its origina position the contrary one (the northern speck of light)repeated the exact same movement.  It was lost in sight about 15 to 20° after passing the zenith due to physical wall and roof limits in my house.  No noise before or after its passing....no doppler effect, no low frequency noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting came to me at the moment I was talking through my mobile phone.  We were agreeing on the agenda of the astonomy observing night to take place next wednesday. I had my patio lights off to familiarize myself with the night sky and constellation so as to prepare the observation objects for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer with public functions and responsibilities in the area of astronomy.  I know my celestial objects.  I am also a recording engineer...I Know about sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were definitely not birds to me.  I have a perfect 20:20 vision.  I saw no movement withing the pack. All &#34;stars&#34; were the same color though they seemed a bit greenish reminding me of phosphorescent specks in wristwatches.  I figured that if a bird leaves a &#34;V&#34; formation while traveling at the same speed it would have ended behind the pack when it regained its position.  Its was also very suspicious to see the same thing happen on the opposite 180° place of the &#34;V&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can assure:  It was not a meteor breaking up.  It was not an airplane.  They were not flying birds.<n>

It was moving left to right, up and down. I told my son, I had to go I would call him back. My first thought was to use my cell phone to video it, however I am not to savy on how to. So I stood there for about a minute watching it. I then decided to run in the house and get my digital camera/video to record it. It only took my 15 seconds to do so. When I got outside I seen it off in the far distance heading towards the Gulf (I live in Lousiana). I came in the house and went to this web site for MUFON and reported it. About 12:30pm I was talking on the phone to an investigator about what I had seen. WHile talking to her, I seen it 2 more times!<n>

The moon was approximately 45 to 60 degrees angle from my position. I told my girlfriend to look and then the object slowly moved in front of the moon. It appeared to have light and looked similar to venus or mars when present later in the afternoon when the sun is still out. After the object moved in front of the moon it then dropped about 10 moons down below the moon where it held a position for approximately 10 minutes. After trying to observe the object with binoculars it soon faded and then disappeared. After making a few phone calls it appeared once again about 7-10 minutes later and looked different and more like an orange balloon. It once again was above the moon about 3 moons to the upper right and then dropped below the moon to the right and held its position for about 5 minutes then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flipped rapidly during its descent, like a coin that had been tossed in the air.  It suddenly stopped plummeting and at incredible speed zipped back and forth for a few seconds, then diagonally upward, until out of sight, above and south of the Tech Center in Greenwood Village.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Walking down Hwy 89 past Ben Lomond Golf Course.  I saw a spherical object up over the mountain far to the right side of Ben Lomond Mountain.  I thought it was a familar vintage helicopter I&#39;ve seen before.  It had a bright flashing light which I now believe was sun reflecting off one part and it rotated.  However, it was stationary only slightly moving either towards or away from me.  It started traveling upwards and then did so at a constant velocity.  It went up and up for a very long time until I could no longer see it.  Then a big silver military plane flew over the mountain area at a very high altitude.  No sounds or emissions of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else here in Ogden saw something exactly the same as this  on 1/10/2009.<n>

They were both slowly moving southward and were at the the time when I saw them the brightest objects in the sky besides the moon.  The lights were moving so slowly that it was actually hard to tell they were moving unless you compared them to the stars in the background.  When I was sure that they were not stars or satellites, or anything explainable I asked my girlfriend to come around to my side of the van to look at the lights.  She did, she saw them too, but by the time she came around they had already become much dimmer as we looked on they just disappeared. Im at a loss to explain it so I just want to report it.<n>

The eight other ones were a lot clearer to be seen they looked like the cylinder of a revolver with a ghost like glow to them the movement was kind of like a wobble or tumble, some of the guests described them to look like angels. What I seen had anywhere from five to eight lights in the rear. The only good example I have is if you ever seen jellyfish or squid and the way light reflects off of them under water it was very strange and life changing to me. The sky was very clear that night, and these objects moved with no sound. The ages of the people were forteen to forty one, and all of us prior to the sighting were all sceptics on ufos, that&#39;s not the case now. None of us were intoxicated, and all of us are having a hard time trying to reason all of this. Thanksele<n>

It was an orange orb the was moving at a slightly fast pace. It made no sound and never changed direction. It was going southwest to northeast. It left no contrails nor did It flash or blink. It was below the clouds or it was bright enough to be seen without any change while in the clouds. As it was about over the City of Erie it began to to get much smaller. It disappeared then reappeared a few times then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

His job duties prevented him from staying in the area and observing the object further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that there is a small airfield approximately 15 miles to the north of his location. Despite this he was positive that the light in no way resembled any craft he&#39;s aware of.<n>

5/30/09 20:45|Columbus|NJ|Other|approx 3 min|First time for everything !|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70465.html|22|ndxe200905| First time for everything !<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 2045 hours I looked out of our second floor bathroom window to check the weather . Brought to my immediate attention was a very bright (brighter than a KC-10 landing light seen at one half mile distance) , very large (larger than a seedless grape viewed at arms length) , object which was shaped in the form of a child&#39;s &#34;top&#34; .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was spatially stationary (I fixed its position relative to two near tree branches.) , although it was rotating counter-clockwise at (best guess) about one RPM . It&#39;s color was &#34;opalescent&#34; white ; there was a small red , eccentrically located red light near the upper portion which rotated as if fixed to the object . As a &#34;best guess&#34; , I&#39;d estimate the object to be about two or two and one half miles distant , the direction being to the N.N.W. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for atmospheric conditions , the sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 3k feet . The object appeared to be approx 1.5 to 2.0 k feet above ground level .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object (with fascination !) for about three minutes , after which I left the bathroom so as to procure a camera . When I returned , the object was no longer viable . I continued to observe the area for about two minutes , at which point I noted two slow moving &#34;conventional&#34; aircraft circling the area where the unidentifiable object had been sighted . These &#34;conventional&#34; aircraft were circling in a 360 degree &#34;holding pattern&#34; , about 500 feet above and roughly a half mile beyond the diameter of the unidentified craft . Although I could ascertain no distinct shape of the two circling smaller aircraft , I assumed them to be helicopters (nav lights , and air speed too slow for fixed-wing) from McGuire A.F.B.  I watched the circling aircraft for an additional five minutes or so , and retired for the night .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke at approx 0400 , and immediately (even before coffee !) checked the television news programing for additional details about the very strange object - There was none . The network news did (at about 0920) , however , make mention that some people in Arizona had become alarmed after viewing a U.S.A.F. weather balloon .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why did I wait so long to report such a strange object , when its size surly must have attracted the attention of very many people ? Although I&#39;d never witnessed such a thing before , I suppose that the answer would have roots related to both a sense of frustration/disappointment and the potential risk of loss of credibility . If you&#39;ve &#34;stayed with me this far&#34; , I&#39;ll seize the opportunity to note that I&#39;ve been an aerophile (an airplane &#34;affectation&#34;)for over fifty years , that I&#39;m a former member of the United States Parachuting Association , and that I&#39;m an armature (very)astronomer .<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing , although the experience only lasted for about three minutes , it was quite a show ! I thank you for your kind attention .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely , ((name and specialty deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This happened and stopped our evening in its tracks for hours..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what it wasn&#39;t but i have no idea what it is..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the blue ridge mountains of Virginia, the nearest large town would be Floyd, VA, at my family farm and we had just gotten done building a deck on a new house on my property. My father was sitting in a chair facing north and me and my buddy were facing him to the south-south east standing up. The time was approx 2000hrs EST on 05-30-2009 and it was still fairly bright and cloudless sky. My father asked &#34;what is that? is that a planet&#34; and pointed over our heads toward the north. We turned around and observed a sphere shaped object brightly illuminated and about 3mm in relative size. I later shot an azimuth from my compass and it was 20 deg (magnetic north, declination for that area is 8deg W so approx 12deg true) and approx 50 deg from horizon.  it was the brightest object we have ever seen that seemed to be either a planet, star or a satellite. my dad was still sitting and asked &#34;is that moving?&#34; i tried to keep it referenced to the roof of the house to see if it w! as but i couldn&#39;t tell. he said that before he said anything to us it had moved down about 10deg.  we all looked through 20 power bino&#39;s and all saw that it was round and completely illuminated equally around but nothing else remarkable about it.  we came to the conclusion that it was a northern geo-stationary satellite but were not satisfied with that due to that it looked way to close to our location and from its large size. (after finally getting back to civilization i tried to find what sats are stationary in the northern sky&#39;s and couldn&#39;t locate any, any help on that? are there any?)  we watched it for approx 45 mins and our talk turned to other strange things we have seen in the sky over the years and about watching satellites floating by.  We all went inside to grab some chow and came back outside to eat and the object was gone. This kind of made us re-think what it was we saw..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now we were really into talking about what that was and had our heads strained to the sky. My buddy spotted a satellite traveling north to south at around 60deg from horizon. it was now approx 2045 hours and some of the brighter stars are appearing.  i picked up visual of the object and it seemed to be just a satellite, the dull glow, size and speed were typical.  My dad was having a hard time picking it up so i spotted a bright star (Ive tried to figure out exactly which star it was but i couldn&#39;t tell you) the star was to the SSE and at around 45/50 deg to the horizon and the brightest object in that sector. I asked my dad to look at that star and i began to call out the position of the satellite, ie; &#34;its 9 o&#39;clock high about 3 hand widths away, now its 10 o&#39;clock its now at the 11 o&#39;clock&#34; all relative to the bright star.. and so on, he still was having trouble picking it up. I finally had him look at the 2 o&#39;clock position and a hand width away and me and my friend cal! led it out &#34;its now at its 12, 12:30, 1 o&#39;clock...&#34; and as it got to the 2:30 position it just stopped. we both yelled out &#34;it freaking stopped!&#34; it didn&#39;t slow down, it didn&#39;t fade out, it stayed a constant brightness and speed until it just stopped dead..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point i was really freaked. my father never did get to see it before it stopped but saw it after the fact but now it looked like a regular dim star..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my bud never let our eyes off of the object for the next 4 hours. we actually took turns resting our necks. we finally just layed down and kept on starring at it waiting for it to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> during this i would see flashes of light popping off in specks near it and other lights that looked like it was radiating out of the object but dismissed them to my eyes playing tricks. at one point i saw a beam of white light come from the 7:30 position from the object and shoot out approx one inch ( these will all be relative size to the object) this lasted a brief second. a few mins after that happened my friend said &#34;i swear i saw something shoot out of that thing&#34; and he recanted the same story as to what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> about an hour later i saw another beam of light from the object, this time it looked like a harpoon getting shot out, kind of squiggly and again about an inch out but this time from the 5 O&#39;Clock position. we both said &#34;whoa!&#34; and both described the same thing to my father independently so we wouldn&#39;t feed off each others story..<n> <n><n> <n><n> during this time we saw up wards of 20+ satellites floating by, all stayed on normal path and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at one point toward the end of our event we saw a flash of light approx 2 inches to the 5 o&#39;clock to the object and faded to a dimmer light. this object was round and looked like a satellite in brightness after it dimmed. this new object began to track south but after about 3 inches of travel it made a 90 deg turn and tracked easterly and quickly grew dimmer and smaller as if it was traveling to a higher altitude. we lost it after 7 inches of travel.. we continued our vigil to not loose sight of the original object that stopped moving until we lost sight of it behind a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i would have not spent one of the few days i get to spend time with my father and my best friend watching something in the sky that wasn&#39;t something that needed attention. i wouldn&#39;t have reported this and would have just added this to my list of strange stuff Ive seen if i hadn&#39;t heard i guy on the radio saying almost the exact story of what we saw and around the same date but in the western U.S... this needed to be documented. i know it wasn&#39;t a crazy story with an unknown spacecraft but like i said before.... i know what it wasn&#39;t, but i have no idea what it was. if someone can explain what i saw please do, its bothering me a bit..<n>

It was approxamaitly 6:30pm and my brother and I were driving north on I75.  It was a bright day so I wore my contact lenses and sunglasses..(very important key fact to the incident)  At the time, the highway curved northwest near the gave exit from 470 to I75.  I could see a shining metalic shape in the sky.  I couldn&#39;t say if it was more oval or teardrop shaped.  In a split second from seeing it, I removed my sunglasses to see it.  I could not see it but didn&#39;t have a clue as to why.  When I put the sunglasses back on, I caught a small glimpse of it and it just vanished.  I don&#39;t know if it seriously vanished or moved at such a high speed that I didn&#39;t catch it quick enough.  I scanned the skies and saw 3 planes in the sky.  They must have been comerical jets as there were no formation, which led me to believe there was no chase involved.  The planes were evident due to the contrails and they were visible with out the sun glasses.  After careful thought, I considered the idea that this metalic shape could not be seen with out the sun glasses because while with the sun glasses, the color mimiced that of the day time sky.  Sort of a camafloge so to speak.  I referenced it to my brother, but he is a non believer in such things and dismissed the thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter (15 years old) and I were sitting on the deck of my condo when I noticed a very shiny silver object traveling across the sky at a fairly fast speed. We ran to the front of the house to continue to watch it. It was moving so fast I did not have time to grab a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be traveling around 20,000 feet in the air. It made no sound whatsoever. It had no noticeable wings. It seemed more roundish than disk shaped. There was no exhaust, but there seemed to be a very strange long object hanging straight down from it. Almost like the tail of a kite. The length of the &#34;tail&#34; was several times the size of the object and just hung straight down like a solid object. The tail was also very faint and hard to see in comparison to the very shiny object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred on Saturday, May 30 at around 6:25 pm. It traveled the length of the sky in no more than a couple of minutes. It was heading in a southern direction from Yardley. It is a very clear day with sporadic white clouds. Toward the end of our viewing it went into a thick cloud. However, the object was so shiny with a bright silver color, that we could still it easily while it traveled through the cloud. Then it disappeared in the distance.<n>

At 1700 hours myself and eight other adults noticed a chevron shaped craft fly over us at an altitude of around 3000 ft.  The speed of the craft was very slow and was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought was that it was some type of military drone.  I remembered that I had a camera in my car.  As I ran to my car to get my camera the craft increased speed and altitude.  By the time I started filming the craft, I estimated its altitude to be at over 15,000 feet. The video shows the craft flying in a circular motion in and out of the clouds. After over three minutes of filming, the craft flew out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other adults who witnessed the event were all strangers and I have no way of contacting them. I do frequent the park often with my children. I hope to run into one of the witnesses at the park in the near future. The entire event lasted about ten minutes.<n>

I am located off of Picadilly St. &amp; Netherland St., just north of Smoky Hill Road.  I was checking out the local skies for signs of potential tornado activity. I noticed a white object moving through the sky (heavy winds) as I scanned the sky looking for characteristics of tornado weather. I initially thought I was looking at a balloon or white plastic grocery bag moving across the sky easterly, due to the high winds. I then noticed the object glimmering with the reflection of the sunlight. It appeared silver &amp; shiny (shaped like a small hamburger/ thick frisbee) as it moved across the sky at a high rate of speed. I continued to follow that object visually as it changed direction &amp; then suddenly headed northeast towards Denver International Airport. It continued to travel at the same rate of speed throughout the encounter as it changed direction &amp; headed north. I continued to watch it travel as it disappeared into the horizon, AMAZING!<n>

I didn&#39;t knew where to report it then.  However, I&#39;m reporting it now because I saw an article in my local newspaper today regarding a UFO sighting in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, so I decided to search for a place to report my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a joke.  It was around May or June last year.  I was waiting for my girlfriend in my car at a petrol station directly opposite her house which was location opposite the Malaysia National Zoo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a sunny afternoon.  The time was approximately between 1300 to 1400 hours.  I was looking into the sky because I have a habit of gazing at cloud formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then I noticed a golden sphere object in the air, the color was somewhat rough like sandpaper, perhaps matted. I thought I was seeing things, so just to confirm it, I got out of my car and took a good look at it again.  It was still there hovering about the clouds as though it was trying to use the sun&#39;s glare to cover it&#39;s existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was hovering approximately 10-12 Kilometers above ground level.  I&#39;m not quite good with measurements but it&#39;s about the altitude of a flying airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 to 3 minutes, the UFO started to gain altitude till it disappeared amongst the clouds.  Not sure if it went into space or what, but it certainly doesn&#39;t look like a mirage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t see any proper means of propulsion on the unidentified flying object but it was definitely spherical.  Hope this report helps out the research on UFO.  This was definitely my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the Characteristics check-boxes below fits the description.  The UFO is just as I described it, no lights or anything, it just seems that the gold surface of the UFO reflects the light from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the latitude an longitude according to my search on Google Maps: 3.207056,101.755012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope it helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am contactable through my email: ((e-address deleted)).<n>

I looked up toward the southeast sky and saw a silver sphere shape in the sky and I said out loud &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and my sister said I see it also so we got out of our chairs and walked out into a more open view and watched it for aprox. three minutes as others come over to view it also. The object just stayed in one spot for a few more minutes and then lowered behind a cloud, we continued to watch thinking it was going to come below the cloud but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I asked myself if Venus may be out, but noticed these two objects were too close together to be the two brightest stars in the sky (and also too large and bright),so I kept my focus on them. All of a sudden I saw one of them dash straight up and out of view within a second.  The second object stayed there a moment and did the same thing about a second later.  Much, much too fast to be any type of jet, and much, much too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It would move slightly to the right then left and up and down in small movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing we notice is another bright object is near by and it would flash lights at this other thing also. This went on for three hours.I have pictures that I took and it is amazing what is in the picture. I was afraid nothing would show up since it was so far up but something did.The first one we saw was a light blue color.  The others were simply very bright. The night sky was very clear with all the stars out.I also saw three shooting stars. Most of the time these objects stayed a good distance away from each other,but then would move closer. Our radio would not play that evening unless we held it up high.  I lay there on my blanket scared out of my wits just watching and calling my family to tell them what I was seening.  We also kept hearing a noise every so often. It was  a low metal noise ,like if you had a big piece of tin and was moving it up and down.  Parsons Mountain is a wonderful place to visit and experience new things, if sightings don&#39;t scare you.  This was May 30,2009<n>

Far greater than any known military or commercial aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to bed early on this night and awoke around 12:15am, to a thumping noise.  Although I do not believe the noise is related, I somehow felt the need to look out my window.  I pulled the blinds back and noticed a white hazy object, hovering above the treeline across the street from where I live.  The object was at a distance of anywhere between 5-7 miles away.  It was a particularly clear night and the stars were out.  It was a white light moving in a small circlular patter, very eratically.  I stared in disbelief and then walked outside to observe.  It was very quiet.  The object hovered for about 3 minutes off to the west and then suddenly shot directly to the north very rapidly, maintaining altitude and distance.  I continued to observe the light for about another minute, before it shot off at an amazing speed toward the north, northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my boyfriend where looking out and I saw a bright bluish looking star, but I had a feeling it wasnt a star so I watched it and it moved. And i told my boyfriend to look at it. It stayed in the same general area but it would move up and down side to side, it would move in circles and it was moving around in the sky for a long time. We got his parents and they saw it too. We also saw about 8 flashes of light across the sky that looked kind of like shooting stars.  We also saw about 4 other stars that were moving like this. But we mainly watched the first one.  I watched it for about 2 hrs.  Part of that time the light got dimmer and dimmer and eventually disappeared but then it came back and it was moving around the sky a lot.  It was too far up to be a plane or anything.  And it wasnt a satellite because it moved around in circles.

Today has changed that factor for the rest of her life .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I have had a previous experience I am a firm believer .  What I saw in 77 changed my attitude for life . I have watched the sky diligently ever since . What I saw today was even more than I witnessed back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whenever the wife and I are out, if I witness anything in the sky that is not immediately identifiable I say,<n> <n><n> There&#39;s a ufo.&#34;   It&#39;s just good clean fun and wishful thinking, until this afternoon at 4:45pm .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are driving east on McKenzie avenue , a very busy street in Victoria bc Canada.  Total clear sky . I spot an object directly in front of us fluttering in the sky , I say the usual comment .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gets closer and we keep trying to figure out what it is . My first thought is a hi tec kite , she says &amp;quot;aluminum weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It keeps getting closer , it is rather large , I would say it is within one mile and approx 1000 feet high .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a perfectly round disc . metallic , darker on one side with a red dome on the shiny titanium looking side . It fluttered and danced in all directions . It even turned totally sideways and looked as thin as a pancake with a red dome .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her at this point &amp;quot;you are witnessing a flying saucer &amp;quot; She does not argue . We watch it for approx 3-4 minutes . Yes , I was in shock myself even though I have always believed . All the time I am driving in four lane traffic . I almost rear ended a guy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stopped at a red light , the guy next to me was not even looking at it . I wanted to say hey buddy can you tell me what I am looking at up there , I said nothing and just kept watching it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the classic saucer , seamless , it floated effortlessly and did all kinds of zig zags .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We phoned radio and TV and no reports . I did notice some people on bikes pointing and watching . However , we are talking a very very busy road , four lanes of traffic , in a very busy part of the city. classic Eventually it turns north away from us , I actually thought of trying to follow it but I could see it was moving fairly steady , I did not try to chase after it . I already knew what I saw and it was as clear as my hand in front of my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one will convince me that military has such an object . This was the same type of description I have heard of since the 50&#39;s. If an army had these we would probably be in a one world government situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a good thing the wife and I saw it together because It is unbelievable unless you see it , even if you are a believer as I have always been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only imagine what the wife must be going through as she has been a total non believer all of her life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think they are getting us ready , to show up like that in such a populated area , bewildering and mind boggling . I think of all the nights I have spent checking the sky , then I am driveling through the city on the way to my moms for dinner , and the most spectacular , amazing event of my life happens .<n>

Si.  The mountain is very large and impressive and it was a beautiful, cloudless day.  At a very high altitude, I saw a shiny, silver saucer.  It moved slightly diagnoal then disappeared.  I pulled over but could not see it again.  I kept my eyes on the sky and a few minutes later saw a dot (like a star) very high in the blue sky.  It not not Venus or a satelite for it shined very bright and was very high.  It moved very fast across the sky then disappeared.  This object (whether it was the same one further away or not) also created an air disturbance in a large radius around it.  The closest thing I can compare this disturbance to was heat waves.  Again, I pulled over but could not find the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mother of two young children who has lived in the Mt. Si area for some time.  I am familair with the patterns of the sky and the way the mountain looks at different times of day.<n>

As I look at the dipper, not sure which one but it was a dipper.. a series of lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched these lights flying in a V-Formation I couldn’t believe my eyes.so I ran inside grabbed my wife.   And showed her the lights.  We both looked in awe.. as the objects was flying.. it then broke into a straight line   &gt; ..   &lt; indicated by the arrows.   This is the formation that the objects flew in, then the middle object took the lead and it then became a V again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked closer and watched and watched this wasn’t a huge massive object.  It was at least 15 small specs.. moving in a synchronized pattern..  It was so far away that the dots looked exactly like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 1 minute for these objects to fly completely across the distance of the sky and out of the horizon at exactly at 11.50 or 11.53 close to those times. These objects appear.. clear as day  if anyone was looking in the sky over Dallas around this time it was almost impossible to miss.. as it flew across the sky in blended in with the stars.  Then re-appeared again same formation same speed a constant movement I don’t know what we saw but we most definitely seen something flying into the bowl of the dipper and proceed to fly across the sky..... the color was specs.... the same color u see when u look at a star...... the objects were flying in a SE direction directly over the Northern part of Dallas....close to the highway of 635 right before the city of Garland<n>

As it got further away it sped up and changed to an orange hue.  Not usre if the colr change was caused by a few whispy clouds or not.

They went from a box formation to triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is for cross reference purposes to note more than one witness to this visual:  Description: My daughter called me stating that the local radio, 97.8 FM (website has audio recording of it) is talking about 11 to 16 disks in the sky above Chandler (she was driving to work and couldn&#39;t see). I went out my front door talking to her and initially looked in the direction of Chandler, NW, to try and see what she was talking about. Didn&#39;t see anything and joked with her about needing to drive into Chandler to try and observe what the radio was talking about. Said good byes. I then went back out and leaned on my Honda roof and slowly started to scan the sky in the direction of Chandler. I then came across 2 white/shiny disks/orbs at about a 35degree angle. They were side by side with about a pinky width between them. I then continued scanning the skyline, due to the reported 11 to 16, and ended up observing 7 more white/shiny orbs/disks at about a 45 degree angle that stuck out against the clear blue sky. This second set of obrs/disks were in 2 groups. One group of three were in a triangle pattern while the other was in a box formation (one orb/disk in each corner of a &#34;box&#34; and a &#34;triangle&#34; formation. Ran in and told my wife (which she just laid there) and then grabbed the camera and proceeded to take 40 pictures with my Vivitar, vivicam 5386, 3x zoom f=5.4-16.2mm. By this time my wife walked out to see what I was talking about (her eyes were still adjusting to waking up, and didn&#39;t see anything). She advised I should wake up my 8yr old to have her come look. During the whole time of observing, I was quit elated that I FINALLY got to see things in the sky. My eyes kept feeling wierd, trying to adjust on such small objects.

The ridge is about 500 feet above the valley floor where the town is situated.  I was looking east at this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5 minutes, it had risen about an “inch” above the ridgeline.  In two or three more minutes, it had risen about 2 “inches.”  (If I hold up my fingers horizontally and squint with one eye, it seems to have risen to two fingers above the ridgeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I sat there watching it, it started to descend rapidly, throwing out a shower of sparks behind it.  A shooting star was descending at the same time, to the northeast, but this object was not near it, and it was bigger than the shooting star.  Suddenly it turned in a J shape, and began ascending again, then stopped and stayed in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for 45 minutes, until 4:45 a.m., when I became so sleepy that I couldn’t keep watching anymore.  In that time, it had risen 6 finger-widths from the ridgeline, faster than the sun rises, so I think it was rising faster than the rotation of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part of the time, I watched it through binoculars.  When I did, I seemed to be able to discern a crescent shape, and through the binoculars, it appeared to be sending out rays in all four directions like a cross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps I was looking at Venus, which my almanac says is bright in the morning sky right now.  But if that was Venus, then why was it brighter than a shooting star, and bigger, and why was it rising so rapidly, and why did it descend, sending out a shower of sparks behind it, and then turn in a J shape and ascend?  I think this is very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke today to a local astronomer, who hadn’t noticed it.  I’ve agreed to get up at 4:00 a.m. tomorrow and observe again, and he has agreed to observe also, and I will call him at work on Monday morning, June 1, and we will compare notes.<n>

Lights were seen for a short time above cloud cover.  I was unable to see the actual shape but the lights did reflect threw the clouds . The lights were shaped in a trianular pattern.  As I looked up i noticed the lights but heard no engine noise and did not see a red blinking light associated with commercial or military aircraft. When I turned away the lights travel towards the north west so quick that I lost visual contact with the lights in the clouds, I tried to locate them again in a cloud break but was unable to see it again. I have no type of video or photograph item with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was in Meridian Hill Park in NW Washington, DC.; looking at the sky around 9:30 pm I saw a strange light moving slowly across the sky heading South.  It abruptly made a 90 degree left to the East then after a while appeared to be lowering and faded out.  It looked like a large bright planet, a warm colored glowing orb. I couldn&#39;t tell how high up it was, but I think it was about 200ft when it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was with me had seen a diamond shaped UFO up close as a 10 year old and also seen others just like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t seem to be moving that fast but did cover a large area in a short time.

I watch for a few minutes when all of a sudden the lights disappeared. I finished the cig I was smoking and flipped it in the yard when two fighter jets of some sort flew over my home. I went in the house told my wife, and then fell asleep. I went to work then next day and a co-worker was talking about a possible UFO they had saw the same night I saw the lights in the sky. We compared notes and proceded to investigate via the internet. To our suprise, several people noticed the activity on May 27, 2009. There is even a video that was posted on youtube.com about the encounter. For a couple of nights the lights above the Grand Strand appeared.

The fire balls then shifted or jumped down to the left and disappeared after about 2 seconds. A minute or two after that, two red dots (that looked slightly different than the fire balls, more rounded and distinct) about 4x the size of a normal star appeared to the left of the first sighting. Then one by one, the dots would move in sequence to the left or north, horizontally, as if jumping one another, but blinking out as it would move. This happened for about 5 to 8 seconds with the dots jumping each other about 5 times and then they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lady in her mid 50’s then came up to the beach access after saying she saw the red dots. The three of us then watched for about 10 minutes or so as randomized flashes of light could be seen off in the distance and scattered throughout the sky, but in the same vicinity as the other sightings. The flashing looked like the same kind of flash a camera would produce, but it was faintly obscured by clouds. There could have been close to 500 flashes, some bigger or brighter than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seven people, ranging in age from 13 to 35 began to walk onto the beach. Just as they got there the two red dots flashed again, off to the right and slightly above the moving/jumping dots. This time they were sort of diagonally sloping to the left and then jumped parallel downward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing lights slowly became less numerous and then seemed to stop all together.

We were on vacation in an oceanfront house and had an unobstructed view of these objects. Beginning at about 10:30, my wife and her mother as well as a few other family members saw lights begin coming on over the ocean almost directly off the coast from the house we were in.  The lights were approximately a mile off the coast and about 1000 to 1500 feet in elevation. They saw 4-5 white lights slowly come on in a row and then disappear after hovering 20-30 seconds. My wife then came in and told the rest of us to come out. At around 10:45 we saw 3 - 4 lights appear hovering about 2-3 miles up the coast from us and then disappear. At around 11:00, 2 sets of 2 lights came on near directly out from us at about the same elevation and distance at the first sighting. The 2 sets appeared offset and one above the other. The lower set after about 10 seconds, tilted or banked to the south and then moved under the other set. It slowly rose a little, and then both sets moved away to the southeast and disappear within a half second or so. This third appearance lasted several seconds. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the second night, May 28th, the lights appeared at about 9:30. They appeared in front of us much as they had begun the night before. Their second appearance was from the southeast moving toward the northeast with an almost vertical banking to the south. The object slowed to a stop as it leveled back out. This time lights appeared to be rotating on the top. It hovered for several seconds and appeared to return to a southeast course with great speed as to almost disappear again. Again, there was no sound. After this, there appeared to be 3 planes - with blinking wing lights that by speed, directional, and elevation changes we took to be military jets - come from the north and fly up and down the coast for at least half an hour. It was as if they were following or looking for something with the patterns they flew and the confined area they were in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this time, I have been in contact with several people who saw the same things we did that night. I also have several minutes of video from both nights documenting parts of the sightings. Among my party were a teacher, retired and former military personnel, medical professionals, and other reasonable and educated people. None of us, nor other witnesses I have been in contact with have been able to explain these sightings.<n>

Suddenly over the ocean horizon appeared a bright red/orange round glowing object which stayed brightly lit for about 10 seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stared out over the horizon waiting to see it again, and about 4 min later, Two lights appeared same color/size as the first, next to each other like headlights from a car, they seemed to flicker a few times then disappeared at the same time.  They stayed lit about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, as we discussed what it could be, one light, same color appeared, then split in two  in a split second, horizontally, into equal sized round glowing objects stayed lit for maybe 15 seconds and disappeared at the same time.... at this point we knew it wasn&#39;t flares from a ship because the one light split into two horizontally not falling downward towards the ocean....we watched for about another 10 minutes then left the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we returned to our condo about 3/4 of a mile away we took the dogs out for a walk, and while looking skyward and discussing what we had seen, a pattern of  five white lights, which looked like stars from the brightness &amp; color, began a flashing pattern.  Five lights in no particular arrangement flashing in a sequence... we heard the sound of aircraft but this was no normal plane(s) whatever it was, was flashing  separetly and too close for normal multiple aircraft to be next to each other. The flashing lights appeared to stay in the same spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We speculated it could have been some type of military aircraft ( multiple ) flying in some formation. But the rumble we heard was no louder than a normal single plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This flashing white light pattern lasted about 1 1/2 minutes.. then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not into the distance..they disappeared right where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object was totally iluminated with a round shape; however, as I was watching it, the light on the object started to fade until it went totally dark; I could still see it for a couple of seconds, the object continued the trayectory to the South but a tree obstructed my sighting and couldn&#39;t see where it went...

About every 5 to 10 minutes these lights reappeared for a 2-4 second duration - always one double, sometimes two or three sets (they almost seemed to be orbiting in a large horizontal circle).  At some point several very tiny, bright white lights in a triangular formation (a bit east and lower in the sky) began blinking continuously.

We were headed east on 224th street when I noticed three very bright lights close together,(not blinking) closing in quite fast from a very long distance away.  At first it appeared to be a plane as it came nearer to the tree line but then it slowed to almost a stop and began drifting, a kind of a crab walk, with no sound, across the road about 200 feet above us.  We are stopped at this point and I and the front passenger are hanging out the window watching is pass over.  It became clear that this was no plane, nor helicopter, and was larger than most planes that fly that low in this area.  As we watched in disbelief, the object began to turn slightly as if to change its direction, but stopped instead.  I could clearly make out the almost boomerang shape, with lights at each corner lighting up each corners relative direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its top apeared to be totally flat.  Below the craft looked like three enlogated footballs molded seamlessly to eachother and to the bottom of the ship. The center shape was glowing a dull blue, and had three evenly spaced small blue lights on its bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the craft is hovering right over the top of a small housing developement, only illuminating the surrounding sky along side of it and emitting a blue glow to the tops of the houses.  4 or five minutes passed and another vehicle was headed the opposite direction and also slowed to have a look.  The object then began to move in its original direction rather slow, before picking up enough speed to disappear in a matter of seconds.  I cannot believe what we had whitnessed, as I have lived in this area for over 22 years.  This was not of this world.<n>

I grabbed my binoculars and went outside and zoomed in on the object in the sky.   I observed the object as it went east, then turned and went north, at which time and then it turned and went west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And after a moment it turned direction again and went south.  I continued watching it, I zoomed in on the object as best I could and what I saw was either a horse shoe or a lazy triangle, and it had white round circles kind of like cloudy circles on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it was so shinny that is all I could make out, and it looked like it was going higher and higher as it moved, and then continued south until it disappeared.  My self and my wife and daughter in law all observed the object and the same movements.  Called the local newspaper and reported it, and went to your website and reported it.

I crossed my drive with my house to my left and the bark to the right, looking at my pasture. The porch lights (front and back) was on as well as lights on buildings across the pasture next to the field I was looking at.  on the other side of the field, 1/2 is a corn farm, and the other 1/2 is tree lined.  There is a small airport about 1.5 miles in the direction I was facing.  I looked up at the sky (facing southeast)when I saw this single white light passing over my house moving from northwest to southeast. At first I thought it was a helicopter or a small plane, until I noticed it had no other lights (red, green or blue)on it, no outlined shape, plus it would speed up, slow down and waver (but not in a smooth curve , but more boxy and erratic)and very quiet.  The light was about 100 ft up (twice as high as my house and treeline).  The light was bright when I looked at it pass, but stayed bright pass the treeline but there was no light shining on the ground or trees.  It was heading towards the airport, but not the normal direction of the planes taking off or landing.  It went about 20 yards above the treeline then it went dim about halfway for a few seconds and disappeared. There was a aircraft with red and white light flying in the distant about 3-5 miles about 10o&#39;clock from the direction I was looking. The only other thing was, about 10-15 minutes later a large sounding aircraft was flying in the area, shaking the house but I could not locate it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happen to live on the Eastern side of the city or just outside loop 20. By 10:00 P.M. much of the lightning and thunder had passed us by and only a few sprinkles remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the weather conditions outside, I noticed a white puffy cloud immediately to the west of my location.  As I stared at this cloud, I noticed four white lights chasing each other within the cloud itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called my wife so she could witness what I was looking at.  I also called my brother who happened to be visiting family in the vicinity of Nixon High which is located NW of loop 20 from where I was.  He was able to see the same lights inside the cloud going around in a circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to apply all logic as to the origin of the lights.  There were no airplanes in the vicinity nor was there any beams of light coming from the ground up. The airport beacon light is approximately 2 miles from where this cloud was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seem to be chasing each other and never collided with each other.  At some point, the lights would come to a complete stop and would begin rotating in a counterclockwise pattern.  The best way to describe the lights is by imagining that your inside the cloud with a flash light and moving the light around or inside the cloud.  I could see where the light was hitting inside but the beam never broke through the wall of the cloud itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting went on for approximately 30 minutes until the cloud moved out towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a law enforcement officer and I have never seen anything like this in my 26 years of service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  We note that his description is not inconsistent with a four-element light advertising display, although we assume that the witness would have been witness to such a light display, during the course of his career in law enforcement.  We do not know what he witnessed.  PD))<n>

I was the first to notice the craft, which started over the land, and proceeded to fly out over the lake. I could not tell exactly how far away it was, nor how fast it was going, because I have never seen anything like this is the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be spherical or circular, and was the brightest a biggest thing in the sky by far. It was also completely silent. It proceeded to fly out over the water and after a bit, it seemed to stop. What happened next I still am not to sure of, because once again this is not an everyday thing...The craft began to glow brighter and bigger. I&#39;m not sure whether it was stationary and just glowing more intensely, or if it was coming directly towards us. After about 10 seconds of this, the craft took off in the exact opposite direction, simply fading away and disappearing over the course of about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been intensely researching ufo&#39;s and other related topics for the past couple of months. This is what perhaps makes it even weirder for myself. I have been trying increasingly to get the particular friends I was with on the night to do their own research. And just randomly, they are the ones who are with me when this happens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all know what we saw that night, and we embrace it.<n>

One letter written in to the Rapid City Journal described the object as &#39;making a loud humming noise before accelerating at an immense speed and disappearing out of sight.&#39;  Despite an Air Show at Ellsworth AFB during the following weekend, only home-station aircraft, the B-1 Bomber were at the base and none were in flight during this time.  The craft was spotted by several eye-witnesses, some of whom detected the same craft at approximately 0430 on Tuesday the 26th of May, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Briefly it appeared to become brighter and then suddenly it shut off as if someone had turned off a light switch.  It never re-appeared after this.  According to the onboard navigation screen in the cabin, I estimate we were approx. 25 to 35 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia and approx. 50 to 75 miles North/Northeast of Halifax. We were at approx. 33,000 feet.  I estimate the object was at about 38 to 40,000 feet and approximately 5 to 10 miles off to our right (toward the east). The time was exactly 20:32 EST on my watch and it would have been 21:32 AST. The event happened so quickly that I do not know if anyone else on the airplane saw it. Most of the passengers were either sleeping or watching the TV screens in the cabin. In Brussels, I saw the pilots in the airport and asked if they&#39;d seen it.  They said they hadn&#39;t, but briefly heard other aircraft in the area talking about it on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in my rocking chair looking up at the sky, looking at stars and watching planes go by.  Then from the south comes these 2 dots,( they look like when you take a flash light and shine it into some smoke in a far off distance you have the round shape of a light)it had no blinking lights too it at all.  The came from the south and headed north.. The first one was moving in a straight line and the one behind it look like it was struggling too keep up with it and was moving around behind it.  Then it disappeared. There where no clouds, just a clear night. I know what i saw and it was not no airplanes nor birds.

It looked like it was about 5 miles in front of me and about 2 miles high in the air when it stopped lifting higher.  It just stayed there for about a minute, then it races another mile or so higher.  It lingered there for about 3 minutes.  After that, it just kept ascending high and higher untill I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n>

M. on the morning of May 5, 2009, I saw a bright white light in the eastern sky. The light appeared to be inside the earth’s atmosphere as I could see stars behind the object that were nowhere near as close.  From my position (in Magnolia, TX) I would place the object above the Woodlands, TX or just north of that location.  The objected appeared to be burning in some manner getting brighter then dimmer.  The fire appeared to be coming out of a central point at the bottom of the object. The object seemed to hover and remained stationary the entire time I watched. I went and got a pair of binoculars to see if I could see the object better, but the object was so bright I could not see past the glare. I then videotaped the object for a bit using the digital zoom to get as close as I could. At full zoom the object appeared to be a sphere; however I could not tell if this was an actual sphere or just a reaction of the camera to the brightness of the object.   I checked the web to see if maybe there was a natural explanation for the light but was unable to locate anything.  Clouds began to move in and I could no longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Smoking a cigarette , and talking to my girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have been staying up all night lately, because i have been seing and Filming Slow Pulsing UFOS for the past week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what i saw may 25th at 2 30 am was one of these same crafts But closer, lower, and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1 00 AM, my girlfriend stopped me mid sentence and exclaimed &#34;What the heck is that&#34; i turned around and there was a tremendously  bright yellowish white light...looked to me at the time that it could be a plane coming Straight at us...{i watch the sky alot and im familiar with planes and what we have in our skys} but as i  watched it i realized, a plane would have moved a bit more by now....this object was barely moving visible to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the first thing that raised my suspicion about this light...we watched it hover for a few minutes...and i decided to run and grab my camera...<n> <n><n> <n><n> just to get a better look at it...my girlfriend decided to go to bed...i felt compelled to stay up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i got back outside. the light was no longer white/yellow, But it was Pulsating ALL colors green red blue white purple, {same as the other lights i have filmed} - when zoomed in these lights have a colored aura ive seen the aura double in size and pulse vibrantly...I noted in my log it looked like a contained Aurora borealis Over AZ...I watched this light and filmed it briefly...i noticed this light was pulsing Inteligently...with a pattern so to speak...this is the first time i have observed these pulsations in an intelligent pattern.every 15-20 secconds the light would pulse solidly blue then solidly red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i thaught this was indeed a sign of life connected to this object.after 2 minutes of filming this object i put my camera down...lit a cigarette and just watced it. This was at approximitely 1 30 AM    I watched it for about 30 minutes and at about 2 00am it seemed much closer and much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to take out my camera again. What i saw when i zoomed on this object at 2 00 AM may 25th took my breath away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What before looked like a pulsing sphere was now...a 2 toned sphere of light.by 2 Toned i dont mean.. 2 colors i mean the bottom 2/3 was bright light and the top 1/3 was solid object. when i zoomed on this orb You could see the top 1/3 of the object was dark...or solid,the bottom 2/3 had a Glowing Core of moving light with Red and Blue Lines of light shooting or swimming all around it, like NOTHING i have ever seen on earth. on the video you cannot see this...until i expiremented with color settings i found. sharpening this image and turning contrast down to eliminate any kind of glare you can see what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> here is a link to a clip i posted on you tube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vp6IEdhCRk&amp;feature=channel_page  this Light hovered slowly Moving twords me for a very long time i went to bed at 5 am because the sun was coming up and the object seemed to be moving Upwards after 4 00 am. it was back near that area -South of the Usery mountain range- May 27th 1am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> but not this morning on the 28th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WOULD ALSO. like to note the strangest occurance...there is a point... i included it in my Youtube clip where i was about to adjust my camera. i remember my thaught prior i was thinking &#34;GOD this light is so amazing i wish i could communicate&#34; i thaught that right before i moved my camera....and in my footage ONLY i did not hear this noise... i did not notice it until i watched it the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a noise....right before the Easily Distinquishable sound of the camera rustling there is A multiple Octave STRANGE ...kind of raspy OTHERWORLDY noise...ive listend to it 100thousand times probably by now and it shakes me to my core everytime  i have no explenation for this whatsoever...and i hope you watch my footage and hear it for yourself<n>

We was on a camping trip to dale hollow lake when we saw it, We was standing at the campsite and I looked up at the beautiful sky and all at once I saw a flashing light streaming across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. I looked at two of my friends and pointed it out and one of them said it a shooting stare, I told her shooting stars don’t blink and all at once it stopped moving and changed direction three times and then streaked out of sight. I have never believed in UFOs but I have racked my brain on what it could have been and have come up empty. I would have never told any one if three of us had not witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have 2 canon stabilized 10x30s  Nomally watch for sats, this time I got what looked like 5 mid level bright stars at once, in a pin ball machine.  Area of sky involved was covered by my hand at arms length.  They would start and stop, no curves in flight pattern. 2 mirrored each other a few times.  One low one high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was even stranger is that 2 sats came 10seconds apart one from SW then one from NE crossing the same part of the sky.  UFOs left and returned 3 times then left after first sat came.  The sats were larger and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> View was to the north 40 deg up from level.

It was a bright white light moving across the sky from west to east.  I first told him that it was an airplane but then noticed it had no blinking lights of any kind.  My one friend said that yeah it was probably an airplane and then my son said maybe it’s a shooting star.  Then all of a sudden in a span of a second it dimmed and went completely out and we could see all the stars around it!  My other friend said good call to my son that it was a shooting star!  At the same time my other friend and I said that, that was no shooting star.  It was moving way to slow to be a shooting star and it was way too bright to be a satellite!  So I said “well son I guess by definition it was a UFO because none of us had any clue to what it was!  Then about 5 min later 2 kids aged 14 came back from the pavilion claiming that they saw a UFO the same thing we saw and described it exactly as we saw it!  The next morning we spotted at least 3 military helicopters flying around the camp site as if they were searching for something!  I have no idea what it was to this day but sure would like to hear from anyone that may have also seen something that night in the same area!<n>

I could hear no sound, the light was constant, and  it had no trail behind it. She left and I proceeded to watch for roughly 2minutes as the object went across the sky and went out of view behind some pine trees. The object was bigger than any of the stars that were in the sky. Two Planes were spotted after with single flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the 23 they were spotted also, but there was 3 forming a triangle. It was viewed by so many people, the news reported the sighting<n>

Just as I was heading in to the house I sighted it coming towards my home through trees and a field west of my home.  I watched it approach and on this night I had hooked up a Mirror to reflect the headlights of my truck to see if I could get a reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the craft made no noise at all, the light was so bright it looked like a star and after passing my home it traveled about 2 minutes or maybe 5 miles or so when it turned out the light.

Red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:30 PM,There was six crafts hovering  very very slowly in the distance  and it didnt look like they were heading in any particular direction.They were hovering around and stayed in the same area. They were in a sort of rectangle shape in two rows of three. I really could not see the shape of the crafts moving but it looked disk shaped but they had bright red lights. To me it looked like there was diagnal lines on the crafts. I know for a fact that these were not planes because they stayed in the same spot for a while and when planes pass by you would hear a noise, these were silent. Three of them faded away and the rest started to dissapear shortly after until there was only one left and it to, dissapeared. It looked as if they went into clouds. I could not see much detail but I know that what I saw were UFO&#39;s and I wasn&#39;t the only person to see them either. Two of my cousins were there. I tried to video tape it and take pictures from my phone, but it was way to dark and the pictures were just black. I also tried to call the ufo center and they accused me of being a prank caller and didn&#39;t even give me a chance to describe what I saw. I really could care less if anyone believes me or my cousins because we know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the time  I was looking up at the sky (my view was partially obstructed by a powerlines) and all of a sudden I see this small, white, circular pill-like object slowly move (at the same speed of a plane, but it wasn&#39;t a plane) and then it just disappeared.  Its as if I was waiting for it to move past the power lines in the foreground but it was gone.  The strangest thing about it is the fact that I had so many things on my mind that I wasn&#39;t even scared or even excited when I saw it.  The object seemed to have been able to blend in with the clouds since it had that same exact &#34;cloud color&#34;.   It just happened so quickly, then 3 hours later it hit me and I was very excited about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just left my mom&#39;s to go back to Seattle. In this area, there is a &#34;Military Base&#34; as you ascend I-82 that seems completely invisible. There is never any activity going to and from the freeway exit to this base - you never see people, military aircraft or any vehicles. This area is highly suspicious for UFO sightings and is considered a &#34;hotspot&#34;. I was taking pictures of my boyfriend&#39;s white truck ahead of me (both of us drove separate to and from Yakima that weekend) and for some reason, I decided to take pictures as we went over this ridge, but just past the military sign. I was not thinking of anything in particular as I had my boyfriend&#39;s son with me in the car and we were just messing around with the camera. This UFO was not visible until after the picture was taken and I was viewing pictures later that evening. The first picture was taken from inside my car through the windshield and the 2nd was taken outside of my sunroof. This UFO is right above the military base area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object&#39;s illumination was similar to a space rocket from a far distance except the object seemed to be accelerating at an unusually fast pace. The object seemed to fly a circular path before coming down to a similar height it took off from, except the landing site was a bit to the right. The object then proceeded to hover from left to right, giving no evidence of increasing its altitude (and at irregular speeds, sometimes it would move faster to the right then left and vice versa). This continued on for 15 minutes before the object stopped. This was when the shape of the object became clearer. The streak of light seemed to possess a spherical center with trails of light both above and below it. The trails of light seemed to contract into the sphere and extend back out periodically. This happened for another ten minutes before the object stayed still. Within 5 seconds of it stopping, rain began and the objected became less visible and dissapeared. The rain stopped and the object seemed to appear again with another just like it except with a darker shade.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed two far away lights way in the distance. The lights look like part of a radio tower.  As we approached the lights we then saw three circle shaped bright lights. Our truck reached the lights and we saw that it was not a tower. Puzzled we continued our drive home. Surprisingly, the lights suddenly proceeded to follow to our vehicle. All three objects followed us at eye level on the passenger side of the window.  They followed us on the opposite side of the freeway.  All three lights kept pace with us, my husband accelerated to the speed of 80 mph. At one point, in a split second all three hovered above our truck. They continued to do for the next three miles. My husband slowed and stopped, pulling off the road at one point.  He was going to see what was above us. I was very frighten and asked him not to go outside, the lights hovered above us waiting .We started the truck again and got on the freeway the bright objects keeping up as their lights flashed off and on. As we approached the city of Las Cruces the lights fell back and disappeared as we got close to the city limits.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Negril, Looking west out over the Caribbean Sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the stars with my wife under some of the clearest skies I’ve ever experienced. I located and pointed out a orangish-red star that seemed out of place.  This star began to move across the sky, slow at first, changing directions every so often.  My wife and I were amazed and were fixed on the object.  The speed of the object increased, and it seemed to be flying toward and away from earth, almost showing off to us.  Then, all of a sudden, the object made one last flight toward earth, getting slightly larger.  The object then stopped, paused for 2 seconds..    What happens next is incredible and I will do my best to put it into words.  The object accelerated away from us, and earth at an astonishing rate.  The object went from one of the brightest stars in the sky to completely gone in a matter of seconds.  We watched the object get smaller and smaller as it sped into space and completely out of sight.  We looked around, hoping someone else had watched all of this un! fold as well, and luckily, there was another couple about 20 feet away that were looking right at us, mouths open.  They had seen it to.  I never quite believed until that moment.  It’s one of those events in life that changes your perspective on things forever.  Gives me goose bumps every time I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At approx 9:55pm my partner noticed three (3) individual orange-ish/white-ish lights in the sky. He yelled out, &#34;Oh my GOD, look at that!&#34; so we all turned to look. What we seen we weren&#39;t prepared for. It appeared to be a triangular &#34;UFO&#34;. These three (3) lights looked as if to be fireballs, with tracing firey tails. They were ALWAYS changing form, from a triangle, to a straight line, and back to a triangle formation. They flew acrossed the sky a bit, however toward the end of the event, they remained stationary. I ran inside to find my camera, and shot some of the final moments on film. The last few seconds they appeared to be falling, as a leaf would. As the &#34;crafts&#34; descended toward the ground, we noticed a plane flying around the same site in which the lights (crafts) were. There were many witnesses (15+). I have had a &#34;UFO&#34; experience once before, however this event is totally unlike ANYTHING I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object wasn’t recognized as a satellite or airplane overhead.  This object moved through the sky without any sound in any way.  In addition there wasn’t blinking lights to be seen, which is usual with most commercial aircraft.  This object moved through the sky with little effort quickly.  As it moved through the sky it had a straight  path of North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no navigation beacons that could be seen, nor any navigation lights, or anti-collision beacons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither myself nor my wife thought to grap a camera as we sat there kind of mezmerised by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When they did they were lower in the horizon and continued for a 10-15 minutes slowly turning and going in and out until it was not visible due to a tree line several miles away. Overcast skies but the objects were still on the black of the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have noticed a few black dots in some photos I have taken that seem to be following the craft. [Photo emailed] I don’t see them with my eyes but seem to notice them only on the pictures. They are so small. I thought ok I’m sure they are dust particles on the lens. Strange I only see these particles so far under planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today marked a new strange phenomenon. I was watching a high flying plane passing by and thought to take some pictures to test the limits of my lens. To my puzzlement I noticed in the pictures [photos emailed] a few bright orbs that seem to stay stationary as the plane fly’s right next to them then makes a sharp turn to the right. There was one dark orb that seemed to be lower (closer to ground) then the other orbs that where white. Picture after picture they just stayed stationary as the plane passed by. I thought maybe I’m looking at stars but it was day time and sunset was not until another 3 hours. I’m not sure what I saw. I took other pictures of clouds around the same time. I looked for possible other orbs thinking that they might be stars but could not find any.  I’m not sure what I saw but will now keep an eye out for more activity.<n>

(NOT FLASHING) All seven hovered together and moved around and after around 7 mins they slowly disburse one at a time and then vanished very quickly. There was then 3 left two came together to make a brighter red but they still changed in brightness separately, the third slowly went higher and to the right and then vanished. The last two stayed together for a further 4 to 5 mins and then vanished. We watched for a further 10mins but nothing re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was traveling quickly from the North-Northwest travelling South-Southwest and totally silent as it wobbled and veered slightly towards our location then appeared to slow down as it approached and also lowered in elevation.  Then the object continued traveling South-Southwest until we lost sight.  Object was brighter and larger than a satellite, with no blinking lights, looked to be “controlled” both in speed and direction, and was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/22/09 21:30|Nags Head|NC|Unknown|30 min total|20+ ufos seen by 15+ people launching from the ocean only to disappear in the sky|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70150.html|133|ndxe200905| 20+ ufos seen by 15+ people launching from the ocean only to disappear in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> So first off, I am new to all of this. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and for a person who lives most his life by logic, this just gets to me. First off, this is all in Nags Head, NC, right on the Outer Banks of NC. So as me and my fellow employees go to stop the last go kart race and get the place closed down, we start seeing the lights come up just a couple miles from us(looked like it was coming from the ocean!, but maybe on the beach). It was kind of cloudy out, so all you could see is the lights. It wasnt a steady light, it was more like a flame going straight up, kind of fluttering. So the first that came were 4 of them, they stayed together in a 7 formation, staying so amazingly steady, it looked to form an outline of an insanely huge ship. The first thing that came to mind were those big imperial cruiser or whatever those huge ships that vaders guys rode in in the earliest star wars. Suddenly one of the ships darted off, and it became a straight line, then those broke up. If that wasn&#39;t weird enough, they kept coming. There must have been at least 20 of these. The rest did not fly in the same path like the first, more random. Then it gets to the last 2, this is the part that really made me confused. The last 2 were took off with what it looked like just mere feet between them! It was an amazing site, they were right next too each other, then one would get futher forward, then the other would dart out infront, and then the other would get ahead again. This definitely does not seem like a military formation...nor civilian or commercial. Also, for as close as they were, there were no sounds at all coming from that direction, but they looked to be going as fast as jets almost! It was really an amazing site, everyone working and the 15 people who just got off the track, just stood there for 15 minutes watching it. Overall though, I would say the lights lasted for a good 20-30 minutes total, but each one would go from launch to disappear in about 30 seconds to a minut! e, from launching around the ocean to disappearing right above us. Oh! Almost forgot to point out that the guy who owns the place, said the same thing happened last night! I will bring my camera tomorrow night in hope it happens again. But does anyone have any ideas? There has got to be some logical answer, but I am just baffled. Sorry the post is so long, I am still creeped out a bit from it, but any help at all would be greatly appreciated!<n>

My camera is the Canon Power shot SD790 1S 10.0 Mega Pixel. They were fighting a fire that had started in the Los Angeles County Lincoln Heights area, days later I was starting to look through my footage when I was rewinding in slow motion and saw an object flash? So I went back frame by frame.  An object stops in mid air for 1.2 frames and was gone just as quick, silver on top and dark on the bottom.  In another shot you can see an object come from frame left to right and what seemed to pass either over or in front of a LA city helicopter. The only reason I&#39;m posting this is because I see on the 8th of June 2009 in Lincoln Heights someone else saw something to!  I really don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s but I can&#39;t ignore what I caught on my camera anybody else have any ideas on what this could have been? I do know what its not!<n>

The skies above Namibia are extremly clear this time of year. I looked into the night sky and saw an object as bright as a fireball, with a red light above it, but looked as if they were connected. The object travelled from east to west and proceeded to hover above us for some time.  I made a note of the time i first saw it until it dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it looked like a fireball, it was only in colour. There was no flame type movement.  Observing the object and using a star as referance, the object circled in the night sky, and the move upwards until it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local airport and there was no recoreded aircraft activity at that hour of the night.  I called everybody from the bar to witness the object. toatl of about 18 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been numerous sightings in recent weeks in Namibia.  As a sceptic, i am now convinced about the exitence of UFO&#39;s.<n>

I went to my kitchen to make coffee.As I was looking out my kitchen window I saw what appeared to be a very bright light in the eastern sky.At first I thought it was possibly landing lights from an aircraft as I&#39;m not to far from the local airport,but the more I watched the light I realized it was stationary.I continued to watch expecting it to move but it didn&#39;t seem to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and found my binoculars and went outside my house to try to get a closer look.This light was extreamly bright.Looking through the binoculars the light was round in shape.As I was watching it the circle looked to split in two but not completely apart,forming a eight shaped object. Then it would go back to the original circle shape. I thought I saw what looked to be an orange flame or light emit from the bottom of the circle but I cannot be sure,it seemed to only last milaseconds.All the time I watched the object it only seemed to move slightly from left to right and possibly went slowly up over the entire time.There was no sound from the object as a plane or helicopter.It was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a couple pictures with my digital camera but they are not great photos at the distance was to far for this type of camera. I will send them to you anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for 45 minutes I went to my computer to see if anything was reported to be in the sky at that time but could find no info.When I went back to check on the object a few minutes later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 55 year old retired male.  I have lived in the house for 13 years and have never seen anything like this in my entire life.<n>

She was gone for about 20 minutes, I decided to go check on her to make sure she was alright. I then stepped outside and looked up at the night sky. I noticed a bright light about the size of a plane but a little bigger. I though it was weird there were no lights on it flashing to distinguish it was a plane. My first reaction was that it was a satellite or a space shuttle since they are repairing the Hubble Telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed to the garage to get my mom to try and show what I was seeing. I was keeping an eye on the object the whole time as to not lose it. I then noticed that it started to go from side across the sky like a plane would, then it started to go straight up and stay in a spot in the sky and started to flash. Two other points in the sky that were to the lower left of it started to flash and move side to side. The main light was in the same spot but moved up and down and kept flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went back into the garage and started to sort some things out and move things around. About 5 minutes elapsed and we went back out and to my surprise they were still there in the sky flashing and moving a little bit, and then they all vanished one after another. All 3 lights disappeared. Keep in mind that planes are flying around in the sky due to the fact I live a few towns away from a major airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved way to fast for a plane and too slow to be a satellite or a space shuttle. I have seen the space shuttle in the sky while in orbit and that moved very fast. I do not know what it was that I saw, the only conclusion I can come to is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I assumed a plane may be in distress.  I immediately looked outside and saw what appeared to be the lights of a low flying commercial airliner flying directly toward the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, less than 1 mile from our house.  Then, it split into three separate lights, all of red, doing manuevers that airplanes aren&#39;t capable of. They all appeared to be breaking the sound barrier.  They continued, after doing manuevers, to travel east toward Hinsdale, NH.  Within minutes, there where several airplanes flying that same direction.  I, as a volunteer firefighter, turned on my radio and listened for an extensive period and never heard any reports of any crashes in our area.<n>

We noticed what appeared to be an elderly woman (70&#39;s 80&#39;s) in a robe in one of the windows? she looked terrified, as though she had seen a ghost and she was standing in the window with her arms outstretched from her sides. I was curious as to what she was even doing in this building which we new was vacant by this time every night, but more importantly what was she staring at? so I looked up to the portion of the sky that the woman appeared to be hypnotized by.. there was the object.. a solid light blue sphere. The object appeared over our head at about 8:50 pm. and seemed to be wobbling slightly up and down as it passed almost directly over our heads about 1200 - 1500 feet above the ground.  The object appeared to be traveling at a steady 250 to 350 miles an hour and was void of any sound.  We watched the object for about 45 seconds unti! l it left our field of view it was followed by an dark helicopter at the same general altitude (with sound) and and then a commercial jet flew over in a different direction (also with sound) about 30 seconds after that at a regular altitude of about 35,000 ft. I can trust my own judgment of this event due to the fact that I am very familiar with commercial and military aircraft due to a former profession (precision machinist &amp; aviation mechanic) this object was NOT a regular AIRCRAFT and it definitely DID NOT employ the use of any conventional propulsion unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

We went for a walk up our street on return a bright beam of light bore down on us, we both looked up into the light in disbelief but not frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our area has alot of strange activities not reported.<n>
5/20/09 23:00|Allegheny State Park|NY|Oval|15 min's|Strange circular shaped craft that was all white flying in the night sky of the Allegany Mt's.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70323.html|149|ndxe200905| Strange circular shaped craft that was all white flying in the night sky of the Allegany Mt&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping with my family and everyone was sleeping.  I was sitting near a fire and I was checking out the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very clear so there were many star’s to view.  At about 11:00 pm Eastern standard time I noticed a strange looking craft flying through the big dipper.  My first thought was that it was just a plane. But upon further review it was shaped like a circle or a oval. The craft was all white. There were no red or blinking lights that you normally see with a airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this craft making very quick turns and dips in the sky. I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I moved away from the fire to adjust my eyes. I kept track of this object and my eyes got adjusted so I continued to view this object. The thing that made me want to report this craft was how it was making very quick turns and dips in the night sky. It flew and moved in a triangular flight path. It moved into this position in about 1 second. It did this about 10 more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved back and forth between the big dipper and other stars so fast. I have never seen a object move this fast and take multiple positions in the sky. I do not think this was a plane. I have been observing the night sky since I was a child and this is the first time I have ever wanted to report an object. The other thing that caught my attention about this object was that it would move all over the sky and then go back to it’s original flight path. My observations about this object make me believe that it was very high in the sky and it was not close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if possible please advise on this. If this is a standard craft then please try to tell me what it was. Otherwise I hope someone else reported this.<n>
5/20/09 23:00|Pinkney|MI|Light|3 min|Low flying sliver light came close to town and then off into space.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70129.html|150|ndxe200905| Low flying sliver light came close to town and then off into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:45 a low flying plane, with all its warning lights flashing, was headed in a Northern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I take several walks through the streets looking at the stars and talking about our hopes, dreams, and those stupid people we have to work with. Last night we took a street we hadn&#39;t ventured before. On this new route we walked through a cemetery that over looks a quiet little lake and down through a quite little suburb. A while later we turned to head back home and heard a coyote howling a way. I hadn&#39;t heard of a coyote in this area for a while but OK. Once we got back home my girl says for some reason i just want to keep going, I say why not? Just about a mile away on our second trip we turn back towards home. I see a plane heading toward Pinkney, MI not only that but I notice another light from the West heading toward Pinkney. In the military I was stationed at an Air force base and jumped from planes. So happens that I like to stand and watch as aircraft fly over head. As the two got close over town, the one blinking now over our heads and the other still had no flashing lights, it&#39;s solid silver. The one light in question not flashing U-Turns towards the North and slips away toward the stars. The direction it took off was between a 45 degree to 70 degree angle from the plane of horizon. Anyone who has heard a plane knows it&#39;s engine would be loudly roaring with that type of acceleration. Not only that but I have never seen anything go from town to gone. I have not been open to the thought of UFO&#39;s and laughing at those who believe. Although, last night my girlfriend and I sure as hell saw one too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>
5/20/09 22:30|Lisbon|ME|Oval|5 min|Distinct Craft, huge bottom of the craft light, specific color light goes off and dissapears after 2 minutes, no flashing lights. 5|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70170.html|151|ndxe200905| Distinct Craft, huge bottom of the craft light, specific color light goes off and dissapears after 2 minutes, no flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was witnessing a number of what looked like falling stars at first until the number became completely unreasonable.  I saw 5 in less than 10 minutes then a number of craft in the distance that I could not make out so I went and retrieved my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take photo’s of objects at night usually with the shutter staying open for as long as 15 seconds which gives me a number of colors especially the flashing of lights from planes or from the P3’s that land in Brunswick Maine you can get their head lights pointing directly at the hill my home is located at but on this night after about 25 minutes of taking pictures and still seeing many more objects in the sky than normal I turned to my left an at between 2,000 and probably no more than 4,000 ft a craft with the brightest light directly on the bottom of the craft with a color I have not seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and fixed my camera on the light, it appeared to be oval but the light made it hard to make out the exact shape and it lasted long enough for me to take 4 pictures with the shutter lasting about 10 – 15 seconds and then the light went off with no flashing lights at all and my eyes unable to adjust to the light I lost track of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 3 pictures of the light and 1 picture just as it went off.  I am trying to see if I can filter out and see the object just after the light went out.  No plane I know especially that low and size turns off all its lights.  There was no sound that I could hear.  The craft was moving slower than many other crafts that normally fly in this area but over the last 5 years this is only the second craft to be this low and close to my home, the other was a P3 and loud with flashing lights and two head lights.  This again with one large light lit up and the color being very distinct.  I have many flashing light pictures and this is the only one of this color and that basically disappeared.  I immediately flashed my camera lights and with hopes of it returning stayed for 45 minutes and no lights ever came back on, the wave of craft up HIGH stopped and the regular night time traffic of jets resumed which you can always hear even at 20,000 feet or more and their lights again are very specific.  I have no doubt this was a craft and not a normal craft for our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  May 20, 2009<n>

Both times there were other witnesses besides myself with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were eating pizza outside in my front yard.  We live in an area where there isn’t much light pollution, so we were looking at stars.  We were trying to find constellations we knew, when two of us (myself and one of my friends) saw the light.  We told them to look as we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared to be star, which we then noticed was slowly moving.  It had been fairly faint, but still noticeable.  We hadn’t been paying attention until it started moving.  It was in the north north-eastern sky and was slowly moving towards the south east.  As it moved it got somewhat faster, but also significantly brighter.  It got bright enough that it rivaled some of the other stars, but I wouldn’t say it :lit up the sky,&#34; or anything that significantly.  As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn’t be seen.  I wouldn’t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn’t have allowed it go over us).  It was a clear enough night that had it been a plane we could have seen something as it continued further.  There was no flashing or sound; the light was white like any other star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three guys (counting myself) and two girls.  We were in high school. Nobody had been drinking, or doing any drugs of any sort.  Everybody saw it clearly and agreed that we couldn’t figure out what it was.

As I neared the bridge over Wade Ave., the lights got closer and closer until a triangle shaped craft passed slowy overhead. It had two white lights at the narrow end of the equilateral triangle and two on the broad end, with a smaller blinking red light in the middle. The craft passed over head with no noise whatsoever and continued in the opposite direction. It was about 300 feet over tree top level, and appeared to be the about twice the size of my car. Had I heard engine noise, I would have thought from the shape that it was fighter jet of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Square looked something like being in the dark and looking at an unlit house, suddenly the door opens and there is a bright rectangle, 4 seconds later the door closes and...nothing..this is what it looked like, except the rectangle changed it apparent angle, as if reflecting sunlight. The sight then looked like a luminous square with a dark square within it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT MAKE THIS SO STRANGE IS THAT IT JUST DISSAPEARED...

It headed away from our location and then began flying perpendicular at about the speed of an airplane.  It then almost came to a stop, moving very slowly in the same direction.  It then gained speed and continued on the perpendicular course until no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear night and I was just admiring ... I came back into my apartment and told my wife what a pretty night it was. I walked out onto our balcony to sit and relax and again I looked up toward the Little Dipper and was shocked! There were MANY other &#34;stars&#34; and these were &#34;moving&#34; from west to east and a pretty good speed. I fixed my eyes on a Star that remained stationary and yes, there were many other *stars moving* I immediately yelled for my wife to come out and to bring the video camera. She hurried out and looked up (OMG!) She tried to turn on the camera but the damn batteries were dead. So we just watched. I counted 14 *stars* but I don&#39;t know how many had passed before I noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long staggerd procession of &#34;stars moving* at a pretty good pace. There were *NO* blinking lights and *NO* sound heard as they passed or after they had passed. I picked &#34;Formation&#34; because they weren&#39;t flying all over the place. They were *going* somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they passed, the sky appeared as it did before except it seemed quite empty now. I was left with a very uneasy feeling because to me, it seemed like an invasion but, that&#39;s just the impression I got from this experience. I didn&#39;t like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve asked my wife several times since, if that really happened and she is quite sure we did. I guess in a society where we&#39;re taught not to believe in such things makes me feel even more un-easy now. My wife and I saw these *stars moving* across the sky just as sure as we see what we see everywhere else with our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what more I could tell you but that I am much more *alert* to the sky when I go outside both night and during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards<n>

It appeared to be moving in a northeast direction, but as it got overhead it performed three or four jerky manoeuvres to redirect its course to a more easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event took only about 60 seconds, or perhaps less.  I have seen satellites before, and I&#39;ve never seen them move like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a light, but more as a light reflecting off an object.  The light was red/gold/silver, as if it was reflecting the sun still more than shining its own light.  It was late dusk, and the brightest stars could just be seen.  This thing was unmistakably bright, brighter than the lights of aeroplanes when they are high up.  And the light was constant, not flashing, and was not red or green.<n>

When I looked up to the sky I didn&#39;t see anything for approximately 2-3 minutes.  Then I saw directly a bright circular white flash nearly directly above me that lasted one-two seconds.  The flash was circular, starting small, expanded, then recinded to nothing.  It was diffently extremely high in the sky, expanding to approximatley ten times the size of the stars in the sky.  I stayed outside another ten minutes looking around and saw nothing else.  The sky was 100 percent clear with no planes or other things in the sky.  What caught my attention was the quick burst of light in a perfect circular shape.  The area I live in is quite dark allowing me to see the stars in the sky easily at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took it in Spain on the 19th May 2009. It is a view looking west from the village of Maro towards the town of Nerja, Spain, in the evening around 6 o&#39;clock. I was only taking a shot of the view and didn&#39;t see anything else at the time, it wasn&#39;t until I put the pictures into the computer and on the big screen that I noticed it. It seems to have the UFO shape and none of the other pictures I took that day have anything like that in them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/19/09 10:40|Holyoke|MA|Changing|about 10 seconds|5 second sighting of rectangular object|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70118.html|171|ndxe200905| 5 second sighting of rectangular object<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving on 91 north 1/2 mile or so from exit 17A/B and something caught my eye in the sky.  I looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded ends; it was about the color of gun metal grey, leaning towards a brown color.  It did not appear to move sideways to me, but might have been coming towards me.  Approximately two seconds later the object &#34;dipped&#34; and the sun appeared to reflect off the object, turning the object bright white.  The object looked different as it moved/dipped, going from a rectangular object to something trapezoidal.  Almost immediately after this it disappeared, as if it &#34;blinked&#34; or was &#34;switched&#34; off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our heads instantly turned up toward the sky as we heard a loud humming noise. It only took a few steps around the house to see a very low aircraft. It was dark out but the light made it appear in a triangle shape. It was only close to a mile above the ground moving very slow. It looked as though it was slowly trying to land. We jumped in the car and headed to the park it appeared to be landing in. By the time we got there, there was no UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m currently studying psychology. I&#39;m an excellent problem solver, very resourceful, and well trusted.  I have good eye sight and would never waste my time posting a joke of any sort on any website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just on my way to the video store at about 9:30pm, just as I got in my car I noticed 3 aircraft traveling slowly in a southbound direction about to cross M-15, about 1 mile northwest of the shell station in town.  The three aircraft were being followed closely by a helicopter. The helicopter had all the usual lighting that any aircraft would display.  However, the three aircraft in front had no visible lights.  They had slim profiles unlike the helicopter. They were following eachother in a close manner, single file. It was night but the sky still maintained a its blue color as the last of the suns light disappeared.  Visibility was excellent.  I am wondering what I saw. I have been able to produce no logical explanation for unlit aircraft escorted (or followed) in the night skys.  Any small planes would certainly have visiable lights, and for three of them to be togeather, unlit ???  Fighter jets are out of the question, I would have been able to hear them, and the chopper would not have been fast enought to follow.  I have worked around aircraft, hands on, and I&#39;m baffled.  I tried to call the police shortly after to see if there were any other reports, but in this small town the police station is closed at night. I hope someone will stumble across this post and provide an explanation, and I will check back tomorrow to see if anyone else saw this.<n>

Right after the sun had set we noticed a bright light in the sky over Wickenburg. It may have been there as we watched the sun go down but we didn&#39;t notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it might be a balloon and the sun was reflecting off it, but it didn&#39;t move and it was way to high in the sky. There was some clouds in the sky but it was clear in the immediate area of the object. The objects light looked something like a blue flourescent light would give off only much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and asked if there were any reports of anything unusual in the skies over Wickenburg. She said no, but someone had reported something like a ballon over Cave Creek (north Phoenix). At the same time, my wife called a friend of ours in Morristown (halfway to Wickenburg) and had her step outside to observe it. She said there had been reports of lights in the sky, in the same area and at about the same time for the last few days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it and as we got to Wickenburg, we saw people on the sidewalks and parked cars with people outside watching it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 minutes had passed by now and I went to my back yard and continued to watch it. My neighbor was outside too, and I drew her attention to it. We continued to watch for another 15 or 20 minutes. I took a picture with my phone and the sky took but the object didn&#39;t. As we were observing it a jet flew by in the general area  of the object, about 30,000 feet or so, (the passengers must have hadf a real good view of it) and it looked to be 6 or 7 times bigger than the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed something like a red or orange glow and within a minute, it moved straight away from us and looked mlike a star ant then was gone. There were no stars out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was 2:23pm (local eastern) and the sky was clear and sunny.  The light appeared to me to be an airliner at first.  Upon further review, the altitude must have been 100,000+ feet and the distance from my location unknown.  The light did not move in the sky.  The intensity of the light is really what kept my attention; it was as bright as the sun.  I did pull my car to the side of the road to watch it because the size vs. altitude was not adding up in my head to be correct.  After about 1 minute, the object turned black/dark grey and seconds later I was unable to locate the object with my eyes.  Even when it turned black/dark grey, the size to altitude ratio would have made the object much bigger than an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It slowly moved behind a tree out of my sight for about 5 minutes.  I stood up and walked to the other side of my balcony &amp; saw the light again.  It slowly moved to the right, and then up.  After a few seconds it started moving back to the right. very slowly.  Once it had moved to directly in front of me, but it seemed to be a mile or more away from me.  At this point i stepped inside to call my husband outside.  When i did that  it started moving quickly toward me.  By the time my husband made it outside it was a VERY bright white light, almost like a spotlight pointed toward us.  It flew straight toward us and red lights started flashing on both sides of the craft.  It was directly above a shopping center in front of our apartment, i&#39;d say about a football field (maybe that far) in front of us. It turned direction, towards the left (west) and flew silently ahead until it was out of sight.  When it first turned, i could see a row of lights (dim) along the bottom side (almost middle) of the craft.  You could tell it was metallic and it seemed to have what looked like rocket jets shooting orangish light out of them.  They were on both sides of the back of the craft, in between the red lights. The whole time it never made noise.  It was eerily quite for the city.  My husband and I just looked at each other &amp; commented on how strange it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed high-altitude research balloon.  PD))<n>

While scanning for it (with 15x70 binoculars)  I saw an object appear near the moon,  At first I thought it was Venus but then realized it was moving in a south-easterly direction, quite fast.  I focused on it and it seemed a lot closer as I had to adjust the focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round and seemed to have something red sort of trailing around it.  The red part seemed to be moving around the disc.  I lost track of it after about a minute.  I went back to looking for the planet Venus and saw another object fitting the same description, at high altitude this time traveling in a westerly direction.  I watched it for about a minute.  They both made me think of a red and white parachute at first, but then I realized that they were traveling too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally I finally did spot Venus and it wasn&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took several pictures but the object was at a great distance it appeared. The sun was just breaking the horizon and all stars had disappeared but you could still plainly see this object and I live in downtown so the street lights  block out quite a bit but this seemed to shine silver and I looked  through bonoculars about this time and it seemed to emmit light from the center and expand and contract. I when inside for a minute and came out to see if I could still locate it but it had disappeared. I just walked outside to see if I possible would see it again and I believe I am seeing it again this mornng but more to the south west but still at a 10 oclock angle.I will try to get a better picture or dvd.

I was looking directly up for satellites/meteorites and noticed a burnt orange colored circular shape silhouette moving slowly (like a bird soaring) in a northern direction (this was nothing that came from the campfire as it was big and had a very high altitude).. it wasn&#39;t easy to spot unless you were looking in that direction as there were no lights and no sound, just a faint big circular dark/burnt orange colored object. I pointed my 300mW green laser pointer at it to ask the other 5 witnesses if they could see it and after tracking the object with the laser for 2 seconds it quickly (in less than 1 second) moved away from the laser to the west a few hundred feet (it looked like a few hundred feet from the ground, it could&#39;ve been a few miles at that altitude).. then it moved slowly more to the west, until i hit it again with the laser and it then quickly moved south.. then east.. then north again... and then east until we lost sight of it behind some tree&#39;s. It seemed that it didn&#39;t want to be hit with the laser, and would quickly moved away from the beam. The laser was shining high enough that when i hit the object the laser beam would reflect off the object (as if you were pointing the laser at any solid object) until the object quickly moved out of the way, then the beam would be high in the sky again. The object made turns between 10 + 90 degree angles and moved fast when the laser beam had hit it. The amount of time that passed between the first sighting of it and when we lost sight of it completely was approximately 20 seconds. 1 of the ladies got so scared she ran inside her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were fireworks 2 hours prior, and there is a small airport nearby.. but i know neither had anything to do with this as there&#39;s nothing that i&#39;m aware of that can move that quick or change direction so quick in our area or anywhere for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: May 17th 2009 Time: 23:35 EST Hanover ON 44.157 -81.024 - exact coordinates of sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a total of 6 witnesses, only 2 had been drinking (myself not being one of them).

It was a clear night and the stars were visible.  I noticed a single bright, round, white light at about 35,000 feet (or more) in the sky to the north and thought it was a plan.  I looked up and it just continued to get brighter and quickly disappeared.  There was no noise and the color and shape stayed the same.  It almost seemed like the light was coming closer and just turned around and went up and was gone.  It took about 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It wasn’t a plane, satellite, or shooting star.  I wonder if it was a dying star or even a UFO.<n>

We noticed something rather odd. A star out of place, perhaps a jet liner. We do live near an airport and it&#39;s not uncommon to see lights from a jet high in the sky.  Sometimes even military aircraft go buzzing around making awful noise. I thought it was probably a jet.  It did not seem to move about at all, and it appeared far enough away to be a star. The object was blinking with red and white lights. We stared in awe wondering what it could be when all of a sudden. Like a star plucked from the sky it seemed to dive straight in at us at incredible speed.  Once it was close enough to make out, (which was within seconds) my wife frantically ran in the house scared.  I stared at it as it stopped and hovered maybe 150-200 yards above the ground, on my left side.  Right above my property. Not making a sound it moved at a slow speed across to my right side over and across the tree tops until out of sight. I saw the craft very clearly.  It was shaped kind of like a star destroyer from star wars but much smaller. I would guess its size could have taken up half a football feild.  Its color was a bluish grey, very dark.  The craft had a few very dim lit lights underneath of it.

Every once in awhile it would come to a stop. There were 3 lights visible, 2 yellow and 1 red between them. After observing it for a couple minutes, it went out of sight be hind a tree that obstructed our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/17/09 19:45|Las Cruces|NM|Sphere|2 hours|bright orbs in triangular formation over NASA facility in Las Cruces, NM 7:45pm 5/17/09|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70075.html|199|ndxe200905| bright orbs in triangular formation over NASA facility in Las Cruces, NM 7:45pm 5/17/09<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend called me to tell me to check out a U.F.O. in the sky to the east at 7:45 pm.  I went outside and saw what looked like 3 large white balloons grouped together. It seemed as though it was reflecting the light from the setting sun, but as the sun set the objects got brighter, a lot brighter. I also noticed that even with the light breeze, the objects were not moving.  I soon realized these were not balloons. There were no other stars out at this point and I started getting text messages from 4 other friends telling me to check out whatever it was in the sky.  As I was in my backyard looking and describing over the phone to my friend, I could see one large orb in the center with three other orbs around it, seeming to be attached. The outer orbs were changing location, but always remained equidistant from each other (triangular formation). The object was fairly close, less than 10 miles away. I could also see a faint glow or haze around the object. My friend who called me was on the other side of town and it appeared much smaller to him than it did to me. My neighbor was outside in his backyard so I called him over and we started watching it together. As we watched, the orb flashed pinpoints of white light around it. It then began flashing pinpoints of red light around it.  After a few more minutes the center orb began to dim and the flashing pin points of light stopped, then the outer three orbs turned red and got brighter, becoming the only visible lights. At this point my neighbor’s roommate came outside with his camera and took pictures.  While I was on the phone describing what I was seeing, a small flashing light shot out of the bottom and headed northwest towards Albuquerque.  I could see a faint contrail behind the orb. This light was only visible for about 10 seconds before it was out of sight. The main object still remained in its same location but began to dim again.  Once in a while I could see a small light appear next to it, but I had to look away from the main object! to see it.  Several times I also witnessed the object to move slightly to the side or slightly upward, but always returning to its original location. Over the course of an hour, it remained it the same position in the sky, getting dimmer whereas the stars started to become visible and got brighter.  After an hour and a half it was difficult to see and was dimmer than the stars, but remained in the same place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure there will be more reports, as I had 4 friends from different locations in town that all noticed it on there own and told me to check it out.  It was also nice to have my neighbor watch it with me as he was able to verify all the things I was seeing. As a side note, I found it interesting that it seemed to be directly above the NASA facility which is on the western side of the mountains from White Sands Missile Range.  I have seen other strange things in the sky before, but never have I seen something so clearly that remained in the same place for so long and have so many other witnesses.  I don’t have the pictures, but when zoomed in, it looked like 3 orbs in a triangular formation with the light stretching towards each other.  It resembled a hot air balloon but was clearly not. Another friend of mine took pictures but I haven’t seen it yet as I am writing this just after the experience.<n>

I high flying jet aircraft with con trail, came in from the west and made 90 degree turn at location of siting.  The jet came within one minute of the object moving out of visual site.<n>

5/17/09 11:30|Kempton Park (South Africa)||Disk|unknown|2 disc shaped objects captured in aircraft photo|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70077.html|203|ndxe200905| UFO Sighting Report  Date: 17th May, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 11:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Place: Barnstormers Flying Club, Kempton Park, South Africa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: 2 disc shaped objects captured in aircraft photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday 17th May, 2009 I was taking photographs of radio controlled model aircraft at an airshow at my local club. The day was very clear, without any clouds, but was extremely windy as a cold front had just moved in from the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only full sized aircraft were commercial airliners approaching OR Tambo International airport at an elevation of approximately 2000 metres above ground level. No small aircraft or helicopters were seen in the vicinity at all during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several incidents the worst 2 being aircraft that went totally out of control and crashed into the ground. My camera, a Cannon EOS 350 D Digital fitted with a 300 mm lens, was consistently going into an error mode requiring switching off and on to reset. This was mildly annoying. Another anomaly was that where I was sitting, amongst the parked model aircraft, all of them switched off, I though I heard the electronic relays “chattering” occasionally but dismissed it as impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the following morning whilst downloading to my PC all the photographs that I had taken I spotted 2 strange “blobs”. On closer examination after zooming the picture the “blobs” resemble disc shaped flying objects. Unfortunately the focus is not good as I was focusing on the model aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft were about 150 meters away but the “blobs” are about 10 to 15 kM away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could these be the typical saucer shaped UFO’s that we read about so often?  I am a normal, educated and responsible male adult, 68 years of age. I am not prone to exaggerating and have an analytical approach as I am a qualified professional Electrical Engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time that I have actually seen something like this, although I have seen strange fast moving lights at night. I live close to OR Tambo international airport as well as DENEL semi military aircraft facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you require the original photograph please give me an e-mail address to send it to. It is 2.42 MB in size.<n>

We were talking, walking slowly, just killing time and he pointed to the sky in the distance (I&#39;d say about a half a mile away) at treetop level and said &#34;Do you see wings on that plane?&#34;  I looked up and saw a cigar shaped &#34;thing&#34; in the sky...it wasn&#39;t moving like any airplane I&#39;ve ever seen...it sort of hovered, going forward and drifting backward and side to side in no particular order, it just hung in the sky sort of. We watched it begin to move forward at a slow rate and moved ourselves to the middle of the track to get a better look...when we got there it was gone completely. I said something like &#34;we lost it&#34; and my friend said, loudly &#34;there it is&#34;  and pointed directly over our heads.We heard no sound, none of the distinctive &#34;trails&#34; that accompany airplanes...nothing.  It was the same shape, still &#34;hovering&#34; and an iridescent color...vaugely pink, sort of silver-metallic....kind of an indefinite shape, still cigar shaped but the edges weren&#39;t really defined, like a glob of mercury (if you can imagine...sounds crazy, I know)this time it was much higher in the sky than before. We stood  transfixed for about 5 minutes as it slowly drifted into one direction and was gone from our sight. We both sat down on a bench and asked each other what we thought it was, &#34;can you believe it?!&#34; and all that stuff. Suddenly the silence was broken by the sound of a jet roaring overhead, going in the direction of the &#34;thing in the sky&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It wasn&#39;t lights but more of a luminescent glow that was very dim.  There was nothing flashing, no blinking lights, just the 2 glows.  I couldn&#39;t really tell any shapes of a spacecraft, only the glow.  They were going very close to the ground, maybe 30-50 feet up.  As they passed above me, they crossed each other like they were swapping places...right glow to the left, left glow to the right, and just speed off across the sky.  They were absolutly silent as I remember hearing nothing but the grass crunching under my feet as I stared at them in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen hundreds of airplanes cross the sky where I was, and have never seen anything that you couldn&#39;t tell was a plane by the blinking colored lights and visual shape of the plane.  Not to mention it was far to close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to the sky, and saw a glowing object traveling west to east.  It was round; or rather it was a larger sphere with two smaller spheres on the bottom.  It was totally silent.  The larger sphere glowed orange, and the smaller spheres were blue.  It was not a plane, and it did not look like any meteor I ever saw.  It moved too quietly and too fast for a plane, and too slowly to be a meteor.  The orange glow was very distinct.  The two smaller spheres on its bottom were too large for aircraft lights and were not flashing or bright enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, the object traveled west to east, low in the sky.  It wasn’t tiny, nor was it large.  It was much larger than a meteor.  It was not a fireball.  The glow seemed to come from inside the sphere.  It didn’t leave any trail; there was no sound, and no electrical malfunctions at my house.   When the object passed over me, and was east of me, it completely disappeared. It wasn’t far enough away to have been out of viewing range.  It was there and gone.  Just like that.    I stood outside a while to see if there was any more activity, but I saw nothing else except for flashes of light from a thunderstorm far to the east-southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen a UFO in the past 4 months.  The other one disappeared, then reappeared, then disappeared again.  I hoped this one would reappear, but it did not. It was just before 1 am central time.<n>

It seem to have a bell or acorn shape sometimes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was above the tree tops in the back of my house. It seem to get low to the ground and something separated from it and I could see a small light flashing from the ground. When the separation occurred there was a red long light or beam. There was not any sound from the objects but I was hearing the sound of branches snaping or something like it ever so often. Than the light went back down to the ground it seemed to be out of sight, for about 2 minutes. Then I saw it comming back up, it was just a low pulsing blue light, (star blue light)and I watched it travel up high into the night sky heading south. I called 911 and the city of Kirkland sent out an officer. I also got a few pics that seem somewhat strange. One is of the separation and in the pic there are 2 objects from the main craft. There is a large tract of land behind my house. It was a dump back in the 50&#39;s. I know without a dought that this was an alien craft.

We decided to go for a walk and stopped at a creek to talk and enjoy nature. We started star gazing and noticed a blue, pulsating objecting. It jumped through the sky and would stop every 5 or 6 seconds. It continued to do this for about 2 minutes, and the out of nowhere turned around (such as a car takes a u-turn) we watched it for another minute or so until it vanished in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed another object with no contrail very close to the jet which was about 3 times the size of the jet or more. As they moved to the west, the larger cylinder shaped object moved way ahead of the jet until my husband and I lost track of both. We got the binoculars out and were able to see the cylinder shaped UFO very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was long and skinny and white colored. It had something in the middle of it, like spokes sticking out or something sticking out. The UFO started out on the other side of the jet going at first the same speed as the jet but then it went a lot faster and kept putting more distance between it and the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO disappeared while we could still see the jet and contrails in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were astounded and excited when we saw it and, of course, very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was too far away and moving too quickly and getting even further away to take any pictures or a video.

The light was fairly close with absolutely no sound. It suddenly appeared, and was at a speed faster than a private single prop engine plane, probably about 300-320MPH. It traveled for about 4-5 seconds before the light made a pulse and shot straight up 90 degrees at at least 1000MPH. Another minute or so, wile observing the sky, we spotted the same object/light at an extreme altitude. Probably in the uper atmosphere or higher.

The object was incredibly glittery and after getting the binoculars I could see a red light inside it that seemed to be pulsing around the object.  While it was there I looked up in the sky and saw a soft golden light traveling over head.  This object could have been a plane, but there were no other lights on it and it seemed to be floating in a different way.  As we watched it it slowly faded away into nothingness.  This object seemed to closer to us.  Meanwhile the green light was still in the sky.  My husband went inside to call his brother to see if he could see it and I sat with the binoculars watching it.  I confirmed that though it was low in the sky, it was not on the mountain, because I could see stars below it.  As I was watching it disappeared by rapidly extinguishing.  It just went out.  After that there seemed to be no more activity.  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t grab my camera, but I didn&#39;t. Also notable is that the green glittering object did not move around the sky at all. We are a couple in our forties with three children 9-11.

It was cloudy and there was lightning because there was a storm moving in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an orange glow that at first I thought was just a plane, so I ignored it. But it appeared to be flying very low and towards us so it grabbed my attention again and I stopped. I had only really looked at it for about 10 seconds or so when the light turned bright white and started blinking, slowly at first and then more rapidly. It did that for just a few seconds more and then vanished. My husband was there with me and said it was probably just a plane that flew into the clouds. I believe differently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving from right to left in downward slant and disappeared out of view behind a neighbor’s house.  I initially thought it to be a falling/shooting star, but then it rose again above the house.  The light was far brighter than the planet/star that was also present in my view.  The light almost had a blue/white hue to it.  The light then continued to drop and rise in an extremely fast motion, followed by left to right motion, loopy motion, and more up and down motions, constantly appearing and disappearing out of my view because of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get a camera; unable to find one, ran back out to find it still making the motions in the sky.  After calling a family member to find the camera I ran back in to get the camera, came back out and it was out of sight.  I stayed waiting outside when it appeared again, but staying still.  The light then grew in brightness/intensity.  While trying to find it in my camera screen, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were over ten people who like us were amazed at what we were seeing. It was blue in color, emitting a very eerie glow and made zero noise. It moved from west to east at no more than five hundred feet above us. There were Americans as well as Mexican citizens who were among the spectators. I am a military aircraft mechanic and know what is conventional or not. This object was not a balloon, helicopter, jet, glider, or anything else that one would consider earthly. I was told from locals that these sightings are very common, and I was surprised when friends I told were not surprised.

Through my windshield I observed a single spherical bright green glowing object traveling roughly south and descending at about a 20-degree angle.  The object appeared to be about 500 to 550 yards from my position, was traveling at an even pace, at a speed I would guess to be about 80 to 90 mph.  From my perspective, I would guess the size of the object to be slightly larger than a basketball.  It did not leave a debris or vapor trail.  I lost sight of the object as it passed my windshield to my right due to the tree line on the property adjacent to the roadway.  It was my impression the object should have come into contact with the ground two to three miles from the road if it continued on the trajectory that I observed.  I did not hear or see an impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The ball was the size of a full moon in the sky and appeared to be within miles from our location.  It was jumping around wildly within its trajectory.  Its movement was similar to a lottery ball jumping around in its case during a drawing.  Once the red glowing ball reached the height of a cell phone tower in the horizon line it just disappeared without a trace.

I noticed it was a half moon this morning, and my chickens were already up and making noise (the usual). As I stood there (and as I often do), I looked directly up from my position into the night sky and I was faced to the East (the Moon would be on my right hand side, the Dipper on my Left).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually see airliners this early in the morning (one, maybe two), either coming from OKC to DFW, or from Tinker AFB in OKC, with their typical, and never confused, blinking red lights. The stars are out his morning, the moon not extremely bright, so I figured I might see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see SOMETHING, but not an airliner/jet. It was moving directly above me, from West (directly above me) to East (directly in front of me, very slightly SE, slow, long curve), and did NOT have ANY blinking lights at all. In fact, the only reason I DID see it is because unlike a jet, this twinkled from time to time like a Star (and not steady like a jet or planet, and Venus is up (I think it is her), east of the Moon&#39;s position, which was to my front right, at about the 1 O&#39;Clock position, the Moon at my 4 O&#39; Clock position).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I wondered about this, is that it left NO visible trail in a clear, partially moonlit sky (such as a foreign object, or meteorite), and was moving MUCH faster than any object I have EVER seen. It covered (from my view) directly above me, to almost Tree top in the FAR distance/horizon in less than 2 minutes, and to date, after having seen thousands of airliners/military jets move over us, I have NOT seen one cover that much distance in that amount of time. It was extremely high up, for me to not distinctly see the typical airliner lights (which you always see).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a fairly steady blue-ish light, which twinkled, had no &#34;burn&#34; trail such as a meteor (that &#34;electrical wire/copper in a fire&#34; type of trail), and finally simply disappeared (faded), still no trail, and no airliner lights. As it moved, I shifted my vision 4-5 times to other parts of the sky to compare/confirm that it was (A)Not my vision playing tricks, (B)Not a Star I was mistaking, (C)Not an Airliner (I moved my physical position to confirm) and (D)Not a Meteor. It made ZERO sound (that high up, I would not have heard it anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other airplanes were in the immediate sky (my vincinity) that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I had seen &#34;fast&#34; before, this morning proves I was wrong. EXTREMELY wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was, but I DO know I wished I had RADAR this morning!<n>

In my room there was a home gym, an entertainment center with a television and a DVD player.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed very bright lights outside of my bedroom window, and when I got up to see what was going on, they were unlocking the back door, the sliding glass door, when I retreated to my bedroom and locked the door. I then heard voices speaking to my in English telling me to make it not be so much of a struggle and give up peacefully.  Also, the object knocked out the electricity to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A being that was tall, and slim, and had what appeared to be grey skin entered into my room accompanied by at least one who is very short, something like up to my thighs (I am six feet tall), I immediately felt as though I was tranquilized and fell back onto the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke again when a being calling himself a doctor of sorts, although he said that he didn’t go to Harvard or anything like that, was preparing a device which looked like a pistol, but bare bones, just a frame, a long slender metallic object used for inserting and a blue object, which was a small sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It proceeded to insert the blue sphere into my left nostril and what seemed like up into my brain through my nasal cavity until I heard a drilling noise and a crunch.  I was sedated, but I felt compelled to get up, walk to my bathroom and to look at myself in the mirror.  I then noticed profuse bleeding from my nose, I then fell unconscious, backward, into some other being who said that he would catch me, although I must have been very heavy for him, as he struggled to catch my falling body.  I still am not clear on whether or not I fell on the rim of the bath tub, although I seem to recollect the noise of that happening. I was numb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I woke up, it seemed to me to be very late the next day, but admittedly I do not remember what day it was when I was implanted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually went later to get a MRI image of my brain, because I had remembered it shortly after, and the doctor said that something was wrong, and people in suits proceeded to confiscate the images, I was told to leave the premises, and I was not charged for the MRI scans, but was not allowed to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I would like to give it another go, I would gladly submit to MRI images or X-Ray scans, or polygraph tests to verify to you that I am honest about this, I believe that this object is still inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one who put this object into my head, he said that they wouldn’t be able to remove it, because that would kill me, but that there would be scar tissue around where it will heal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is really only one of several interactions, I am a multiple abductee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

I immediately looked at it as it traveled out of sight behind trees.  The whole episode last 2-3 seconds, long enough to train my eyes on the object as it went out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What it looked like was a spherical bright object shrouded within a hazy fog or glowing aura, traveling at very fast speed.  The color of the object was bright white with a bluish tint, or more accurately, the sphere was bright white while the glow surrounding it was bluish-white.  It seemed, instinctively, like a meteorite flying through the air but there were things about it that made me question that possibility.  One, the trajectory was straight and level, not at an angle downward.  Also, the shooting stars I&#39;ve seen in the past have always been bright and sharply defined, never one with a glowing aura surrounding it.  That immediately seemed very odd and out of place.  Plus, the time that I was able to view the object, 2-3 seconds, doesn&#39;t sound like a long enough time but compared to the shooting stars I&#39;m familiar with, it&#39;s almost an eternity.  Not only that, it didn&#39;t feel like it was going to dissipate, or burn out, as it went behind the trees but rather to continue on its present trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I was to describe it&#39;s dimension and where it was within the environment, I would say it was roughly 200-300 feet in the air and was traveling at 100 MPH+.  (It could&#39;ve have been higher but then the speed would have been amazingly fast.  I would stay with the original estimation.)  The object appeared about 3-5 feet wide while the glow extended outward 10 feet or so and maybe 15-20 feet behind.  That would seem to suggest a trail (or a tail) but I couldn&#39;t really detect anything like a vapor trail or smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If push came to shove, I would say it could&#39;ve been a significant meteorite, if I had to say it was anything identifiable.  But the color, trajectory and the glow seems to conflict with that hunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just went out to check on my dogs.  I looked up into the north west sky and saw a bright light.   The size of the light was if you took a normal star and blew it up 10 times and magnified its light by a hundred.  There were no flashing lights.  I would estimate the hight of the object at about 50 to 60,000 feet based on the hight if the highest jet in the sky.  This light made the jets in the sky pale in comparison.  I watched the object for a minute or two.  It began to move slowly across the sky a short distance.  Then it left straight up into outer space and the light faded as it went.  It was gone in less than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/14/09 22:12|Hemet|CA|Light|~ 2 minutes|second time in one month a light makes a 90 degree turn overhead|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70045.html|240|ndxe200905| second time in one month a light makes a 90 degree turn overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a coincidence.  Just yesterday, I filed a report about light that made a 90 degree left turn and was being chased by a military jet a month ago.  Last night, I was outside with my telescope, and saw something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were seeing how many galaxies we could spot through the eyepiece of my little 6-inch telescope in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster.  We were also chatting about what we did during the day.  I relayed to her how I had filed a report for a UFO chase I witnessed last month (which I had told her of the night it happened), and how picky you guys were about spell-checking the report before filing it. She was telling me about a friend who had just died from cancer. In other words, just the usual talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what we saw. At 10:12 pm, PDT on May 14th, 2009, we both saw a very bright single light moving eastward, just north of the star Spica. It was as bright as any satellite we have ever seen, like an “Iridium Flare”.  I would say it was as bright as Venus ever gets.  I said to her, “Do you see that bright satellite?” while pointing to it.  She said she did. We watched it moving for a few seconds, at the typical speed a satellite moves. It then dimmed to the brightness of a faint star.  We know satellites fade as they enter the Earth’s shadow, so it was expected.  What was NOT expected was that the “satellite” made an instantaneous left turn and headed north-east, passing next to the bright star Arcturas on its way.  I watched it fade in brightness until it was no longer visible, in northern part of the constellation Bootes.  I said to my wife, “Satellites never change direction like that.”  She agreed, as she has seen at least a hundred of satellites as well, and is familiar with the way they move across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first noticed it, it was in the general area that commercial aircraft take, but it had no blinking lights. Commercial aircraft don’t make tight turns like that.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  Commercial aircraft are very audible, both as they approach my area, and as they depart the area. There were no other aircraft visible, or audible, at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there we have it, a second mysterious light over my area making 90 degree turns, silently, in a single month.  But this time, I have a witness.<n>
5/14/09 22:02|Tulsa|OK|Cigar|10 seconds max|Large very bright bluish white "strip" of light seen on bottom of a large craft|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70042.html|241|ndxe200905| Large very bright bluish white &#34;strip&#34; of light seen on bottom of a large craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving in to work (night shift in downtown Tulsa, Ok) at 10:02pm on Hwy. I-75 southbound (near 96th street exit) I saw a VERY BRIGHT &#34;strip&#34; of white or bluish white light in the sky to the east. This is very close to the approach used for runways at Tulsa International (Rwy. 18L and 18R). I am use to seeing planes approaching to land at the airport in Tulsa, but this WAS NOT an airplane about to land at the airport. It appeared (as best I can tell) to be about 1/4 mile to my east (no way to reference this distance, just a best guess). It had a dark outline I could not identify well, but then lit up with a VERY BRIGHT strip of white light on it&#39;s bottom. The light looked a bit like the expensive xenon headlights used by teenagers in the import cars, as it was almost blue tinted a bit. maybe like a mercury vapor light, but MUCH brighter. It stayed on for about 3/4 of a second and went out, then back on for about 1/4 second. Then, as it was going dark, it started moving away (appeared to be eastbound, but was hard to tell). As soon as the lights went out, I lost sight of it&#39;s dark outline and the sighting was over. If i were to guess, i would say this strip of light was at least 100 feet long, but I could see no real shape except that the strip of light was a straight line below a darker craft. When i saw it I immediately got a &#34;fight or flight&#34; feeling as adrenaline surged through me and I was awestruck and scared at the same time. I continued the drive to work (no missing time on my commute) and sent this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a bright amber light.  The coloring resembled a bright light inside of a brown paper bag.  The light seemed to be too far off of the ground to be a spot light or new cell tower.  I grabbed a pair of 8X binoculars and went to the corner of my yard to take a better look.  I could see a larger version of the amber light through the binoculars with hardly any detail but the light did not appear to be just glare.  There seemed to be some type of object.  As I watched, it was almost like the small halo that changed positions around the bottom of the object the way a spot light would.  However there was no definitive beam of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch and tried to figure out of it was some type of balloon or helicopter, the object VERY slowly continued to rise and rise.  I thought that the object may be some type of helicopter however I heard absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I saw random parts of the field light up but I could not find the source of the light.  This happened 3 times.  I glanced from side to side as I saw the green grass light up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next The object began to move north and that is when I saw multiple blinking red lights under the object.  The amber glow was dissipating at that point.  There seemed to be 6 or so red lights in a triangle formation like bowling pins on the bottom of a single object.  I tried to record the object with my cell phone but it wouldn&#39;t pick up the light, all it recorded was black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved to north it picked up pace very fast.  The object moved rapidly over a nearby farm from my vantage point with all the red lights visible.  At this point there seemed to be a clear light on the front part of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only approximately 1-2 minutes from when the object began moving north until it was out of my sight.  As it moved on its course I could see another blinking lighted object that appeared to be further away than the initial object.  The primary object moved directly past the 2nd object from my point of view.  The second object appeared as a single blinking light of red, blue, and white.  I could see the second object long after the first object was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We had already witnessed two orange orbs in the same area about a month ago so I looked up and a few seconds later I saw one for myself except it was a “boomerang” shaped craft with 5 orange lights; one at the tip, one on each end and one on the center of each “arm” it was difficult to tell how high it was flying but I would guess approx. 3,000-4,000 feet, about as high as the local mountains. It was larger than an airplane; next to a full moon I would estimate it to be about a sixth of the size. It flew NW and disappeared into the clouds. I kept looking up into the sky when we both saw another (or the same, I’m not sure) object flying NE, then from the opposite direction one of the same size and shape came towards it, I thought they were going to collide but they instead seemed to merge into each other and become one larger object which then changed shape; the orange lights on both objects began to sort of swirl around then the craft(s) took on a double diamond shaped appearance before flying off in a NW direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then went back to our apartment about 7 blocks away; once there I witnessed another chevron or “boomerang” shaped object flying south through the sky from our front patio. At that point we decided to get our digital camera to try and record the objects and went back outside. I saw the chevron shaped object at least two other times, once flying north and then south. At this point we went outside to the street for a better view. A couple of minutes later I witnessed another chevron shaped object that appeared to be larger and flying lower than the others. It also had the orange lights on the bottom, more than the first, however this time the lights seemed to be moving in a very coordinated pattern, as I watched the lights seemed to swirl around each other in circles. There was absolutely no noise from any of these objects. Unfortunately our camera was unable to pick up the video we tried to record, however we’ve decided to take it with us when we go out riding now just in case. I will update if we see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with these witnesses, and they sounded to me to be quite sincere, and serious-minded.  PD))<n>

It is my sincere belief that the occasions within my scope of vision of flying craft qualify as those with special regard for airspace regulations and relative safety within US. To date every object has been almost like a passing passenger aircraft, marked with regular flashing airplane lights seen by me before. It is my sincere hope that one day we may know the true nature of these Unidentified Flying Craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving. 198 is a straight road. There is empty fields on each side of 198, until you get to the naval base. As we were driving I saw what looked to be an aircraft flying only about 10 feet above the ground, going north to south across 198. I said, What is that look how low that plane is flying&#34;. My boyfriend said thats not a plane thats a helecopter.We were about a mile from it than. As we approuched its path which it seemed to be going back and forth on the same path it was in no way a plane or a helecopter. There is nothing on this earth known to man that can do what this craft didAs we approched it , it was in the field on the north bound side. It was already turned around and was headed back over 198 to the southbound side.I was driving so it was on my side. This thing was only a 100 ft from the ground .It had about six bright lights that ran straight across it. It was as long as a tractor, trailor. It turned right around on a dime when it made a turn it turned to the left. As we approched, the craft seemed to speed up. and was headed right for us. The lights in the front I saw start pointing downward right for us . We were so scared we thought this thing was gonna crash right into us. Right when it reached us I looked up the lights blinded us but looked up at it out my window and if i stuck my arm out the window i could of touched the bright lights on it as it went over us. thats how low this thing was. Right when I thought it was gonna crash into us the craft went up and over us then back down to the other side of the field.When the craft was about to go over our ford Ranger Truck, I looked up at it . It looked like one huge wing It was made of metal. silver in color.The lights were bright, but I could see the outline of the craft.the huge craft was very thin. The craft looked compleatly differant as we were comimg up on it , compared to what this thing looked lik! e from a side veiw. It was so unbelivable. This thing I know was messing with us . We saw this craft turn around an b line it right at us and speed up.We really thought we were dead. My boyfriend ducked just before it went over us. I was shaking for hours after that . The craft proceeded to the southbound side of 198 turned and repeated back and fourth about 3 more times before it ended up crossing 198 going north and dissapeared .I watched it cross 3 more times in my rear mirror. My boyfriend wanted to turn around but i told him forget you that thing almost just crashed into us. I know this wasnt any aircraft of ours this was huge, It houvered 10 feet from the ground it was fast and it could turn on a dime. We dont have anything like that. Also there is no piolot gonna fly across a highway that low coming at cars. That is against the law. The most unusual thing about it was as it went over us there was no sound also somthing that big would of blown me a bit for how close he came over me .There was no wind I drove steady.But No Sound . Please I wish someone will get ahold of me about our sighting. I need to talk to somone. cant stop thinking about that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have also been a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. I am quite familiar with observing various aircraft at various altitudes, meteors, fireballs, as well as tiny polar orbital satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, Wednesday 13th of May 2009, at around 10:30pm I was observing the stars out of my home&#39;s side window looking toward the north west and I saw a very unusual event. My home is situated in Orleans Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the “stars” I was looking toward became a stationary, relatively bright white light with a ring around it. It then began moving laterally from left to right, maintaining the same brightness and ring.  Then it quickly &#39;faded out&#39;.  When I timed it out later, the whole event probably lasted no more than eight seconds. It demonstrated to me that to see something like this, you had to be in the right place, at the right time, looking toward the right direction. I&#39;m reporting it here (as a UFO) because of the following reasons...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a natural phenomenon: it was most likely a meteor that was traveling toward me. That would explain the short duration of brightness, and the slight travel from left to right before fading out. Some haze in the sky would explain the ring around it. But why did it become very bright and remain stationary in the sky at first? And if pieces breaking off it made it change direction while it was coming down, why did it move horizontally, but not downward if it was under the influence of gravity?  If it was an aircraft: it was most likely the landing lights facing me. Once again haze would explain the ring around the central bright white light. But the white was not a &#39;tungsten&#39; white, it was a pure white light. The brightening of the light and fading of the light is explainable if a rotation of an aircraft toward or away from me occurs, but how could it move laterally from left to right while maintaining the landing lights toward me. (Landing lights shine out ahead of the nose of an aircraft for the pilots to light ahead in the direction of their travel, not out from the aircraft body toward the tips of the wings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had continued looking for a long time after its disappearance to see if any aircraft  navigational lights appeared moving along the extended path of the original white light, to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following the event I began double checking my observation by going through a mental process of critical thinking (which is stated in summary above).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as I was witnessing it in real time, I was struck with awe, or shock, and an sense that this was perhaps something that was neither man-made nor a phenomenon of nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had looked up to see a really bright white (star-like) light in the sky. I noticed it descending slowly. At first I thought it were just my eyes, but after watching for about 10 more sec I knew I was definitely seeing it correctly. I immediately ran inside and yelled to my husband to come look at it. We both watched as this bright light descending very slowly behind the hills in the east/northeast. This light was almost 2x&#39;s the size of the brightest star/planet that had been just to the left of the light when I had first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled the car over and me and the passenger watched as the lights floated silently fairly close to the ground. The lights, which originally were 4 in a string, and two more off to the side, suddenly became 3 on each craft. They started flying North East and as they came overhead we could see that the lights were two seperate triangle shaped crafts. They seemed to be black or some other dark color. It wasn&#39;t completely dark outside, so when they flew over us we could see their shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were also very silent, and started to move very quickly and eventually were gone. Me and the passenger both believe in ufo&#39;s, as in, we believe there could be aliens, or it could also just be a secret military craft. But the area they were in is no where near a millitary base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that time I observed what looked like a large white flood light in a tree line, 1 mile south of RR. 6.  The light was moving at too great of speed and changed direction to sharply to be a vehicle or poacher.  I stopped on RR.6 and watched the light for approximately 12-14 minutes.  The light then stopped and split into 2 different lights, 1 the same bright white, the other a blue green color.  The blue green light stayed ststionary while the white light continued traveling east in the tree line.  The lights were approximately 1 half mile apart when I heard what sounded like an electrical snap.  At that time the blue green light streatched from it&#39;s stationary spot to where the white light was.  The whith light then stopped and the blue green light re-appeared on top of the white light.  The lights then moved slowly to just above the tree line.  At that time I heard the electrical sound again, and the lights streatched to the west and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a person who beleives in this kind of stuff. I am a former Police Officer, and currently a armed nuclear officer. I thought I was initially looking at a poacher until I realized how fast the object was moving.<n>

As the object came thru the clouds the 2 lights (that would have been on what would be the wings of a airplane) started from the side of the object and came together toward the front of the UFO into one solid beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked pretty low, low enough for me to see it also have a pattern of white and red lights in a V formation they were behind the one beam of light facing forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound it made was a low steady rumble, not a hum but more of a stedy rumble, really low sound but loud enough I could hear it.

As I stood outside, I was facing North and noticed a bright light moving across the sky at somewhat fast speed relative to my position on the ground. The light caught my eye from the Western sky and moved from west to east. The light was bright, white and seemed to grow and diminish in intensity several times during my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s path seemed straight, made no noise, and bore no navigational lights. I had observed it&#39;s path as being approximately 20 degrees elevated from the horizon, and traveled a very approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. It may have been higher, but that would have meant the craft would have had to have been quite enormous. It&#39;s flight made it from the Western sky horizon to the Eastern Sky horizon until I lost sight of it behind some neighbours trees. The craft was just as illuminated whilst traveling from me; as it was approaching me. At that altitude, my best calculation of speed would have been several times the speed of sound. Yet no sonic booms or vapour trials were evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, this is an exact duplicate sighting of the same craft I saw one night in Stewartown, Ontario with a number of multiple witnesses 6 years ago, one of which was a MUFON representative. It was an almost identical flight path, and characteristics as this sighting. I&#39;ve ruled out any airplanes, test missile flights, or satellites/space station. This is truly an unidentified object traveling at great speed, and without any sound.<n>

It was fluorescent blue and it seemed to be accelerating upwards. It seemed pretty close to the ground (about 200 ft)and what I&#39;d liken it to was the back of a jet engine accelerating (when the orange becomes brighter) except it seemed quite wide like 30ft in diameter.  My girl friend witnessed it with me and then it suddenly vanished.  It was completely weird.  I honestly believe it was a ufo.. then we wouldn&#39;t stop looking out the window (as you would do after something like that) and noticed these three objects really high in the sky and I know it wasn&#39;t a helicopters or aeroplanes as I can see the flight path of aeroplanes coming in to Newcastle (you can visibly see planes ascending/descending) and the height. These objects could easily have been mistaken for stars.. they were that far away but you could make out they were changing colors red, white and blue. One of them was closer (but still miles up)and you could see it getting smaller and smaller like it was accelerating away. I should also mention the positions of them in the sky was like a large (I&#39;d imaging miles wide) triangle. These seemed to hang around for a few hours and after a while i just stopped watching but I am certain the two diff items are related....I&#39;d like some commentary from you in this via e-mail.

Disappeared after 5 mins.  Too large to be a plane at that altitude (there was a small semi-transparent cloud I used as reference for altitude), and didn&#39;t have any blinking light (a plane would have its lights).  No engine-trail behind the object (like a plane usually leaves) and completely disappeared after 5 mins.  The object was directly over Sacramento, a bit towards Roseville.  Should crosscheck with planes schedules anyhow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I observed a large passenger jetplane ascending toward the clouds.  I quickly decided to take a picture before it got out of sight.  I looked into the viewfinder and was about to snap the shutter, a dark round object suddenly appeared below the clouds.  It was already in a downward speeding motion toward the jet.  It pursued the jet from its rear at great speed.It maintained an elevated height to the jet&#39;s tail.  The plane was moving very fast.  The object was moving faster but slowed when it matched the jets speed.  I released the shutter stunned and then ran to my computer to see if I caught the object in the picture.  I did. I believe it to be from the same group of objects I had seen and photographed the day before.<n>

It looked like a normal launch like the many I’ve watched before except on this occasion I noticed a irregular object in the same vicinity of the shuttle just as the shuttle went out of view.  To the naked eye it looked cigarette shaped and was moving rapidly to from West to East.  As I focused on the object it appeared to be cylinder shaped and was moving horizontally.  I did notice what appeared to be fins towards the aft of the object but it was not identifiable to any aircraft I have seen before.  I short it looked like a missile (no wings mid ship) flying horizontally at a very fast rate of speed.  I&#39;ve watched airliners before thru a telescope and compare the rate of speed to be far faster than a commercial aircraft.  There was no vapor trail or any sign of exhaust.  I&#39;m not saying this was extraterrestrial but I have a good knowledge of aircraft military and commercial and have never seen anything like this before flying in the manner (horizontally) it was.  I hope someone else in South Florida witnessed the same thing.  My location is Port St.Lucie Florida roughly 12 nautical mile inland of the beach and I was looking ENE about 45deg of the horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded sincere to us.

I live in Powell, Ohio in an upper middle class housing development that is tucked away and surrounded by a large rural area. It was just after midnight on May 11, 2009 when we were preparing to turn onto my street. It was mostly cloudy with a bright moon that was at the time shielded by clouds. The moon was in the south east part of the sky. In the north sky we noticed, 4, almost round, but oval, objects of white light that were moving around and I think they were also crossing each other. The objects, at first, were moving at a consistently paced medium speed. The grouping of lights, as a whole, was also moving slowly away from me through the north sky. We drove around, followed and watched them for about two minutes and then stopped the van and I got out and watched for about 30 seconds more while my girlfriend remained in the van.  I decided to get my camera. I went back to the van and retrieved my camera. The area where the objects seemed to be was near a line of large electric towers. The objects seemed to stay together in the same part of the sky, but their moving around speed began to slightly increase. When I turned my camera on and was waiting for it to prepare to be able to use, the objects moved into the center of where they had been rotating and became one and disappeared. When they became one object, that single object did not increase in size or brightness. The lights did not appear to have been projected from the ground. Their intensity on the cloudy sky was not bright. They were not faint, but they were not bright. The entire incident lasted approximately 5 minutes. I then drove around for about 10 minutes toward the area where I had seen the lights. I don’t know if this was related to the objects we saw, but when I got back in my van to drive toward where I had seen the objects, one street light went out as I was beginning to pass by it. No other lights went out and there w! ere no o ther incidents. After approximately 15 minutes had passed since we first saw the objects, I made an anonymous phone call to the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office and asked them if there would be any reason why there would be strange lights in the sky in the area of Liberty Rd and Hyatts Rd.  The deputy said no and I then asked if anyone had reported seeing any lights in the sky. When he said no again, I stated that it must just be my eyes and hung up. I know what I saw and my girlfriend knows what she saw. When we got home, we wrote down the facts of what we both saw and I got on line to see if there were any similar sightings of the objects of light. I am 46 years old, retired from part time law enforcement and currently a small business owner.  My girlfriend is a 29 year old nursing student.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Neither of us has ever seen anything like this, and we both agreed on what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA.  We were lying on the lawn, at a concert.  There were various ordinary looking airplanes in the air, all lit up normally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we saw two small swept wing shapes quite high up, in formation, but the trailing object was in very loose, and erratic formation with the leader.  This was unlike any kind of normal military jet formation I&#39;ve ever seen.  ( I am an ex airline pilot.)  The two were on an westerly heading, flying very, very fast, faster than any military jets would fly, and they were lit up on their undersides in a kind of feathery light, but the entire underside was lit up.  We could not see any detail, except that they were small, swept wing objects.  They made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have said, my wife and I both saw the objects, and we did not disagree on what we had seen.  It was the first time in either of our lives that we realized we had seen something that did not look human-related.  We would very much like to know what we were seeing.<n>

I saw something flying low, blackish-gray boomerang shaped, no lights, no sound, gliding slowly over the neighborhood around 2130 sunday night. I thought it was a flock of birds but it never broke formation and was to perfect of a shape, and there is noway it was a plane because it had no lights or sound, plus a plane flew over, in a different direction, maybe 30 seconds after in which I could hear sound and see blinking lights on it, at a much higher altitude.  Two other people saw the ufo fly over also and none of us have ever seen anything like it before.  Just checking to see if any other reports have came in.  If you have any questions please call or email me.  Thanks<n>

It was headed NE from here looked like it was going at a smooth clip but didn&#39;t seem too fast because it just glided through the air (my opinion) but I imagine it must have been going very fast. &lt;--- Ok that sounds contradictory... what I mean to say is that it must have been going fast because it was going about as fast as one of theses LAPD choppers when they are cruising by but silent and I guess because of the lack of noise, it just seemed to glide by effortlessly which in my head made it seem like it was just strolling by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry i really suck at explaining this...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright white light... no blinking just solid Didn&#39;t have time to grab a camera but i did have binoculars nearby, through them, god help me I&#39;m gonna say it... it looked triangular but that could be just what was exposed by the light. From what i could tell it seemed like the size of a Helicopter but in no way did it make me think it was one... just a size reference! The light on it was bigger than an LAPD chopper spotlight and it wasn&#39;t emitting a beam or anything, at least in my opinion... I see enough LAPD choppers at night to know the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unless he was running with no lights but that one and somehow made his chopper completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Made no noise whatsoever... I even started talking to it, saying &#34;hold on&#34;, &#34;come closer&#34;, sounds corny but I really wanted to communicate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> God, I&#39;m shaking I&#39;m so excited... this was about 20 minutes ago 8:20 pm PST  Ok, so right after I typed this I heard some LAPD choppers over in the NE direction for awhile and then I heard them pass by my complex heading to what sounded to be in the SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted that the whole time this was going on, including while I was typing this post my cell phone kept turning off and rebooting itself over and over again and stopped after I heard the LAPD go by. Could be the phone though... I hate my blackberry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been LAPD or any other helicopter only due to the fact it seemed to be very close and made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish it had stopped for awhile<n>
5/10/09 19:30|St. Louis|MO|Changing|7-10 Minuites|Diamond shaped object in southern sky, have compelling video|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70036.html|279|ndxe200905| Diamond shaped object in southern sky, have compelling video<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a strange object in the southern sky on Sunday 5/10/09 at approximately 7:30 PM.  The flight was not consistent with any aircraft I&#39;m familiar with.  It was slow and methodical, and in the distance.  It appeared to be 2000-4000 feet in altitude, approximately as large as a 2 story house, and appeared to change shape either by rotating or turning over somehow.  I also caught about 4 minutes of video tape; of which about 10-15 seconds are pretty compelling that what I saw is simply unexplained.  Here is a brief description of the events:  	At about 7:30 PM on 5/10/09 I had just finished cleaning up from a massive Mother&#39;s Day feast that I had prepared.  I stepped outside on my back porch for some fresh air, when I noticed a very small object in the sky.  I first thought it was a high flying plane at 50,000 feet which sometimes fly overhead.  Then I realized that it was overcast, and that I couldn&#39;t possibly see that high.  After reasoning about the cloud cover I thought the object to be around 2000-3000 feet high.  Since then I have learned that the cloud cover was at 7000-8000 that night, so the object was definitely under that ceiling.  My initial thoughts of 2000-3000 feet may be correct, but not for certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I realized that is was moving too slow for a normal aircraft at that altitude so I called for my girlfriend to come and take a look.  She thought it was odd as well, and I asked her to rush to get the video recorder.  We started shooting the object, and was initially very hard to get into focus as our zoom was at 35 xs and was in auto focus mode.  So if we moved just slightly, or caught the top of a tree, or had a bird fly right by it would keep auto focusing and then blur out the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we fiddled through it for a minute or two, we got the hang of it, and were able to capture several distinctly different shapes not visible with the naked eye.  One was a diamond, one looked like a slightly elongated football, and one like a top with some sort of antennae protruding from the top half of the shape.  There was only one object, but was either turning or rotating to create these different shapes.  The video we have is shaky, showing the object to dart around, but in reality it was moving in a straight line, and our zoom at 35 xs and our shaky hand is the cause for the appeared erratic motion of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight of the object was in the southern sky headed due north.  As it came north, it seemed to drop in altitude.  Then it went 45 degrees NE, and then headed due east.  As it headed east it appeared to ascend. At various times it appeared to have some sort of halo or ring around the entire object; either from air displacement or something else.  It made no noise, and there were other aircraft in the sky that were farther away and closer that were making noise.  The whole event from start to finish lasted roughly 7-10 minutes, and we have roughly 4-5 minutes of video.  There are about 15 seconds of very compelling shots of an object that I&#39;ve never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m about as well versed in Military Aviation as a private citizen can be, as I&#39;m fascinated with the Military Channel, the Discovery Channel, and the History Channel.  This was not a B2, a F117, F22, or an F35.  I have seen all of them on numerous shows, and I can&#39;t see how any of the shapes I saw on the video could be one of those aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, after my story aired on some local news stations here in town, a gentleman contacted me via fax with some sketches he drew after a sighting with him and his girlfriend on June 20th 2007 at approximately at 7:50 PM.  When I saw the fax it was clear that the images were very similar though he didn’t have a video or a picture.  I contacted him and he came to my office to hear my story.  When he showed up, we talked for a bit.  He seamed genuine in nature, and as he was telling me his story, I quickly realized the similarities to my event.  The object seemed to change shape on an axis, there were at times a blur or a ring around the object obscuring the air around the object, that it moved slowly and deliberately across the sky changing altitude, and that it matched no aircraft he had ever seen either in shape or flight characteristics.  He explained that when he called his girlfriend into the room to see the story on TV she immediately said, “That’s it…”  Although he saw most of the object with the naked eye, it was closer to him than for me, as I wouldn’t have been able to decipher the shapes with my naked eye.  Only with the use of my camera with the zoom all the way at 35 xs was I able to clearly see the shape of the object.  In telling me his story, I could see he felt vindicated of sorts, and was very interested in seeing where this went.  He said with almost 99% certainty that we saw the same object...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can send a still picture, and I&#39;m truly writing to see if we can get any type of explanation of what we saw, or if you could shed some light into where we could go for help.<n>

The sky was mostly clear with a few light clouds.  I was watching a plane fly over and above that was small silver reflective circle shaped object flying from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my wife and my 12 year old son who also saw it.

When I turned to look it was too big to be a satellite and I assumed it was a plane. However, it was flying a little lower than usual, had no blinking lights, made no sound, was round in shape with a luminescence to it, and flew faster than an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was amber in color with a peach and orange color to it. It&#39;s trajectory was perfectly straight as it traveled above our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it flew over we were mystified as to what we had witnessed and are still in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The winds seem to be heading N/NE not directly East.

I notice a stationary back dot in the sky above Providence Hospital with grey clouds for a background. I told my wife, and she spotted it with my help. After watching it for a while, I decided to run inside and get my old video camera. I videotaped it with my elbows braced on the deck so I could show it&#39;s movement. At about the time I started filming it, it started drifting(?) to the east on a horizontal plain. At one point I tried to zoom out to get some scale and perspective, but lost it when I tried to zoom back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the video on my big screen, you can see an object arching beneath the main object. It&#39;s hard to describe. Though even on the big screen the main object looks like a shapeless black object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed it to a bunch of friends last night, and they insisted the I have a expert look at the video. Hence this contact. I have yet to transfer the video to a digital form. My firewire card is not working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I love physics and astronomy, and so I have a hard time believing we are being visited by other life forms....sorry. But I do believe in the term UFO. I was in Phoenix when the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; occurred, and I witnessed them from an overpass (Dunlap &amp; I-17). I still believe they were government related. This may too be the case.<n>

I also live about 10 miles from a small airport so I do see a lot of planes crossing the sky. I&#39;m used to that, but tonight I went onto the back deck and noticed two lights. I almost looked away as I said this is nothing unusual, but it caught my attention suddenly that one of the lights was darting, then it would angle and dart again. I think it happened about 3 or 4 times, but being alone I was afraid and ran back into the house (Sorry, that part is embarrassing, I guess I&#39;ve seen too many scary movies). When I noticed the one light darting that way I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the other, it may have moved I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never seen a UFO and maybe this wasn&#39;t, I kind of hope it wasn&#39;t, but I&#39;ve never seen anything even remotely like it and I&#39;d sure like to know what it was. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didn’t see if the light just appeared or was traveling across horizon, but when we noticed it was really bright, just above the tree line in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling in a southward direction across the sky, faster than a plane, and the light was getting brighter then suddenly dimmed and got dimmer and dimmer and finally disappeared out in space. What ever it was, this thing definitely left our atmosphere and went into space. The whole thing lasted around 3 minutes.<n>

After about 5 minutes along a similar trajectory, I witnessed the same thing again, by I presume, another object or possibly satellite debris.  Finally I saw a third object about another 5 mintues later doing the same sort of inconsistent pattern.  No series of satellites would follow that close in my opinion along the same trajectory unless it is debris from a rocket, or satellite or something else we have not heard of yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a bright sunny day with no clouds.  We laid down to enjoy the day and we both spotted plane flying over head.  It was a normal passenger plane.  We are near an Air Force base and an International airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are under a pine tree.  The plane disappears into the braches, and then we spot a very small yet super shinny object up In the sky.  It seemed to be higher than the plane and further away.  The plane crossed between us and the object in our field of view. The object was stationary.  I thought it was an astronomical event, maybe Venus shining very brightly for some odd reason.  So we did not try and find the plane after it flew over the tree we were under.  But neither of us ever saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO stayed in its position for approximately 15 minutes.  After a while we both had taken our eyes off of it, only too look back to its location and not see it there. Instead it was heading northeast at a decent pace, blinking like a light.  Its speed was maybe a little faster than a cruising passenger plane.  However we could not judge its altitude well.  It flew too far away and out of sight for us.  We did not have a video or picture abilities with us.  My wife and I were surprised and proceeded to try and interpret what we had saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after we were digesting what we had saw, we looked back up and she spotted two more objects that were the exact same luminosity and size.  They were floating very slowly in the same direction as the previous one.  They floated away over a period of ten minutes and out of view, however they never blinked or sped up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I did not spot anything else that day.<n>

It was about 30 minutes to our arrival at LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at an unusual cloud formation that looked like a a contrail of some sort, that was nearly parallel in height to the jet plane we were in.  The white contrail at first just seemed to stop, which is why I thought it was just a cloud formation.   My daughter was in the window seat, so I asked her to look out the window and tell me if she saw anything unusual.   We both stared out the window and she said she saw 4 dark circles that seemed to be in a boomerang formation.   While she is saying this, I realized that the contrail didn&#39;t just end, it WAS behind 4 dark circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was flying slower than the plane, so we had had to strain to continue to see it.  Neither of us thought to get a camera and take a picture of it.  It did not appear to be that far away and the circles seemed to be about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  They were large enough, that if it had been a plane, we should have been able to see some detail, like wings and a fuselage, but they were just dark circles.  It was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe there is a completely mundane explanation for what we saw, but it wasn&#39;t like anything I recognized.  I was hoping that someone else might have reported seeing something, because it did appear we were over a populated area.  You could see roads, houses, reservoirs, etc...<n>

He was sitting on this front porch stoop (facing West) and noticed a silver sparkling object   appearing  to travel  up the side of Peavine mountain.  At first he thought it was a helicopter but ruled this out due to the rapid ascent and abrupt changes in directions without regard to being on a road or paths that were visible on the side of the mountain.  He indicated he observed this object for about 30 seconds then decided to get his binoculars and camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then observed this object going above the top of Peavine in a westerly or north-westerly direction.  He used is Canon digital camera with the 40 power  lens  and took three pictures, only two frames captured the object which  was just a small dot in the totally blue sky background.  He was so excited that he yelled at me to come and see the object which was shimmering in the sky at some distance, I used his binoculars then got my binoculars to observe the shinny and our US Postman also observed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While using my binoculars and observing the object, it sped different directions and reversed course very rapidly, unlike any normal flying craft.

So I glanced out of the window to see to bright lights sitting completely still in the sky.  There were no other stars seen and this was the first time I&#39;ve every seen anything like this.  My mom in law said they went out there 30 minutes to an hour early and it got real close and had blue lights flashing on the top of the white light.  I was too scared to go outside to take picture because it was still dark.  I was looking out the window and saw the top light drop and smaller light which fell slowly down and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have pictures of this lights in the sky that were taken around 5am.  I could only describe them as lights that grew dimmer and dimmer and moved ever so slightly as the sun came through. At 5:45 they disappeared.  I will be out there tomorrow night to see if they come back.<n>

The lights slowly roatated in a controlled sequence around the periphery of the disk.  It was moving on a southerly track. In my opinion it seemed to be following the same outbound track from Heathrow airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No central core of the disk was defined and the disk gradually dissapperared into the low cloud.  Throughout the sequince, there was no sound what so ever.  Estimated size of the disk was a least one mile across.  I have benn a pilot for 35 years and my profession is teaching pilots associated subjects,  I have witnessed various kinds of atmospheric phenomena.  Also, every kind of aircraft.  This was a contolled craft.  It was not a natural phenonmenon, nor was it any kind of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into work the next day and a collegue of mine who is also an instuctor, was talking to a group of other pilots.  I went over to listen and he was describing exactly what I had seen, he had been in a pub in Ascot, Berkshire, 5 minutes from where my house is, with a group of friends, all of which saw the same thing as I.<n>

WE WATCHED A WHITE LIGHT GO FROM DIM TO BRIGHT A FEW TIMES, BUT DIDNT APPEAR TO MOVE. WHILE WATCHING THAT LIGHT, MAYBE A 100 OR SO YARDS TO THE SOUTH, A PULSATING ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT APPEARED, AND ACTUALLY SUBMERSED ITSELF UNDER THE WATER WHILE CONTINUING TO FLASH. WE COULD SEE THE LIGHT BLINKING JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. AT THAT POINT WE HEAD TO THE CAR. WE WATCHED THIS HAPPEN FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. WE DECIDED TO DRIVE TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE LAKE, WHERE WE COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHTS FLASHING, ONLY THIS TIME THERE WAS A THIRD LIGHT RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE OTHERS THAT FLASHED FROM BLUE TO WHITE TO GREEN.

When I was done watering my plants I leaned back on the trunk of my car to light a cigarette facing north, when I thought I saw a shooting star in the sky and did a double take.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen and was not any civilian or military plane at least not any that is publicly known.  It appeared to be one craft however I could not make out an outline of the object.  One very dim orb was leading the other dim orb except what made this so strange to me was that the orb in the rear was visibly offset  from the other, meaning it was not directly behind the first, almost diagonally behind and to the side of the first dim light.  It moved from east to west, then almost lost sight of it behind a big tree, but I ran excitedly to the other side and caught a clear view as it proceeded west until it faded off on the horizon line.  This object was extremely fast and did not make a sound. I ran inside after I lost sight of it, and grabbed my camera and walked westward for half an hour but was unable to see anything else.  It was very exciting, I am still very excited,  I live by a small airport and often film the airplanes, and growing up I lived by Forbes Field Air National Guard Base, one of the largest airstrips in the United States, and I would often see F-117&#39;s and B-2 Stealth fighters and bombers, even flying low and in formation in the day and at night, and though stealth&#39;s look very creepy at night and fly in triangular formations, I can identify them for what they are, and this was no military plane that I have ever seen.  Thank you very much for taking my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/8/09 09:48|Springfield|MO|Fireball|5 or 6 seconds|UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73082.html|303|ndxe200905| UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  &#34;MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.&#34;  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I&#39;m a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I&#39;m a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn&#39;t find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn&#39;t even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I&#39;m reporting this many months later (which I&#39;ll explain soon).  I&#39;m pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn&#39;t take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield&#39;s airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn&#39;t get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn&#39;t seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn&#39;t make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don&#39;t know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn&#39;t been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here is some background info on why I&#39;m posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist&#39;s renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn&#39;t get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn&#39;t move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I&#39;d like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can&#39;t remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That&#39;s when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it&#39;s near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn&#39;t a serious violation) and I said &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn&#39;t see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn&#39;t share this, then I wouldn&#39;t be helping anyone figure out what&#39;s going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what&#39;s going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I&#39;ve seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can&#39;t get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn&#39;t seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it&#39;s proven that aliens are real, then it&#39;s going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I&#39;m fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I&#39;ve got a huge project due in the morning and it&#39;s getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would estimate the object to be flying between 500 to 1000 feet above houses, at a speed of 60mph, and was a quarter of a mile ahead of me. I continued to follow it for 3 minutes until my sight of it was blocked by trees and then the object completely disappeared (possibly landing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed and saw the object starting from the intersection of Stony Point Road and Todd Road until the intersection of Stony Point Road and Dutton Ave. It was after that that I lost sight of the object.<n>

On Friday the 8th a retired Air Force vet told me of a sighting two 12-year olds who live in his apartment complex had the previous evening. He was able to set up a meeting with them the following Friday. The two witnesses, a boy and a girl, were in the parking lot of the complex at the time. The boy told me that he first noticed the disc to the west, towards the main entrance of the Beaver Creek resort,which is about three quarters of a mile away. The disc appeared dark and oval shaped with flashing white, red, and yellow lights at first. The disc darted quickly to the northeast, then slowed down and moved eastward down the Eagle River valley, passing to the north of the apartment complex. The boy pointed the disc out to the girl witness and they watched it as it fluttered down the valley before ascending into the clouds. At one time they saw an edge view of the craft which looked cigar shaped with the lights appearing along the upper edge. The sighting occurred as it was starting to get dark and there were broken clouds over the area. The witnesses said there was no sound coming from the disc. The kids immediately went and saw the Air Force vet, who is a neighbor of the boy, and told them what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kids are very creditable and I believe they saw a UFO. When I asked the boy how large the disc appeared in the sky, using his fingers at arms length, he held his fingers about two inches apart, indicating the UFO was quite low. Due to their age we did not do a report with MUFON. The AF vet said the complex has many hispanics, some of whom are illegal, and they are very closed mouth about things. We had two other sightings reported to me that same day along the I-70 corridor in Eagle County, one of which in Edwards was reported to MUFON CMS#16910. The other one occurred in Eagle CO about 21:30 and is reported at this site. I have gotten some local news coverage about the sightings out here in the hope of finding other witnesses to this sighting and the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Bob Fiske, of MUFON/Colorado, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

The first light disappeared leaving the second light. The second light divided making a third light. The second light disappeared leaving the third light which divided then disappeared leaving a fourth light which then disappeared. I was telling the other person on the phone what was happening while it was happening. I then drove through the mountains and continued to watch the skies to the east, south and north. I saw a white light that was flashing unlike a plane and moving from south toward the east. I was describing the flashing light to the other person on the phone when all of a sudden a falling star catch my eye streaking across the sky from the north to the east.  After it disappeared I tried to look for the white flashing light but could not find it. Shortly after that I saw groups of what looked like planes flying east.

We were doing a training mission through Seoul, and I was sitting right seat, behind the pilots. The time was 1901, about 20 minutes before official sunset, and the sky was hazy.  We were flying North-West over the Anyangcheon canal at about 1000 ft, doing 100 knots.  As we passed over the Ewha Women&#39;s University Medical Center, we flew right past the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be stationary, but very close to our flight level.  It was approximately 30 feet off to the right side and 20 feet below us, at its closest point. It was spinning very fast.  It looked disc-shaped,  with a diameter that was no more than 2 feet. It was silver and reflective on top, and black underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it for 5 seconds before my pilots initiated a left turn and it passed out of my view.  I informed my pilot-in-command of what I had seen and he said it was probably &#34;something caught in a thermal updraft&#34;.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that while flying.<n>

When I up loaded photo&#39;s to my computer I noticed the objects in question. I ask the person I took was with if she had noticed anything unusual in the sky at the time I had taking the photo&#39;s. Her reply was no. I asked her to look at the photo. She told me this has happened to her. Looking at the photo before and after the photo in question i looked to see if something had got on the lens to cause this. There is nothing I could find to explain this. I have emailed you three photo&#39;s the one of the objects in question and the photo on my digital camera before and after. You tell me?<n>

It was a pretty cloudy night, with not many visible celestial bodies to begin with.  We both sighted a couple satellites moving across the sky early on.  After about an hour of being out under the stars and clouds, I spotted a stationary light towards the east start to move, at a similar speed as satellites do in the night sky.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the speed of the &#34;satellite&#34; seemed to be varying.  I remember thinking, &#34;no way, if that&#39;s a UFO I am going to flip.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then completely turned and started moving 90 degrees in a different direction.  That&#39;s when I got giddy!  And it continued its erratic flight for a good four or five minutes, increasing and decreasing in speed, even stopping every so often for a couple seconds, zig-zagging around the same area in the sky, and changing directions quickly, too fast for a plane to be capable of doing by my estimates.  But eventually I lost sight of it in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time I&#39;ve ever seen anything like that! Such a cool experience.<n>

It started from my left and went to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a shooting star, but then I realized that it was waaaay too big to be a shooting star.  Another think I realized was that too low to be a shooting star.  It was so bright that I saw it shining IN the clouds.  It was very fast, but didn’t make a noise and didn’t fizzle out as a shooting star would.  It wemt all the way until it disappeared into the horizon and I couldn’t see it anymore.<n>

At first I thought it was a flare but there were no movement, sparks, smoke, sound or  vapor trail. It sat there motionless for a few seconds then a second one appeared in front of it.  The same color and size.  They were both motionless.  A few seconds later a third one appeared in front of them, all three were motionless, still no sparks, smoke, sound or vapor trail.  They sit motionless for a few seconds then started to slowly move toward the east, still no sound, sparks, smoke or vapor trail. At once all three vanished.  There were no visible signs that anything had been there. The lights were visible for maybe a minute.  I could not see any planes in the area.<n>

It glided through the air slowly and seemed to hang in the air for a while. It moved very strangely because it seemed to travel in a very straight line.  The air around the object seemed like it was vibrating or the object had a haze around it. It flew much higher than the buildings around it but not as high as a plane passing by.  It was hard to tell if it was close to me or far away so I could not tell the size of it.  The bottom of the object was hard to see, but it looked black and flat.<n>

The object had no depth like piece of paper or a thin sheet of metal but was not shinny. Visually, it seemed to be only one side of a larger 3-dimmentional object.

They stayed up there for our whole stretch down the highway (495) until we couldn&#39;t see the view anymore because of the trees on 195.

Woke me up and almost as soon as I heard it, the sound went away so I looked at my daughter and was pretty much like I don&#39;t really want to know what that was.  My fiance&#39; Jumped up out of bed and looked out the window, she was like if that&#39;s a helicopter it&#39;s got awfully weird lights, and awfully low.  She watched the object hoover silently over the neighborhood behind us for a good 20 seconds, no more that 100 ft off the ground.  She  Describes it pretty much like a blob with red, white, blue, yellow and oranges running the width of the object only illuminating itself and nothing else. No spot lights nothing.

It was about 60’ long as compared to the small plane that crossed under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to reach and bend down to lift up Captain’s seat and get camera, (5 sec.), on my pontoon boat, then I looked up to find it in the camera’s sights, and it had disappeared. Sky was clear, except for a few very high thin with several light lines of these high clouds, moving from the Southwest to Northeast. I kept looking for it for about 15 minutes no where’s to be seen. It had it’s mirrored, shiny, aluminum bright body, opposite the Sun, which was also about 80 degrees, up in sky. The plane came from a local personal airport on 11 Mile about one mile away, they landed after what it seemed as if they were going underneath the object, the plane was about 400-500&#39; up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have other 2 UFO sighting&#39;s here in Summer 2008, one silver &amp; round in clear daylight, along with 3 other witnesses on board another pontoon, and 2nd sighting in Summer 2008, was a large round red light approx. at 11:30 pm at night, with just a few light see-through clouds. The red light was larger then plane lights, and it stayed steady until just fadding away or disappearing. The red UFO was approx. 300-500&#39; up in air, about 15 degree up, and about 1/4 - 1/2 mile to N. Northeast of N.E. edge of Little Myers Lake, their were 2 children and 2 teenagers on pontoon boat fishing with me at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No images of these 3 sightings were taken.

I looked out of the window to see a large orange light like a fireball in the sky, moving at what appeared to be the speed of a plane, over my house from west to east. The light was 2 or 3 times the size that the largest planet appears to be when it is close to the earth ie much bigger than a star and completely the wrong colour. It is  difficult to estimate how high the object was, but it was possibly slightly over helicopter height, but there was absolutely no sound. I called my husband and together we watched the light move steadily across the sky. It appeared to get smaller and then possibly burn out. No other objects were seen in the sky, apart from a few stars, and neither of us have ever seen a light like that in the sky before. We are professionals in our 50s(a teacher and IT professional)and are not UFO watchers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We decided to take a hike in the woods.  We went about a mile out, and a aerodynamic ship flew across the sky.  It sort of looked like the star destroyers on star wars, but smaller, about 500 metres.  It was made of chrome, and quickly flew across the sky.  None of us had cameras, and we don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it.  It made a vibating noise, like a quiet car engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Fast Mover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling north on hwy 97 approximately 5-6 mile north of Madras, Oregon 4:30 AM.  In the distance I could see a blue flashing light in the road ahead.  It appeared to be about a half a mile (I guess) ahead of me and not moving.  The weather was high overcast and dry.  My first reaction was, it was a police car.  I began to slow down and as I approached, the light began to move away from me at a speed about double of my speed.  I was moving about 65 mph.  It was moving so fast I was trying to figure out how it could be a car.  The light still flashing at the same rate turned +/- 90 degrees and moved west into a very large irrigated field.  My guess it was 5 -10 feet off the ground and did not move up or down.  It looked to be about the size of a basketball.  Again it was dark and I did not have any references to compare it to.  It traveled out what appeared to be about a 1/8 - 1/4 mile and turned south now going the opposite direction I was moving.  I followed it visually the best I could.  After it passed my sideways field of view I began to watch it in my mirror.  It went past me a little further (hard to tell how far in the dark and I was still moving fairly fast).  It looked like it turned 90 degrees again and came back to the road.  The light looked as thought it came up behind me and I lost sight of it.  I did not see any residual light flashing around my vehicle.  Again it happened very fast (30 seconds +/-) and I was watching the road at the same time this was all going on.  I was driving a 2005 Ford pickup.  The exterior mirrors are large and it also has an interior mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/2/09 23:59|Hong Kong (China)||Other|15 min|Wierd halfmoon-like thing hovering above the apartment buildings. I wonder whether or not other people saw it.|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69906.html|337|ndxe200905| Wierd halfmoon-like thing hovering above the apartment buildings. I wonder whether or not other people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1 minute before midnight, I looked out the window of my bedroom in the 1st floor apartment I live in with my family, up at the sky in the direction of the apartment buildings about, I&#39;d say, a few hundred meters away. I wasn&#39;t looking for anything in particular, just wanting to enjoy the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glimpsed what I first thought to be a half-moon. It was about a semi-circle in shape, though with further inspection it seemed like one of the corners of the semi-circle was elongated. The color was kind of a really light orange, and I remember thinking, &#34;Hm... The moon looks rather golden...&#34;  The position of the object was just over the top of two of the buildings, positioned kind of in-between then but above. The apartment buildings were about 20 stories tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I thought I could see the object quivering, like when an image projected onto a wall by an over-head projector quivers when the projector is lightly touched; it was like it was hovering, or something. And the outlines of the object were also kind of blurry. Also, when I shifted perspective, the object also changed position in my sight like any object in normal distance, completely unlike a body at moon-distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was confused, but then it seemed like my subconscious had already come to the conclusion that it was not the moon, because then I realized that it was much too large to be the moon, and the color was off, anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I just tried to put it out of my mind, and returned to my own business. Then, at 0:14 of the 3rd of May, just 15 minutes after, I looked outside again, unable to resist my curiosity. To my absolute astonishment, the object had shifted, like the moon was setting, or something. Now, it was positioned at about the top floor of second-top floor of the apartment building; I don&#39;t remember clearly which. That was when I came to the conclusion that it was definitely not the moon or any ordinary celestial body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, it the edges of the object looked very blurry or scattered, like I was looking at it through tears, but the buildings did NOT look like that; only the object. I had mixed feelings at that point, kind of scared, kind of curious, and kind of uncertain, as well as wondering if there was anyone else seeing the same thing. I was working on my computer, and it briefly occurred to me to use my web-cam to shoot some footage; I have no idea why I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away again, again trying to put it out of mind. Then, a while later, I looked out the window again, trying to catch a glimpse of it. It was gone. It couldn&#39;t have been more than a few minutes since I had last looked. Now that its blurry light was gone, I could see that in between those two apartment buildings, there wasn&#39;t much of a gap at all that I could see from my vantage point; definitely not wide enough for me to see the entire Object. (I think the reason I didn&#39;t notice that when the object was still there was simply because my attention was riveted on the object.) But then that begged the question, &#34;How could the Object have remained visible to me when  it appeared to have lowered to the level of the top two floors?&#34; Unless it was in fact in FRONT of the buildings. That could only mean it was an UFO, right?  Hopefully, someone else also saw it and have photo/video evidence.<n>

I could not tell exactly what shape it was, because the sky was covered in clouds, but it was a definite green orb moving sporadically around the sky. I then noticed two more green lights moving with it, also sporadically. They moved very fast and turned sharply and quickly. There was no real pattern to their movements at first, but then they formed a large circle in the sky and seemed to move on a fixed rotation around the circle. At the exact same time they would change directions. They would alternate between this pattern of sporadic movement with each other and the circle. This lasted for about 30 minutes before one seemed to disappear suddenly, then another one a few minutes later, and the last one about 10 minutes after that. The only other person who I know saw this is my sister, who I woke up after watching the green lights in the sky for 10 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before in my life (the only time I&#39;ve ever seen anything like it was on a show discussing UFOs, and there were videos that people submitted that resembled what I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was headin N-NE. Since it moved so fast i said look at that, everyon looked and found the object, we chatted bout satellites for a few seconds, when the whole thing flared up. It was so bright that it looked like it grew bout ten sizes larger for 3-5 seconds, then it went back to the normal tone. It never varied its heading this whole time. We could see it for prolly another three to four minutes before it covered the other half of our horizon an went outve view. As you could expect everyone was excited an watching the sky. Prolly 5 minutes later someone pointed out two more objects flyin close together from the east. We watched one object turn from headin NW (mostly west) along with the other an switch to N-NE. It seemed to follow the first object we seen, there direction mostly N by a lil NE. They both followed the restve of there headings true  till they crossed the horizons an disapeared. One that switched seemed to increase speed an dissapeared a few minutes faster then the one headed NW. Both outve site in round 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But as it came nearer it was just like a ball of orange-ish light with a haze of light around it. There was no sound at all and it travelled in a straight line anywhere between 2000 and 4000 feet above us. As it travelled over us the light then disappeared but one witness saw just a silhouette of the sphere.  Two other witnesses had said that they had seen similar the night before, but 4 or 5 of the lights. One witness estimated that it travelled about 120 kts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I grab my binocular, its look like 3 small orange ball or maybe it had 3 light with the naked eye you could only 1 orange, and it had like black top or black dome.  Then as my girlfriend was saying she couldn’t see it anymore in the binocular I was seeing like turning grey or something then I look with the naked eyes and I couldn’t see it then I look back in the binocular and it was gone, seem it disappear in the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object was translucent with a haze around the edges. At first I thought it was a large piece of plastic floating in the air, but it maintained its shape and course.  The object floated up and down changing altitude about 100-200 feet each way.  The object started in the area of the Mormon Temple and disappeared for several seconds in low rain cloud before emerging and continuing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object around the vicinity of the Bay Bridge.  Approximate altitude was 1000 feet based on the height of the East Bay Hill in the background.  It appeared to maintain its heading throughout the sighting.

The object was shaped very much like a stealth bomber but it was going very slow across the sky from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I watched the object slowly cross the sky and then gradually disappear into the clouds.<n>

I was facing him (facing North) and he was facing South. He called my attention to something that flashed in the sky. I turned around and didn&#39;t see anything at first but kept watching because my husband told me to just wait that it was flashing at intervals (roughly one minute). I kept watching where he told me to look (we used two stars in the sky to locate it) and I caught the flash. It wasn&#39;t something &#34;twinkling&#34;, it wasn&#39;t going off quickly enough to be considered a blink, it was just like a pinpoint flash. It didn&#39;t illuminate the sky around it. I know it sounds idiotic (and I&#39;m not saying this is what is was) but the best way I could describe it is if someone was setting off a flash bulb really, really high in the sky. I kept standing there and watching in the exact same location and in about a minute it flashed again in the exact same spot. Sure enough within another minute it flashed again, in the exact same spot. It didn&#39;t move a single inch because as I said, we were using two stars to guide off of with the location. The last and final flash was to the left of the stars and then we didn&#39;t see it again. It flashed very brilliantly each time we saw it, the last flash that was off to the east of the spot it was initially holding position in was just as intense as the others. It was just a very bright white flash. The light didn&#39;t reach the ground or anything it just looked like a star flashing really intensely at one minute intervals from really far up in the sky. The final flash we saw, as I stated before, was not in the position it initially was and after that we didn&#39;t see it anymore although we were both keeping our eyes on the area we saw the flashes in. The final flash was far enough from the first ones that it couldn&#39;t have been a &#34;star&#34; moving. If it would have stayed lit up, the distance it was with the last flash, you could have definitely detected noticeable movemenet. But since it didn&#39;t stay lit, an! d we did n&#39;t see it move, we just saw that it HAD moved pretty far from its first location. There were no clouds, it was clear and we had a half moon that wasn&#39;t visible because it was low on the horizon. We didn&#39;t see or hear any planes or helicopters and the flash seemed to be coming from so high up a plane or helicopter wouldn&#39;t be at that altitude anyway. It looked like a star (as bright as Venus) would light up for a split second then go back out only to light up again about a minute later. I know my report was redundant as far as the descriptions, but I want to make sure what we saw is understood as a single light and not an affective &#34;flash&#34; although that is what we would call it. I also want to make it clear that it moved far enough from its original location that there is no way it could have possibly been a planet or star. The location of both areas were in the same field of vision range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a flare or a very big shooting star.  However, during the time I watched, it moved across the lake at even speed, slower than what normal planes look like, which I have viewed many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some clouds, light whispy, but the circlular red light could be viewed even when clouds were in the way.  About 20 seconds of watching brought the light about 70 degrees above me where it stopped.  Up to this point, I was expecting to hear a sound, plane or helicopter and to see running lights when it got closer, but neither happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped for about 10 seconds maybe more when I heard some people on the street and tried to alert them to what I was seeing.  However, and this sounds made up I know, the light then moved slowly to my left and got behind thicker clouds.  The reddish light could still be seen from time to time over the next 10 seconds or so as I tried to guide them in to what i saw but by then, even if they did see it, it would not have made much sense to them as you could not really define it or see the movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its hard to say if it was getting higher, but through the clouds when I did see it, the size appeared to have diminished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only logical thing I can think of is that it was some sort of flare on a parachutte. However, if it was that then it was above clouds, so at least 1000 feet in the air, it moved in a straight line for 20 to 30 seconds I watched it, stopped dead in its tracks for 10 seconds at least and then moved to my left.  While I could see the light, it did not vary, didnt get bigger or smaller or flicker.<n>

I was leaving work late one night with my girlfriend (at the time) and another friend—we worked in a performance theater, and had finished a show. It was around ten at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were preparing to get into the car, I happened to be facing the North-Western sky. My girlfriend also had a general view of that sector, but the other friend was distracted and looking elsewhere.  The sighting lasted no more than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very suddenly, I see a light zoom over us in a north-westerly heading (I couldn’t discern any sense of a body—just a light as if from an afterburner).  I judged its distance from its trajectory:  it wasn’t travelling “across the sky” but very perceptibly forward. Also, the size of the light subtended the same amount of area as, say, a golf ball held at arm’s length (as it passed overhead).  These observations together led me to believe that it was relatively close to the ground-at least within 500 - 1000 feet.  That’s just the sense that I have, judging by how it moved across my field of view.  I didn’t feel like it was very far above us (not as far as a helicopter would be, for example).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its speed seemed notable:  it appeared and disappeared within less than a second, which, given I had a clear line of sight for quite a distance, is remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light (or afterburner) was also notable: I remember it being not orange but a pale blue/green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the most notable aspect of this sighting was the sound—or lack of it.  As it passed over us, I heard no sound.  Not an engine, not even the sound of a body moving quickly through the air.  Even a commercial airliner can be heard from the ground at some heights. Judging how close this seemed from its trajectory, I was so surprised that there was nothing. The night was as silent as before it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the quick moment, I exclaimed to my friends. As hinted earlier, my girlfriend had also seen “something”, though my other friend had not been looking at the sky (and without a sound, there was no reason to look up).  My girlfriend didn’t know what to think of what she had seen—she would only ever say that, sure, she had seen something—I think she was less willing to attribute the sighting to anything and more comfortable with shrugging her shoulders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I was surely confident that it was something extraordinary.  It may well have been just an advanced aircraft tested by the military, but it was certainly something you wouldn’t reckon you’d ever see.<n>

We live in a rural part of town with a few farms, and several neighborhoods. It is very peaceful and everyone practically knows each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a recount of what I saw that night.  I was driving my SUV, my sister was in the passenger seat, and our girlfriend was in the back seat behind the passenger.  As I made a left hand turn onto my girlfriend’s street, my girlfriend and I noticed bright, white lights just above the treetops about 300 yards away.  My friend and I saw what looked like to be a “horizontal shaped Ferris-wheel” type object in bright, white lights (several lights spaced apart but looked to be connected vertically) hovering just over the treetops at the end of an open field.  The object was not moving. The lights were spaced in two’s – one on top, one on the bottom, perfectly aligned, perfectly distanced from one another – they were several of them. The circular object was huge!  We were speechless.  When I finally had to put my eyes back onto the road, the two of us were hysterical.  We asked my sister what she thought about it, but she was looking straight ahead at the road.  She never saw th! e lights.  At first, we thought someone was having a party and had rented circus-type rides.  However, why would the rides be above the treetops?  We decided I should keep driving while we tried to locate the lights in the sky so my sister could see them.  I ended up driving a three-mile loop, but they were gone.  From the time she and I saw the lights to driving the three-mile loop, about 5 minutes had passed.  There was absolutely no sighting of anything in the sky, nor no sighting of any parties in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we dropped off our girlfriend, we told her father about what we saw.  I wanted to call the police department.  He told us we were crazy!  He asked us what we ate for dinner.  My girlfriend and I ate the chicken fingers with fries and he told us something was in the food.  I still cannot get that vision out of my mind.  I drive past that area all time, as it is about two miles from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 44 years old and working at the family business.  My girlfriend was 38 years old and owned a hair salon.  My sister, also 38 years old, works at the family business.  Whenever we get together, we reminisce about that night and what we saw.  We both believe it was something extraterrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn’t the first time I noticed odd things in the sky.  I know it won’t be my last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have emailed three photos of this UFO event to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading South on Hwy 550 from Bloomfield, NM and was about 50 to 60 miles North of Albuquerque.  The pictures were taken with a Canon Digital Camcorder  Model NTSC ZR200.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw two bright lights in the sky to my left, about 10:00 or 11:00 in the sky, I pulled my car over and got my camera. Two other vehicles pulled over behind me and appeared to be watching this, also. The light balls were not moving much at this point.  I was so excited, I forgot to put my camera on movie mode so all I have are the still photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two light beams came down from the sky at an angle from the two light balls to my left. The light beams changed their angle a few times as the light balls moved a little.  Then, suddenly the two light balls formed into one larger light ball.  The two light beams coming to earth formed into three beams, then instantly, there was only one light beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light ball came to Earth VERY FAST at an angle following the one remaining light beam.  Then the light ball got much brighter, like it was on fire and it was leaving a &#34;fire trail&#34; behind it, not a long one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer to Earth, it looked like an explosion took place.  I snapped a picture of this &#34;explosion&#34; then it took off for the sky again.  It was traveling very fast.  It went up and over the hill to the right in the photo then went straight up in the sky at a rapid rate of speed.  It disappeared in a matter of a few seconds very high in the sky.  There was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dropped my camera after taking the picture of the &#34;explosion&#34; and took off in my car.  I looked for signs of fire on the ground to the right of the highway where it might have been close to the ground and saw nothing. It appeared to me that the &#34;explosion&#34; may have happened about 1/2 mile ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father was a Navy jet pilot (career Navy) so I was raised around all kinds of aircraft.  This was not a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft.  I am a bookkeeper and office manager for an accounting firm.<n>

I continued driving while my eyes were glued to this object. I noticed the object was not moving at all. This was when I realized that this object was NOT a helicopter. I became startled, turned down the radio, and forcefully tapped my friend on the shoulder to get his attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His first words were &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  Unlike me, he instantly came to the conclusion that this object was not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still driving when I noticed the break in the trees was beginning to close. I pulled over on to country club road and parked my car. Because we were playing an &#34;assassin&#34; game, I had binoculars in my car. We then ran out onto the golf course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still hovering in place approximately 1-1 1/2 miles away. I put the binoculars up to my eyes and gazed at this disc-shaped object. It was a UFO. The typical UFO every person imagines in their head. As I was staring at it, it moved slowly to the right behind another set of trees upon a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I ran back to the car and drove into the cemetery where the patch of trees were. When we got to the top of the hill, into a total clearing above the city and everything in the area, it was gone. Completely gone, out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this hoping that somebody else in the Monongahela area will see this and confirm that they saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They appear to be lights at quite a distance.  I have described them as looking like a &#34;ferris wheel&#34; in the sky.  Many different colors. They make no sound and move at incredible speeds when they move.  They also sit in the same area for quite a long time.  I have many, many pictures that I would like to submit.  They stay visible for anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour sometimes.  We saw 2 on May 1, 2009.  They were together, usually we might see one in one particular area and another in another area of the sky.  These were together through the entire sighting.  They stayed visible for approximately 30 minutes or more then it was like they just turn their lights off and we didn&#39;t see them again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, and the objects of interest are simply small smears of light.  We allow for the possibility that the witness has photographed stars, or other celestial bodies, using a camera that was handheld.  PD))<n>

It slowly hovered across the highway coming down, there were no windows, tires, motors or anything on the object. It floated to the other side of the highway and there was a strangely lit object where it just turned still hovering at the same speed moving so smoothly then i lost sight of it as i drove by. It appeared to be landing, made no sound, and no other objects or people were in its landing area. had to be 7 feet high. very bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
