I was 8 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was watching me as I starred out my bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As It got closer I could feel them watching me, like they were probing my thoughts with a  great probing force.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I  moved under the covers of my bed and became frozen unable to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad . Telegraphically they told me that he couldn&#39;t hear me, I believe everyone on my block was put to sleep. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down and afraid to let them think that I could see them.  I was scared and pretended not to see them.  There was one alien that wanted to communicate , maybe the navigator,  The two others were standing in back of him, watching and did not try to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship.  I remembered the docking port. How we docked and getting on board.  The ship was larger inside that it appeared outside.  I had  physical tests with samples taken.  I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship. I remember how big the ship was inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told  me when the tests began and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think they populate other worlds with what they take, and  use you later on for reproducing a hybrid, from the two realistic dream/experiences, because I saw one recognizable abductee on TV., she was complaining about her experience of being used.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw gray figures with no facial features separating and cloning DNA into multiple vials.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from Orleans to Tampa.  They showed me a  ray gun that used static electricity.  The end of it had a shape similar to  a  filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  I think if it misses your forehead it will make a light bulb break.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All that happened when I was 8 years old in 1952 just before the UFOs flew over President Trumans Capital.

They collected a fluid sample, and all my lymph nodes felt like they were scintillated in my abdominal area.  I wished I could feel that again, but never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from New Orleans, Tampa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They gave me a dislike for nuclear weapon testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen mother ship docking; the ship was larger inside than it seemed outside. I have seen hand held ray guns that erase memory using a static electric beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attending elementary school I drew pictures of the same UFO and Ray gun many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were nice to me. In later years they answered every question for me and showed me what I did  not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m so old is why Im telling. There is a lot more but who cares, this is enogh for free thinkers. This is my record.<n>

As I was saying my prayers with my eyes closed, lying in bed I felt like someone was watching me outside of my bedroom window.  I opened my eyes and saw a light staring down at me from up in the air like a helicopter about 300 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like my thoughts were being probed.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I hid under the covers on my bed and then I became like I was frozen stiff and unable to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad. Telepathically they told me that he couldn&#39;t hear me.  I think everyone on my block was like under ether or something.  I don’t remember going up into the saucer. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out, night or day. I could draw great pictures of UFO’s in school.  My parents blew off my story after I said , “I saw a saucer last night”.  My mom said on the way to the kitchen, “Gee I thought I locked the door last night”, it was open in the morning.  I can remember all conversation and think precisely when I get an adrenalin rush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down in the middle of the ship with the dome window behind them and I was afraid to let them think that I could see them as they stared at me.  I pretended not being able to see them. There was one alien that wanted to Communicate, maybe the navigator, the other two were standing in back of him, and they just watched and never tried to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship. I remembered the docking port.  How we docked and the dome part of the saucer had a bottom rim that fit into the docking port and became attached to the ship, and as I was going aboard getting on board I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship had lifted up.  I remember how big the ship was inside because it appeared small and was large inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me when the tests started and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the things that happened above I could not remember at first but was reminded by other things as I lived my rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one recognizable abductee that was very familiar on TV years later and she was complaining about her experience of being used during the abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from New Orleans to Tampa.  I remember the color of light aboard the ship as the sun was coming up, They showed me a ray gun.  The end of it had a shape similar to a filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  Because of their telepathy they can feel things that their body never feels through your experiences.  Maybe they try to get some of our features to benefit themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on their ship more than once, because of my scoop marks. I even saw a hooded figure that scarred me standing next to a cement slab.  They told me how many kids I would have. I saw a projection of my wife years before I got married.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe aliens look a little oriental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They will step in to our world if they think we are going to destroy our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is like controlling the bad fish in a fish bowl from breaking the fish bowl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All that happened when I was 8 years old in the UFO flap of 1952.  The UFOs flew over President Truman’s White House and were as were seen flying up the east coast as reported by Eastern Airlines pilots, on route to the north from Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my parents moved houses in Miami they moved in back of Norman Beans house, a MUFON original board member.  Coincidence or not, you be the judge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I get reminded of more I will add more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Was btweem Enumclaw and Auburn going to a movie in a NE direction.  It was dark that night with no traffic or background lights.  I saw out of the passenger side a very very large oval object covering most of the sky.  It had colors of the spectrum shimmering around its body and a row of portholes in the center.  There was a reddish fire coming from its tail.  I signalled my husband to stop the car and he also saw it.  It was moving very slowly.  Then it took off extremely fast towards the NE and disappeared over the horizon.  Afterward we discussed reporting this but decided not to since the government was denyig everything at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I felt like it was watching me.  I could not move.  I was scarred stiff.  I told my parents about it in the morning; they said I saw the street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember I had scoop marks all over my arms that itched.  My parents told me it was from mosquitoes and gave me some sulpher soap to wash with.  (In 1975 some one called in to a local TV show and reported seeing the same light in the same neighborhood in 1952.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1958 I went camping at Crystal Springs, Florida, and awakened the next morning with scoop marks allover my right elbows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1959 I awakened on morning and had the same marks on my inner thigh.<n>

I went to the expermental hanger at Barksdale, and asked the guard if I could have a look insids,  He sid &#34;NO&#34;  then I told him what I saw, he said he had seen the same thing, at which time he opened the man door and said &#34; have a look, we have some goofey looking stuff, but nothing like that.&#34;               AFBB<n>

Sometime in the summer of 1952 or 1953 my family was in a two car caravan going from Texas to California.   At the time, it was fashionable to have a spotlight like police cars on your car.  The lead car was my mom and dad.  The second car was my dad’s childhood friend to whom I refer to as my uncle, but he is just a family friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother said they were traveling at night, the time was about 3 am. This sighting occurred between midnight and 3 am. She kept waking up and noticed a bright reddish orange light at a distance. It seemed to be tracking the cars. The road was a two lane road somewhere between Pecos, Texas and Carlsbad, NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She finally woke up at 3 am and told my dad that that light has stayed right along with them for at least two hours and many miles. She said no way it could be a water tower beacon after so much time had elapsed. He would speed up, it would speed up. He would slow down, it would seemingly slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, they stopped in the middle of the dark desolate road. My uncle in the car behind stopped and they all stood in the middle of the road wondering what in the heck the thing could be. So, my uncle set his spotlight on the object, and it took off and away from them at breakneck speed. They were all horrified and amazed, but continued their trip to California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they arrived at Long Beach, California, my mother said she bought a newspaper and read an article that the day before something flew over several sunbathers on the back that same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad never wanted to discuss it. Years later, I asked my uncle about it and he said it was indeed a true experience and it happened the way my mother told me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My father told me about an incident which occurred while he was a Sargent in the Air Force.  At the time he was the driver for a Colonel at the base in Cheyenne.  My dad always told me to take this story with a grain of salt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day the Colonel (whom my dad never named) came back to the vehicle &#39;roaring drunk&#39;.  He then told my dad a story he never knew whether to believe or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colonel had gone to a UFO crash site.  Apparently he said that radar had tracked &#39;something&#39; that had come from the vicinity of Venus.  When it hit the atmosphere, it did so at speed.  There was a hole in the craft about six inches in diameter, and the insides were burned by reentry heat.  Speculation was that it had been hit by a meteoroid sometime during the trip.  Three bodies were found, charred beyond recognition.  Pieces of the craft were everywhere, including a metal sphere with a peculiar characteristic.  When spun, even by hand, it became extremely difficult to move it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad couldn&#39;t tell me if that meant move as in gyroscopic motion or an inability to take it from place to place while in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me the story because of my interest in antigravity, so if there were other details, I was never told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was 9 years old at the time. My parents were visiting my aunt and uncle and playing cards inside the house. They lived in a little four corners community about 20 miles northwest of Lansing, Michigan. It’s too small to be listed on maps or have its own zipcode  I was out in the back yard laying on my back looking at the stars, trying to make them into pictures. As for the exact time, it was dark so was some time after 9:00 pm and before 11:00 pm, which was when we left to drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the stars, one of them moved. It quickly went from one place in the sky to another and then stopped. The route it traveled was like a large U. There were no flames, no noise, no brightening or dimming of its light, no blinking. It just moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely not a plane, helicopter or other type of aircraft. Even at 9 years old, I was very familiar with and had ridden in most types of aircraft, I spent many Saturday afternoons at the airport just watching and bugging the private pilots for a ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars and it was definitely not one of those. It was definitely not a meteor, they do not make U turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement only took one or two seconds. The object had not moved before then and did not move a second time. It looked like just a star that moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember, this is 1952. There were no satellites, space vehicles, space stations or space junk for years after I saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I could not bring myself to tell my parents that night and have never mentioned it since that night. I have not seen any other unidentified flying objects since then, although I know several people who have and I have no reason to doubt them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought that I should put this on the record before it&#39;s too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the interesting report!

I was 12 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lying there on my back with my eyes looking up over the beautiful sky above I noticed these 7 circular lights about the size of basketballs and yellow/slight orange in color very similar to an orange moon.  They were absolutely motionless and in formation.  The first group of 3 in a V formation and a bit away was a second group of 4 lights in a V formation with the fourth light on the right wing of the V formation.  I was able to watch these lights for the better part of 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as if on a count, all 7 balls of light sped off in 7 different directions leaving a lighted contrail that lasted maybe another 5 seconds - all 7 lights disappeared - they were gone.  If I had to guess at the altitude I would think 30,000 to 40,000 feet  Wish I had pictures<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can swear I was not delusional, drunk or having any other stress.

(not exactly sure of time, I wasn&#39;t there).  He told me this in 1962, I was 11 or 12 at that time so my brother was 4 or 5 yrs at the time of the sighting, since he is 2 1/2 yrs older than me. He does not remember this. Maybe this is more interesting.  That same yr 1962 around the last week in Aug.  I was walking home from town, I have walked this road a million times so I know exactly how long it takes under many different circumstances.  The point is...between 2 foot steps and 2 flashes of light...I lost 2:20 minutes of time.  I am willing to give up the 20 minutes as just misplaced, however not the 2 hours.  I went absolutly nutz for two days tring to figure out how and where I lost 2 hours, to the point of my head really hurting me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I felt (somehow) that if I stoped thinking about it, the pain would stop, and it did.  It was years before I could recall this without pain.  Between the 2 foot steps, I nearly stumbled and caught myself from falling at that point a drop of blood fell on my right hand, I reached to my forhead and felt a small indentation (I&#39;ve often wondered about an implant). AND one night while watching TV, a very high pitched sound filled the room and the 1/4 inch plate glass over the picture tube...shattered, I was then that I realised/wondered if it came from me as I felt a strange sensation over my right eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK well thats a mouthfull for now.

N. of, State Road 13)|IN|Disk|18-20 sec.|3 saucer-shaped objects flying fast (with wobbling motion) from N. to S. at a medium-high altitude--no sound, no trails, only silence.|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32866.html|17|ndxe195206| 3 saucer-shaped objects flying fast (with wobbling motion) from N. to S. at a medium-high altitude--no sound, no trails, only silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning is bright, sunny; the blue sky cloudless. One object is seen, then two others, further distant. Since I am facing west, they are initially spotted to my right (north) at about 140 degrees, and watched as they disappear to the left (south)at approximately 30 degrees. The elevation is some 35 degrees above the horizon. Requiring about 18 to 20 seconds to traverse the 110 degrees or so viewing field between the angles, and at an estimated altitude of at least 15,000 to 20,000 feet, their speed is great. There is no sound, no trails, no maneuvers--just straight, swift, purposeful flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects are round and flat (saucer shaped) and wobble as they fly--an action similar to that of a thrown tin-can lid. This wobbling behavior enables me to notice that the upper surface is a bright, whitish silver-blue--a color quite like that of burning magnesium--while the underside is dark gray or almost black. The closest craft looks to be about the size of a full moon, when seen directly overhead--the other two, being at a greater distance, appear much smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  The witness is well known to us, and we consider him to be an exceptionally credible source.  PD))<n>
6/10/52 12:00|Chicago (south suburb)|IL|Circle|10 minutes|My sighting of two objects in Chicago, IL as a pre-teen in the early 50's|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49634.html|18|ndxe195206| My sighting of two objects in Chicago, IL as a pre-teen in the early 50&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened when I was a young boy, just pre-teen when I&#39;d guess I was about 12.  I&#39;m now 65 and want to leave this report before I can&#39;t.  This would put the event in the very early 50&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in a south suburb of Chicago (on a small farm), about 20 miles SSW of downtown.  The township was Calumet Park, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One afternoon I was standing in the yard looking due North.  Suddenly coming out of the west there was a very high, extremely fast round object moving west to east.  The speed was unlike anything I had ever seen.  Many times that of the fastest plane.  From the ground the view angle was probably about 60 degrees.  From my distance it appeared to be about three or so times the size of a pin head held at arm&#39;s length.  When it was due north of my location it suddenly came to a stop, motionless.  It remained that way for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another identical object came from the East at the same blazing speed.  It came to a stop right by the other one.  Now there were two of the round objects together.  They hovered for a few minutes.  Then they went straight up, got smaller and smaller until I couldn&#39;t see them any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, no vapor or contrails.  The day was bright and clear, not a cloud in the sky.  No wind.  Just a perfect summer day.  I remember the temperature being plesant too, which would normally mean early summer or late,late spring.  In the above part of the form I&#39;m only guessing month-day-year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Childhood abduction and mental and visual encounters through out life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 8yrs old I went for a walk in the woods in the mountains in Colorado.  There I had an encounter.  I disappeared for hours. When I returned home, I remembered some of it but not all.  When I tried to talk about it my parents just said I had an imagination.  In 1985 I went to a hypnotist, and had him take me back.  All my life everything kept coming back in dreams and thoughts.  By 1985 I was in tears most of the time. I couldn&#39;t get them out of my mind.  Also throughout my life I had other sightings, tetepathic messages sending me places, and some times others with me and saw what I saw. After my sessions with the hypnotist, I remembered.  And knew I wasn&#39;t crazy.  I remember standing under the ship, it cast a circular shadow, and I could see the sun shining on the ground around it and in the trees. I don&#39;t exactly remember entering the ship, but I remember being on a moveable table or something.  There was a small being walking besides me.  He didn&#39;t scare me, actually I felt safe as long as he was there.  I remember going down a corridor oddly shaped, with light that seemed to come from the walls.  I remember going past an area that looked like somekind of control area. It was all high tech, smooth, and hard to describe.  I drew pictures of everything I could remember, including the panel boards of sorts.  The small being with the very large eyes was still with me.  Then I remember passing an area with floating spheres and another type of a being.  Very tall, bald, large head,large eyes, but not as large as the small being.  I called them the Elders, they seemed so intellegent, and aware.  Then before I entered another area I saw another being, whom I will never forget.  He was humanoid, and very impressive.  I felt very safe.  When I entered the area, there was a baby, maybe about one.  It was sitting on a table, then a large transparent amber colored round flat object dropped down in front of it.  The baby was startled, but calmed down when it stopped in front of it.  It ha! d two arms on the side of it that controled its decsent, and was secured from above.  It had areas in it that were indented, I drew a picture, it is easier to see than to explain.  Then they stopped me next to a girl that was laying on a table.  She had a clear thing kinda domed over her head.  She just laid there. I can&#39;t remember too much until awhile later when I was placed in an area with others.  The area was darker than the areas I&#39;d been in, and the ceiling had lights on it.  The whole ceilins and lights rotated and in the middle the lights were pulsing.  after being in there, I couldn&#39;t remember much.  It is as if they tried to erase my memory.  They did a lot of it, but somehow, I was able to remember some, and sub-conciously I retained a lot of memory.  I tried to tell people, and my parents, but no one would take me seriously.  T%hey just thought I had a big imagination.Anf throughout my life I kept encountering them.  Sometimes I&#39;d see the ships by myself, and at other times there would be other people with me, so I knew it wasn&#39;t my imagination.  Now that I am grown and have kids of my own I am scared.  I have 6 children, and one night 5 of them were with a babysitter, in Gonzales, Lousiana.  I went out to eat with a friend.  While eating I got this real uneasy feeling, and told my friend I had to get home right away.  We doggie bagged our dinner and left. When I got home the babbysitter was screaming, the kids were all talking and excited. After calming everyone down,I asked the sitter what happenen.  She said that my daughter A had come in to say that there were lights in the sky outside.  So everyone went out to see.  When the lookede the lights were gone, then they saw it.  An object of sorts hoovering about 25 feet above the house.  Silent, no sound, and strangely no lights. Just a dark object, that you could see the shape.  My daughter R. ran into my shop and hid under my tee-shirts on the rack.  The babysitter said she tried to get the rest of the kids back into the house.  She said s! he got them in for a moment but they ran out again.  They said I came home just as the object left.  She was my friend, but didn&#39;t come back to my house for a year.  It really scared her. And made believers of my children.  I don&#39;t know what I would have done had I been home at that time.  Why did they come?  What do they want?  And why when I see them, do I feel some kind of a connection with them?  They are strange, yet not strange, alien yet not alien.  I don&#39;t know what they did to me when I was younger, nor do I understand how they can get into my head.  I mean, one time they told me to go to Giant Rock Airport in the desert of California.  I heard them in my head all day.  My husband told me to just go. I ended up with 4 other people and we went to the desert.  There all five of us watched a ship in the sky, moving all over the place.  Now I had witnesses, I was not alone.  Then once I disappeared for hours.  I was only going to the store.  I had taken my (black) kitten with me. when I got  home, I told everyone that I had seen a ship, but I didn&#39;t know I had been gone very long.  But it had turned my black kitten into a black and white kitten.  There were white hairs all over it.  And I don&#39;t remember anything except seeing the ship.  Yet it had been hours, and to me only moments.  And the kitten was my proof.  Everyone at the house saw it.  That was a good calling card.  Now, I don&#39;t know what the future has in store for me and the children who now are adults, and know that something else is going on, that none of us understand.  Maybe someday we will find out why, if they ever return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

From east side of ferry boat spotted string of brilliant red balls that apeared to be diving into the sea far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first inpression was that a plane had fired a string of red rockets, but the things didn&#39;t trail smoke, didn&#39;t explode or fade out.  My impression now, almost fifty years later was that another such string followed the first.  There were no aircraft in sight in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rather simple observation it seems, but I came across letters to home describing the unique event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a sailor and stationed on a ship, I was not at all aware that this sighting coincided with the great defense alert along the coast, especially around Washington that night until I read in the Book of Lists of the report by an airliner coming in from over the Atantic that red lights approached him at &#34;thousands of miles per hour&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If those strings of lights were the ones I saw at that same time and date, what I saw were not diving into the sea, but passing over the very distant horizon.<n>

It was a bright sunny day with just a few low clouds.The object appeared to be coming lower about the size of a full moon, i could hear no sound coming from the object, unlike an aircraft. Asit came lower it enetered a cloud, i stood for ages it seemed, but i did not see this object reemerge from the cloud. I reported this to someone who was connected with the Royal Air Force, they contacted the ministry of defence in london, who sent a form, with this officers help i filled in this form, and it was returned to london. To this present day I have heard nothing more on my sighting. but i still remember this incident as if it were yesterday.  Some years later in the 1111970&gt;s near here a forrester had a contact encounter with a flying object, which was reported wideli in the Edinburgh Press.<n>

I had an astounding memory, so I know this wasn’t made up or imagined.  I was spending the summer at my aunt and uncle’s summer house on Pretty Lake in Dousman, WI.  The property bordered the lagoon portion of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing in the sand at the front of the house which was parallel to the lagoon.  At some point, I got up and walked to the side of the house that was facing away from the lake.  I saw about 5 or 6 &#34;things&#34; standing on top of each other trying to reach the bathroom window.  The window was just a small opening that opened outwards and opened from the top, not the bottom.  I was shocked that these &#34;silver monkeys&#34; were trying to get into the house.  I started running to go into the house and tell my aunt, and then everything went blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that I never did tell her about the silver monkeys because in the evening, she was giving me a bath and I asked her to close the window because I did not want the silver monkeys to come in.  She said there were no silver monkeys.  That night I wet the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had several more unusual experiences that summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
