The location was East of Marysville above or slightly east of the  Quilceda Golf Course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear sky that night and one could see in the background Mt. Pilchuck and then the old Ski Slope lights in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This disk shaped craft displaying bright yellowish / white portals (rectangular shape) windows. These windows were quite visable of the 180 degree  facia of the upper portion of the craft. What made this craft unusual was extending from each side of the  diameter of the craft were circurlar tubes. At the end of these tubes or conduits were as it appeared  round balls.  Much like a vertical lolly pop stick infused into the candy ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft appeared to my brother and I as if it were a transport or research craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> from these round balls extended from the craft one could quite clearly see colored red,green,white colored objects flowing to the ground. These objects were round in dimension. From the bottom of the craft flowing to the ground were streams of gaseoues like colors, green.red,blue.  This activity lasted for about one hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time of activity this craft made vertical and horizontal movements from slow to very raid speeds.  After the  decending colored objects from the balls stopped, the lighting from the portals became much brighter for about 15 minutes from what I belive was the cabin lights of this craft. Shortly after the powering up of the light intensity This craft went from a very staionary position a rapid speed I have nver seen in my life out over Mt. Pilchuck beyond the cascade Mountian range in about two seconds or less acending into the Stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much to my amazement, the following day at High School I gave a report of this incident to my Home Class. The Teachers thought I had been drinking hard Cider, but there were over thirty five students whom came to me during the day and attested as seeing this same object and activity. Several were in my Home Class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate that the date of the sighting is approximate, although that may be the case, we assume.  PD))<n>

It was around eight thirty or nine o clock when I happened to look out my bedroom window when I noticed a bright light that sat over the lake for a long time, maybe ten minutes or so and then it moved towards our house but in a north westerly direction.

I told my mother about it and she said it probably was an airplane, but back in those days, airplanes didn’t hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/1/59 19:00|Jacksonville|IL|Unknown|1 minute|Late 1959, bright lights from a hovering object of unknown shape making a zed-zid zed-zid electrical sound.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42619.html|6|ndxe195910| Late 1959, bright lights from a hovering object of unknown shape making a zed-zid zed-zid electrical sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wanted to recount this as it is one of those unexplained things from childhood that I&#39;ve never forgotten. I was 5 years old and we were moving bit by bit into our new house. I was &#34;helping&#34; my mom take things out to the car. She was going to take me with her to the new house that evening and I was excited about getting to play in all the new rooms. I remember going out the back door with something in my hand that I was going to take to the car. Mom was still inside the house. There was a very, very bright light. I looked up and there, hovering above the house, was this huge object that just seemed to be made up of very white, bright lights. I have no idea what shape it was and could not see anything but the lights. It was silent except for a strange electrical sound -- zed-zid, zed-zid -- and started to slowly move away from the house. I remember screaming and running inside, terrified and crying. I don&#39;t know how articulate I was in trying to get my mother to look outside and see if it was gone. She didn&#39;t see anything and couldn&#39;t understand why I was so upset. I refused to go outside again that night and lost all interest in going to the new house to play.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was silent. Some 20 feet os so over was a second identical object hovering in mid air. A third identical object was further out in the sky. There was a fourth identical object going out even further. There may have been 5 or 6 of these bubble shaped objects. Each one going further and further out into the sky. The closest one which was hovering by the window may have been around 9 feet in diameter. I was 6 years old and with my mother one afternoon after kindergarten going to meet my father. My mother and I were walking down this street when we noticed many people starring up at the sky. Of course we had to look up to see what everyone was looking at. I remember looking at these objects and wondering what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
