4/28/96 12:00|Holopaw|FL|Changing|@15minutes|Sunday, April 28, 1996, a day I'll never forget! Had no sound, didn't exactly land in my sight, but I'm pretty sure it did!|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39756.html|8|ndxe199604| Sunday, April 28, 1996, a day I&#39;ll never forget! Had no sound, didn&#39;t exactly land in my sight, but I&#39;m pretty sure it did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving between Holopaw and Melbourne, on 192. It was a beautiful, bright, sunny Sunday, my husband, said &#34;I see a UFO&#34;, I said, &#34;Where?&#34;, as I was scanning the sky. And there it was, a ball, looked like a pewter ball, falling gently down from the sky. As it was falling, the lower part was beginning to flatten out slowly. Out of the top, it looked like it could have been some sort of antenna, but it was a different material than the rest, a white grainy hard material. As it was lowering closer to the earth, it was wobbling gently, and at the same time, constantly changing shape. The antennae, or whatever, was coming out of a tufted material from the top.  And at the same time, the color of the whole craft is changing to a bright silver, shining and glinting in the sun, and perfect, still revolving, no imperfections, no lines or marks. By now, the bottom is completely flat, perfectly flat, and out of the top, the antennae, has changed to show 3 perfectly round, large windows, or glass, which showed the beautiful, blue sky, through them. I was scrutinizing, to see if any being was looking from the window or glass. But saw no living being only this perfect object. By this time, it was perfectly perpendicular to the ground. It was about a couple of feet from landing when it stopped, in mid-air, and whisked off to the left, still ground level, white sand was blown from under the craft, and we were moved from the sight. Looking back from the front seat of the car, I saw a white gate to the left of the craft which opened fast. It seemed to have been made of the same white, grainy material that the &#34;antennae&#34; had been made of, before the transmutation. Now, looking at the road ahead, leaving this sight, the road looked like it was going to a perfect point ahead. After seeing this spectacular occurrence, we were both wordless and in awe, and I thought, this was the last day of life on earth. I said to my hubby, that maybe we should report this to the police to alert who knows who about this for the safety of the world, but he said we would be locked up, for sure. So we went to the art festival and then to the beach and had a great day. But I had much anxiety for a few months after this, expecting some sort of repercussions, but, thank God, and I do mean, thank God, we are still in existence!<n>

We decided to take a walk up the Salmon River Road to the East.  While walking, off to my left I notice light above the canyon rim.  I assume it is the moon until I look in front of me and see the moon beginning to rise to the east.  I immediately turn to look at what it might be. I was astounded and was shouting at my friends to look and I immediately started running back down the road to get a clearer view since it was slightly obscured by trees.  I watched it for a few seconds while running and had to look back  at the road to see where I was running and looked back and it was gone. What I and one other observed was a craft that looked like a massive glowing white oval/egg cocked at a 45 degree angle and slowly moving toward earth.  From my perspective it was 1 1/2 times bigger than the moon but its distance from me is unknown and would guess at least a mile.  The craft emitted a mis! ty, comet-like tail that was white with slight electric blue like tinges to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I looked up and saw the triangular shape above us with round yellowish lights in a v shape.  I found it amazing that we were all looking and seeing it.  Then, there was a strange uncomfortable feeling for a second and no one said anything and then moved to different parts of the roof as if we hadn&#39;t seen it, I looked up to see it moving north west.  then it was gone.  I was confused and asked the others why they were acting strangely...they asked what I thought I had seen.  I didn&#39;t answer, but asked what they saw, three people said they saw ducks---one heard them and said they were brown, another said they were white and another greyish.  I asked, weren&#39;t they moving awfully slow for ducks???  They didn&#39;t know what to say.  The fourth person said he saw ducks, but then he saw something else for a moment, a triangular shaped craft.  I clearly saw a craft the whole time and never saw any ducks.  Actually, I asked my companions what they saw as the ship was above us.  And that was when I asked them aren&#39;t they moving very slow for ducks.  Then, after the strange moment where everyone froze and then moved away (two started to pull in the kite) that is when I asked for details of the ducks.  And I actually had an argument with one of my friends who was angry that I had seen something different than him and he was convinced of what he saw.<n>

I don’t know what made me look up; maybe it was a sense of motion or movement that caught my eye. I looked up and I saw a dark triangle shaped object with three lighter shaded circles at each of the corners. The circles were not really lighter in color but maybe not as black. The object was just within the glow of the street lights being reflected off the street but not quite low enough to be fully illuminated. For some reason it seemed darker than the night sky above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at a very slow, deliberate pace as if not in any real hurry. It seemed like it was observing maybe.

There were a few ships out to sea but they were anchored as their night lights were not moving at all.  The two bright lights were positioned one either side of a large ship but then moved towards eachother slowly and then suddenly flew apart at a great speed to stop in prev position.  The lights then flashed alternately and continued in this fashion for a few more minutes. At first we thought the lights to be pilot boats but when we saw their speed and manouvering we knew this to be impossible as no boat or helicoptor on earth can move in such a manner and speed.  Even planes do not stop dead in mid air. Unfortunately, we in S.A. do not have a UFO centre to contact or to check for similiar sightings. (We were approx. 40 mtrs above sea level and the objects appeared to be on the horizen)<n>

I am an ex  Police Officer and currently own my own business.  I employ approx. 25 staff,  am a designer and work with extreme detail.  The incident involved an interaction with an &#34; invisible electrical entity&#34; over a period of approx. 5 hours that  we are aware of and possibly longer.  Four tangible hard artifacts remain,  many other less tangible items are also involved.  Injuries to three members of the party include symptoms similar to slight radiation poisoning,  burns and scarring,  massive headaches,  personality changes,  massive tinnitus to three witnesses which commenced spontaneously and at the same approx. time.  All  attempts to investigate the incident have come to a dead-end in Australia.  This includes approaches to the Services, C.S.I.R.O, academia generally and to many of the local UFO and Paranormal Organisations.   I would appreciate any assistance forthcoming from the U.S.A. or any other reputable source to allow me to continue my investigations.<n>

It wasn&#39;t a perfect cylinder, it was like a Zepplin blimp with the nose being a little more rounded,and no cockpit underneath. I lost sight of it because of a few houses so I ran out into the street and it was gone.

Driving North at approx 21:30 at night along the coast road we saw a bright orange light in the distance that resolved into 2 orange lights side by side.  Passing under the lights I looked out the car window to see a triangle shaped object hovering approx 100 metres above us and approx 20 degrees to one side of our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights that we could see from a distance were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over and crossed the road where we were close to being underneath an object that had several large red and green lights underneath, with a large central white light. There were small winking lights on the 2 outside (wings) of the delta shape. We could clearly see the outline of the craft and that it was silent and hovering in place. The craft was an isosceles triangle that appeared to be the size of a small civilian aircraft in width. Only one other vehicle passed us during this time and the passengers ignored our efforts to point out the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approx 2 mins hovering the craft rotated on its axis and slowly moved East away from our position. It stayed the same altitude and we watched until the craft had moved off into the distance and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the craft had moved off in the direction of our home suburb I told the boys to keep a lookout. We encountered the craft crossing the main highway approx 8 kilometres from where we first saw it. We turned down the nearest street to pace the craft that was slowly following large power lines behind suburban housing. At this point we noticed 3 smaller winking lights come in at speed from the surrounding night sky and join with the object. The boys kept the craft under observation while I drove parallel to its course. Approx 30 seconds after the smaller objects joined with the craft the boys said that it had suddenly gone straight up into the sky at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I did not see the craft leave though when I did look to the side a second later the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made a report to a local UFO investigator who (with our permission) passed the sighting onto a local newspaper. Wishing to remain anonymous we did not give any personal details except to confirm what the investigator had told them. I have not referred this sighting to any other person since that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand that this is an old sighting, tho I hope it may add to your knowledge of these events. I have drawings made the same night by the boys and myself if you should be interested.<n>

I noticed a light moving to my right . I focused on it . It was dark . It was low in the sky relative to the horizon where it came from . Its trajectory was a shallow angle , almost level maybe 5 derees down . The first fireball was Phosfloresent green . It was the relative size of a streetlight and had a tail 10 times that in length . It took 5 to 8 seconds to cross the sky . It was very strange because we heard the torch like sound of the fireball like a blow torch . There was no sonic boom . We looked at each other and ware amazed at the experience only to be drawn to the same point low in the sky to see yet another object almost the twin following in the same path seperated by 30 seconds but this one was different . It did not make a noise yet it had a tail of the same proportion , the same trajectory and speed . The shallow angle of decent made me wonder about these sightins . It was like they were flying . I have watched the night sky since 6 years old and have yearly events of watching the different annual meteor showers . Most meteors are very fast and hi up in the atmospere . They enter at a steep angle .  These were flyin not shooting . Most Unusual !!!<n>

As we parked on the North side of the street in front of a club whose name I don&#39;t remember a young man rushed out to us exclaiming &#34;do you see those UFO&#39;s&#34; or something to that effect. We all walked into the outdoor courtyard of this club and directly overhead was a small number (maybe 7 or 8) of &#34;points of light&#34;. I hesitate to think of this as a &#34;UFO&#34; sighting simply because I saw no &#34;objects&#34;. The points of light seemed to be white in color and very small, occupying perhaps the same minutes (or seconds) of angle as most stars. Yet they were clearly not stars as they were continuously moving in a sort of &#34;cluster&#34; and seemed to appear and disappear as though ascending and decending. During the encounter my girlfriend (who had lived in LA some years previously) kept shouting &#34;Those are birds!&#34;. After what may have been only a few seconds or as much as a minute the lights ceased to appear while one of them moved generally Westbound at what I perceived would have been a high rate of speed. Frankly I hesitate to clog the database with a &#34;sighting&#34; that is not particularly anomalous. Being nighttime I had no teresterial background to judge distance or size by. The points of light were very small and no detail of any &#34;structure&#34; or even &#34;reflective surface&#34; was visible. There were no attendant sounds that I heard. Given that LA has enormous &#34;light pollution&#34; I find the bird hypothesis likely (birds riding &#34;thermals&#34; could account for the twinkling in and out of the light sources) though I have never seen such a display before or since. I hesitate to think of myself as having had a UFO sighting simply because the experience was odd, but not that odd. There was simply too little visual data for me to be &#34;blown away&#34; by the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a beautiful clear spring day in Southern California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to the park but there wasn&#39;t anyone to play with.  So, I started hitting the ball up against the wall and waited until someone showed up to play.  I threw the ball up in the air to practice some serves and something directly above me caught my eye.  I thought it was a plane at first, but the thing wasn&#39;t moving.  I&#39;ve always been into planes since I was a kid, so it struck me odd that this &#34;plane&#34; wasn&#39;t moving.  It had to be at an altitude of about 1 to 2 miles up and nothing that I knew of could hover at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very much dumbstruck and at the same time extremely curious.  Why wasn&#39;t this thing moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around to call to someone to witness this, I didn&#39;t care if it was a stranger or not.  But, there was no one around within 100 yards of me.  I was very confused about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid down on the court on my back so that I could better examine what it was, because it was directly above me.  It had the shape similar to that of space shuttle turned upside down with it&#39;s bay doors open.  I remember wishing that I had a pair of binoculars so that I could see it better.  I remember it was highly polished like stainless steel and the sun was reflecting off from it brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to have laid there for 5 to 10 minutes.  It just stuck there.  I almost got the feeling that it was looking at me looking at it.  I went to get up and took my eye off from it for a split second and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so struck that I forgot my tennis racket at the courts as I jogged home to tell my family.  When I told them what I saw, they didn&#39;t seem to believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in April 1996 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was some kind of rocket because it seem to be coming from the direction of the space center on the east coast.  It was far to big a fire trail than the space shuttle and the sound much lowder like a constant roar, not a boom like the shuttle makes when it brakes the sound barrier.  Its rate of speed was that of 100x FASTER THAN THE SHUTTLE DOES ON TAKE OFF. I know this was no space shuttle because you can see the space shuttle, but not this,  what ever it was, was covered by fire.<n>

The morning was dark and it was foggy, the general area was illuminated by the city lights and was not very bright. As i was passing the Sign indicating that the Lakewood blvd off ramp was coming up, I observed  a brilliant green/white fireball with tail about the size of a silver dollar in my windshield. the angle of descent was approximately 40 degrees from left to right from the corner of my windsheild to approximately 6 inches above the base of my windsheild to about 3/4 of the windsheild along the base. It then totally disappeared. I estimate the distance approximately at 1-1.5 miles in front of me from where i was on the freeway The fog gave the fireball a fuzzy appearance around its perimeter. I tried to see if other drivers on the freeway had seen it, but at 70mph and in the darkness it was impossible to make eye contact with other drivers. &gt;From the angle of descent and approximate distance, i judged that the Fireball must have gone in the direction of the many hangars that occupy that airport and also face the freeway. Note: the speed of descent was rapid as if it were falling at great speed. I was expecting a fire or crash in the area of  the projected collision, but as i passed by , there were NO fires or explosions.  I found out that there was no one in the tower at that time, so i could not verify my sighting with anyone. I checked radio news and newspapers at the time ,but no mention of a crash. MY guess is that it was no meteorite( it was too big and there would have been fire), is that it may have been one of  our craft which may have been in trouble and had to &#34;land&#34; in the city under extraordinary conditions. I have since heard of fireballs in seattle and i figured i  would finally report it to someone, I figured the police would not accept a report.<n>

4/11/96 20:00|Atlantic Ocean||Light|4 hours|During a flight from Boston to Amsterdam a strange point of light could be seen for almost the whole flight.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02995.html|69|ndxe199604| Summary : During a flight from Boston to Amsterdam a strange point of light could be seen for almost the whole flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When flying from Boston to Amsterdam on a Northwest DC-10, my girfriend and I noticed a strange light off to the lower port side of the airplane at a distance of about 2 to 3 miles.  At first I thought that the light could be a reflection from one of the navigation lights of the DC-10.  After watching the light for about an hour we decided that that wasn&#39;t the case.  It would change position and color.  We could simply tell that it was some sort of object. After a while, we would just take a look out the window every 20 minuets or so. Every time we looked out it was still out there. At one point we asked another passenger and a steward to take a look and they were amazed as well.  The light dissapeared when we started to overfly some shipping, probably about 200 miles from Ireland. After the flight we joked about the &#34;UFO&#34; that we saw, but we were still left with an unsettling feeling. I am a private pilot and I have seen nav light reflections and air traffic at night, this light was not even similar.<n>

It appeared to be a landing light from an aircraft which was much to low to clear the mountains for a landing in San Jose. On my way outside I noticed the time as 12:44 am. The craft passed over at approx. 1-2000 ft. and at a viewing angle of approx. 45 degrees from vertical. It was approx. the length of an airliner and cylinder shaped and rounded at both ends. There were 7 round porthole shaped openings along the side and 5 square areas colored as if subjected to heat. There was a horizontal circular ring that had movement like liquid moving around the ring. There were vertical lines of descending from the rings that came together as an apex to form a cone. The cone in front was a light gray color and the one at the rear looked like liquid gold moving around the ring and upt the vertical lines. When it passed from my view I returned inside my house and took note of the time. It was 12:49am. The next day I took compass bearings and determined its course at approx. 355 degrees magnetic.<n>

I was driving my car to home in Dayton, Nv. It was a Friday night. I am not sure what the date was other than the Year and Month. It was April of 1996. This is a real true encounter and I do not wish to be known. It has been actually a hard thing for me to deal with in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was actually going to go home to grab my guitar. I was a 25 year old guitar virtuoso. My indian friend from the Hopi tribe in town was waiting for me to come back. I was a kid, just trying to have some fun on a Friday night. So now I am going to put into perspective the events that happened, true and factual. I will have you know straight forward that this story is complete and true. I will send drawn pictures soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was driving in my Dodge Rampage on Hwy. 50 East in Moundhouse Nevada. My window was down. The air was blowing on my face. I had my radio tuned in and up fairly loud. My speakers sucked with some distortion, but it was cool with me. I was on my way home to grab my guitar at 11:00 at night. I was intending to get there as fast as possible cause I wanted to create some music with my friend Chris, the Indian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it was already late and I knew I had to hurry. I had nothing else to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed the Virginia City turn off on the left. As I passed it I noticed some light on the hills at the mouth of the Canyon there. There were 4 lights. They were a whitish blue and very very bright. They were lighting up the sagebrush actually on the hillside on the west side of the VC Highway. They were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I was driving so, I saw the lights but I looked away as I was driving. I was thinking to myself thats a low jet. I thought it was a jet plane coming from Reno. I looked back at them. They were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. Then I began to wonder. What the heck is that. Must be a helecopter I thought. Then I really began to stare. No it&#39;s not a helecopter. I knew it was no helecopter or plane. Yet, I could see no object, only lights. They were not moving. I could see the brush on the hill bright as day. I saw some things moving in the brush. Little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote&#39;s or something. My heart began to thump. The adrenaline kicked in as I realized this was something different than that I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving still and slowed down so I could see more of it. I was very realized and already had a hunch it was a UFO. I said out loud, &#34;Haha yeah you know I can see you.&#34; As soon as I said this, the lights began to turn. They were no longer shining on the brush. They span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. They looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. They were very big and bright. There were no other cars behind me I could see lights from nor in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was racing fast. I was frightened. I no longer was really watching the road. The lights had my total attention. They turned around and began slowly hovering down the Canyon towards the Highway I was driving on. There were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. Thats when I realized it was a round object. I was freaking out. My eyes were huge I&#39;m sure and I was awake and ready to notice every detail. The lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. Like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. I knew I was heading straight towards them at the same time. I was afraid, yet I was curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. I was amazed. Entranced by the realization and curiousity I barely even looked at the road ahead. I was just staring out my downed window. My radio became all fuzzy and then was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car was driving fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon there became an embankment on the side of the Highway that separated the lights from my vision. I knew from driving the Highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach Dayton hill where the Canyon is. I also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed I was. The suspense was incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the hill and as soon as the Embankment receded, there I saw something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I was at top the hill and the Canyon beside me on the left. Right there as the ground cleared way, I was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! Yes, this was real. I was not even watching the road. I was mezmerized by the depth. I was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. It was indeed a saucer. Yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. I saw the tiers or stories, the floors. I saw the walls. Everything inside was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was incredibly astounding. I had no clue what to think or anything. All I could do was stare and observe.It was like I was above it and as I went down the hill I became level with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that I first saw. There was a female. They all were wearing white robes. She had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. Her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. Right into my eyes they were. She nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. They were all smaller like a 5 year old. She was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! And me! I felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that I understood her and them. Her long finger, their faces grey. She had 3 fingers and a thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then had a terrible feeling. I looked up to the second story. There was 2 beings there in the middle of the room. I was about level with them I think. The being I first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face andeyes of E.T. His skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. His skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. His face looked a lot like E.T. The kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren&#39;t black. Their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. Blue eyes, the girl had green eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. I noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. His mouth dropped! His eyes bulged! As he realized I was looking at him and them and He was staring straight into my eyes! He was frightened that I saw him. It was deffinately not part of his plan. His eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. I&#39;d estimate I was 20 feet from his face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made contact alright. He immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. The one in front of him was sitting. I saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. He had a human like head. Not a draped skull. I could see wrinkles all over his head. It made him look very old. No hair on any of them whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was not in white. He was wearing a black suit from what I could see. He turned his face toward me! Right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! He turned his face toward me. Ohhhh Myyyy Goddd was I scared!!!! He was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. His face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! They were pure black. As he and I stared eachother in the eyes I realized he was a man. He was a human. He must&#39;ve been thousands of years old and very wicked. I was petrified. I was scared shitless. He gave me this snarling look yet at the same time I could see his smarts. There was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. He then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instantly! The windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a Chinese fan decending from the top. Corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. They were breathing like and sparkling with colors. I noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything! The bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. That must be how they do their airports. That must be their laws or regulations I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to spin. My window was still down and I was close to the bottom of the hill as I heard the riffles begin to hummmm! They sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. The object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. As it spun faster and faster I could only see the outline of it. Like it was suddenly cloaked. Kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. It spun so fast it began to become invisible. It then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was petrified. I had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. I had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. I pulled over and got out of my car. I looked up. I wanted to see it more. It was sunny outside. There were cars going by. It only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. I was at the top at 11:00 P.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. Yet, I didn&#39;t even realize this. Not at all. I had no conception of time. I was tired. I went home and crashed out. I woke up and remembered the hill. I don&#39;t know how it was daylight when I got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. I don&#39;t remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. I have only told a handfull of people this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. I will tell more if I get a chance. I think they were mining gold or silver. I bet if someone pulled a map of resouces and compared it to sightings they might realize some things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/5/96 21:00|San Diego|CA|Formation|60 seconds|Two military members sighted two red lightsnorth of downntown San Diego.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02065.html|83|ndxe199604| Summary : Two military members sighted two red lights north of downntown San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us were in a position on Fifth Ave in downtown San Diego&#39;s Gaslamp Quarter about two blocks from the convention center.  We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.&gt;From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO&#39;s on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.  I decided to let you know about the event, albeit late.<n>

It had 8 small lights on the leading edges, bright white, which blinked a bit.  It had to be several hundred feet in span and it&#39;s speed could not have exceeded 50 mph.  We called the airport which said it had nothing on it&#39;s radar and had no visual from the tower.  We didn&#39;t believe them because we could see the top of the tower from where we were and the UFO was in direct line of sight.  The next day in the Westchester Gannet Newspaper we found out the about 300 people had reported seeing the same object.  Authorities said it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation at night.  But considering the very low altitude (aprox. 200 ft above ground) we would have heard so many engines.  And the formation didn&#39;t vary at all, making us believe it couldn&#39;t have been more than one craft.<n>

I was driving my car to home in Dayton, Nv. It was a Friday night. I am not sure what the date was other than the Year and Month. It was April of 1996. This is a real true encounter and I do not wish to be known. It has been actually a hard thing for me to deal with in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was actually going to go home to grab my guitar. I was a 25 year old guitar virtuoso. My indian friend from the Hopi tribe in town was waiting for me to come back. I was a kid, just trying to have some fun on a Friday night. So now I am going to put into perspective the events that happened, true and factual. I will have you know straight forward that this story is complete and true. I will send drawn pictures soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was driving in my Dodge Rampage on Hwy. 50 East in Moundhouse Nevada. My window was down. The air was blowing on my face. I had my radio tuned in and up fairly loud. My speakers sucked with some distortion, but it was cool with me. I was on my way home to grab my guitar at 11:00 at night. I was intending to get there as fast as possible cause I wanted to create some music with my friend ((name deleted)), the Indian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it was already late and I knew I had to hurry. I had nothing else to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed the Virginia City turn off on the left. As I passed it I noticed some light on the hills at the mouth of the Canyon there. There were 4 lights. They were a whitish blue and very very bright. They were lighting up the sagebrush actually on the hillside on the west side of the VC Highway. They were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I was driving so, I saw the lights but I looked away as I was driving. I was thinking to myself thats a low jet. I thought it was a jet plane coming from Reno. I looked back at them. They were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. Then I began to wonder. What the heck is that. Must be a helecopter I thought. Then I really began to stare. No it&#39;s not a helecopter. I knew it was no helecopter or plane. Yet, I could see no object, only lights. They were not moving. I could see the brush on the hill bright as day. I saw some things moving in the brush. Little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote&#39;s or something. My heart began to thump. The adrenaline kicked in as I realized this was something different than that I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving still and slowed down so I could see more of it. I was very realized and already had a hunch it was a UFO. I said out loud, &#34;Haha yeah you know I can see you.&#34; As soon as I said this, the lights began to turn. They were no longer shining on the brush. They span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. They looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. They were very big and bright. There were no other cars behind me I could see lights from nor in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was racing fast. I was frightened. I no longer was really watching the road. The lights had my total attention. They turned around and began slowly hovering down the Canyon towards the Highway I was driving on. There were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. Thats when I realized it was a round object. I was freaking out. My eyes were huge I&#39;m sure and I was awake and ready to notice every detail. The lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. Like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. I knew I was heading straight towards them at the same time. I was afraid, yet I was curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. I was amazed. Entranced by the realization and curiousity I barely even looked at the road ahead. I was just staring out my downed window. My radio became all fuzzy and then was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car was driving fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon there became an embankment on the side of the Highway that separated the lights from my vision. I knew from driving the Highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach Dayton hill where the Canyon is. I also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed I was. The suspense was incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the hill and as soon as the Embankment receded, there I saw something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I was at top the hill and the Canyon beside me on the left. Right there as the ground cleared way, I was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! Yes, this was real. I was not even watching the road. I was mezmerized by the depth. I was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. It was indeed a saucer. Yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. I saw the tiers or stories, the floors. I saw the walls. Everything inside was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was incredibly astounding. I had no clue what to think or anything. All I could do was stare and observe.It was like I was above it and as I went down the hill I became level with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that I first saw. There was a female. They all were wearing white robes. She had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. Her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. Right into my eyes they were. She nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. They were all smaller like a 5 year old. She was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! And me! I felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that I understood her and them. Her long finger, their faces grey. She had 3 fingers and a thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then had a terrible feeling. I looked up to the second story. There were 2 beings there in the middle of the room. I was about level with them I think. The being I first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face any eyes of E.T. His skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. His skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. His face looked a lot like E.T. The kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren&#39;t black. Their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. Blue eyes, the girl had green eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. I noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. His mouth dropped! His eyes bulged! As he realized I was looking at him and them and He was staring straight into my eyes! He was frightened that I saw him. It was deffinately not part of his plan. His eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. I&#39;d estimate I was 20 feet from his face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made contact alright. He immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. The one in front of him was sitting. I saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. He had a human like head. Not a draped skull. I could see wrinkles all over his head. It made him look very old. No hair on any of them whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was not in white. He was wearing a black suit from what I could see. He turned his face toward me! Right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! He turned his face toward me. Ohhhh Myyyy Goddd was I scared!!!! He was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. His face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! They were pure black. As he and I stared eachother in the eyes I realized he was a man. He was a human. He must&#39;ve been thousands of years old and very wicked. I was petrified. I was scared shitless. He gave me this snarling look yet at the same time I could see his smarts. There was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. He then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him. Like he was signaling to me they were going up! Instantly! The windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a Chinese fan decending from the top. Corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. They were breathing like and sparkling with colors. I noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything! The bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. That must be how they do their airports. That must be their laws or regulations I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to spin. My window was still down and I was close to the bottom of the hill as I heard the riffles begin to hummmm! They sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. The object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. As it spun faster and faster I could only see the outline of it. Like it was suddenly cloaked. Kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. It spun so fast it began to become invisible. It then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was petrified. I had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. I had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. I pulled over and got out of my car. I looked up. I wanted to see it more. It was sunny outside. There were cars going by. It only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. I was at the top at 11:00 P.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. Yet, I didn&#39;t even realize this. Not at all. I had no conception of time. I was tired. I went home and crashed out. I woke up and remembered the hill. I don&#39;t know how it was daylight when I got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. I don&#39;t remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. I have only told a handfull of people this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. I will tell more if I get a chance.? What I am wondering is how you could miss such an object because I was sure to see it. I am only 33 and I am not into hoaxing or anything. I would not email this important information right to you if I was. I don&#39;t give my name well, because I have a life. I have seen the mechanics of their vessel. Does that mean anything to anyone? I don&#39;t quite understand people anymore in general as far as all this goes. When I look up I know! I know the life is there cause I&#39;ve seen it. God I wish only you could understand the reality of things more. The design of the ship was like of a seashell. It covers and uncovers itself when it needs. The windows are for sightseeing. They are huge! The riffles are razor sharp. I would imagine they could cut through tree&#39;s, maybe even burrow into the ground. It spins before it takes off. Like a top, it gathers momentum. It spins and whirrs and becomes almost invisible from spinning so dang fast. It tilts, and it shoots from some kind of small impulse explosion device. It shot up so fast you see, that all it left was a light streak. When it hit the atmosphere, which I did see, it made a flash. When it made the flash, I saw the shape of it up there. It was a millisecond. I watched it, I witnessed a real encounter. It was breathtaking. I made contact unknowingly and made eye contact very knowingly. These beings are astronauts and miners, sightseers, they are in search of something great. I think, or get the notion from deep within, I am not sure where, but they are taking samples of many places. They are beholders of elements, chemicals, they are ancient. Alchemists. They must be abducting in search of enzymes they use for experiments in genetics to endure life. The fountain of youth so to speak on a much broader scale. Why I know this I have no idea. It&#39;s a hunch. The search for life eternal exists in the life eternal above. See, when I look up I know, that through all them stars is eternal life. There is life everywhere there in every form imaginable. It is eternity. Can you imagine what that means? Human kind has just begun to seek. I do believe we as a race shall be warned. This planet is immensely overpopulated, it must look like a christmas tree at night from space? I am very patriotic for our astronaughts. I believe in the missions. I know I sound like a flake, but take it as constructive evidence. It is real. I do not know how the space, and naval and airforces of the globe and sattellites have not been able to track the vessel I have seen. The devices we use must not be sophisticated enough to see them. They do use light, and sound only at take off. Can you please map out gold and silver or electrum deposits and compare them to sightings of ufo&#39;s over the past 3000 years. There you may find something extensive. I am not sure why they would want gold being it isn&#39;t very conductive, but if you were traveling far through a lot of stuff, corrosion might be bad. Gold would be a great alloy? Collectors. I know for a fact where I saw the craft, there is gold. They were spotlighting the surface. Mars rocks found on Antarctica. Imagine that. You see proof of life already is here. Amonst ouselves and our globe. This Earth was heaven before we decided to make life easier for ourselves. There are lions and trees here just like in Heaven. All water is Holy. I do not understand the missions so to speak of the shuttle being extremely productive, yet. The craft we need to make is one of motion, not gliding. Like the craft I saw, it hovers yet it spins and gathers motion to spin off and out. It uses wind. Is there wind in space? It&#39;s like a spiral propeller. A disk is the object but I saw how it works. It spins gathering force and is designed to use that force to propel with angular coordinates. The shock or gun of the blast is what makes the sound when it ignites and shoots up. I believe you should experiment with these physics. This is the way they do it. One other thing I noticed was the antennae on the bottom of the ship. It must pick up all vibrations and such. We have dishes, they have antennae. Also I noticed that they&#39;re eyes are black eyelids like that of an insect, but the lids lift up to reveal the more human like eyes behind with irises and pupils. They have huge eyes, there&#39;s no wonder why they are so advanced. They take in a lot, and communicate without word. With mind they communicate. I am sure there are many different species. I saw 3 species on 1 ship. The information I have given you might be of vital importance, who knows. It is real. I know that. I have drawn pictures as well. I am curious as to what happened to the time warp I encountered as well. I can not remember for the life of me. There was 9 hours I can not remember. How could I be driving a car and be abducted. That doesn&#39;t make sense. I just drove down the hill, and it was daytime. I saw them take off and pulled over. It was morning time. What the hell happened to me. I wanna know. Kind of. I&#39;m kind of scared to find out. The other day when I first began to take pictures of the drawn pictures, the cable went out, my cell phone just died, and my webcam took a dump all in the same half hour. I went to the T.V. and went to fix it somehow, and as my hand approached, the cable came back on, my cell phone beeped, and my webcam light came back on. Weird. So I used the cell to take the photo&#39;s and uploaded them to my computer system. I have sent them to 2 people and such. I would like to send the drawing to NASA. I would like you to see what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anonymous<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The body was slender with long arms and legs, a small head and to the best of my recall, large eyes.  The body was reported to be 3.5 to 4 feet in lenght with silver skin that was deteriorating (presumably over the winter).  The news sources reported that the remains had been taken to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mi,for examination.  Suspiciously, there was never again any mention of this unusual find in the newspaper, on TV or over the radio.  It would seem that the media was instructed to drop the story, even though it was one having great public appeal and would draw large audiences.  This certainly seems to have been a &#34;hush&#34; job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The mall was ready to close so the time was about 10pm when we were driving back to our apartment which was located off of progress avenue on the hill above Widener University school of law.  I was riding in the passenger seat and notices a round, yellowish light in the sky.  Then what seemed a few feet to the right of that light another light &#34;turned on&#34;.  Then another and another.  Ultimately, there were six lights in the sky that looked like this:    O   O   O   O   O   O.  I told my roomate to pull the car over.  When he did the lights were gone.  I got out of the car and noticed a very small red dot in the sky.  It was a light.  It was moving very, very fast from right to left, then up and down and all over the place.  Then it would stop.  Once it was stopped, a few seconds later the light formation would start again like I described above.  We drove around the backroads there for about an hour following it.  What scared my the most about this UFO was that someone apparently saw on 9/18/02 (posted on this site on 3/21/03).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part is when we got very close to the lights.  Right by this old farm house that has a big pond on the side of their home.  I was very familiar with this road becuase it was a very beautiful place to walk/run as I would often jog on that road for exercise.  We pulled over into the driveway of the farm house.  We pulled over because there was anohter man who had seen the light and pulled over also. We got out of the car.  At that time there was only one light and it was floating toward us.  It came over a bunch of pine trees and across a field directly toward me and my roomate.  He got scared as it got to about 40 yards from us.  He begged for me to get in the car but I couldn&#39;t move.  I wasn&#39;t scared.  I was amazed.  He got back into his car.  The light came toward me and the stranger that had pulled over.  It was getting closer and closer.  It was a large, warm glowing light.  It was beautiful.  I felt no danger.  It&#39;s weird to say this but I felt very safe, almost like I was being comforted a bit somehow.  It sounds stupid but it&#39;s true.  Well, as the light got closer, now it was about 20 yards away, a car came down the road from our right and the way the road bends the cars headlights blinded me and the stranger.  When the car passed us the light was gone and that&#39;s how the entire incident ended.  The stranger jumped in his car and took off.  My roomate was yelling at me at that point to get in the car.  We went back to our apartment and called all our frineds.  They didn&#39;t believe us becasue it was April fools day.  I called 911 and told them what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, the next day in class I drew a picture of the formation of lights for one of my frineds.  One month later that friend called me and told me to turn on the tv.  In May of 1996 there was a similar sighting in Arizona and it was on videotape.  My friend was freaked out becuase of my drawing and how much it looked like the UFO over Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wereI was apparently not the only person in Harrisburg to see that UFO that night as it made the local news.  They discounted it as a flare from an f-16 which is used as a decoy from heat seaking missles.  I found it interesting when the Arizona UFO was discounted they same way, saying it was a flare.  If the government has a flare that can float and hover and light up for over an hour then fine.  That&#39;s what I saw.  However, the flare that they showed on the news that the f-16&#39;s drop fall to the ground like a brick.  That&#39;s not what we saw.  I&#39;d love to talk to the girls that saw the similar UFO on 9/18/02.  I think we saw the same thing.<n>

The exact shape of the silouhette I&#39;m unsure of, as it was night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the fact that it was a country road, there were no street lights that would have been mistaken for the two lights. (We lived on that road, and were very familiar with any abnormalities).  We thought nothing of it initially (it wasn&#39;t something that was highly apparent).  My mom then turned to me and pointed it out, asking what it was.  I said that I didn&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went into a panic and she slowed the car down.  There was no sound coming from it, so it could not have been mistaken for an airplane.  We sat and watched it moving up slowly, then it flew up into the air maybe 200 yards, and flipped over completely, flying away at lightening speed.  I would guestimate that it was about 250 feet from one light to the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is that it scared the crap out of us both, and nobody believes us to this day.  It&#39;s almost a unspoken secret between the two of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were driving south on, I think us 189, at sunset and see a large circular light coming at us. My first thought was a plane was trying to land on the long straight stretch of road. I drove off the road to avoid collision. The light passed silently and disappeared. Unknown if there was loss of time or not. The light seemed to be 100 ft  or less off of the ground and traveling in excess of 100mph. I heard no sound and never saw the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thought it was a nightmare. Next afternoon was questioned by parent about bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 17 years old, I awoke in my underwear running from a bright light in my backyard. I was terrified. Next I awoke in my bed and vividly remembered running from the light.  I thought it was just a nightmare and went back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I woke up and looked at my watch that I had on been wearing overnight and realized that I was late for school.  I hurried and got dressed and rushed to school only to find that I was ~45 minutes early.  I thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my first period class, the girl that sat in the desk behind me asked me what day it was.  I told her the date and someone beside me said I was wrong. My watch was a day ahead.  This would not be strange except that I clearly remembered her asking me what day it was the day before the event and the date on my watch was correct.  Still I did not think about my nightmare, nor did I suspect anything more than a malfunctioning watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After school I returned to my home.  When I walked in my mom was in the kitchen.  I talked to her for a few minutes and told her about my day. Then she said something that chills me to the bone to this day.  She asked me if I saw a bright light out my window last night. She said the light woke her up and she wasn&#39;t real sure what it was and then it went away.  The window to her bedroom was on the same side of the house that I was on while running from the bright light. Our house is 100 yards from the road and our driveway is on the opposite side of the house.  I am not sure what happened to me, but I have a feeling that I may have been abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
