2/12/82 23:54|Windsor|CO|Triangle|6 Minutes|Upside Down Black Metalic Pyramid with non-defracting lights|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17310.html|2|ndxe198202| Upside Down Black Metalic Pyramid with non-defracting lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home from work, I saw 3 non-defracting white light beams streaming over tree tops and creating distinct round lighted areas on the hillside. As I approached town, I noticed that these lights were coming from the grocery store parking lot area. It was a stationary object so even though it was about 2 miles to town it was still there when I arrived. I saw a dark triangle shape against the sky with the 3 lights coming from each side of the point witch was pointed towards the ground. I was curious, still thinking that this could be a hot air balloon or something else. I was the only car which turned into the parking lot. I thought this in itself was amazing since the road had alot of traffic that night. Was I the only one who saw this?. I pulled my car directly under the craft, which was only slightly above the parking lot light. It was a dark color maybe black, metalic with slight bumps arranged in possible adhesion or rivet type patterns. The shape was clearly up-side down pyramidal and about 50-60 feet from top corner to top corner. It was centered over 4 parking lot lights and I wondered if it was gathering energy from them also. It made no sound.(I turned off my car, and listened carefully between the waves of cars on the road). Another car pulled up, a grey Toyota Celica with 2 young men inside. they roled down their window and were looking at the craft with the biggest eyes I&#39;ve ever seen. Their mouths were hanging open and I could see their tongues. I waved at them and the craft began to rotate on axis. The men burned rubber out of there and squealed tires again acelerating onto the road. I decided that my car was a safer vantage point at this time and hoped it would start. It did and I backed up about 50ft. The craft then headed towards the grocery store. It looked like it would run into the sign and roof. When the point of the craft got within 15-20 ft of the store, the craft lifted about 5 foot and cleared the store top. I should metion that it didn&#39;t make any sound, the lights had rotate! d from p ointing west to pointing south and it was only traviling at a speed of about 5MPH. Against the night sky I could see the flat top clearly. A few months later a co-worker was talking about the UFO that crossed the road in front of her. She said that she and others stopped their vehicles on highway 34 towards Greeley and just watched this up-side down pyamid thing cross the road. She said that it was still moving at about 5MPH. Her sighting lasted about 15-20minutes as she saw the lights before it crossed the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify whether the time was am or pm, but we presume it was a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time.  The date may be approximate, although we are not certain of that.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD))<n>

2/1/82 22:00|Mt. Palomar|CA|Unknown|Five minutes|High altitude light moving E-W, stops, loiters, makes a 90 degree turn, and accellerates at lightening speed out of the atmosph|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58730.html|4|ndxe198202| High altitude light moving E-W, stops, loiters, makes a 90 degree turn, and accellerates at lightening speed out of the atmosph<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the spring of 1982 I was camping with my girlfriend on Mount Palomar near the observatory in California.  It was a very clear night so we were able to see an incredible amount of stars that evening, it was really very beautiful.  Around 10:00 PM, I noticed a red light moving across the southern hemisphere at an attitude of about 11:00. The object appeared to be moving slow like an airplane from west to east, but its altitude was very high as if it was in the upper atmosphere somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 80,000 feet. At this altitude I imagine that its ground speed had to be tremendous, and it was probably pretty large if I could see it that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object move across the sky for about three to four minutes and then it simply stopped and loitered for five to ten seconds before it made a 90 degree right turn and departed at lightening speed out of the atmosphere. Even though the red light was probably the sun reflecting off of what ever it was, this was not a shooting star, they don’t leave the atmosphere once they enter it and this was not another planet, they don’t move like that.  I am retired military and somewhat of a UFO skeptic, but I am not aware of anything in our inventory that is capable of flying at such a high speed then come to a dead stop, loiter, and then make a sharp turn and accelerate out of our atmosphere in less than a second.  It just doesn’t exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one other occasion I made a similar observation during the early 1990s. I was on an at sea deployment with the Marines between Hawaii and the Philippines when I saw the object.  The Navy usually operates under what they call “darken ship” conditions at night so it gets very dark out there and you can see are the navigational lights. Because of this, you can see stars like you’ve never seen before under these conditions.  Anyway, I can’t remember all of the details, but I do remember that the events that occurred that evening were almost identical to the ones that occurred in 1982, which is why I have remembered them even after all of these years.   And yes, there were others with me when we sat what ever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
