While watching them they stopped. This really got our attention and while watching them sit there they suddenly took off as if shot from a gun and in a flash was gone. I know this is a boring story as there was no large craft to take us on board or anything like that but I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m reporting after 50 years. I saw what I saw and it was not any kind of plane. I&#39;m reporting because I belive there are thousands of people like me who have seen similar incidents and never told or had the opportunity to tell their story, but now we have the internet and I hope you will get the word out asking people to report even the simple sightings like mine. I saw a similar thing again about 12 years later and I&#39;ll report on it using another form. My son has also seen interesting lights but never told anyone but ma and perhaps his brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was a moonless night and the stars were bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying on the table top and Kenny was lying on the seat to the left of me. We laid there looking at the stars talking. My eye caught astar moving in a zig-zag pattern across the sky..being raised in the Air Force and my Dad a pilot, I knew aircraft very well and this was no ordinary flight pattern at that elevation and it was no helicopter. So I got up on my elbows and in a loud voice to Kenny &#34;Look at..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light was coming at us at a great speed..It got so bright that today I think I felt the heat..This is the last thing I remembered..  Until we were standing at the end of the table and both of us said nothing. Return to camp and Jack and two other guys with us, asked where we had been. We simple answered, &#34;up at the bench&#34;..Only thing I can remember them saying was that they were just up there 15 minutes ago and did we go in town..Kenny and I went straight to sleep..the next morning no one could wake us until 8:00 we both got up..There was nothing said about last nite except they asked us if we went to town..I didn&#39;t understand why they would ask this nor Kenny..we hadn&#39;t gone anywhere..WE let it drop..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kenny and I remained friends for a year after that incident...Years later I realized that Kenny and I never dicussed that night..Now that was unusual for two Air Force brats seeing something come out of the sky and not saying a thing to each other or our parents..<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the later eighties I was on the road in Ohio and heard a talk show host talking to someone about abduction and sure fit the experience that I went thru..I dismissed it at the time. Months later I told my wife ((name deleted))..about what I heard a on the radio and told her of the event in Japan..She is a well educate dutch girl..in bio-genetics we met in Calfornia..We had been marrried 14 years at that time..She said she had something to tell me. While we sleeping in our bedroom in California she was awaken by the present of being which describe to a TEE the greys..which is famous now..she was told to go back to sleep and no harm will come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This shook me..not only had she not told me, but what the hell was going on..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went to a therapist in Omaha..Ne. who tried to hipmotize me..I guess I was to scared and he couldn&#39;t...I&#39;ve tried to find kenny..or Jack. No luck so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly my friend tapped me on the shoulder. I turned and saw an oval orange light coming from the west. We watched it until it disappeared over the piney hills east of town. It travelled horizontally, at I would guess the altitude of a light plane. It was a very distinct oval; no haze, no trail, no sound. The distance between the hilltops east and west that nestle this little valley town is prob. about 15 miles, so the object was going at a pretty good clip. Our parents &#34;pooh-poohed&#34; this of course, but changed their minds a couple of days later when the Colo. Springs paper carried reports of sightings that same night around the same time (tho&#39; describing green, blue, etc. in addition to orange) from the Colo. Springs area, east of Woodland Park, and further east of Colo. Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was an area frequented by test-planes and many U.S.A.F. bombers (I think I saw the U2 at extreme altitude before it got any publicity.) That day, one circular saucer rose above hilly wooded horizon, about 2 miles away, edge on, travelling not very fast in hztl. plane, banked away, clearly spinning (about 50-60 r.p.m., I&#39;d guess), rose a little above the horizon, then fell away below horizon, TO BE FOLLOWED BY 8 MORE IN LINE ASTERN. I had the binoculars on it (them) in turn and I can&#39;t remember if there were two visible at any one time, but the timing and motion was such that it wd be highly unlikely if it were one repeating the manoeuvre another 8 times. Colour was aluminium grey.  Dia. about 25-40&#39;, I&#39;d guess -- at that distance it was difficult to tell. I didn&#39;t get a long look edge-on but I think I glimpsed a bulge at the centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have spoken about this for years and, of course, everyone dismisses it. Got my Dad to report it to R.A.F., but .... you know the rest!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The famil|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12521.html|6|ndxe195507| 1955 daytime sighting of a saucer craft by a family of four while on a picnic on a Sunday in the Cascade Mts. of Washington.  The family believes the  craft hovered over the river, observing them (and vice versa). Craft left at unbelievable speeds and the father, a flight engineer for Boeing  Aircraft and former flight instructor on the B-29s of WWII, insisted the family remain silent about the sighting so his career would not be in jeopardy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thirteen years old, and it was a Sunday morning in July, 1955, in Washington State.  I thought it was aspecial day from the start.  The morning mellowed from a nighttime nip into a lovely, crisp summer day, more like late spring than summer, and the skies were a cloudless blue.  Days like that are rare in Washington State, and my parents were not about to waste such an opportunity, so, over breakfast, they suggested a picnic. Later, I sat glued to the car&#39;s window, during our short drive into the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  My parents located a rather remote picnic site along the Tolt River, near the little town of Carnation, which I considered a perfect setting for our outing.  Our car was not far away, but the spot was totally natural and untouched in appearance.  The river was a bit too swift to wade in; its cold glacial waters spilled over heaps of stones and boulders.  The river banks were even larger heaps of stones, most of them sanded smooth by years of flooding waters.  Large stands of virgin Douglas Fir flanked the banks. We picnicked first, then I started a family game of skipping stones across the water.  I remember laughin at the near impossibility of skipping stones on such wild waters, yet my Dad could often manage two skips.  I don&#39;t remember how long we played like that, but at some point, my Dad picked up a slightly heavier stone and drew back his arm as though to loft the stone skyward, over the river.  Instead, he stood frozen, arm drawn back, for several seconds.  He was staring up, and off to the west slightly, across the river.  With great alarm, I followed his gaze.  There, above us, hovering motionlessly, was a UFO. It would be more accurate if I called it a flying saucer, for it was just that.  It was as though someone had joined two round stainless steel saucers, edges together, only these saucers had no bumps, no varying angles, and no visible portholes or openings.  I could see that the saucer&#39;s mass was easily defined along the edges, and solid in appearance.  The sun was further to the south, and there was no glare on the saucer.  It seemed to hang, suspended, like a monstrous steely plate, at a fairly low altitude, over the river.  It remained there, motionless, as seconds stretched into an eternity.  All was quiet except for the river in my ears. As I huddled near my mom and dad, I experienced a numb uneasiness, which was visibly shared by the rest of my family.  It was not the presence of something alien that bothered me as much as the knowledge that IT was watching US.  And how long had it been up there, hovering, before we noticed it? I noticed that the saucer&#39;s height was difficult to estimate, simply because I had no reference points to use for comparison, except possibly the tree tops.  Was the saucer huge and at great height, or smaller and at a lower altitude?  (This is the only point where my family and I recall things differently:  I remember it as hovering low over the tree tops -- maybe one thousand feet or so --but the rest of my family remembers it as being higher.  We all say it was 8-9 inches across, as the eye sees the diameter.  I cede to their opinion, because I was the youngest of the group, and my imagination the most vivid.  Although altitude is a debatable point, what is most important is that we all saw the saucer and for a considerable period of time (five minutes plus). Finally, the saucer started to move towards the east, silently, very slowly at first, then gathering tremendous speed.  It left no vapor trail.  Never, in my wildest fantasies, had I ever imagined an object could move so fast.  And most incredible of all, it was silent speed.  (Yes, the river could have muffled quite a bit of noise, but we heard nothing.) After it was gone, my father suggested we all sit.  He was quiet and in control, and led our family discussion about what we saw.  He said the UFO did not fit any aircraft known to earth, unless it was some sort of secret, experimental project.  He absolutely discounted weather balloons, based on the fact that we could all see enough of the top portion of the saucer to accurately judge its total shape.  Besides, my father was not making presumptuous statements; he had been a flight instructor for the B-29 bomber during World War II at Mather Field, California, and after the war he was a flight engineer with Boeing Aircraft Company of Seattle/Renton, Washington.  Furthermore, he was an enthusiastic, leisure pilot, flying often in his spare time.  My father also said that the saucer would reach New York City in twenty minutes (or less?) traveling at its departure speed.  In 1955, nothing from our earth, to my knowledge, could travel that speed. My father made us promise that, (with only a few possible exceptions), we would keep this experience a family secret.  He feared social backlash and loss of his job at Boeing if we reported the sighting.  Usually -- not always -- I managed to keep his rule. After my father died in 1974, I started to speak about the sighting more often.  I still wonder if speaking won&#39;t jeopardize my career as well.  I hope not.<n>
