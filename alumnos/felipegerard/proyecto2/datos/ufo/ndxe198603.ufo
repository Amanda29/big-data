Me and my co-driver, we drive a truck together, were driving south, when we seen a rectangler craft moving southwest to northeast towards Salt Lake. We actually stop the 18-wheeler in the middle of U.S. 93 and got out to look at this thing. As this object is &#34;floating&#34; over us, with no sound or effort, I am looking at my partner&#39;s eyes to make sure he is seeing the same thing that I am. This craft is moving about 400-500 feet above our heads, in the dark we can see that it is a rectangle, but moving wide end first. The narrow end was towards the rear. Two red lights on the front edges, blue to green lights on the rears edges that blocked out star light in the background. We estimated to be about 300 feet across to 600 feet long. It didn&#39;t make a soung as it cruised by at about 20-40 miles per hour. It disapeared over the eastern mountains of Nevada, heading towards Salt Lake/salt flats. We stand there in the middle of the road in disbelief. Just as we are ready to leave 3 minutes later, I took one last look up to see about 30-50 lights that were the size of a satalite as it crosses the sky at night. But, these lights were not in a certain formation or any kind of order. It was like a bunch of ballons moving across the sky. In the same direction these lights moved much faster and were over the range within 1-2 minutes. Then when we finally started to leave, two military jets &#34;buzzed&#34; our rig just before we got into Alamo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3/25/86 07:45|Los Angeles|CA|Triangle|3 minutes|Stationary black triangle over LAX area during crowded morning traffic on highway 405, Los Angles|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64111.html|2|ndxe198603| Stationary black triangle over LAX area during crowded morning traffic on highway 405, Los Angles<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in 1986, and I&#39;ve finally figured it&#39;s time to tell this story after all these years. Because I&#39;ve worked for some law enforcement support companies, I&#39;ve always hesitated to do anything that could have been a “problem” at work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the week around Easter, 1986 in Los Angeles. I was working for a special effects company that mainly worked doing laser EFX for rock tours, motion pictures. Our shop was in W. LA, and I had a job installing a laser system at the Spruce Goose theater in Long Beach, CA. I had been working there every day including the holiday to get the show ready for the grand opening, and with the bad LA traffic at that time, I had to leave the shop very early to make it to Long Beach in time to get in at least 8 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this morning, it would have been about 7-8 a.m. Traffic on the 405 going south was very, very slow, and with lots of stops and starts. I had just passed LAX airport on my right, and was in the area where there were lots of defense contractors such as the huge TRW and Hughes plants. I was in a second from the outside right lane of traffic, and all the cars had come to a stop. I was just glancing around, waiting to get moving again when I happened to look up. I did this a lot in that area as there were many large commercial jets in the area landing at LAX and it was something to do while stalled in traffic. I had heard a plane nearby, and as I looked up, I could see a fairly large, and completely stationary black triangle hovering possibly as much as 500ft over the buildings off to my right. It just hung in the air, as if frozen. There were no lights, noise of any engine, and it was a dark flat black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it was very, very odd, but considering the area that I was in, I considered that it may have been some exotic antenna that was being tested at Hughes, etc. Then it crossed my mind that it would have been very hazardous to have something like that so close to commercial aircraft in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this triangle for maybe 2 minutes, and at one point, the driver in the car next to me was looking at me staring up through my windshield. I looked at him, and motioned with my finger to look up, which he did. He looked directly at this same object for about 30 seconds, then looked back at me and shrugged as if to say, “I don&#39;t know what it is either.”. At this point, traffic started to move again, and I tried to watch for as long as possible at this object, but I quickly had to put my attention to driving again and once I could not see it from my front windshield, I lost view of it. On the trip home that evening, I made a point of slowing down at the same location to take a look, and there was nothing that I could see, however it was dark out by then. Just lots of normal aircraft lights at that time. For the next 4-5 days as I continued on that project, I made a point of looking every time I was in that area, but never have seen the object since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size to me may have been about 50 feet wide, with almost a perfect triangle shape. The thickness was hard to judge, but I would say maybe 5 feet. I looked very closely to see if there was a tether as there were lots of advertising balloons in the area along the 405, but there were none that I could see, however the object&#39;s lack of movement made it appear as if it was tethered. It is windy in that area from the air coming in from the nearby Pacific Ocean. The “point” or nose of this shape would have been pointing NE, about 2 miles south of LAX on the west side of the highway above industrial buildings. I believe there was a wide bend or curve at the point of the highway. I have not seen any object like that before or since that day. It does remind me of the appearance of the stealth aircraft that many of these companies in that area most likely worked on, and I have always had a thought that what I saw that day may have had something to with that, however at that time, those programs were all still very secret I believe. Oh, the sky was clear and blue, and with the morning sun coming up, and not much pollution yet from traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object was as bright as the sun without hurting to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both questioned it immediately, but never reported.  We&#39;ve discussed it once or twice since, but have come to no conclusion as to the identity of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3/15/86 10:30|St. Petersburg|FL||10 minutes|I seen a being made of light in 1986,and never knew what it was.|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09992.html|4|ndxe198603| I seen a being made of light in 1986,and never knew what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1986 (I remember the year because my youngest son was only 6mo.old) I was sitting on my couch watching tv, and it was about 10:30 at night suddenly I felt static electricty pulling my hairs on my arms and neck and felt something was there besides just me. I looked to the left and saw a person made of light or something like it,and you could see right through it and see structures of bones etc, but no eyes,and it said some thing to me but I couldn&#39;t understand what,because it spoke fast to me like a record being played too fast,strangely,I didnt feel afraid  at first,but 10 min.had gone by and then I felt afraid because   it felt like only seconds had passed.So I grabbed my two boys  and went to my ex-husbands house to ask him if I could have the dog for awhile and he said ok, he asked me why and I told him but I dont know if he believed me or not. But after the dog arrived and ever   since I&#39;ve never seen it again.<n>
3/15/86 00:00|Delray Beach|FL|Disk|15 minutes|Saucer with white gassy bottom approaches beachgoers at night and zips in, and zips away...silently.|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81539.html|5|ndxe198603| Saucer with white gassy bottom approaches beachgoers at night and zips in, and zips away...silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend were sitting on the beach outside a Reggae club we liked to go to, it was late at night.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was around Delray Beach.  Either that or somewhere from Ft. Lauderdale to Delray Beach, which was where we hung out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hadn&#39;t been drinking heavily.  We were looking out over the ocean and saw this strange light pretty far off in the sky.  We remarked on how unusual it looked and then we saw it zip around very fast at sharp angles, and come closer to us.   I know this will sound strange but it was as if it had tuned in to our thoughts.  I say this because it zipped pretty close to us and we got a real good look at it from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped kind of like a cake, or maybe a Fedora style hat and where the head-hole would be there was a pearly light but kind of gassy and ethereal is the best way I can describe it.  I say gassy because it was like looking into dry ice at a concert.  We looked at it for a minute up close like that and were talking about how cool it was but not wanting to get excited and scare it away, and another guy, rather drunk, came up behind us and shouted hey what are you looking at, and it zipped away and out of sight.  THERE WAS NO SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so long ago, it&#39;s strange to try to recount.  It is hard to believe it was real.  But it was, I know what I saw.  Me and my friend lost touch a long time ago, but I did see a special on TV once about some UFO&#39;s seen in Florida by many people including law enforcement, like Sarasota or Jupiter Beach or something, and the pictures they showed that the people had taken, some of the pictures were of exactly what we saw.  That&#39;s my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/13/86 18:00|Auckland (New Zealand)||Circle|5 mins|Strange glowing Orb hovering in front of 12 year old boy!!|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15953.html|6|ndxe198603| Strange glowing Orb hovering in front of 12 year old boy!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im 25 years old and Im reporting the strange occurance that happened when I was 12. I was outside on the verandah of my parents villa and was looking up at the sky. It was just starting to get dark and everything seemed quiet all of a sudden. I was saying to myself at the time `It would be interesting to see a UFO!` And then a light came down diagonally from the sky and it hovered right in front of me!Itwas circular and shone like a mini sun. A light yellow/white colour. It also made a hum that you could JUST hear. So there it was hovering over my driveway, I was in awe, tried to shout to my mother who was cooking in the kitchen but no words came out. I freaked, then it started wobbling a little, moved slowly up in a diagonal position, then shot right up into the sky. If it had a pilot, 1 - 2 people could fit inside it. Bizarre!! Either Nasa has some mind boggling technology or...I dont want to think of the other explanation!<n>
3/10/86 00:45|Middle Smithfield Township|PA|Triangle|several minutes|While watching Letterman, I heard and "felt" a low hum. I muted the TV, and could still hear the sound.  I opened the sliding glass doo|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12277.html|7|ndxe198603| While watching Letterman, I heard and &#34;felt&#34; a low hum. I muted the TV, and could still hear the sound.  I opened the sliding glass door, and the sound was definitely coming from outside.  It was a clear night, with a sky full of stars.  The house is in rural PA, so there was no light pollution to contend with.  Standing in the driveway, I scanned the viewable sky and didn&#39;t see anything, but could still hear and feel the hum.  It sounded like the hum was coming from beyond the tree line to the east.  About that time, I noticed the the sky from that direction was becoming &#34;blacked out&#34; (ie the stars were being blocked by an object passing between my line of sight and the sky). The object continued across the sky from east to west, at a slow rate of speed.  As it cleared the tree line, I could clearly see it was triangular in shape, and it continued to block out the stars as it moved directly overhead.  There was a dim glow at each point of the triangle.  I ran inside to get a camera, returned and took several pictures.  None of them developed.  It disappeared over the treeline to the west, and the hum diminished as the object moved further away.  It was a large object, but it was difficult to estimate it&#39;s actual size or distance from the ground.<n>
3/4/86|Marbela (Spain)||Sphere|8 mins|mijas costa spain sphere  8 mins 1986 four of us saw this object ,a clear afternoon|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51758.html|8|ndxe198603| mijas costa spain sphere  8 mins 1986 four of us saw this object ,a clear afternoon<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was a clear day no clouds just blue sky,i was stood in the back garden of a house in the costa del sol area of spain,mijas costa.i was with my wife and a friend, we noticed an object in the sky, it was round like a ball high up in the sky.it was shinny silver, but not a light. the object moved around a vast area ,the craft was large as it was very high up,in praportion about the same as if you through a tennis ball up in the air as far as possible.my frinds husband arrived and said can you see whats in the sky,he had been watching it as well as he came up the road.we all stood looking at the craft for a few more minutes until it moved across and straight up into space.the craft was unlikly to come from man as we could not make something like this,it was seen clearly and had no cover when it left it went straight up untill it could be seen no more. when i returned home to England i went on local radio and explained what we saw.i feel so lucky to have seen it<n>
3/1/86 16:00|Birmingham (UK/England)||Other|a few minutes|One cube and one sphere (one red the other was black) over the Lickey Hills,  stayed equidistant as they travelled in the air.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87458.html|9|ndxe198603| One cube and one sphere (one red the other was black) over the Lickey Hills,  stayed equidistant as they travelled in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two objects, one sphere and one cube were travelling in the sky and remained equidistant from each other as they moved through the air. one was red and one was black but can&#39;t remember which was coloured red and which was black.  The objects appeared to have the same diameter as each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were silent as they moved.  There were no aeroplanes overhead or cars moving on the road at the time.  There were no other people out on the street - as once we had seen these objects we looked around to see if anyone else had spotted them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my boyfriend then (my husband now), we were both dating at the same university college between January 1983 and May 1983 only, which is why we can give an approximate date to the event, despite it being a long time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two objects were silent we first thought it must be a remote control device, however they travelled much too far and would have been out of range of any control device.  We then wondered if they were weather balloons -but a cube and a sphere are unusual shapes and they were not travelling very high in the sky.  They were not as high as an aeroplane.  Despite the sky being our reference point for size we do not think they were as high as where a helicopter would fly either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear, dry pleasant Spring day. We had gone for a walk at Cofton Park and walked back to the street. We were facing the road and opposite the shops/houses with our back to the park.  Behind us to our left was a pub and the car park was behind us.  We noticed the objects diagonally to the right (in the air) as they entered our vision.  The two objects moved from our left to our right.  Their speed remained constant, they stayed the same distant apart from each other as they flew.  They appeared to be a way over the houses opposite, travel above them and moving flew over the wooded Lickey Hills until they went further and further into the distance (almost travelling directly away from us at this point) until they went naturally out of sight over the hills and trees.  They stayed the same height above the ground at all times and were not linked or attached to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood still watching the whole time, it was at least a good few minutes so we got a good look at the sphere and cube.  They did not appear to have any lights or windows, they moved steadily and did not &#39;whizz&#39; by so we observed them continually and talked to each other as we did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they had disappeared we waited awhile - still no one was around.  We returned back to our university college (where our accommodation was) and told our friends this story.  We have since searched it on the internet and often relayed the story or chatted about it with each other.  It was a simple story and we have always agreed the details...two steady flying objects, one sphere and one cube - one plain red and the other plain black!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
