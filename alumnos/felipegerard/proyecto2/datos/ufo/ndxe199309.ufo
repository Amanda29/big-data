It looked like it had energy moving through it. I had only looked at it for about half a minute then it started moving really quick and was going in one direction and then I thought it had changed and shifted in another and was one really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/17/93 22:00|Red Deer (Canada)|AB|Other|1- 2 minutes|Strange shaped object, no sound, no lights, moving slowly about 20 ft off the deck.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37406.html|2|ndxe199309| Strange shaped object, no sound, no lights, moving slowly about 20 ft off the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cool September evening, I positioned my yard lounger, wrapped a quilt around me, and lay down on the lounger in preperation to watch the &#34;metorite&#34; shower as earth went throught the tail of a comet(forgive me for not recalling the exact dates/year or the name of the comet)As I watched the light show I mildly ammused as it was not as good as it had been the year prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, from over my roof top came a dark shape, about 20 feet off the deck/ground, silently and slowly. I can not describe the shape as a disk because it seemed to be more like two disks together one off set from the other, as if one were riding on the other. What startled me was how silent it was and that there were no lights. I always thought UFOs were lighted up and had a hum or something, but this object seemed to absorb the light, only reason I could really see it was the fact that the bottom was not smooth but had various shapes at various levels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up, scared at first then amazed and excited. I moved back into the wall of my house keeping my eyes on the object as it moved slowly (5 mph;a guess) out of my sight passed the roof of the neighbours house. By the time I ran to the street it was well beyond the other houses. There was no tail flame or such as it went out of my sight over the horizon of roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to my west an saw this bright glowing object rising it was very very high up and it apeard as if the object was just glowing a bright orange. It went over head and went down in the East. Then a few seconds later it roase up in the West again and and it roase up untill it was right up above our heads and just stayed there for a few second the started to decend then stopped leveled off the it just shot of untill there was a long streak of light and then it was gone out of sight. My mates and I talked about it for days afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  We do not understand how an object can disappear in the east, and then rise up again in the west.  However, such an event might be explained by the presence of two objects.  PD))<n>
9/15/93 22:00|Fort Worth|TX|Light|2 hours|The flickering object had a smaller object moving in and out of it .|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31994.html|4|ndxe199309| The flickering object had a smaller object moving in and out of it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 9/93 I went outside to enjoy the cool night time surroundings . I lived in Everman at the time and our house faced West towards I.35 . The sky was very clear , and when I looked in the sky I saw a bright light (star like) but brighter . I thought it was a aircraft at first but it never moved . Then all of a sudden it began to move from side to side and moving in an assortment of different angles very quickly . I knew at that time that this was not an airplane nor helicopter , because I worked in the Navy during night and day Aircraft Recovery and refueling . So I&#39;ve seen too many Aircrafts at night to know this was not a commercial or military object . When it began to move , but it stayed in the same location . I went inside my house and got my wife . I told her to come with me outside , that I wanted for her to tell me what she could see in the Sky . She went outside with me and looked in the sky and seen the bright object and it began to move rapidly again . She grabbed me and we both looked at each other in amazement and began to talk about it to one another . After about 30 min. my wife got scared and went inside the house , I stayed outside and watched it move and stop moving . And it also flickered and changed colors , to a red and white flicker . I then noticed another bright object NorthWest of it and it began to flicker as well . And when I looked back at the first object it started to flicker really fast and I started seeing beams of light come from underneath the object and a smaller object moving out of it and then entering back inside . That scared me because it was very vivid , so I ran inside my house . My wife asked me was it still there and I told her Yes , and what it began to do . We both looked out the front window of my house in fear . We went back outside because I had to see this thing again to make sure that it was real . It was still there in the same location and moved very slowly from one angle to another . And than it began to move I thought , but! it would fade out then it would get bright again . It did that for about 10 min. and it faded out completely . This began at 10pm and was over around 12am . My wife and I remember this like it happened just yesterday . We could not go to sleep that night and I called a  local T.V. news  station to see if there were any reports of strange lights in the sky in or about my area . They told me No . But my wife and I know what we saw and it took alot of time for us to calm down . And we also called the Everman P.D. to no avail . We have told no one but my son . We do not like to watch any UFO programs , because it brings back what we saw that night too vivid . And we know in our heart and eyes what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/93 21:00|San Francisco|CA|Circle|3 to 4 minutes|Round shiny object emitting three rows of blue pulsing arc rays.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42476.html|5|ndxe199309| Round shiny object emitting three rows of blue pulsing arc rays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my friend at San Francisco&#39;s Lake Merced while doing some night time fishing. The night was cool and there was some overcast clouds as we were talking and fishing, then I spotted some lights overhead and thought they were coming from hi-beams such as an automobile. I thought they might be police patrol car spotlights (we were not supposed to be fishing at night because the lake was closed after dark) So now we were on the alert and thinking  we would get busted by cops so we remained silent for a minute or two. Then, across from the lake we saw a bright round metal ball about 20 to 25 feet in diameter peek out from behind a tree top, while hovering some 30 to 40 feet above the ground. At first I thought it was a spotlight that someone was projecting onto the trees, but almost simultaneously I realized that there was no attached beam that could be making the spotlight, plus , it was partially obscured by the tree tops. My friend and I looked at eachother and   we could not believe our own eyes! Then, the light slowly went back behind the trees and suddenly was gone. A few moments afterwards, the light appeared directly above the lake (approx. 100 feet or less above the water) but this time the shiny round object was obscured by the overcast clouds/fog but we could still see it shining. The next thing that happened will stay in my memory forever, this thing started emitting three sets of light blue arced pulse-typed  light rays. They were coming down in three rows and when they hit the surface of the water they simultaneously bounced back up through the arc stream for about 10 to 15 seconds and this thing made absolutely no noise. After this , it took off and was gone forever.This event happened 12 years ago but I remember most of the details clearly as if it just happened. After watching Peter Jennings&#39; report on UFO&#39;s two nights ago, I learned of the National UFO Reporting Center and this was my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

9/15/93 20:30|Racine|OH|Light|35 minutes|There was a large number  of lights in the sky flying in geometric patterns.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16443.html|6|ndxe199309| There was a large number  of lights in the sky flying in geometric patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A night in the Fall of &#39;93 my little brother and I were driving on a county road near our home.  I am interested in the stars and as such I glanced up at the sky.  I saw what I believed to be a passenger plane flying west.  A few seconds later I witnessed an additional object flying directly toward the first.  I knew that the distance between the two would be great by differences in altitude.  Still, I watched off and on until they met.  Then amazingly enough, the second light stopped and reversed direction to follow the first.  Immediately, I stopped the car. I rolled down the widow to hear what I figured to be a low flying helicopter.  I heard no sound.  Then, the second light accelerated and began flying circles around the first.  As I watched in awe, the first light continued on its trajectory while the second stopped again.  When I took a wider view of the sky, I discovered not just one object but between thirty and fifty similar sized lights of varying colors.  They all appeared to be flying in what one could determine to be geometrical shapes.  I told my brother to get out and look.  We both stood in amazement for about five minutes watching the aerial display.  Then being only two miles from home and my small telescope, we drove on.  When we got home, we looked up to see if they were still there and discovered another light.  This light was much larger, white, and stationary.  The smaller lights would fly to the larger one, stop, and then resume the geometric ballet.  I went inside to get my telescope and my father.  My father, argueably the most skeptical man in the world, was speechless as he witnessed the show. I tried to get a better look with my telescope, but they only appeared as bright lights. After about a half an hour, they just diappeared.  I realize that this may seem odd to report five years after the event, but I had no idea who to contact until now.  I will not wager a guess as to what we saw but it is deffinately worth reporting. At the time of the event I was seventeen, my br! other tw elve, and my father forty one. I graduated valedictorian of my high school class, played several sports, attended church, and was active in community activities. I&#39;m not sure what is meant by background information but I hope I have given sufficient informatio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We stopped at one point to look down into the valley to look at the lights coming from the music festival that happens every year there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a light coming from farther back into the hills and all noticed how the light neither changed position, nor intensity as it came towards us. It was distant enough that we could not make out any detail as to what it was or its size, but just upon casual observation, it was obvious it was not a car or anyone carrying a light.  I jokingly flashed an SOS at it a few times. Our friend who was driving us around in his truck said he had to go, so he could take his mom to work. So we jumped into his pickup, a Nissan extra-cab, and drove back into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had thought nothing of the incident until my Mom had asked me a number of days later if I had seen the UFO article in the Register newspaper. It described a ball of light some 100-200 feet in diameter, and how it had passed over the Millpond area and the sighting of it by hundreds of people, there was also a contact number in the article (at the end IIRC) for anyone that had anything to say about it, I don&#39;t believe the number was a local one. I believe it is still on microfilm at the local paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As the formation ascended slowly (approx. 10 ft. per second,)the lights contracted. I then noticed a bronze, or orange elliptoid/cigar-shaped craft about 500 ft. above the triangle, rising simultaneously. This craft had a distinct outline and appeared in no way &#39;fuzzy.&#39; As the formation rose the triangle contracted becoming one light without increasing in size. After a few seconds the aqua light disappeared (I believe it accelerated faster than the eye could follow,) reappearing alongside the elliptoid, and having changed shape, as it was now identical in appearance. I followed the now two bronze craft for another ten seconds until the objects vanished into the overcast at approx. 10,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Elevation: 6000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

The sky was blue and there were no clouds in sight. Looked up as we were walking back to my residence and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft...didn&#39;t think to much about it because of the tregectary it seemed like a silver aircraft carrier and as we were in a &#34;military training zone we saw lots of aircraft so no big deal right? The wings would have been practically equal to my line of sight.When an aircraft that big comes into sight it always appears cumbersome and slow so I did not really pay much attention cause the craft from a distance always seem to move slowly because they are so high. Dinn&#39;t think too much about it because I assumed I couldn&#39;t see the wings as they were equal to my line of sight and therefore I would not be able to see the wings. Anywaywe continued to walk and after about 5 minutes the craft as we observed still appeared stationary. This caught my attention and I therefore paid more attention to it...and then I noticed that the under carriage was brighly lit which could not be possible as it was around 3pm and the sun would illuminate the craft to the far side not the under carriage. On closer inspection we realised it had not moved for 5 minutes and that we were actulley getting closer. We were just stunned and did not even consider it to be anything other than a terrestrial craft. Until when we were debating what it was and when we looked up after around 10-15 seconds it had just vanished!<n>

It was about 3am and we were all laying on our backs talking and getting ready to go to sleep.  We had a campfire that was lighting up the canopy of the trees.  There was no wind and the forest was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a small disk shaped object about a foot across and about 10 feet off the ground flew directly over the fire and traveled out of sight in a perfectly strait line.  The only sound it made was a swhoosh as it passed.  It appeared to be metallic and about an inch thick, it had no lights or anything else -- very plain looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other friends saw it too and they were as stunned as I was.  There was no reasonable explanation for it.  The forest was covered in dry leaves and if this thing was thrown, we would have heard it land, not to mention heard the person who threw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving at about 15mph and I was able to see it for about 100 ft before I lost it in the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire was bright and we all got a good look at it, it was a very bizarre event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in September 1993 is approximate.

SO AS I  WALKED OUTSIDE I LOOKED UP, AS I ALWAYS DO IN HOPES OF SEEING A UFO. WELL, ON THAT NIGHT I GOT MY WISH. I SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE ME STOP DEAD IN MY TRACKS. THE OBJECT WAS ONLY ABOUT 30 FT. OVER ME. I NOTICED IT COMING IN FROM THE EAST FLOATING ALONG AT ABOUT 10 TO 15 MPH HEADED WEST. IT WAS WING SHAPED WITH A WING SPAN OF ABOUT 25 FT. AND ABOUT 10 FT. LONG FROM THE TIP TO THE TAIL. THERE WAS A FULL MOON OUT AND THERE WAS A STREET LIGHT ABOUT 20 FT. AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING. IT LIT UP THE UFO ENOUGH TO WHERE I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD A BROWN SHADE TO IT AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COVERED IN SOME KIND OF FUR. IT HAD NO MARKINGS NO LIGHTS AND IT WASN&#39;T MAKING A SOUND. I ALSO NOTICED THAT IT HAD  SOFT, ROUNDED EDGES TO IT, THERE WERE NO SHARP LINES NO SEAMS OR NOTHING ATTACHED TO IT. THE LEADING EDGE HAD A LONG CURVE TO IT WITH NOTHING ELSE ON THE TIP. THE FRONT END LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 6 FT. THICK AND TAPERED DOWN FROM TO THE TAIL. ALONG THE TAIL IT HAD THESE HALF CIRCLE LOOKING APENDAGE&#39;S WHICH WERE ABOUT 2 FT. WIDE AND ABOUT 2 FT. LONG EACH. THEY WERE JOINED SIDE BY SIDE AND RAN ALONG THE ENTIRE END OF THE TAIL. IT FLEW RIGHT OVER MY HOUSE WITH NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MY VIEW. THE UFO DID NOT CHANGE ITS SPEED OR DIRECTION OR MAKE ANY OTHER MOVEMENTS. IT JUST FLOATED ALONG IN A STRAIGHT LINE. I WATCHED IT UNTIL IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER SOME TREES. I WAS TEMPTED TO FOLLOW IT AND MAKE SOME KIND OF NOISE TO SEE IF IT WOULD SOMEHOW REACT BUT I WAS AFRAID TO BECAUSE I COULDN&#39;T TELL IF THIS THING WAS SOME KIND OF CRAFT OR SOME KIND OF LIFEFORM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I COULDN&#39;T SLEEP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. BELOW IS A ROUGH SKETCH OF THE BOTTOM OF WHAT I SAW THAT NIGHT. P.S.

We would walk down a dirt road to the end of the AOA area to watch the planes. We especially enjoyed watching them do touch and goes after dark. This was because the f-16&#39;s had bright green lights on their tail fins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the last night we were in Yuma, we stood on a dirt hill at the end of the base&#39;s runway. It was around 9pm when the last of the fighters took off. This time when they disappeared over the horizon, they never returned. After about 30 minutes of no aircraft activity on the base, we got bored and left. On the way back to the trailer park I just happened to look up to admire the stars. When I looked up, I could only see darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wondered if some clouds had rolled in without us noticing them. So I began to look out past the dark spot to see how far the cloud cover reached. It was at that moment that I noticed there were star visible all around the dark spot in the sky. Confused I began to study the dark spot. It was then that I noticed that the object had a long straight leading edge. I could tell, because the stars above were disappearing under these leading edges at an equal rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a flash. I looked toward the tiny flash and it went off again. It reminded me of an airplane beacon. Next I followed the leading edge of the wing forward until I noticed a tiny white light at the nose. The light was constantly on, just very hard to detect with the naked eye. It looked like all the other stars in the sky. I then followed the leading edge of the wing down the opposite side of the craft. At a great distance away, I spotted another tiny green strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be about 200-400 feet up.  Standing back I looked from one strobe light to the other. Then I followed those lights up to the tiny light in the nose area of the craft. The vehicle was huge. I estimated about a football field’s length from wing tip to wing tip. Perhaps half a football fields length from the back of the craft to the tiny nose light. I couldn&#39;t believe how large the craft was!  The craft moved at a very low rate of speed. It almost seemed to have a hover capability. I stopped walking to listen to see if the object made any noise. I heard a very quite blowing sound. It reminded me of a fighter plan idling on the taxi-way. The exception was that it was barely audible. We watch the craft float slowly over the edge of Yuma and then disappear into the darkness. The whole event took about 3 minutes time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always assumed that this was a military aircraft. I could clearly see the Marine Fighter Base&#39;s air traffic control tower from where I was at the time. I figured if I could see the tower, then the tower could see the object. Since there was no activity on the base at the time, I figured they knew about it. A military fighter base wouldn&#39;t let such a large object float past the end of their runway and do nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then last year I was listening to the Art Bell show on Coast to Coast Am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that show a guest called in from Arizona. The guest exactly described the same craft that I had seen. This brought up the whole discussion of the famous &#34;Arizona Lights.&#34; After hearing several stories about this large triangle type craft I decided to contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this a military craft being secretly tested at night? What is your take on this incident?  Ps. I am an air show fan and love all sorts of military aircraft. I&#39;ve seen a lot of planes in action, but nothing I&#39;ve ever seen or heard came close to this craft and it capabilities...<n>

( it was white, no plates, 1 black window on the side) it was approx 1000 feet ahead. as we approached it started to drive off( making no noise even though the path was covered w/ leaves) we rounded a corner and lost view of it for approx 10 seconds when we came around the corner it was gone. the path about 10&#39; wide at the location of the van but either end of the path was WAY TO NARROW for the van to exit the woods.  and the ground was muddy where the van was driving off to but there were no tracks. i was never a ufo believer ultil these 2 days. i am a scientist by heart and practice. I am an environmental biology student, and i think totaly logicaly, and i try and find a reason for everything. but what is saw defies all reasonable explinations. if i heard this report from anyone else i wouldnt believe it but i actually saw it. ill keep my friends name confidential but he can corroberate everything we saw. hope this report helps.  i heard u on artbell saying u could report sightings that happened in the past so i did.<n>
9/10/93 20:30|Phoenix|AZ|Rectangle|1 minute|A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird....|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65535.html|21|ndxe199309| A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird....<n> <n><n> <n><n> this happened when Iwas ten years old and around sept. 10th 1993. It was after dark on apartly cloudy night with the moon out there was no other aircaft around and the weather was good. Every Friday evening my Mom and I would walk around the school I was going to for fun Etc. on the way back about half a block from my house I was looking down and was about 7 feet behind my mom  Out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashes on the ground right in front of me. the best way to describe this light is it looks like the light you would see at the bottom of a pool with the water moving kinda like bubbles but not kinda like electricity, but not very weird but pretty I guess you could say the light had no noise to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once is saw the light i looked up to the sky and there happened to be a opening in the clouds that was a good 2 to 3 miles wide. there was a very large cloud behind me, but I saw nothing. I began to think it was so funny lightining or something like that. At this point I ask my mom did you see that she said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time we both lookedagain to see anything one more time and out of the cloud comes a very very very large rectangle object at a very fast speed going west tored Luke Air Force Base about 7 miles west of where I am at. I lost track of it in the clouds about ten seconds after I saw it, but in those ten seconds it was proable 7 miles away already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Clouds that night where about normal alttuide and like I said earlier the opening was about 2 to 3 miles long and about a mile wide this object was bigger then the opening in the clouds I want to say it was 12 to 15 aircarft carries long and 6 to 8 wide it was HUGH. The object had a ton of lights on it all over the place they could have been in a pattern , but it went by so fast and unexpectedly was unable to see that. The one thing I did notice was the back end of the object, the back end was all white/blue lights kinda like a rocket area or where the engines are at. The object looked to have a blueish silver metal on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise at all and did not displace a cloud that was the weirdest part of all for something that big, that fast, and with what looked simalur to rockets on back that was just not right. I have been a beleaver ever since. I have never seen or heard of anyhting like this ever again. also to note for the next hour after seening this my eyes were burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> if you have any questions please contact me thanks  P.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw the Phoenix lights and those in any way where not flares, even if they were there not going to do any military trainning where they were at becasue it was over a Indain resrevion and that test area they were talking about its near yuma Arizona 95 miles south west of Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

So we went inside and came back out shortly after to check again this time it had looked like it had moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we kept watching it.  It then started moving in zigzag movements very fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called friends to see if they could see it but they could not see it from where they were in the city and said there was too much of a haze in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started video taping it and watching around the sky we then noticed that there seemed to be many other dimmer smaller lights around 10-15 around it that looked like stars but all of they were moving around in similar movements like the big one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we seen a object that looked like a tube shoot across the sky leaving a sort of redish trail and then looked like it burst into flames and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat in the car in front of the house watching this go on for an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden my brother looked out his window and coming from over top of his house and right over top of us is what we thought was a helicopter at first but it made no sound and then when it flew over us it was about 50 feet in the air and looked like nothing I&#39;ve seen before.  I didn&#39;t get a very good look at it except for the back which was big and triangle shaped and had three big red lights in a triangle on the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a matter of 5 seconds of trying to get my phone out and getting video turned on it had shot off and I just caught the back end of it in the distance leaving.  My brother was taping when it first flew over but right when he turned to look at it with video.  His phone then shut off.  When he turned it back on it still had 20% battery and shut off for no reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed red beacon type lights around the trailer park about 6 we found when we went driving around they were about 15 feet high and flashing in a weird manner and really bright (to bright and short to be airplane signal towers) when we! tried to find them and get close they would not be where we seen them its like they would just disappear.  I took a picture of one of them to show height and brightness of one.  I seen something unexplainable in the picture.  It was what looks like a big gold ship that&#39;s hovering right beside the beacon you can only see the front of it cause of a street light that seems to be revealing it.  But you can also see a bit of the side of it and see what looks like a wing faintly in the darkness the gold &#34;ship&#34; must be atleast 60t high.  It goes up higher than I can catch in the picture.  We could not see it in when we were just driving around looking for the beacons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to my brother&#39;s and went inside cause the fog was way to thick to see much else you could not see the moon at all and the fog was hovering 10 feet above the ground.  Just sitting still.  We sat inside in awe from everything we just encountered but of course just second guessed ourselves if we actually just seen what we did.<n>

I saw three yellow lights hovering for a second or two, then shoot south over downtown Seattle at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Will never forget that smell (Corona) from the intense energy<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was at tree top level gliding alongside the highway as my wife and i drove<n>

I was watching a medium sized bright yellowish star moving slowly in a straight line from East to West directly overhead and was trying to determine if it was a plane.  It appeared to be as far away as the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked ((female name deleted)) to look and we both watched as the star, just a steady bright light with no blinking, made a perfect right-angle turn towards the North with no deceleration whatsoever, travelled for around 10 seconds in a straight line Northward, and then made another right-angle turn Westward, travelled in a straight line Westward for 5 seconds and then accelerated and zoomed towards and over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did we see sparks or any sort of trail like a meteor would make.  It was just a yellowish star doing something I couldn&#39;t since find any way of explaining.<n>

Also, I was quite young at the time (I&#39;m 21 now), and the accuracy of this report may seem questionable because of it, but in order to prevent any distortion of the facts the relevant information of this event was previously logged by me, and this record rather than my memory is the source of this account. It started at my friend&#39;s house, who&#39;s backyard connects to a back street adjacent to some train tracks, beyond which are mostly more train tracks, the Bethlehem Steel Plant, and then Lake Erie, so the view of the area above the lake was relatively unobstructed. I was in his yard with him and his two younger siblings, and just suggested that we go look for UFOs. This would seem more unusual if you didn&#39;t take my age into account, but it was the first time I&#39;d ever made such a suggestion. I had a small pair of binoculars with me, and we began to search the skies. It was around 7 or 8 pm, and the sun was about to go down, so there was still some light. Almost immediately, I spotted something in the sky directly above. It appeared to be a satellite to me, with blinking lights that flashed in a triangular formation. This was evident as the second flash would blink next to the first, and the third would blink behind the other two. This was rather uninteresting to us, so we headed out into his back yard looking Westward over the lake. It was probably 20 minutes when I spotted something moving South. It looked like many of the other planes we had seen going back and forth, but a bit slower, and I watched it since there was nothing else in the sky to watch. After a minute or so, this got boring to me, and I began to search the other areas of the sky. When I looked back to where I would have expected the light to be, I couldn&#39;t find it. Instead, I saw a large (compared to the original light) colorful, seemingly swirling ball of light sitting motionless over the top of the steel plant. I wondered about it, but then decided that it was probably there all along, just some light in the steel plant parking lot that just looks weird. I searched the skies again, and looked back after a minute or so. The ball was gone, but the smaller light was back, moving along it&#39;s original course. As we watched it, for now we were more curious about it, it seemed to be slowing down. When it appeared to have stopped, it soon became obvious that in fact it had turned and was headed in our direction. Through the binoculars, it appeared to be saucer shaped, with a flat bottom, thin edges, and a bulge in the middle. As it drew nearer, it began slowly to turn towards the North. It gradually came almost directly overhead, at which point we could see that it was triangular in shape. In each corner was a round, flat light, each of a different color. What these colors were, I forget, but they were plain bright colors (I&#39;m pretty sure one was red, the others may have been blue, green, or yellow). Also, the craft was being followed by 2 others just like it. They moved extremely slowly, and made no sound. This made it hard to determine it&#39;s size, but I was under the impression that they were approximately as long as a passenger jet. Through the binoculars, the back end of them seemed hazy as if intense heat was being discharged. They continued a smooth turn and headed back towards the lake. A group of helicopters appeared from around the mainland and chased the crafts out over the lake.<n>
