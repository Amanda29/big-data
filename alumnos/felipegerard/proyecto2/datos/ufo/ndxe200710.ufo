I am a 23-year-old male and I am a student.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my apartment to go study on campus when a fast moving cluster of lights caught my attention.  This was at 21:55 O&#39;clock.  There were no clouds at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving from North to South.  It caught my attention because of how fast it was moving, which at first was in a straight line, but kept my attention because it started making very sharp, random turns.  All of the turns were very immediate, with no time spent changing directions.  Although the overall movement of the craft stayed north to South, its zigzags were alternating east and west.  It also appeared to be moving at a constant velocity during these turns, until I lost sight of it a few seconds later.  The speed was faster than a commercial jet that was also in the sky and was constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The parts of the craft that were visible to me were the three faint white lights.  These lights did not change intensity, color, or position relative to me during its flight.  As the craft made its zigzags, the three lights stayed in the same orientation, but the craft was translated east and west.  The outer border of the craft was at times visible, but I&#39;m not sure if it was a circle or a triangle.  The lights however were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its size appeared to be smaller than an airplane, but I could not be sure of its altitude.  The only other information that I have is that as I lost sight of it, the lights got dimmer.  I&#39;m not sure if it was gaining altitude or not because the lights were already close together and dim, so to me they just got dimmer.<n>

I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or satallite because it wasn&#39;t moving fast or blinking. One was coming in a diagonal direction from the west the other from the east. I got my bionoculares and telescope to look at it up close. When I looked at the objects in both the telescope and bionoculars in focus and up close at the 2 ufo&#39;s, but when I directly looked at it through the telescope and bionoculars I could only see a unidentified fly object absolutely surrounded by a green-ish fog or laser type of thing and a bright light following them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire 1 hour time peroid every single dog in the entire neighborhood were barking like mad and growling angerily constantly I could her it from inside my house.

10/31/07 20:50|Colorado Springs|CO|Disk|2 Min|A saucer, flying only about 50 feet in the air, right above the middle of Colorado Springs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59555.html|4|ndxe200710| A saucer, flying only about 50 feet in the air, right above the middle of Colorado Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never believed in the existence of UFOs until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday, at about 8:50 PM, I was driving eastbound on Academy Boulevard (this is a major road of Colorado Springs, and goes right through the middle of the city), when I saw a few lights floating above a shopping center right next to the road. I was traveling about 35-40 mph at this time and got closer to it quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds, I realized that the lights all belonged to the same object, and were then slowly moving above Academy, only about 50 feet in the air. It came at an angle towards me (or perhaps I was just moving towards it faster than I thought), and for about five seconds, it was close enough for me to see the details of it. It was the classic saucer shape, with maybe 6-8 white lights around the circular base of it, and one white light at the top. The top, however, was pointed as if a large cone were placed on the top of the main saucer part. It was dark, but I&#39;m fairly certain that the UFO was black or dark grey, and probably the equivalent of 2 or 3 cars in total mass. After about five seconds of it floating only about 50 feet away from me, it banked and did a u-turn, flying away at a much higher speed than it had been before (although it was impossible to estimate the speed at night in those conditions, its accelaration was definately much more than a helicopter could have managed). I saw the lights of it for a few seconds more, then lost it within the glow of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that there were many more witnesses (it was a busy city street, after all) and there should be more reports on the same saucer. Yes, this did happen on halloween night, and I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if I hadn&#39;t seen it so clearly (it may as well have landed and let me walk up and touch it), but it was very frightening because of what I might have just witnessed. Technology like that that we don&#39;t know about scares me and makes me wonder what else the government has in terms of power. I still don&#39;t believe it was extraterrestrial, because the statistical chances of that are improbable almost to the point of impossibility, but the fact that it exists at all is fairly horrifying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

It then slowed down at times and sometimes would appeared that it jolted backwards for a second... It slowly moved into the clouds...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that there was no jet in front of the &#34;jet smoke&#34;. This sighting happened at about 7:25 AM.

10/31/07 03:00|Middle Island|NY|Fireball|2 seconds|Incredibly huge fireball with ion trail and slight alteration of trajectory.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD))|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59669.html|6|ndxe200710| Incredibly huge fireball with ion trail and slight alteration of trajectory<n> <n><n> <n><n> We recently went stargazing on a sod field adjacent to Prosser Pines in the Middle Island area. While driving back from the area North towards Middle Country Road, we witnessed an utterly incredible fireball. It was far, far bigger than a normal shooting star (we had been watching the Orionids earlier in the month) and it&#39;s diameter was similar to that of the full moon. It appeared to be moving in an East to West motion diagonally towards the Earth, we witnessed it cover an area similar in width to the constellation Taurus. It did not however move in a straight line, it abruptly moved downwards slightly halfway through it&#39;s streak, as if it&#39;s trajectory had been abruptly altered (The best way I can explain it is picture drawing a straight line, then someone nudges your hand and your straight line is altered and continues in a different path) Because of this I believe it was &#39;close&#39;, at least far closer than a normal shooting star. It&#39;s motion was not similar to that of a normal shooting star. It was incredibly bright yellowish-green. It&#39;s peak brightness was comparable to an orange streetlight, it had to have been greater than -5 magnitude. It&#39;s movement appeared natural and not machine or human like. It lasted for about a second, with an ionization (?) trail lasting an additional second. It&#39;s motion was beautiful. It appeared perhaps 30 degrees above the horizon and disappeared perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon. We had been impressed with alot of what we saw in our telescope that night but this fireball made me and a friend resoundingly yell out in amazement. It looked like something that actually could have impacted on the Earth but we heard or saw nothing else past this. My roomate heard my tale of this fireball and attests he saw a similar phenomenon driving home from Riverhead in the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??

She was asleep in the car. As soon as I drove up to the house I looked to the back side of the house because this huge bright green fire trail appeared out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this type of U.F.O. before with my girlfriend, but never has it been this low and describable. When I had seen it before, about a year ago but in the same town, it was very high up in the night sky. The trail was too far away to see as flames. I realize that it actually traveled the exact same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is absolutely no way that this was some meteorite falling out of the sky. It&#39;s path and trail was so defined and visually unique. Holding my thumb and pointer finger to my eye, it was an inch thick, and the trail was a good 4-5 inches long. It looked like flames reaching outward for oxygen. It didn&#39;t trickle off into other colors. It&#39;s integrity remained the same the entire time it was in my line of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It almost seemed to take off from the vast wooded area. Not a vertical lift at all, but coming from a slight angle and never curving away. It stayed straight in it&#39;s path with it&#39;s long bright green fire trail escaping further view over the distant trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to note that I am near a military airport, Stewart International. I was unable to see the source which created the trail. It was too dark to see anything other than the green fire trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD))<n>

I spotted it again tonight and it is a bit fainter maybe magnitude 3 now also more dispersed.  Look in the East (just North of East really) find Cassiopeia  above the area Capella, the brightest star in the East, below and the seven sisters (Plieades - a little tiny dipper) to the South, in the middle between all those is an equilateral triangle of close to the same magnitude stars -the fuzzy dirtball is on the lower left- obviously hazy through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just witnessed my first UFOs these two lights passed near the comet at an apparent altitude similar to the ISS/Space-Shuttle (which I saw a couple nights ago) silent, orange color points of light and chasing, slowing, speeding, passing- speeds that ranged from faster than ISS to full stopped on a dime and then 90 degree instant turns East and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unlike any heavenly body not even meteors move like this.  Human&#39;s Jets could not move with such speed especially in the turning, no Earthly flight technology can slow down like these did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot rule out plasmas but plasma still has to follow the rules of physics regarding inertia, energy conservation and acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed these with my binoculars for perhaps half to three-fourths of a minute.  The initial direction was South out of Perseus away from the comet when I first noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for these 2 things.<n>

The site I chose to set up my camp was right on the southern limit of the camping area so there was no obstruction to view other than cacti.  Several times each week and always at night I would see a large, right triangle shaped object at some distance.  It sported three red lights and emitted a low humming noise and move slowly.  This puzzled me for aircraft do not sport position lights in that configuration.  On fixed wing aircraft they are red on the left wing and green on the right one with a white anti-collision light mounted on top of and to the rear of the vertical stabilizer (tail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging the size of the object, distance from my location and its altitude was difficult as I had no point of reference.  It could have been a mile or two away or it could have been 20 or more miles distant.  Depending on the distance the object could have been 400 feet in length at the closer distance or much, much larger at the farther distance.  However, it seemed to be below 1000 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I paid little attention to it as I assumed it was military due to it&#39;s location, for south of where I was camping is the large Yuma Proving Grounds of the U.S. Army.  Logic said secret military aircraft but after years of hearing reports of UFOs being triangular in shape and having an associated humming noise, I&#39;m inclined to think that what I saw was something unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it a UFO?  Yes, positively!  I could not identify it and was therefore unknown and it was flying and it was an object.  Was it military?  Possibly.  Was it other worldly?  One might have suspicion of such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was I hallucinating? No.  Was I under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  No.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eschew the former and seldom imbibe of the latter.  Am I flighty of nature and imagination?  No.  I am a former high school teacher plus I hold a commercial pilot license and am a certified flight instructor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, what did I see?  Good question!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought maybe it was a satellite burning up falling to earth, but then it just started to move north again like nothing had happened. I told my brother about this, and he said, “ oh I have seen that thing before” that’s all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both observed the same thing, a light that was getting brighter as time went on and then went dim. We both agreed that it did not appear to be in our atmosphere, it was not tracking or moving in any direction across the sky but appeared to be coming right at us. We stayed outside for another 5 minutes observing the area around us and did not see any other lights other than the occasional aircraft that we see every night. This event has really scared my friend, as she could not understand what it was or how to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing north-northeast and the object appeared to be at about 70° in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about the size of a dime and most likely 2 or more miles away from me. (Based on the distance of the mountain it went behind)  It was completely and precisely circular with a green glow. Inside the circle was a thick band of white glowing light. It had no tail of any sort and was not blurry; even at the speed it was going. There were no flashing lights of any kind. When I saw the object, it was dusk. The sky was not yet black. The object caught my eye and stood out due to the speed and the odd green glow that it had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was moving quickly, I was able to track it, follow it and get a clear picture in my mind of the object. It moved steadily and in a straight line across the sky. The object crossed the sky in about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The plane had two black smoke trails, &#34;very thin&#34; and it was also had two to three lights, one on each wing and maybe one underneath the head of the plane. As i got closer to my apt. complex, I noticed one of those long helicopters with the one propellers on each end of it which must have already been in the vicinity that seemed to be interacting with what I perceived to be a ufo. As soon as i notice the helicopter and the ufo right near each other the military plane that i saw coming towards the area when i was exiting the freeway was  clearly flying over my apt. complex then made a very sharp curve behind the disc which was not moving at all, suspended in mid-air as was the helicopter about one hundred feet to the left of the ufo which was only about 200 to 300 feet above the ground directly over the complex. It was in plan view, nothing was obstructing my view at all at this point. I really dont know if anyone else paying attention  but there were people in the area outside in the location. I was so excitied that i did not stop to stare at it because i was trying to hurry and get in the house to get my wife and bring her out to witness what i had seen. But unfortunatley to say by the time we came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our building is at the end of a street named Goddard and right behind us are hills and some wilderness. I was out back talking on my cellphone and having a cigarette, just as I finished my phone call I happened to look up at a passing jet airliner. John Wayne Airport isn&#39;t too far away, so we see alot of air traffic. Well, as I was observing the jet, another object moved into view. What caught my eye was the sun reflecting off it&#39;s surface. At first I thought it was a weather balloon, as it was translucent in nature. It was a solid shape at first, like an aspirin. Then it lost it&#39;s shape and became unstable and undulated along. It did this for a moment, and then became a sphere, then going back to undulating. I watched it sharply and then it just disappeared. I&#39;m not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I know what I saw. Also, I should mention a few other details such as it&#39;s size. While at first appearing small, the jet passed right underneath it. The jet was pretty high up there, so this thing must have been about 1/6 the size of the aircraft. Even though it was translucent, I did notice that whenever the sunlight reflected off it&#39;s surface, the material briefly became dark and metallic. Also, the object was coming from the direction of the hills behind us (west) and was heading east towards Santiago Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first i thought it was a shadow or something but when i saw the planes,and traffic hellicopters flying near it,i knew it was not a shadow. At one point it looked like it changed shape from a circle to a shape of a top hat. I tried to figure out the size of it as i saw a few jet planes flying in its direction you could fit at least 3 of those jets together just for the width,and it would not cover the whole thing.After about 8 minutes of whatching this, the black mass started to move away,and this time at a steady flow forward heading west into the sky line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the parking lot of the Table Rock General Store, just a few miles from Table Rock Mountain itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us were visiting a friend who lives nearby and had stopped to check out of the motel beside the store.  The woman who works in the store was outside, pointing her camera phone at the sky. She kept saying, “They have no wings and no jet stream (contrail).”  I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw a metal aircraft of some type making steady progress, headed in a southwesterly direction. I could not see any sign of wings or any suggestion of a tail. The shape was long, as large as a commercial jetliner or even a C-130, rather cigar shaped, but somewhat wider at the front end and tapering toward the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wondered if it could be a blimp, but it was not blimp-shaped. It also moved steadily forward at what easily could have been several hundred miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The body was metal, looking like aluminum glinting in the sun. As we stood there, another of the same aircraft came into view, moving in the same flight pattern as the first and at what looked like the same speed. We watched for probably 15 minutes, during which time the first craft moved beyond our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was easy to see because the sky was deep blue and totally cloudless. It was hard to estimate how big they were, but from that distance, they looked about 3/8” long if I’d held up my fingers to measure one from front to back at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman at the store said she had seen five of them the day before, flying in formation. I believe she said they appeared to be escorted by helicopters, but I may be mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our curiosity was piqued, to say the least, but we thought a simple call to Air Traffic Control at the Greenville, SC, airport would reveal what they were. Due to their direction in which they were traveling, they surely would have shown up on the radar there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the friend we were visiting said she called, but the airport radar had picked up nothing that sounded like what we’d seen. She was referred to several other agencies, including the FAA, and finally to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and the friend who were visiting are both retired newspaper reporters, with more than 30 years of experience each. The friend we were visiting is also a longtime journalist. We all had worked together at the same large (and very reputable) newspaper in North Carolina. But our friend is somewhat handicapped and by the time she got out of the car to take a look, the aircraft had moved out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third witness is the woman who works in the store. I don&#39;t know her background but she seemed to be a very no-nonsense kind of person.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be too slim and was moving too fast for a dirigible, yet did not appear to be moving as fast as a jet plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting was brief before it became blocked by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The motel owner said she had spotted similar objects, flying in a group, only two days before.  Since this was in daytime, we spotted no lights on the object, but it appeared to be reflecting sunlight. We heard no sound.<n>

I was one of four grandmotherly women at a rural gas station at the foot of Table Rock Mountain in Pickens Co., SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of the women -- both retired newspaper reporters -- were talking at the gas pump with the woman who runs the store, when she suddenly pointed into the sky and all observed what they said were (at least) two cigar -- or tube-shaped wingless, exhaustless, noiseless aircraft crossing the sky overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am severly crippled so by the time I got out of the car to look, the things had passed over and were hidden by trees.  It was not clear how many there were, as one of the women saw only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The store owner said that two days before, on a Sunday, she had seen five such objects go over, in formation, and two army-type helicopters seemed to be either accompanying them or trying to intercept them.  But they were fast and soon disappeared over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the women, an experienced news photographer, tried to photograph them but the extreme brightness of the sky and their high altitude made it impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this sighting to the FAA in Atlanta, the RADAR room at the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport and the Flight Standards Office in Columbia, SC, where I was directed to you.<n>

I looked off to the northeast – towards Scott County – and saw a round shape with bright lights of Red, Blue, and white. The lights went all around the object and sometimes seemed to be steady and at other times seemed to strobe or even rotate around the object. The object also had at least four straight extensions coming off of it and running underneath the main object. The extensions were also lighted. The object sat perfectly still. I got my daughter to come look at it. She thought it was a Police Helicopter, mainly because of the red and blue lights. The object was way too high to be a Helicopter and the area it was hovering over would have been very rural. My daughter went back inside. I continued to watch. We do not have binoculars, so I went inside to get my daughter’s Digital Camera that has Zoom capabilities and thought that might help. When I returned to the balcony, the object was still there but then there was a second object much closer and much larger. It was more of a perfectly shaped orange ball and almost appeared to be “sitting” on a house off in the distance. I called for my daughter again and she thought it was a full moon. I did not think that was the case because it was too orange and I don’t recall ever seeing a full moon in that spot before. This morning I looked at the Naval Observatory’s Web Site and according to it there was no full moon last night, it should have been a “Last Quarter” moon.  My daughter told me that I had watched one too many X-Files and that she was sure it was a Police Helicopter and a Full Moon.  While I do not know what either object was, I do not believe they were those things, and my daughter who was so sure of herself was too “scared” by what she saw to sleep in her room downstairs last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??

Craft also did not have any strobes, just three white lights.

If you were to hold your hand out in front of your face at arms length the distance would be about 3 inches between fingertips. It then dimmed and continued moving a little slower for another 20 seconds when it faded away.  I&#39;ve seen dozens of similar sightings, lights that form out of nowhere in the night sky and either remain motionless or move very slowly across the sky before fading away. This was the brightest and longest lasting so far.  Definately not a meteore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Subjects stated that they thought it was a very strange object and had pulled off the road to see if they could spot it again. They also stated that they could hear no type of noise at all, as from an aircraft.  Afterwards subjects stated that within 5 minutes of their sighting a group of 3 Military style helicopters were flying tin the same direction of the object.

This was very strange to me, because there was nothing in front of the exhaust to explain their appearance. They were appearing in strait lines and horizontal from each other from behind the hill. As far as I could tell, they were just appearing without logical explanation. I had never seen anything like it before. The trails were, like the exhaust you would see from an old steam engine’s smoke stack. (puff, puff, puff) They were appearing all at the same time (five at a time) in a straight across pattern, appearing about every half a second or so, going upward at about a 45º angle, to the left. Not like a jet trail would leave behind it, in a (V) shape. The trails of exhaust didn’t appear quickly, rather slow in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the trails, my camera was in the car trunk. I pulled over as soon as I could to get the camera. Before I had a chance to pull over, a shiny cigar shaped object appeared in front and center, of these exhaust trails for a split second and it was gone in a bright flash of light and the exhaust trails just stopped. The trails were quite far away, if I had to guess how far I would say about 1 to 1-1/4 miles or so, and the cigar shaped UFO, compared to the trees at the top of the hill, looked to be about the size of a school bus maybe bigger. From the time that I first saw the trails till the time of the flash it was about 6 or 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I could pull over to get my camera the remains of the trails had started to dissipate and are not as sharp in the photo as when I first saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As close as I can tell from my research, the object was coming from the valley east of the small town of Monte Nido, California , near Piuma Rd. Note: The Valley is called Dark Canyon…  As a young child and as a young adult I have also seen other things in the sky but, to me, I have always been able to dismiss these other sightings with some kind of rational explanation, (weather balloons, shiny silver planes at sun rise or other things...) but not this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached the photo and some Google Earth images to calibrate the location. My photo and the Google Earth photo image are as close to the same location as I could get Google earth to get me there. I have also included several Google Earth, &#34;top down shots&#34; of the valley, were I think that the UFO took off from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first top down is from the opposite direction of the original shot and shows were the picture was taken from, the second one shows an area (to the best of my calculations) the place were the UFO took off from. In this area you will notice some buildings and some other objects that are of interest. First you will see a large area at the top of one of the hills near the buildings that has been whited out (by Google) or covered with a white covering of some sort. (Not sure) Also you see a circular shape that is very large and has some interesting shadows around it. I don’t think that this is a pool, maybe a horse corral. Maybe it is a large door or cover of some sort. Your guess is as good as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all the UFO stuff that is surfacing I thought that I should send in this shot.<n>

It was quite high and still quite large considering how high in altitude it was. At first glance I thought it was an enormous bird based upon how it seemed to be gliding through the air. However upon further inspection I noticed that it was actually shiny and highly reflective. It moved at a fairly consistent pace, and it moved fairly quickly although slow enough that I was able to run into another room (to get a better view out of our sliding glass door) and it was still there. Again, it seemed to be gliding, but definitely not decending or falling. It went behind the large number trees in our neighborhood, and I was unable to see what happened to it from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before it went behind the trees there was a helicopter in the air which passed near it (although the helicopter was quite a bit lower in the air, it passed in the same vicinity...almost right under the object). I didn&#39;t get a good look at the helicopter so I don&#39;t have a description other than it was definitely dark in color. I was mostly transfixed on the other object. We do get a lot of hospital trauma helicopters flying over our house from time to time as we live on the edge of town, so the helicopter didn&#39;t strike me as unusual at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 30 year old woman and I have never seen anything like this object before in my life.  I have seen large weather balloons gliding high in the sky and I can tell you this looked nothing like a weather balloon. It was jet black with a highly reflective surface. It appeared oval in shape and moved at a medium, consistent speed. I heard no noise from it...although the approaching helicopter could have drowned out any sounds. It was a crystal clear sky, with little to no clouds and no haze or fog. And I no, I had not been drinking. :)<n>

This red light slowly pulsed (faded in and out) 3 times, then paused, then 3 times again, over and over.  It abruptly changed course twice, I estimate about 60 to 80 degree course change each time.  I was in my car stopped at a stop sign, and I rolled my window down but I could not hear any helicopter or plane noises.  It simply floated out of my view over the horizon.  It moved roughly at the same speed a traffic helicopter might move.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 4:45 am and I was going home to get into my work clothes and go to work.  I noticed it because it was so unbelievably bright I’m talking if you were on the road that night or morning you seen this darn light if looking into the sky.  I also started to notice that it sort of changed colors a bit maybe wrote it off as a satellite or planet until I noticed that it didn’t move at all just kind of hovering in one spot.  Other people observed this event as well, my friend/coworker called me today (Tuesday) and was telling me he had caught this strange light in the sky Sunday night on video.  He is going to school for film and graphics design I think, so he really knows what he’s doing when it comes to filming.  As I was sitting in my car waiting for my boss to arrive to work (I work at a local retail store) I kept watching the light.  It appeared to me that it was sparkling or possibly blinking the main color was white but it was entirely too bright and large to be a star.  I also heard another opinion from the same coworker that documented the experience, that it looked as if it held some form of being he described it as an “angel”.  I wouldn’t go as far as to report this if I thought it was a star/planet/gas/or aircraft so I’m asking for a possible explanation as I think this was possibly something from out of this world. Another worthy mention would be that my manager also seen the light and had noticed it on her way to work as well and we sat there outside of work to stare at it for a moment it was quite odd. It didn’t move at all almost as if it was just hovering or watching over us.  The best way I can describe it is a large obviously strange bright object sitting out of place in the sky and it sometimes changed colors even said to look as if it was housing or transporting a being or extraterrestrial being if you will. I got the feeling I was being watched quite an interesting unexpl! ainable experience. That’s all I can really say, thanks for anyone who takes interest in this true, even documented event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting.  PD))<n>

PD))|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59519.html|36|ndxe200710| Very brilliant white light over northern Delaware, hovering for an hour and then shot upward into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up around 4:20am because I was having trouble sleeping.  I was in my living room, sleeping near sliding doors and it was a very clear night.  I looked up a star chart just so I wouldn&#39;t make a mistake here.  Facing south/southeast, about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, a very bright white light was hovering over the tree line.  It almost looked like the northern star, but was 100 times more brilliant.  The object was far off in the distant, but after observing it for about 20-25 minutes, it made a very slow, controlled movement toward the south (left to right), not by much.  Very very small, slow movements.  The object continued to hover for about 50-60 minutes.  My wife came out of the bedroom, because she claimed she could not sleep either.  She observed it as well, and as a science teacher, she was curious also.  After about an hour, the object took a straight upward, controlled increase in elevation, starting out very slow and then increasing upward at a faster rate of speed, until object lost site into the stratosphere and further upward into what appeared to be outer space.  Object was looked for throughout the early morning hours and the next evening, but was not seen again.  I think it&#39;s safe to say this wasn&#39;t a weather balloon or meteor; military!  I also might note that there is a local airport with very little traffic nearby, however, this airport also houses military aircraft for soldier transports, usually to and from Iraq.

It did not come straight down, but rather at an angle.  There was no tail to it.  There was no beam leading to it like from a search light.  It was not transparent.  It was as though there was a pulsing to it around the outside edge of it.  From my vantage point it looked as big as a fifty cent piece.  It came down more than half a mile away.  I can not say if it came down on my side of the mountain or the other side since my view was obstructed.    The state police say no one reported anything.  I need to know if anyone else saw this.  I would like to know exactly where it came down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/28/07 21:30|Nacogdoches|TX|Chevron|Brief|Grey "V" shaped object flying with a low hum - Shorted out stoplights and lights|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59967.html|38|ndxe200710| Grey &#34;V&#34; shaped object flying with a low hum - Shorted out stoplights and lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 28, 2007 in Nacogdoches, Texas four of us witnessed an unidentifiable object around 9:30pm (21:30) fly between two grey clouds.  There were bright grey clouds outlined by a dark sky behind it. Me and two of my fraternity brothers were just coming out of a meeting and heard a low hum growing louder and closer.  All of us looked up expecting to see an incoming plane way off in the distance but in between two grey clouds there was about a 100 yard gap of black sky clearly outlined by the clouds (directly above us).  Then we saw a “V” shaped object with a smooth rounded bottom the same color as the clouds traveling south at a pretty high rate of speed.  It looked about as large as a passenger plane does from that high up.  It looked almost like a grey hang glider with a very low hum sound being emitted.  After we stopped and talked about what we just saw, we went home and every stop light on North Street was not on, not even the emergency blinking lights and there were police regulating traffic (Other peoples power may have gone off too, it was about 10pm and I saw no lights on the way home).  Anyways the people who saw the air-craft are all college students at Stephen F. Austin State University and in a Fraternity.  We would not make this up.  The only reason I am reporting this is because I saw that a few other people have seen a similar thing and there could be more than just in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBJECT DESCRIPTION Grey “V” shaped Hang Glider object with a smooth curved bottom followed by a low hum and power outages of a bunch of stop lights (Not even the backup flashing lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were probably over Indiana. Out my window, I watched for a good 30 minutes what seemed like a spotlight/searchlight moving through town after town and forest after forest.  It was as though a helicopter was searching for something yet the light was not constant in a straight beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very bright light and easy to spot.  The light would slither around like a snake through the trees, across the ground, coming in and out of view.  Or the light would make a circle—not a perfect circle but a disorganized shape, illuminating trees, buildings, bodies of water.  When on water the light would spread out a lot, as one would expect.  The size of the lit area would be about like the size of a football field or smaller.  At times the light seemed low, like it went through the trees and not on top of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would disappear for a few seconds then reappear a few miles later (over and over-I’d see it for 5 seconds, disappear 5 seconds, reappear.) It was going at approximately the same speed as our jet because I was able to watch it for 30 minutes.   It was not on the same course as our jet, for its location changed in relation to our jet’s path.  But both our jet and the light were traveling generally north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw a helicopter or any aircraft or any source of this spotlight.  I could NOT see a beam coming from the sky but just the light hitting the earth.  The light had nothing to do with our jet.  Once we turned west in our approach for landing, we headed in a different direction as this light source.  And then when our plane was over Lake Michigan (just before descent), our plane did not create any light below us on the water--verifying to me that our jet had no relationship to this light thing I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Left Miami International at 7:45PM Eastern and landed at O&#39;Hare at 9:50PM Central.)  I am a 40 year old female, kindergarten teacher, married with 3 kids, and live in western suburbs of Chicago.<n>

Just early this morning around 5 am I was out smoking and there was an unusually bright light above Gold Hill mountain, there seemed to be like rays of light coming from it and no sound and it would appear to get closer and then go farther up, I watched it for about 15 min and then went inside. I tried to take a picture, but it just showed up as a small line on the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read over the reports on here from the Arlington area and a lot of them say that it looks like the lights they see head towards Darrington. I have seen these same lights for years. They are bright lights that at first look like stars, but then they will start to move side to side, or up and down and then after a while they will just go up really fast and dissapear. I am not the only one who has seen this happen either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time this last Spring, my daughter and brother, and I were out in the yard at night and I saw this bright red light move slowly across the sky, it was big and bright and I have never seen anything like it before, I expected there to be a noise or a fire because it looked like the light went down in the mountains, then about 3 min later there were jets flying in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part that caught my attention about the reports in Arlington, WA is that more than one person has reported seeing jets following these lights, and in the last few years I have noticed the same. If you go out at night and watch, almost every clear night you can see these strange moving lights here, and a lot of times within minutes after seeing them there are jets flying in the same location, which I find very strange. Also I have to add that on none of these occasions of seeing these lights has there ever been any noise coming from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD))<n>

PD))|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59538.html|52|ndxe200710| Bright light appears over NYC<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the car with my girlfriend outside of her house at approximately 5:00 a.m. early Sunday morning. As I was staring out the windshield into the sky I noticed an  unusually bright light in the sky. The object looked like a star but appeared to be in the sky at or about the same level a plane would be. The object did not appear to be moving, so I immediately ruled out that it was a plane and it was also much to high to be a helicopter. After staring at it for a few minutes I noticed that the object actually had moved slightly in the sky and was no longer in the spot it was just a few minutes ago. The light appeared to be about 5 times in diameter bigger than the north star. When I zoomed in on it with a camera, I noticed that the object actually was not bright white but it was actually blinking other colors of light. Red, green, blue and yellow lights were blinking one at a time. But when you looked at it with the naked eye it appeared to be just bright yellow or white. After driving around for a short while I tried to figure out exactly where in the sky the object was. I estimated that it was somewhere between Brooklyn and Manhattan as I was staring at it from the eastern shores of Staten Island. Staring at it with the naked eye, the object looked like a white flair that was not moving in the sky. Just a very bright and close twinkling white star, but as I said when you zoomed in on it, it appeared to be blinking different colors. When my girlfriend attempted to take pictures of it, it would not appear on camera. For a split second we were able to zoom on it very well and see that it was actually a circular object. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am wondering if any other people saw this object because it was in the sky for about 2 hours. If I were an alien, I would probably visit NYC at that time because every is sleeping or drunk. I went to sleep and when I woke up the next day the object was obviously gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

I work midnight shifts (5:30 pm to 5:30 am). I have never previously seen what I would consider a UFO. NOTE: I do have extensive aircraft observation time, as when I was stationed in Iraq in 2005, my unit was positioned in a location very close to the airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came into my peripheral vision from the right. I was standing facing due-north. At first I assumed it was a bird, but when I began visually observing it, it was obvious that it was wasn&#39;t, as it had a smooth, man-made appearance. Also, it was obvious that it was fairly far off and at a much higher altitude than one would expect to see a bird. This is especially true since in the region in which I live, during this time of the year there is little bird activity, especially at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of around 1500 feet and at an slightly oblique angle to me. It appeared not much smaller than a C130 at that altitude, but I could not make out a fuselage, etc., that one would expect to see on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved rapidly, much faster than a helicopter - perhaps several hundred miles an hour. It appeared to bank to the left (north-west) as it passed in front of me. It was an extremely smooth banking turn and the full wing shape became quite visible at that time. As it reached full bank (object perpendicular to the ground), I lost sight as it passed behind a building. Due to the my angle of observation, that&#39;s the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was gray in color. It blended well with the cloudless night sky (especially as effected by urban light pollution). There were no visible markings. Intriguingly, the object made no sound. At that distance, if it were an aircraft like a C130, one would have definitely heard the engine drone clearly. Also, there was no jet sound as one would expect to hear from a jet flying so close. I thought that, as in the case of an A-10, I might hear the sound after the craft had passed overhead. I heard no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight characteristics exhibited seemed to indicate it was an aircraft. But as previously stated, it lacked a fuselage, any markings and was completely blacked-out. There were no lights of any kind visible. Furthermore, the object left no contrail. I  am, as one might expect, fascinated by what I saw. But I certainly cannot explain it. Though it exhibited some aircraft flight characteristics, I could not identify it as any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen (in person or through research).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no noise to speak of, if there was I was in semi shock and total disbelief to notice. I’m sure there is a logical explanation for this. And I’m sure you will give me one. I never before listened or believed in UFO’s. I think this experience might have changed my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought all I could see was the reflection of my dash lights on the window, but then I looked several times and suddenly I did see blinking lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over to the shoulder and rolled down the window. In the eastern sky there was a large band area about a 45 degree angle from the horizon that had satellite looking blinking lights, but there were many, perhaps as many as 50 or sixty, that at each blink were in a different position, none being in a sensible trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were so amazing I turned off the engine and my girlfriend I both got out of the car and stood at the side of the road and continued to watch the lights flash as they headed in a north east direction. We both concurred we were seeing something that was not like any aircraft we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly one of the lights stayed on and shot across the whole eastern sky. If it had been an aircraft it would have gone hundreds of miles in a matter of a split second. The other lights continued to flash, sometimes very close together sometimes far apart, but like they were traveling together as a large spread out band.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe four or five minutes they gradually disappeared going in a northeast direction. My girlfriend and I agreed we had never seen any aircraft, satellite or shooting star that looked anything like what we had just seen.<n>

I was in a dark area near the corner of Convoy and Armour Streets in San Diego, California.  This area is directly under the flight path of Montgomery Field and a few miles south of Miramar Marine Air Station.  I have lived around the Miramar Marine Air Station for 20 years in several locations.  I have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). A plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud; but there was no sound.  The distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but I could not see anything in-between the lights.  This was a tight formation.  This V-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds  (5 seconds is not a quick glance---I watched it clearly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds; but I do not know how high above the clouds.  I could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The quality of the lights needs mentioning.  The lights were solid and bright; but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light.  These lights were different, maybe softer.  These lights did not blink. I guess the best description of these lights would be a slightly dim, off-white.  I say they were a V-shape; but the open end would be wider than a typical V.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 7:00 PM.  It was a cloudy and overcast night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky we saw a bright flash of light and a white fireball fly past us high in the sky.  I don&#39;t believe that it was a meteor or a &#39;shooting star&#39;, because it flew under the dense cloud cover and it streaked accross the sky and didn&#39;t seem to be descending, but maintaining its altitude.<n>

Me and my friend were riding around looking for something to do.  We were driving around and saw that they had just finished building a new road, so we decided to go down it to check it out.  It was still new and there were no street light’s and it went through a big field, so that when you were in the middle of the road there was nothing around you and the only lights were the lights on your car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at about the middle of the road when a huge brown and tan object, somewhat oval shaped, came flying through the air straight toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slammed on the brakes because it didn’t look like it was going to stop and as soon as I did it did to.  It just sat there hovering about  10 to 15 feet  above my car, me and my friend just sat their stunned not knowing what to do we just stared at it as it floated there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in incredible speed it flew straight up and disappeared.  Me and my friend took off in the car not knowing what to do.  A few feet down the road we stopped and turned around we were scared but we were curious.  This time we went really slow down the road hoping to see whatever it was before it seen us.  We did, it was just floating above the road then it flew straight toward us and stopped right on top of us again it was there for about 10 seconds then it flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend looked at each other and I took off I was speeding down the road and all of a sudden a weird looking creature around five ft. tall, with a round shape to it jumped out of the bushes and ran into the road I had to swerve  to miss it, I don’t know where the creature went but I know it couldn’t have been a coyote or a normal animal because it walked on two legs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also couldn’t have been a person because it was an odd looking brown color and it was naked.  After that we got off that road and went home.  I went back down the road the next night and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report, or not.

I pulled a chair over to the window, which faces North, and opened it all the way. That night the moon was almost full and it was fairly bright outside.  The aircraft moved out of site to the west and turned around and began flying east toward the Sandia Mountains, but this time I noticed a faint orange light was leading the pack of aircraft.  It was very small, very faint and I could make out no shape, which was odd because the moon was almost directly above.  The shape of the aircraft was quite clear and they also had 3 white blinking lights underneath them.  I continued observe the jets and the orange light fly towards the mountains for app. 30 to 45 seconds, at that time I was observing them from behind the line they were in.  When all I could see was was the white lights on the jets an extremely bright light shot out in front of them, It was orange but extremely bright, so bright that it appeared bigger in size. It moved up at a 55, 60 degree angle and curved straight up.  Afterwards the jets continued to fly towards the mountains and out of site.  I have no explanation for what the light was, there must be more witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My attention was diverted to a light on the sky... it was small, white, and silent.  It was below a pretty low cloud cover so I was impressed by the absents of sound.  It was moving quickly, &#34;like a meteor,&#34; so it traveled a large distance in just 5 seconds.  It then made a 90 degree turn straight up through the cloud cover, illuminated the cloud cover slightly and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my daughter if she saw that, and she acted like I was trying to scare her because we were at a Halloween party.  When I explained to her what I saw, she knew instantly that I was not lying. No one else was involved or believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They appeared hundreds of feet in the sky, not thousands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the lights began to spin around in circles, at one point coming together in the middle of the point they were circulating, but for a moment, and then moving out apart again where they continued to rotate. The three circulating lights appeared to chase each other independently in an almost triangular configuration around a central light as they were nearly an equal distant apart from each other during most of this spinning “dance” in the clouds. Never in my 40 years have I seen anything like this. The lights appeared to emanate from the clouds, but I noticed no objects other than the strange lights. I was about to grab my camera from the house when I watched the lights dart off to a point in the southeast part of the sky, pause for a few seconds, and then blink out as simply as if one were turning off a light switch. Before blinking out, the lights appeared to be nothing more than a crack of light in the clouds. I’m willing to believe that this was somehow manmade, but I am at a loss for how it was accomplished. This was no ordinary lightshow. Unfortunately, although this is an urban neighborhood, I didn’t see anyone else outside at the time to confirm what I saw. Considering the urban nature of where this took place, I’m betting others might have seen this but I’ve read nothing in the local press.<n>

Bearskin Lake ON, Circular disc with 4 lights seen 500 ft above ground heading East<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 19:00 hrs. my two children ages 10 and 6 were looking out our front livingroom window which faces West, and saw what they described as a circle shaped object flying in the sky about as high as our communications tower (500 ft) above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They described it as being a circle with 4 lights on it. The light colours were red, green, blue and yellow. They said only two colours flashed at the same time, then the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When asked if they were sure it wasn&#39;t a plane, my 10 year old daughter gave my a funny look and said &#34;dad, I know what a plane looks like and this wasn&#39;t a plane.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked them to draw a picture of what they saw, they both drew a circle shaped object with 4 lights under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the bedroom at the time of the occurrence and did not see the object for myself, but I do believe my children as they know the difference between the truth and a lie, and have been raised to respect authority.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two reported that the object wasn&#39;t moving fast, nor was it moving slow, but somewhere in between, which gave them just enough time to remember what it looked like. Bearskin Lake is a remote First Nations Reserve in Northern Ontario, approx. 350 km south of Hudson Bay (Fort Severn).<n>

There was no sound to be heard from the object. I felt that I was watching the last few seconds of flight before the object impacted the ground. It looked like a &#39;shooting star&#39; only it was much closer than any one I have seen before. The object was moving in the South-West direction. It might have impacted in Vancouver, Washington. I live in Battle Ground, which is north-east of Vancouver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could possibly have been some sort of firework, but not one I have seen before.

I thought it was a plane that was flying low and coming in for a landing. There were trees in front of the church and I watched the object through the branches. I couldn&#39;t see wings but I thought that&#39;s because I was looking at it from the side. I noticed a red tail. I watched it through the trees and waited for it to appear outside the branches, but it simply just disappeared. It didn&#39;t turn off or go up or down, it simply did not appear past the branches. It just disappeared. None of the kids seemed to notice. I stared and stared and tried to figure out where it went, but I couldn&#39;t figure it out.

The sky was dark and filled with sparkling stars, then high up and off to my right hand side, out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of something bright in the sky.  As I directed my attention to it, I thought, &#34;oh, what a beautiful falling star!&#34; I quickly braked my vehicle to slow and watch it and it came darting through the sky like falling stars do, then I saw it was a large, intensely bright, glowing, round,green ball, which grew bigger and bigger as it come rapidly closer and closer, and I thought, &#34;Oh my god, whatever this is, it&#39;s going to crash right beside me... then suddenly it abruptly zig zagged off horizontally like a &#34;zee&#34; and then shot upward and disappeared from sight.  By this time I had stopped my vehicle.  I looked and looked trying to find where it had gone, but its disappearance was extremely rapid and I saw it no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shocked and unnerved, I didn&#39;t tell anyone about it for several weeks. It is at the suggestion of my son, I am making this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was small, and bright, like a star, or sattelite, but its movements became irregular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was roving quite simply at first, but then it moved down, then back in the direction that it had been moving in, then it zipped over to the right again, then it did something wierd...it zoomed away from the planet, well it went left, really really fast, turbo speed...then it stopped.  Didn&#39;t move for a second or two, then continued to move in a strange pattern, eventually moving out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in an apartment building, I only have a sight view of the sky.  I am not the type to see a ufo.. I am 23, a female and not into this stuff too much, although the FACE ON MARS is nuts...anyway, I read alot about the brain, and once I saw this strange light I read up about what it could be, and decided that I did in fact believe that intellegent life was observing our planet, for whatever reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I saw another UFO, or whatever it was, that was about a week ago from now, NOV.8 2007, I was looking out the window again, and I thought I saw a grey seagull, riding the wind.  As I watched the &#34;gull&#34; I noticed that it didn&#39;t ride the wind as an amimal should, rather it just moved wiht the same altutde in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked closley, realizing that I was looking at a dark disk, not very high up, no lights.  It looked very stealth, yet very clear.  I have 20/20 vision, so I know what I saw, and I looked like a dark disk, flying overhead.<n>

I am an ex ((deleted--military speciality)) Specialist and I am currently attending college to obtain a ((deleted)) degree in ((deleted--technical field))!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am somewhat reluctant to even divulge this much and will appreciate absolute anonymity at this time (as I fear what personal and professional ridicule I may face in the scientific community).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night 10/25/07 at or around 20:30 hours myself, my fiancé, and my two children witnessed a triangular shaped UFO.   At the peak of this triangle was a shimmering blue light which rays of light seemed to come out in fractioned adamantine way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other lights at each peak changed color.  We witnessed this craft move from one side of the sky and then straight down to where it was only maybe 200-300 ft away in the sky.  It emitted no noise and seemed to give of an electromagnetic field.  In addition, our clocks in our van and the lights dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed what appeared to be a red orb coming from the triangular shaped UFO and then seen several (perhaps ten) aircraft and helicopters heading toward the UFO.  The moon was full a night illumination was extremely high, so we cold literally make out the contours of each craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that witnesses in a red truck down the street from us saw this event as well, however, I have not approached them thus far.  I would like to explain these occurrences in more detail in private with an investigator, and perhaps send a drawing of the event and the crafts that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is much more, and I would like to discuss via investigator correspondence.  I would prefer email contact at this time.  I have much to explain, and believe me, I’m quite serious about what I saw last night and what I have seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep this information to yourself at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I state again, I wish to remain anonymous at this time.  I am ex military and an aspiring scientist and the last thing I need right now is extra attention, even if I do believe in this phenomenon!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you for your time and help, and I look forward to corresponding with you further!<n>

The lights seems to converge closer together, or the ufo was moving away, it hovered west toward the ocean, then disappeared over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second I saw a few  miles farther up, about a minute later. First it seemed to consist of a few bright lights like the first, it was hovering, I watched it move slowly above the freeway, but suddenly the bright white lights turned off, and there were two lights at the end points of this cigar shaped object, one red, one blue, it seemed to get bigger, or closer, it was moving slowly then it was out of my field of view.<n>

10/25/07 19:36|Denver|CO|Changing|2-3 minutes|Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59455.html|82|ndxe200710| Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My room mate and I were walking from Capital Hill to the Starz Theatre, next to the Denver Pepsi Center to see an advance screening of &#34;Lions for Lambs&#34;.  We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn&#39;t pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i&#39;ve seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a &#34;straight&#34; pattern, never escalating its height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I&#39;d say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714&#34;ft. And this object was definitely within that range..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will have been my second time seeing UFO in two different States.<n>

More specific, I had just turned left onto Rosewood lane from Collins street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was at dusk, still with a lot of blue, and a mostly full moon was staring me in the face.  All of a sudden, a bright &#34;star-like&#34; object, (much brighter than Venus), appeared at the top of my windshield, falling hard and moving fast toward the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can assure you it was no airplane, for, to be honest, I&#39;m smarter than that.  I know when I see an airplane, and THIS was no airplane!  This unidentified falling object moved too fast and the light did not &#34;twinkle&#34;, or &#34;blink&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled from the top of my windshield to the horizon in a matter of 10 seconds, or so, keeping in mind I was on a residential street, not exceeding 15 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My raw impression, is that whatever this thing was, &#34;IT&#34; came from the atmosphere and hit the ground.<n>

I was less than half a mile from my house, coming up towards my turn off when I saw something in the sky that looked like a low airplane coming in on final approach at an airport, that&#39;s how low it was. It had to be no more than a few hundred feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off at my usual turn, and I could see this thing was low so I pulled over at a clearing where there weren&#39;t any trees around, parked, and got out. This thing, from what I could tell from the lights, was shaped like a triangle. There were two lights on the bottom of it at the front, one at the back at the point of the triangle, and then a blinking red light about 3/4 of the way back on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up thinking it was an airplane or a helicopter (when I was pulling over and getting out), but there was something wrong. This thing slowly passed literally right over me, but there was not a single sound coming from it. It was almost like it was just slowly seamlessly gliding through the air. From as low as this thing was, there should have been the sounds of an engine or something if it was a helicopter or a plane. And it sure wasn&#39;t coming in for a landing because the nearest airport was about 5 miles SW of where I was and this thing was traveling N-NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until I had just gotten past me and then I jumped back into my car and turned around because I wanted another look at this thing. I got back onto the road I had just turned off of, but this thing was nowhere to be found. I looked all over in the sky in the direction it was going in as well as all around in every direction and there was nothing. No white lights, no red blinking light, nothing. Just the moon and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove for a little bit longer trying to find it again but couldn&#39;t find a single sign of it. After I couldn&#39;t find it again, I gave up and came back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My coworker, who has since quit, will not contribute to this report so I will not use his experiences although I would prefer as they are more &#34;colorful&#34; than my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background here; I am (or at least was) happily married and prefer to stay that way, and my wife will not listen to me and DOES NOT support my reporting this but after researching online I feel I must do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 28 year old who graduated from a very small town in Nebraska, so I do not expect anyone to take me serious that this took place. People who have an education or money would be, but I am just a regular guy I guess, but here it goes anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a bit of a personality crisis (as well as a whiskey crisis) for the last few days and I’m just trying to get by.  Frankly, I am annoyed that this happened, and 4 nights later I am still annoyed and not enjoying my  life if you don’t mind me speaking my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving a commercial truck used to move frozen food that is sold retail, and there were two of us, one in each truck returning to our “office”. I was ahead of my coworker, when we turned a bend in the highway, ahead there was a black square in the sky. I don’t know how else to describe it, there were no lights or sounds, just a square floating.  I nearly had a heart attack when I saw it, keep in mind-and this important-that it wasn’t there when I came around the bend, it just appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low and almost on the road and I locked up my brakes.  My truck is heavy and admittedly we speed, so I was all over the road. I came to a stop and got out.  All I saw was this black square. I am not trying to sound dramatic.  But it was simply a black square, moving very slowly-hardly moving-to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when thing get weird, cause my coworker gets out of his truck and his face is white as a sheet, and he says ((deleted))all this for selling ice cream door-to-door.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am staring at this black floaty thing, and then suddenly my coworker is gone. I mean thin air gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly from the cornfield about 50 yards ahead from the south comes my buddy screaming bloody hell.  His eyes are so big it’s like all I can see are his eyes to this minute, and all I can see to his right is this dark square, and as he is running to me, his arms out wide as if to hug me, and there comes this horn, ya know like compressed air you have on your boat, and I duck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coworker jumps into my truck and shuts and locks the doors, and here I am prying on the door handle screaming like a school girl and I look behind me and see a guy, like a little skinny guy  along the ditch, and this is where I become a drinker, cause the guy is looking at me all menacing like he is coming to kill me and he is skin and bones with a big ass head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jim lets me in and I put in drive and push this International to 120.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is mad, don’t make trouble for me please, but you all don’t know (or belief) but I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Then again the lights came on in succession until 5 square orange lights were lit and then the sky went black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my car over and got out to see if I could hear a helicopter or plane.

I decided to do a U turn to watch the light from the closer other side of the road, and when I realized it had already disappeared with no trace.  It is impossible to tell if it diminished or flew away as there were trees in between when I realized it completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For your reference, I am including the URL to the map of the exact spot where I could still see it before the U turn,<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=Guildford,+GU2+8XH,+UK+(Philips)&amp;sll=54.162434,-3.647461&amp;sspn=8.199939,20.500488&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.230914,-0.653043&amp;spn=0.017118,0.04004&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1<n>

It hovered for approximately 4 minutes. I ran inside and got my two daughters ages 8 and 6 to see if they could see what I was seeing. As we were watching this object it looped around and started to head south. To our astonishment, as the egg shaped object was traveling south another object appeared it seemed to come from  above and was somewhat higher in the sky.The first object continued to move south at a slow place , yet the second object was at a stand still. We continued to watch the first object move south ,when we looked back were the second object  first appeared it was gone.The  whole incident  lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Neighbors probobly thought we were loosing it,looking up in the sky and shouting and pionting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying at around 2000 ft and seemed to be slowly drifting down from the sky to about 1500-1400ft. It was clearly a disk and was yellow, and was covered in a thin gray haze which to me looked a bit like steam. As I have said, it was yellow with an orange rim. All a saw was the bottom side of the disk which appeared to have small blue lights flashing randomly. I am not sure if they were lights or just reflections. I watched this for about 40 seconds and then it just vanished in thin air, there were hardly any clouds at all. Almost as soon as I had stepped inside, I saw the disk again through the window. This time it was much lower down, probably only 500ft above the roofs of the houses, but a lot further away from me than before. It was also traveling much slower than before, probably only jogging pace. It seemed to maintain altitude and I was able to estimate the size of the disk. I would say it was about 80ft in circumference and around 15ft from the bottom to the top. This time I was partly able to see the top of the disk, and it looked exactly the same as the bottom. The gray haze was still around the disk, but I could not see any of th e blue flashes I had seen before. This time, I was able to see the object for just over a minute. I went outside to get a better look at the disk, I could no longer see it. The sky&#39;s were almost completely cloudless, so I don&#39;t know where it went after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

I was standing in our company’s break room talking to another co-worker when a third co-worker opened the door and told us there was a strange object/light hovering near and above the south side of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having some experience with a few sightings before (because my eyes never leave the sky) I ran out and immediately began to compare its movement with a nearby by airliner, houses and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my co-worker, the object/light started out as being as large as his fingernail.  It moved slowly upward, silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time he arrived at work and I had gotten outside to see it and it was half the luminosity of Venus which was shining in the predawn light also in the southern sky.  The light from the object began to pulsate and the object began to move in a tight circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A commercial airliner began to approach the area from a westerly direction at what I can assume to be a 30,000 foot ceiling.  As the airliner came closer, the object moved sporadically in a straight line heading south, quickly the light flickered and dissipated and finally shot away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 30 minutes later while we were talking about it in the office, a third witness told us that she saw the same object from a different angle. She said that she saw two smaller objects &#34;eject&#34; or &#34;shoot&#34; out from the bottom of the main craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pulled her daughter outside to watch. 20 minutes after the craft shot away, the sky was a full military aircraft scrambled in multiple directions and all in the basic area where the object was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A person in our group familiar with Air Force maneuvers mentioned that those aircraft were moving in a scout formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all familiar with the regular air traffic patterns from L.A., Vegas and Phoenix. None of these six or so aircraft followed those usual patterns. They were all at nearly the same altitude and flying in many different directions.<n>

He said it was making manuvers back and forth across the trees with extremely bright lights on shining down, but no noise that he could hear.I told him to call me if it came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m usually up at five getting ready for work.  He called me and said,it&#39;s back.  I told him I&#39;m on my way with my camera.It took me about 2-3 min. to get ready and called him back to see if it was still there he said it is heading up the creek toward my house.  I said, I don&#39;t see anything i&#39;m on my way and hung up.I was standing next to my car about to open the door and then I saw it.There were no lights on at my home, and I, and my neighbor live in a remote area of East Texas.His house is about 1/2 mile down the creek from me.At first I dismissed it because I thought it was an airplane way up high,but I continued to look at it.My Wife was watching me leave and saw it too, at different angle from our bedroom.There is a private airstrip close to our house about (2 miles)and we see all kinds of small planes all the time, usually during the day ,but somtimes at night.One thing they all have in common is the way their running lights are configured.What caught my attention was the brightness of the lights on what I thought were wings and the two oversize lights on the front lower part of the fusalodge that were very dim.When it got closer I realized it was not several thousand feet up but a small craft only about 350 ft up.I estimate it was traveling about 45-60 mph.  IT had no wings to speak of,and only made a hum .When it passed overhead I heard a wisp ,like when birds fly by close enough you can hear them.It was only after it passed directly over me that i could hear the hum,like the sound a golfcart makes when it&#39;s moving slow.Dimentionaly it was about 25 feet long and 25-30 feet wide.Very dark flat color, no reflection .The part normally thought of as the cockpit was the only rounded part of it,but the nose was very blunt or flat and wide.There was no tail.... no rear lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the way it looked and the amount of noise it made I don&#39;t see how it could fly that slow.<n>

My initial thought was it was on a tower, but I realized there are no tall radio towers in the area where this light was.  Besides which, I make this trip several evenings a week and had never seen the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next realization was that it was moving, very slowly, appearing to move from west to east (towards me) and coming closer to the ground.  The light appeared to be about 2-3 miles distant, but this is just a guess.  It was not landing lights on an aircraft-I have lived by airports before and am familiar with these.  Plus the light was much larger than landing lights would be, and the airport is in a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drew closer, I started thinking that perhaps it was a series of large bright lights, as opposed to 1 large oval light.  I thought it might be a helicopter, but the light(s) was too wide to be on a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point I had been watching the light(s) as I drove for approximately 5 minutes.  The light(s) was getting lower and lower.  There was nowhere on its line of decent for a helicopter to land, so if it was a helicopter of some sort, I don&#39;t know what it was doing.  Of course, I don&#39;t know what a UFO would be doing landing in a residential section of Baton Rouge, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I had to make a turn in order to reach my destination, and as I was already late to pick up my daughter, I chose to make the turn and lose sight of the light(s).  When we returned to that road about 5 minutes later, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, I have lived near airports before--both military and civilian--and did not recognize the shape of the light(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was more than a little bit spooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road I was on was not crowded at this time of the evening, but it was by no means empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people had to have seen the light(s) too.<n>

What immediately caught my eye was a completely still, lighted object in the sky.  I went through the usual eliminations; star, airplane, helicopter, weather balloon.  None of these fit what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started focusing on the object not as a whole, but in parts-trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  First were lights going from left to right.  There had been some red when I thought it was a plane.  The lights I was now seeing were white.  I couldn’t make out the shape of the object these lights were coming from.  Then within the sequence of white lights, a red one was included.  I almost missed that one as I had started my focus on the beam below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam below was as wide as the lights that were going from left to right, narrowing down to a point in a “v” shape and ended not far below the lighted object.  This light was a foggy white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back at the lights to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me, I green light was included in the white ones going from left to right.  It was then that I knew I was seeing something I had never  seen before and I needed to report this to someone.<n>

Object was blinking off and on, I mean winking in and out, disappearing completly and back on again.  It appeared cylindirical but was very high up for me to get a good look without binoculars.  Area is frequented by regular airlines and we have Lemoore Naval Air base about 10 or 15 miles from that location.  I am familiar with their speed and appearance and that of regular aircraft.  This object was way faster that any jet I have observed or airliner.  I only saw one and there was no one in the area to show or to see it that I am aware of.  I work at a  tomato factory that is way out of town and can see the valley sky without any objects getting in the way.  I have seen objects before, but not for some time and just happen to be looking up.

At first we thought it was a tiny cloud (the only tiny cloud in the sky) but it seemed to have a short, fat contrail trailing behind it, so I thought it might be a jet or possibly a meteor falling to earth since there was a meteor shower on Sunday.  But this object didn&#39;t appear to be falling down or going anywhere, it was standing still in the sky and appeared to be in suspended animation (now doesn&#39;t that sound silly)!  We kept an eye on it as we drove home and once home I stood on my lawn searching the sky for it.  At first I couldn&#39;t see it but then I saw something that appeared to be a tiny jet with a small contrail trailing behind, but in suspended animation and going nowhere in the sky, that&#39;s what was so weird about this.  As I watched it got smaller and smaller in the same spot and then suddenly disappeared after watching it about three or four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming it may have been a jet traveling southeast away from us, which could have made it appear to not be moving and getting smaller as it distanced itself from us, or was it a meteor that disintegrated in the sky, what it was I&#39;ll never know?<n>

It is about as close as you can get with out getting on KSC, 10-15 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking movie pictures with my camera and the shuttle had lifted off.  About one to one and a half minutes after the launch I pulled away from the camera and look up and saw some thing going from West to East at a high rate of speed.  It was bright and looked like a flying saucer shape but you just saw a yellow light.  I asked my friends and some other people around us if they saw it and they said that they did see some thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought that it was a chase plane to take pictures of the shuttle but quickly decided that it was not a chase plane.  They have land base camera’s that can give you better pictures than a chase plane.  Also if a plane is in the launch area they will not launch the shuttle.  I have seen many shuttle launches since I live close to Cape Canaveral.  I have never seen any thing like this before.  I retired from the Air Force and have seen F-16’s, F-15’s, SR-71 and F-18’s flying at all altitudes and this was none of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get a movie of the UFO but it was so bright I could not tell if I was getting good pictures.  Once I got home I downloaded the movie onto my computer to see if I got any thing.  I found that I had about a second of the light but I could not tell what it was.  I looked at each frame that I had and each frame was different.  It was not a good movie you can not tell any thing from what I have but a light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so sure that the news would have some thing on this but no one reported any thing about the ufo/light.  I don’t understand this at all.<n>

He was looking outside so I decided to see what it was. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then I thought that it was much to slow to be an airplane. It was incredibly low to the ground, only 20 feet above my house. It was a giant triangle about 75 feet on each side. There was a light on each point of the triangle and mabye one in the middle but it was too faint to tell. It hovered above my house for about 20 seconds until it disappeared into the night sky. It looked like it was searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Each illuminating flicker had a bit of a difference to the shape. And the color was odd, not a single shade but a blend of shades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was larger than a medium-sized star, but that included the emitted light form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never went completely dark until the last quivery flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 or 3 seconds later it was in the SSE sky, at just slightly above the original degree point...seemed to be same size and description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Locations would have gone like this...Original sighting was as if I extended my arm straight out in front of me...Second appearance was as if I extended my arm mid-way between straight in front and straight to the side...hope this makes sense.)

HWY 34. We noticed what looked like a tower light in the sky to the south of us. It was bright orange and it dropping what looked like flares? There was a second smaller orange light kinda below it moving up and down. I stopped and called my sister to have her go outside to see if she could see them from Stephan, where we live. She said she didn’t see anything. We didn’t see them anymore and started back home again. Then we were about two miles from home and again we seen one bright orange light then it spilt into two with one below the other, moving up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got home and I walked down our road alittle to see past the campus High School building and south in the sky was five bright orangr lights. Four were in a straight line and one just below the left of the formation. I ran back to the house and got my kids in the van and we were going to go drive to get a better look at them. We made it just off our gravel road and we seen the one orange light again drooping what looked like flares. My daughter was filming it on out cell phone. We waited for about 30min and nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so excited leaving our house my sister ran over our dog, bummer. There are several residents in the area that seen the same lights. I even e-mailed it to Keloland our news station, no responds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on the 24th in Chamberlain, SD the  Keloland weather camera caught this burning light crossing the sky to the east, and a School bus had to stop and check it out. They said on the news that it was burning space debris.I know what I saw was not burning space debris or anything like it . What I saw was stationary and moving up and down. Then maybe later in this week out in Crow Creek district they found some crop circle that some hunters found. I seen a picture that a co-worker took.. I don’t know if  it was related to what I saw or what but anyway, &#34;weird stuff.&#34;<n>

SD UFO SIGHTINGS 10-22-07  On 10-22-07 I was traveling south from Sioux Falls on interstate 29 when around 8:30 pm on a clear night the stars were starting to show up I noticed a bright organgish round light to the west over the horizon thinking it was a plane heading for Sioux Falls, because I could see the two planets. When I looked over again it was gone just some faint stars in the sky were the light was. Then I looked over again to make sure it was not a star, when a moment later I saw in the dark sky a light go from nothing to bright then another light came on in a line with the first only a little ways away, only to have the first light dim out as a third light came online a little ways away from the second light, as it got brighter the second light went out. As with the fourth light however they were not moving. Kind of looked like big sparks between them. Then no lights for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I turned west onto old Hwy 44, now 280th St. after traveling west for a couple of minutes I was pondering at what I just saw thinking this is no plane, planet, or star. It happened again only this time it was more west southwest this time. When it happened again I called my wife who was bringing the kids home from their football game in Sioux Falls, I asked where she was and if she saw the strange lights to the west she said no, so I told her and the kids to look half way (2:00 o’clock position) up the windshield and look west, I said they come and go and to just watch the sky and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four miles from Hwy 19 I saw them doing the same thing again but now one was farther north by itself. Moments later the phone rang and it was my wife and kids and they said they saw the lights to the west. I drove west for 26 miles and turned south on 449th Ave. for two miles and pulled over the time was 8:53 pm again the lights came on but not in a row one light up a little to the south and as that one faded out, one light up north a few miles from it. They would take turns going on and off at 9:00 pm a plane came from the southwest at a high altitude moving northeast. At 9:14 pm was the last time I saw the lights. At 9:23 pm I saw four navigation lights in an echelon formation spread a few miles apart come from the west at a high rate of speed when they arrived at the vicinity of the lights they stayed in formation and turned northeast to Sioux falls were our F-16 fighter base is located. After they turned northeast I saw two-twin engine jet fighters come from the southwest (Omaha?) they flew the area for a few minutes and left, also some came from the south (Sioux City?) All these planes were on the same altitude and intercept as the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife had stopped in Hurley and talked to a man who was standing on 283rd St. watching the lights, he had also been watching them from the interstate. My wife got home about the time the fighters showed up.  She could hear them and see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/22/07 18:45|Chisholm|MN|Triangle|5 Seconds|Silent, black, triangular object with no lights|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66972.html|130|ndxe200710| Silent, black, triangular object with no lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it as being roughly a week or so before Halloween of 2007. My friend and I were grounds workers at a mining museum/park, and we had just finished closing up the park and locking the buildings around the site. We locked up our grounds garage last, where our cars were parked, at about 6:00 PM. We ended up getting into a conversation for about 45 minutes. The sun had set, and we were having a deep discussion about 80’s Hip-Hop artists, when my friend suddenly stopped talking, looked up, startled… and then SPRINTED up the road about 20 feet!  I wasn’t too concerned, just a little confused. I caught up with him and he explained to me that he had just seen a very large triangular “object” pass right over us, and just over the tops of the trees near us. He described it as being INCREDIBLY low, probably just 75-100 feet off the ground, triangular, and black. I couldn’t help but be skeptical of his account, being as I sensed absolutely nothing of this seemingly huge UFO right above our heads. We were all by ourselves, there was virtually no ambient noise down by our garage, except the sound of cars passing by on the highway near us, and still this “craft” made absolutely no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stood there for a while and listened to my friend frantically repeat his description for about two minutes. I clearly remember him estimating the size of it and whatnot, when I looked up to the north, pointed at something, and yelled “Like THAT?!” I felt my stomach drop. He looked and said “Yes!”  I stared directly at it. It was a black triangle, floating slowly upwards. It wasn’t as close to the ground as what my friend described, and its really hard for me to guess how big it was, but I would estimate it as being roughly the same size as the one he witnessed first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can remember is how directly I was staring at this thing… it was a totally clear night, the thing was darker than the sky, and I had no doubt about the exact shape I was looking at. It was just a triangle… no lights, just a shape… slowly moving upwards. We watched it for what could not have been more than 5 seconds, and it just vanished right in front of our eyes… just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to freak out and scream a string of profanity, all while we tried to reason and deduce what we realistically could have seen. “Things can’t just disappear!” We ended up jumping in our cars and driving across the street to the ‘Ironman’ statue/parking lot. We got out of our cars and stood there for quite a while, staring up at the sky, almost expecting to see another one. I imagine we looked pretty insane like that, but it didn’t really concern us as much as seeing disappearing triangle spaceships…  I’m not sure how long we stood there, but I swear it was almost 9:00 by the time we decided that we had no idea what it could have possibly been, and it was time to go home. My drive home was about 15 minutes, and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t an immensely unsettling drive home. I found myself staring up out my window the whole ride, but genuinely not wanting to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never really believed in paranormal activities and the like… I’d never seen a ghost or alien or UFO or anything like that, and I always remember seeing UFO accounts on TV and being very skeptical. I always thought “I’m doubt they could see anything clearly if it was that dark.“ But what I saw was so clear, and I have no doubt about exactly what we both saw, which I think was actually the part that made me the most uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following weeks I just felt sick, scared, paranoid and uncertain. I told very few people about it. Over the course of the next months, and the rest of the winter, there was more slight… anomalies. One strange night at around 10:00 PM (again at our workplace), we were in the museum parking lot, looking at the sky and we saw a strange, moving star-like light up in the sky. Naturally we assumed it was another plane, but it was moving it an erratic, arbitrary pattern that was just odd. We watched for minutes as it just moved across almost the whole sky, heading towards the horizon (which happened to be the general direction of the airport…), when two other lights appeared. We heard distant rotors and decided these ones were helicopters. The helicopters seemed to follow (or chase) the first light, until they all disappeared behind the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another time my friend called me at 5:45 AM, and I didn’t answer. He left me a message telling me to turn on the news. I did, and saw video from the airport cam of three strange, dim lights in a triangular pattern right on top of the horizon. They (or “it”) weren’t moving relative to the surroundings, though when we replayed the DVR in slow-motion, we could see the lights “fluctuating”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has been several times where we or I have just looked up and seen a “star” moving in the same strange, erratic patterns, or just general strange stuff going on. And the weird thing is, its always only happened at work. I’ve thought about trying to get a picture or video sometime, but haven’t yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still work there, and it’s almost a normal thing now for strange things to happen. But I have to be honest, it still bothers me deeply not knowing for sure. I always expect to go outside for a cigarette one night and see something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airplanes can’t disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We live in a very rural place with much farmland (right at 15 minutes outside of Farmington Missouri (south west)).  Our lot is 5 acres and we have dogs, cats, horses and cows on the surrounding farmland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right at 6:30 am and it was still pretty dark here.  I saw what I thought to be a very bright star in the North East sky.  And it was not twinkling, however it seemed to get larger and larger.  It was very quiet here and we could not hear anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I noticed for certain it was getting larger I just figured it was an airliner going southwest towards us.  My daughter and I just watched it for about 2 more minutes and when it started to get closer and closer, I could see how low it was and got scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I then went under the nearest tree and I tried to hide her under me a bit.  The aircraft was in full view the entire time and it came right over us.  The light on the front was a very large bright white light, just one light in front that we could tell.  The light was too bright to be able to see the topside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it went right over us at about 100 feet, the horses and cows and dogs went crazy and started making loud sounds. The lights on the side were blue and there were 5-8 of these small blue lights on the left and right side (underneath).  The object was triangle in shape and never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not seem to interfere with the trees at all, though it was right above the tree line (approximately 75-100 feet high).  There was no wind or anything else emitted from the object.  When it passed over it was going rather slow. It seemed to slow down a bit going over the farmland right across from the road.  I could not say how fast; however my daughter and I were able to tell what the underneath looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the craft was mainly gray-scale and was not what you see in movies at all - meaning it was not all flat and perfect.  It had what looked like ridges and mechanical wiring, etc... It was not a shiny object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed I quickly moved to the right of the tree so I could see the backend of the object and it had red lights on the back end, though I could not say how many lights were on the craft - definitely more than 5 and they were small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the craft just took off very fast on the same heading.  Soon after the animals got quiet and nothing else followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I came inside as soon as possible and did not wait to see if there were any to follow, either. I will be honest and say that I did not believe before I saw this in the sky.  I did ask my daughter what she thought that was in the sky, and she said she did not know but thought it was strange because it did not make a sound and the animals did not like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had her explain it to my husband and as she was explaining it, not one detail was different from what I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up some military aircrafts online to see if perhaps it was on of them.  The closest I could find was the stealth bomber, however this was still quite a bit different from what we saw.  Differences between the stealth and the object we saw were the underside was different, the lights were not the same and no sound came from the object we saw.  They were very similar in shape, however the craft we saw was a perfect triangle from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like you to catalog this, if you need to for your data and record collection; a return call is not necessary but if you need more information feel free to contact me.  I wish to remain anonymous due to my profession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>
10/22/07 05:00|McKinney|TX|Other|2 hours|Five 'star like' intellegece operated craft observed by 2 people in North Texas.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59464.html|132|ndxe200710| Five &#39;star like&#39; intellegece operated craft observed by 2 people in North Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in suburbs of North Dallas , Texas. I am a State Gaurd for the State of California , an American Red Cross first responder , a 2 year member of the Air Force Auxillery , Cival Air Patrol and my father was a pilot for over 10 years. I am not an expert at aircraft , but am credible to tell you what I witnessed was something unexplainible and very real and not capable of being any current aircraft that any goverment possess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A college friend and myself had gone out for a cigarette after watching a late movie on television. The sky on this night was extremely clear and there were no clouds visible. Constilations and stars on this night were excellent to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 5 am in the morning , still dark , both of us caught with our peripheral vision a change in a consilation visible in the North West sky. Two stars had appeared in the sky , at least they had the appeance of being stars. More than this they were moving at slow pace , like that of a satelite . The pair moved as a unit , buts coordination was beyond that of even the most expierianced pilot. They changed direction slightly twice , remaining perfectly in sync with eachother. The light they gave off dimmed slowly over time until finally disapearing. My friends thoughts on the behavior of the lights explores the possibility that these crafts were moving upward and out of our atmosphere causing the dimming effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was that these were military crafts , with advanced aero - navigational computers or something that would explain the way they manuvered. I continued to observe the sky and the area where we&#39;d witnessed the strange distant lights. Theyre were a lot of meteors also in the sky that night , a naturaly occuring meteor shower resulted my Haley&#39;s Comet. I was not expecting what followed as with most UFO sightings that Ive seen on TV programs , or read about in books there is only one sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes had past since the disapearance of the first two craft. We both suddenly observed a bright flash from just south of the prior mentioned constilation. The flash was as bright as a camera flash light. Immidieatly after the flash another single one of the &#34;moving stars&#34; craft was visible moving in a Northern direction for several seconds before fading like the first two. My friend and I now knew that we were observing something very real , and something that needed immiediate looking in to. I told my friend to remain outside and observe the sky for more activity. I went inside to check all local news stations , and national news , in fear that this was a test of the missle defense system or that another national attack had happend causing the presence of these possible advanced military craft. There was nothing relevant on either press outlet. I went back outside only to find my friend just about to call me , and in time to witness a third and forth craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following sighting remains to me the most signifigant in that it dis-proves any of the theories I had that these craft were man-made or modern. This sighting also disturbes me on a deep level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was a passanger jet , probably out of DFW International , heading north , with one of these star like craft following it from a higher altitude and several hundred yards behind. It shadowed the airplane for a good minute in a half , maintaing the same distance and matching the speed of the airline. It then accelerated and moved directly over the plane before abruptly vanishing. At the same time as this first craft disapeared a second light appeared from the origional area that the origional craft had been following the plane at. Several hundred yards behind the plane. This sudden appearance of this craft startled me enough , that I actually fell backwards on the ground. The craft was visible for no longer than several seconds buts direction was twoards us as I clearly remember seeing the light tracer caused by the fast moving craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These second pair of craft were much closer to the ground than the origional two viewed in the constilation. These two also moved quickly and appeared and vanished abruptly instead of a gradual fade. I felt a strong fear for the safety of the passangers on the plane , and was very uncomfortable with the way these unknown lights interacted as if there interest was with this jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my friend and I now knew that what we were seeing was unique , and something that we were not supposed to see. Ive seen meteors , shooting stars , satelites , and nearly every kind of signal light on a plane from both sky and ground and can possitivly identify these crafts as none of the mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sighting occured near 07:40 . We had remained outside for over thirty minutes patiently watching the sky and going over what we had seen , trying to make reason out of any of it. Morning had come and the only now visible stars in the sky were two off to the south west , and a very bright (maybe northern star) star to the west. As we turned around from watching the fading of the two stars to the east , and the area of sky where we saw the other crafts , a new pressence startled me. A new , non moving , very bright light was now visible to left of the remaining one star we had noted before. Its size and amount of light it produced was a complete mimic of the single star to its right. It remained for 6-10 minutes , long enough for both of us to begin questioning simply overlooking this light , and begining to accept that it was also a star. Without warning , it ever moving , and completly dismissing it as a fading star , it simply faded inwards , as if it was moving directly away from us at some great unthinkable speed. Within the amount of time taken by a eyelid blinking it had completly gone leaving the morning sky cloudless , single star remaining, and becoming lighter as the sun was now up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This last star gives me the oversure impression that it was singled in on us and was observing us. It did not move or show any other sign of possible cause , other than its looming pressence above us , and the feeling that we were trapped and being watched by something that we could not explain and thought could be threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever these objects were , they were true &#34;unidentified flying objects&#34; . As to whether being extraterrestrial in orgin , I can knowingly testify that there is no possibility that these were man-made or navigated by a conventional pilot . This is taking in to account the possibility of classified expierimentals. These things moved , appeared and vanished , and interacted as if altitude , time , and matter simply didnt matter , and that using these crafts could manipulate and contradict even our most basic laws of physics and far supercedes modern aero science potential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have accepted that there are no explinations to what I witnissed and that the account that both of us saw will be laughed at , misunderstood , and not believed. I however feel a sense of self , and look at it as being something very special that I was able to witness , and accept a very real unknown that we as Americans or any persons should press be investigated and monitored. My friend , of christian upbringing, found the expieriance to be the most religious , awakening , and realization as to the importance of having witnessed such things , a life changing expieriance as well as both of our single most important moments of our lifes. Being able to witness these crafts and observe , if only shortly , travelers of space , and things capable of seeming to bend reality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no access to a video camera to record the lights for evidence. Also , after much discussion decided not to call the police at the time. Whether a public record or press involvment will be made by myself or friend remain to be decided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain that this is intended to be a serious report, but we post it, nevertheless.

This was no aircraft as I know them to be as it stayed in the same location for an hour occassionally going up then down but for the most part remaining in the same location. I called my wife out who also witnessed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some time I called my brother in law and he went outside and observed the craft as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commercial traffic was moving around in the sky with normal strobes flashing and you could plainly tell the traffic was moving. At one point I did observe the tasil beacon of an aircraft which looked like it was flying towards the hovering craft and looked to fly around it , then the beacon was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance above ground was not determined because of the mountain ranges in the area. The night was clear and visibility was unlimited. The moon was about three quarters providing a well lit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe any commercial traffic flying in the area of the craft. This except for the one beacon that flew towards the craft.I did not see the craft leave the area as it was late and I went back in.

As we stood at the &#34;Archery range Observation point&#34; My attention was drawn to the color effects on a cloud bank by the setting sun. In the sky at that time were several identifiable objects, two airliners with visible contrails and an ultralight aircraft. What caught my attention however was a very bright almost teardrop shaped &#34;light&#34; that seemed to remain stationary below the cloud bank. At first i thought it was the setting sun reflection of a third airliner, however the other two did not display such a bright reflection, nor did their contrails. The ultra light craft was on the opposite side of the sky and much much lower in altitude. I did manage to capture the light on my digital camera, though the photograph is rather inconclusive. I also had the opportunity to view it through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be somewhat spherical with what looked like an upward &#34;trident&#34; glow or aura. I have sketches in my field notes. the entire &#34;sighting&#34; took roughly 3 or 4 minutes before the object disappeared behind the distant tree line. If this was in fact an airplane reflecting the sun, I&#39;ve never seen the effect before, and having grown up along the flight path of the Rochester International Airport I am pretty familiar with the profiles and various weather effects on flying aircraft viewed from the ground. Anyone wishing to see the photograph, and a more detailed description, feel free to email me.<n>

The sun was to our backs, my friend said they might be fighter aircraft but I said no way, too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as that object faded from view to the NE, another SPHERE came along in the general same track this one PULSED a few times along the flight path.  Again, it faded from view to the NE.  The color was a golden yellow and real sharp and defined, but small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No estimate of altitude but it was up there. I joked, these must be UFO&#39;s any more? and sure enough, another came along this time to our  left but followed the same flight path.  No pulsing, just a steady, bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, faded from view in NE distance and again, a fourth object, the last, came into view as same as third, but this one pulsed a few times as it zipped over head and on to the NE. The color of these objects were all consistant and the only reference of luminosity would be the yellowish hi-way lights they use to light the interstates, only more intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No contrails or erratic flight, just straight and true. It was really strange how brilliant these objects were and stood out against the daylight sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.........<n>

10/21/07 13:55|Elk Grove|CA|Sphere|8 min|Chrome sphere(s) over farmland outside Sacramento California spotted from twin prop passenger aircraft|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75201.html|146|ndxe200710| Chrome sphere(s) over farmland outside Sacramento California spotted from twin prop passenger aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying on a twin propeller engine passenger aircraft from Palm Springs to Sacramento. i spotted a total of 3 seperate sphere&#39;s traveling in straight lines in different directions, they appeared one at a time and no two were visible at the same time. there was one, then 2 minutes later another, then 4 minutes later the final one appeared and flew out of sight just as the first two had. The aircraft was approximately 20-30 minutes south of Sacramento. i was sitting in the window seat on the left side (facing forward) of the aircraft looking out the window trying to pass the time. i often have my nose glued to the window looking out during flights so it&#39;s not unusual  or random that i was gazing out the window at that particular moment. i observed the first sphere traveling above the ground heading south westish (based on the assumption that we were indeed traveling North). it was very difficult to determine speed and size of each sphere because I was tra! veling in the airplane. the airplane i was in was traveling about 10-12K feet, or however high those airplanes fly during travel(horizon airlines). we were at cruising altitude, that is, we never appeared to go any higher than that for hours at a time, and only descended for landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sphere was like a ball of light, likely emitting light rather than reflecting (although if this ball was chrome or mirrored as was the second, it COULD also have been simply reflecting sunlight). since it never lost its brilliance, i assume it was emitting light rather than reflecting. i got the brief impression that it was lite-green in color.  this sphere was farthur from my eyes and closer towards the earths surface so i could observe it for about 6 seconds before it flew out of line of sight from my little window. i was taken by slight surprise by this because it was the first one and moderately gained my attention. it seemed to be traveling quickly, faster than the cars traveling nearby. i would approximate the size of this one to be slightly larger than a minivan. if one were to crush a short school bus into a sphere that would be about the size, approximately. again very hard to determine considering that i was in a moving airplane at about 10K feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing to stare out the window, i was eager to see it again. between this sighting and the next i could see a small small recreation/agriculture airplane and make out the fusalage from the wings. so i&#39;m very confident that this first object (along with the subsequent 2) was a perfect sphere, not birds or planes. and i&#39;m very confident that the first object was in motion. so after a brief minute or two another one flew by, this time it was headed directly in the direction we had come from. this second sphere was what really got me intruiged, this one appeared to be less than 300 ft away from the aircraft. Way close! it traveled at the same altitude, didn&#39;t go up or down, it was traveling in a straight line directly south.  this sphere was definately chrome in color, about the size of a minivan. it was very hard to determine if it was just floating there or traveling rather slowly. if it was floating in place and the airplane passed over it (not directly because i could st! ill see it from the windows on the side of the plane) it would appear to the observer to be moving. so it&#39;s difficult for me to determine if it was moving in a straight line south or whether it was simply floating. i asked several people in front and behind my seat (same seating oreintation) if they &#34;saw that?&#34;. i was frustrated that they hadn&#39;t and I had caused a minor disturbance on the plane because i was frustrated that nobody was looking out the window because they would have also seen it. i was mad that they missed this event because they had their face in a book. i was essentially trying to find another witness but nobody else claimed they saw it. accepting that this was likely to be a personal experience i let it go and continued to press my nose against the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> several minutes later i spotted the final and most distant sphere. this was bright in color, no hints of green, only white, bright white. this one was traveling West, of the three seperate objects, this one appeared to be closest to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> upon landing, i found a pilot sitting in the small Sacramento Airport that we were awaiting our flight transfer at. i asked him if he knew what a chrome colored sphere shaped object would be doing in the air? he immediately suggested a balloon and i was disappointed at the thought that a balloon makes sense. weather balloon or party balloon. so i then asked him how many balloons he has seen in the air during his career (excluding hot air balloon), he responded with zero balloons. i described our flight path and he said, &#34;aah, yes i just flew on that flight&#34;. unspecific to whether he was pilot or co-pilot, i will never forget his face, broad jaw like Elvis, i could spot him anywhere. he also admitted to having not seen the objects (or at least the up close chrome ball) for himself. i was the sole witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 spheres, one at a time, first one was lite-greenish headed opposite direction of plane, the second was way close and i got a very good look at it for the breif 2 seconds it was in sight. my eyes were able to lock on and focus on it before it dissappeared out of my line of sight, it was traveling in roughly the same direction as the first. and the third was faint, bright white and headed westward towards Pacific ocean. i have seen footage of an identical chrome sphere in a ufo clip filmed in Ventura California. i had always been intruiged by ufo&#39;s but after this sighting of mine i became very interested for approx 7 months before i was satisfied and no longer interested in persueing clips online or reading such books.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i was 20 yrs old. I have a difficult time believing that it (second Chrome sphere) was a balloon, a little girl would have to run into a random farm field and release it. im not sure if balloons remain inflated at that altitude. NOAA uses whether balloons that look very very similar to it, but i doubt that NOAA would release such a balloon in a flight path especially considering that they are aware of wind direction and speed, if this was a whether balloon, it definately posed a danger to the propellers. too close for comfort.<n>

I&#39;m pretty sure it was 7 lights orangish lights flying in perfect tangen. It could have been one space craft or several in perfect formation. This thing could not have been man made because it flew so fast... I saw it go across most of the sky and out of view in less than 10seconds. It was flying much higher then a plane and I coulden&#39;t hear anything... Kinda weird how I looked up just then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also it left a green and blue trail behind it... but right before we saw it we all saw a strange flash so we looked up(thinking it was lighting) and there it was. Also all night we observed what looked like a star except for the fact it kept moving to different spots (this is the rreason we were outside in the first place when we saw the blue and green squiggle). Im sorry if this seems out of order but I left this out: the saucer we saw left a green and blue squiggle trail behind it which is how we knew it wasn&#39;t an asteroid or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was stationary for a few minutes and then it dropped what seemed about 50-100 feet in the air and then it went back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it do that for about 2 minutes I ran to get my husband.  When we both came back we saw red, blue, green, yellow and white lights that seemed to rotate around it at a very fast rate of speed and it was moving slowly over the newly cleared land across from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed maybe 500 yards away and not far above the tree tops where the clearing ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept seeing a flash of light reflect from the ground and the trees every few seconds. It appeared that the craft was taking pictures of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went and got my brother to come look at it also. He stayed for a few minutes and then left us, I guess he got spooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was traveling very slow moving towards the south in a zig zag pattern.  My husband said it looked like a fish swimming in the water.  At one point a small light seemed to approach it and then it went dark, you could still see a silhouette of something there. It almost appeared that something went to look at it and then turned off its lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft eventually got so far away that we could hardly see it anymore.  We left when it was just a dot of light miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was crystal clear. There was a meteor shower going on too, several meteorites or just space trash burning up in the atmosphere that was staying visible longer than what seemed normal.<n>

They had blue and red pulsating lights. What caught my attention was when one of them moved and started to get closer. I saw these small UFO’s every night leading up to the morning of the 21st. I even had my son come outside and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of the 21st at 2::00 (am) I opened the front door of the house in Rochester Hills and I was stunned. There was an extremely bright star like object directly in line with my front door. It was distant at first but slowly moved closer and closer until I could make out its outline. I am 55 years old and I have never seen anything like it before. It was definitely nothing that I have seen in the sky or earth. The same satellite looking objects were also in the sky at the time holding stationary positions from left to right in the horizon. One was directly above the bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the bright object moved closer the wind blew the tree tops. I observed the bright object until 5:00 (a.m.). During that period of time it moved closer and then further away. It also moved from being dead center of my doorway to being to the right of the doorway. At 4:30 (am) the small satellites began moving slowly toward the big bright light and appeared to line up behind it. They then disappeared one by one inside of the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD))<n>

I seen in the northern sky what looked to be a flock of birds. When it came over me heading torwards the Twin Cities, the birds were not moving their wings and were moving too fast to be a bird. It was as high as the water tower, and the only thing that can move that fast is a prop engine or faster. It was completely silent and had no lights on it. it was a large v-shape and right behind it was a smaller v. It almost looked like it was trying to disguise itself as a flock of white birds. Birds cannot fly this fast or glide that fast. I estimate its speed as fast as the top speed of a Cesna aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ^ ^   ^ ^         ^ ^              ^ ^ ^   ^  It was in that formation, and moved as if it were one.

At 2330 I observed a very large orange sphere off to the west of our location moving south along a small mountain range. The sphere appeared to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter and had sharp edges . It was not moving very fast but then just blinked out, like turning off a light. I was turning to my left to ask my son-in-law if had seen it when the area was lit up by a very bright flash, like an old flash from a camera. So bright it made me blink my eyes although I was not looking directly towards the area it came from. My son-in- was looking in the direction the flash of light came from and stated that it wasnt like a quick flash on and off but took almost a second to develop then go off. He did not observe the sphere as I did as he looking to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We witnessed a total of 18 objects which were obscured by a bright red light, they were low approximately 1000 - 500 ft off the ground (they came in over the tree tops) you did not see them from a long distance off, they were traveling south to north directly along the magnetic pole. They were approximately the size of a Cessna plane. They traveled in pairs one behind the other at an approximate lapse of two minutes and another pair would follow. The last pair, the one in the lead went off map north and the other caught up and turned 90 degress to the right after it had appeared to stop. They moved at an extreme rate of speed. There was not a whisper of a sound (as an object passes thru the atmosphere it displaces air thereby there should have been sound - there was not).  Looked at thru binoculars only could see light. Called 911 and reported the event and they stated they would advise officers in the area. The sky was bright and clear.  This was not a laser effect (one of the individuals has worked on stage with such items).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A little ways past his house we noticed a very bright light to our left. Looking at it first I said &#34;Why is that plane flying so low&#34;? But then it dropped down from where it originally was and was coming closer to our car. That’s when my friend said &#34;That’s not a plane&#34;. The shape of the UFO was triangular with white lights on each of the corners and a big red light in the center. It also had many other little lights but are harder to remember. I rolled down my window to try to take a picture with my camera cell phone, and that’s when I noticed that the UFO was completely silent. No noise of an engine or anything, dead silent. I took a picture on my phone, but it turned out very blurred, it was just a blurry splotch of light on my phone. The craft then rose up higher after passing over our car and moved into the distance out of our sight. After seeing this we were both in shock because of how close our encounter was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I spoke with the witness who had little to add except that the sighting occured in the Pierpont area around Hwy 163 and N.  - B.

10/20/07 20:30|Cincinnati|OH|Disk|5 minutes|UFO sighted on Oct 20, 2007 8:30 pm near downtown Cincinnati|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59392.html|168|ndxe200710| UFO sighted on Oct 20, 2007 8:30 pm near downtown Cincinnati<n> <n><n> <n><n> One the evening of October 20, 2007, I was driving on Kyles Lane in Ft. Wright Kentucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 15 year old daughter, a passenger in the car, started screaming hysterically that she saw a UFO. I laughed it off, thinking it was lights from a nearby ambulance reflecting off of something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quarter mile up the road she screamed again, telling me to look to my left, towards downtown Cincinnati.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I caught my first glimpse of the object.  It was obvious that it was not something normal, but I was seeing it between trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove a little bit further up the road it was clear as day to me. The object was lit up bright white with vertical tan marks on it that looked like shadows of some sort.  It was somewhat of a disk shape, with another bubble type disk at the top.  Its size was something I couldn&#39;t comprehend the possibility of it being able to hover in the air. It was easily the size of 3 city blocks squared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on Kyles Lane until I came to the bridge over Interstate 75, where I slowed to a near stop. Here we saw the object was within 2 miles of us, bright as could be, hovering just to the west of downtown Cincinnati.  We were both amazed that none of the other cars seemed to notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was in total disbelief, on the phone with a friend who lived nearby, telling her to stand in her front yard facing Cincinnati and tell me if she saw it.  She saw nothing. Due to traffic I was forced to continue driving. I changed my course by heading south down Dixie Highway towards Covington and the Ohio River. At this point we saw it again, but this time it was much farther away, I&#39;m guessing 30 to 40 miles north of the city. The shape and brightness of it was so distinct there was no confusion as to that being the same object. I sped down the hill on Dixie Highway towards Covington, trying to get near the river, and a better spot. I was hoping to find someplace to park with a clear view. I lost sight of it again while going down the hill, but once at the bottom, going east to! wards Fi fth Street we saw it for the final time. I was now near the river again, only this time it was east of Cincinnati, about 20 miles from the first sighting. Being a non-believer, I have gone over every possible scenario in my head, trying to convince myself I didn&#39;t see what I saw. There is also the fact that my daughter saw it, first I might add, and was completely shaken up to the point of hysterical crying and shaking that I could not console her in the least. I considered taking her to the hospital to be sedated, she was that upset. I also realized that I was shaking while trying to tell the story to a friend where my daughter was spending the night. I spent the rest of the night and the next morning trying to decide whether I was going to tell anyone. I consider anonymously calling the police station and saying &#34;Look, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy, but have you had any reports of a strange bright object seen around the city in the sky?&#34; I watched every news report for several days and scoured the newspapers, but I have seen no mention of anything that could even remotely be what we saw. There was a blimp in town the next day for a football game, but it was nowhere near the right shape and at least 10 times too small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So help me here, please. Are both my daughter and I certifiable insane or did someone else see this also?<n>
10/20/07 20:20|Crown Hill|WV|Triangle|5-7 minutes|One huge Black triange with white lights followed by a second smaller triangle with blue lights|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61200.html|169|ndxe200710| One huge Black triange with white lights followed by a second smaller triangle with blue lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 39 years old and currently functioning as an RF (Radio Frequency) Engineer for a regional PCS (CDMA) service provider. I have had 5 UFO sightings to date. Now that Ive covered a little background, let me get right to the latest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 10-20-2007  Location: N 38 : 12 : 11  Lat      (NAD83) W -81 : 23: 54  Lon  West Virginia (Crown Hill area)  Time: 8:20pm  I had to travel to Tazewell Virginia for business that day and my trip home was around 2 hours. After dark I checked the night sky on a regular basis, I usually do this since it increases the odds for seeing things, sounds simple, but a lot more people would be seeing these things if they could forget their problems for a moment and just look up. As I was traveling west on route 60 between two small towns, Hansford, and Crown Hill my attention was drawn to the brightest star in the sky, since it happened to be near my field of view when I glanced upward from the wheel to scan the sky for anything of interest. Having stared at the bright star for a second or two I dropped my gaze below the star and discerned that I could distinguish the mountain top from the sky since my eyes had adjusted to the night, and the fact that there is a strip mining operation located along the top of the same mountain providing some ambient lighting helping to clearly define the top of the mountain against the black star filled night. OK cue the Twilight Zone Theme, here&#39;s what happened at that point. For a completely unknown reason I glanced back at the highway, just to be safe, I had not seen another car for some time and after making sure I was still driving safely I looked back up, but I stopped short of actually looking at the bright star and instead became fixated on an area just below the star I had looked at previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking &#34;Why am I looking at en empty piece of sky?&#34; Before I could even formulate another thought a large orb of white light appeared, Ok, let me explain how this appeared, it started as a small pinpoint of light and grew to a large orb of white light, fast, but slow enough that I mentally registered the observation. I believe I stared at this for about 5 seconds before I witnessed another orb appear to the right of first orb, it arrived in the same manner as the first but appeared to be slightly smaller. I will try to explain this next part as clearly as I can. After the first two orbs appeared they were followed by around a dozen more, with each orbs appearance taking 1/2 the time as the last, accelerating in speed until all 12 had fully appeared in a loose straight line in the sky, I remember thinking wow, that looked like a computer controlled sequence of lights. At this point I decelerated down to about 25 mph, I know this area is not heavily traveled so I wasn&#39;t concerned since I was alone on the highway. At this point I was convinced that I was looking at a small fleet of luminous orb UFOs, I remember getting nervous and a bit frightened when I noticed that it looked like the orbs on the far right were moving. I thought I was going to witness ariel feats of a dozen UFOs hovering over the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly realized I was actually looking at a huge triangular configuration of around 16 large white orbs. At this point I swallowed hard and felt a lump in my throat, I did have the resolve enough to roll down the window and listen for sounds. You guessed it, no sound at all. At this point I went for the phone to get a picture, it politely refused to go into camera mode, seems the battery was too low, that&#39;s another weird story in itself. I then fixed my concentration back on this triangular formation of white orbs of light. It was heading straight for me, but it was also rotating on its axis without banking. It rotated until the point of the triangle was pointing north from its previous eastward orientation. At that point it began travelling north from its previous eastward course, all without banking, it remained plum while rotating to achieve a new azimuth heading. It was on course to pass over my view. Before I continue I want to stress that given the nature of the appearance of these orbs, as in how they appeared, one after another in a clearly timed and perfectly executed nature, I am left with only two conclusions given the data I witnessed myself, one is that this object for all purposes de-cloaked in a timed sequence before my eyes, or two, the object materialized from some other time/space/dimension. Needless to say both are quite humbling to see/contemplate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lets get to the size of this object, I call it an object because once I could see underneath this thing, it was blocking out the stars, and the large orbs of light were clearly following the leading edge of this triangular object that occupied the space in between the orbs. The orbs were anomalous, hell, everything about this was anomalous, I felt like I was in overload mentally because nothing was correlating to any prior experience. I could not resolve a single thing about this that made sense, it was ominous and very disturbing to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at approximately 700 - 800 feet in altitude and roughly 1/8 mile ahead of me and took up 3/4ths of the windshield in a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It appeared to have a convex semi circle rear on it judging from the orbs of light in the back. Let me explain the high strangeness of these lights around the perimeter of this object. I looked intently for any signs of these being mounted to the side of a solid object, I could not see anything that indicated that these orbs of light were attached to the black mass that they clearly were following in perfection with, as a matter of fact I felt a cold chill of fear and amazement when I realized that the dark mass that was clearly blocking out stars as it passed overhead, was blatantly, absolutely refusing to reflect any light from the obvious orbs that were mere inches from it!  I noticed then that another white orb of light had appeared at dead center underneath the light absorbing black triangular mass. This new orb was blinking on and off, in a slow repeating cycle. I looked for a refection of light from the undercarriage of whatever this black triangular mass was, but to no avail, the Orb of light would appear and then disappear, I said it that way because it didn&#39;t power down and back up, it simply was there then gone then back again. I laughed out load at this point, I was just in awe at this, and let my analytical side take a break, I just tried to take it all in and experience it rather than trying to understand it, my logical mind sort of passed out from overload.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I actually physically jumped at what happened next. one instant there was a black star filled open sky in front of this huge triangular object, the next instant there is another black triangular object travelling at the same speed, in the same direction, and within approximately 100ft of the first object. I was utterly just numb at this point and reverted back to my logical mind as the trauma of a second triangle appearing like a David Copperfield finally sent everything else I had into shock. The second black triangular craft did not share the luxury of a light absorbing hull as its big brother continued to disturb me with. Rather this new entity gave me a couple of things I could relate to, one it reflected light, and two the lights appeared to be fixed to the object and quite visibly had a housing around them. Let me point out that the new object had all blue lights, and more interestingly enough they appeared to resemble LED lights in appearance. This new triangle looked like the classic Belgium triangle with the difference being it had blue lights, three of them positioned at each point of the triangle respectively. The other noticeable difference in comparison to the Belgium triangles was the fact that I could clearly see an elaborately geometrically designed housing covering these blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t make out much detail from the blue light reflected from the undercarriage of the new triangle, but I was relieved a little in knowing it did reflect light, unlike the disturbingly huge triangle that defied physics in every detail of its existence, and somehow absorbed light, it was like a triangular black hole, very disturbing to witness. At this point I watched them both disappear over the mountain to my north from the view of the passenger side window. I drove a few more miles before I really snapped out of it. I told my wife and two children as well as two of their friends all about my encounter three times in even more excruciating detail than here. I couldn&#39;t sleep and in the end I worked a full day on two hours sleep, full days are usually 10 hours for me, but I was still energized from the night before. As a footnote, I work in a building that is directly in line with the Charleston airport, I watch C-131&#39;s fly over at a very low altitude, I am fully aware of the size of this aircraft at various altitudes and I estimate that it would take 16 of these flying at the same altitude in a tight V formation to roughly equal the size of the first triangle, they would also need to be fitted with large round lights mounted on extensions from the hull to simulate the orbs, so a mistaken aircraft this is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am very familiar with the night sky here, and the normal forms of air traffic, and I instictivly knew this was out of the ordinary. 15 seconds into the sighting, the bright light split into two separate lights, one moving off in an approximate south bound direction, and the other moving in an approximate north bound direction. The speeds seemed very slow, almost as if they were sattelites, but they were definelty at a lower altitude. The north bound light disapeared suddenly at about 1 minute into the sighting. At this time, I broght the south bound object to my wifes attention, and we both observed this light traveling across the sky slowly. It was traveling in our general direction. At about three minutes into the sighting, the object was observed to dim greatly in an instant, but was still observable. It then was observed that the object appeared to move straight up, and instantly disapeard. This was no normal sky traffic, and to top it off, it all happend at the same time that San Francisco went dark for their annual &#34;Lights Out San Fransico&#34; event, where much of the city&#39;s lights went dark for one hour. This sighting left us shook up, and slightly frightend.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Observed a bright white light over the ocean to the West of me, at first I thought it was a shooting star but it had a level coarse headed right towards me heading East bound straight as a arrow, its altitude appeared to be 5,000 to 10,000 ft I took my foot of the gas and rolled my window down to hear its engine or whatever noise it was generating, however as it went across the front of my car there was no noise only the typical sound of air going by my window at about 45mph. As soon as it went by I saw an orange and white sphere on its stern the colors were moving in the sphere like an orange and white marble in motion. The object continued on its course to the East past Camarillo and over the hills as it was going over the hills the sphere flickered out. The whole incident happened within 8-10 seconds. I believe I observed the craft from 75 miles to the West ! and 75 miles to the East in that time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done some calculations and my deductions conclude the craft to be traveling at 900miles per minute or 50,000 miles an hour, which could of circled the earth twice in an hour. I will never forget it<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

So we got our coats and went out onto the porch and started walking towards my barn where I keep my horses and dog. Out of nowhere we saw this light and an object that had a metal look to it. It was easy to see because  the light was surrounding it. The object (we couldnt really identify the shape) was moving slowly throught the sky as if it was looking for something. At first we thought it was a helecopter but it didnt seem to have blades (on the top) and it was not making nosie like a helecopter does. It seemed like everything around us was still and silent. We started walking towards the barn, again, and i could hear my dog barking. We still had a strange feeling and i got goosebumps as we started moving closer to the barn and towards the spacecraft. Then the object starteed moving towards us very slowy (still looking for something, i think) and thats when me and my friend started to get scarred so we turned around and ran back into my house. When we got in i looked out the window and the object was gone. The next morning we went back out to look around the feild and there was no traces of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I could barley make it out at first, but as it got more over head I could see that it was a boomerang shaped object, moving very fast, made no noise and there were no visable lights. I watched this object as it headed towards the east until I lost sight of it, the whole thing lasted about 10-15 seconds. afterwords I tried to figure out what I had just seen and couldnt come up with anything other than a UFO.<n>

After finishing construction job in WY. I returned home and took several items to the Houston Gem and Mineral society and it was suggested that it was a petrafied stump. After returning home I struck the object with a8lb. hammar and it seperated into 1 large piece and six of lesser size. Upon inspecting Ifound that this was no stump neither was it like anything I have ever seen. The largest piece a Queer shape likend to a deformed somewhat humanlike appearence and the smaller pieces fist size and some alittle bigger there appears to be some typy of foreign script and odd looking what seem to be pictures. I photographed the pieces and stowed them until about a week ago. When I removed them from storage to rephotograph them with a digital camera so I could send to you I noticed that the pieces of this object seem to have degreded considerable. While re-examining the object Idecided to make magnafied observations and what I see are on the outer a clear woven pattern while investigating I soaked 1 piece to see if it had any effect and it did. The piece gave a strong plastery smell and showed fibers and very promenent geometric patterns became apparent. This is truely worth scientific N.D.T and destructive testing if nessary.

I live near an airport and am use to seeing planes fly over head, but this object had no lights and made no sound. My initial sense was a circular object with a lighter colored leading edge in a chevron shape. It moved swiftly covering about half the sky in a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes I saw a similar object about half a mile east of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and woke my girlfriend and told her what I had seen. I tried to assimilate what it could have possibly been. Ranging from a glider to stealth planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed my neighbors outside and told them what I had seen. Within minutes we saw it again. 3 groups, the first looking like what I had seen, then two more groups. Oddly, the last two groups appeared to be birds. One group had 2 &#39;birds&#39;, strangly and eerily glowing in the night. I could barely discern &#39;flapping&#39;. The other group had maybe 3 &#39;birds&#39; in it. But they moved so swiftly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to compare mentally the differences in what I had seen before and after I had witnesses, and it seems they looked more like birds after I talked to the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disparity in viewings comes from the apparent speed of the objects as they flew overhead. I cannot seem to shake the feeling that these are not birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough, as many times as I have went outside to smoke cigarettes at night. I have never noticed these &#39;birds&#39; in any season. Let alone the three shooting stars I have also witnessed in the sky this night. I have never seen so many shooting stars in one night, let alone my whole life...and 3 ofthem within an hour along with these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Similar description at another location at    http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54739.html.<n>

This new object was moving in and out of the cloud cover .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The new object seemed slightly different in shape , but still had very bright red and white flashing lights . After watching it , and then seeing another very similar type object we decided maybe it was a plane . It appeared something dropped out of the 2nd object , later I thought it was a falling star possibly.  In total there were 3 items seen . 2 moving , possibly planes although incredibly low for jets . The first item , very unusal in shape  and motionless other than flashing lights  was a ufo of sorts and not a plane.<n>

I said to her, “What is that, a blimp?” and she responded jokingly, “No it’s a UFO!” We first saw the object when we were about a mile away from it.  As we got closer our mouths dropped open and we both just said “what the  ....” We were shocked.  It was right above us just hovering over the road.  You could see the UFO almost perfectly.  It had three bright lights on the bottom in the shape of a triangle.  It was saucer shaped, silver a little &#34;bubble&#34; type thing on top.  It was spinning and just hovering.  We pulled over because we wanted to get a better glimpse.  There were about six other cars behind us that were also stopped looking.  As soon as we pulled out the camera it moved upward behind the clouds, (it was a cloudy night) Like I said, it was clearly visible and big but you could tell it was a pretty good distance above.  At first sight it was hovering below the clouds but once people started stopping it hovered up farther into the sky.  It started to move west so we decided to follow.  Once again we pulled over and started trying to take pictures but every time I would move so we could see it would move a little more hiding being the treetops.  We took five pictures with my friend’s digital camera.  Then it vanished behind the treetops.  There was a bank parking lot so we decided to pull in the lot and park.  As soon as we parked and were about to get out we started hearing this strange loud noises.  Noises I honestly can not explain.  We have NEVER heard anything like it.  For some reason, as scared as we were we got out because we wanted to see if we could actually see what was making those noises.  It almost seemed like two “aliens” communicating to one another.  We were both just frozen there so scared and then all of a sudden the noises started going “crazy” and a dog that was in the backyard where the weird noises were coming from started barking and honestly seemed like it was being att! acked so we jumped in the car and took off.  We both were just stunned and so scared.  Neither one of us really believed in this, until now that is.  After returning home we decided to see what her camera had caught.  All the pictures were gone except one which you can barely see anything.  If you zoom in you can see a white object.  Now this was the last picture taken and this was when the UFO was going away before it vanished.  This area was very lit up and there were a lot of clouds in the sky, but you can see none of that except the UFO. This should tell you how bright it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was a meteor, but it appeared to explode, but instead of disintegrating, it split into 3 bright lights and they began circling each other. The lights seem to be suspended in mid air as they hovered around each other and moved up and down. One at a time they would disappear and reappear. At one point we think there were 5 lights. This continued for 4-5 minutes then we saw what looked like helicopters surrounding the lights. It seemed they were moving further from us and eventually they all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about it, but decided it was probably pilots from Carswell or pilots practicing for the air show scheduled at Alliance Airport that weekend. However, with all the news recently about odd sightings we decided we should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be a large oval shaped ufo and a small little one below the big one in the far distance. The objects were not visible with the naked eye, but the camera was able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been a default with the camera because the object only appeared in one spot in the sky and no where else. as you can see on the photos the object doesn&#39;t appear in the same position every time.  Therefore, it could not have been something on the lens.<n>

10/19/07|Keller|TX|||Large Orbs of Light over Keller/Southlake on 10/19/2007|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59350.html|200|ndxe200710| Large Orbs of Light over Keller/Southlake on 10/19/2007<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/19/2007 my husband, and I were sitting on the back patio at our home when to the east of us I first noticed what appeared to be a very large meteorite entering the atmosphere, (from west to east) it had a very long, wide tail behind it.  This lasted 5 seconds or so before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our daughter had joined us on the patio and about 20 minutes later I noticed in the approximate same spot in the sky as I had seen the meteorite 3 very bright large lights just stationary in the sky, in a shape of an arch.  One on top, one below it but slight out to the right and then a 3rd beneath it, and slightly into the left.  Suddenly a 4th light appeared parallel to the second but much farther to the left of the others.  Then a 5th appeared, and then the 1st one disappeared and then reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not fading in or fading out they just appeared.  There were stationary the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went in to get his camera and took a picture of three of the lights, but the shutter speed was not correct and the picture did not come out very good.  Our daughter grabbed her digital camera and came back out with the video feature turned on.  She captured a few seconds of it, but unfortunately handed me the camera and I not realizing she had it on video tape, held it down to my side, when she told me she was videotaping and I got it back up facing the direction the lights were in they had all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were over the Keller/Southlake direction looking toward the airport.  There were several plans visible in the sky, and these lights were 100&#39;s of times larger than planes. We snaped a picture of a plane that was in the sky, slightly further away and to the south east of us, the difference in size is incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the news last night and this morning thinking that several people would have reported seeing this, but have heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would expect that pilots flying in and out of DFW would have reported this sight to the Tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the picture my husband took today and was surprised at what I saw.  I was expecting to see three blurry blots of light, but instead all three look like a child had scribbled in the night sky using lights. The video my daughter took clearly shows two of the lights or orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No time for the sighting indicated by witness.  PD))<n>

The three-lighted objects flickered from green to white to a pinkish color at an astonishing rate.  Two of the smaller objects seemed to make a circular path away from the central stationary light, one to the north and one to the south coming back to the original point from where they started and began the process over.  We watched this happen for about 20 minutes and then the two outer lights faded away and a minute or two later the one that was stationary and the brightest followed suit and faded away.  This is not the first time we’ve witnessed something like this over the north Texas skies.  There has been at least four other occasions and all of the sightings have been at around the same time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stayed at an oceanfront hotel and the first evening we arrived, we went downstairs to take some pictures of the indoor lazy river and the outdoor pool area of the hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a very bright white light with a little red in it, in the sky over the ocean.  Thinking it was a plane at first, we still continued to watch it because it was so bright!  It was moving very slowly to the left (north).  After about a minute or two, another light shot out of the bright one (to it’s left) and then 2 other lights lit up in a straight diagonal line with the one that had shot out.  They lit in sequence at evenly spaced intervals of time (about 2 seconds apart).  They were bright white also with a little red in them, but were smaller in size than the initial one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial bright light and the 3 other smaller lights all moved very slowly to the north in the same formation (still over the ocean).  The initial bright one went out after a couple of minutes and the smaller 3 lights went out about a minute later, one at a time and at evenly spaced intervals of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just a few seconds later, we could see 2 very small white lights traveling at a very fast rate of speed much higher up in the sky.  One was slightly below and behind the other.  They were also traveling northward.  We did see a plane in another section of the sky, and observed that these smaller white lights were moving so much faster than the plane!  We have no idea what any of these lights were, but we were certainly fascinated by them.  Dumbstruck might be more like it.  I had a camera in my hand and didn’t think about taking a picture until after the first bright light had already gone out.  I tried to take a picture of the other 3 lights that formed the diagonal line, I used the 12x zoom, but I had just gotten this digital camera and am still learning how to use all the different settings, so the picture came out very grainy.  The lights also look rather orange in the picture, but in person they were white with a bit of red.  Just to note: the other pictures I took outside that night (before we saw any of the objects) didn’t come out as grainy as the picture of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would love to have an explanation of what these lights were.  My husband and I are pretty skeptical people when it comes to UFO’s, aliens and the like, but this experience is certainly one that we will remember for the rest of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had first joked to my sixteen year old daughter in the car with me &#34;look at that ufo&#34; when we both realized that it was indeed a ufo!  The width of the triangle was as wide as a large jet plane, and all the lights on it were white and one very noticeable red light in the center.  The craft had lights but occasionally three beams of light would burst from the craft for a few seconds and then the light would dim and there were either clouds or the light or the craft itself made the air around it seem to be hazy and smoky like feathery clouds around it.  Then there would be darkness around the craft again and it was not possible to see if the dark sky had clouds or if the object was making the smoky swirling cloudlike haze around it.   It was moving very very slowly, and was very low.  It made no sound.  Then it drifted away and we were unable to follow it since we were on our way home and we live on the lake.  The object moved slowly down the lake unil we were unable to view it any longer.  It was extremely large and had at least six white lights on it and the red one in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It faded out over a five second period. Within 30 seconds  I saw the same object several miles or degrees to the North. It also slowly faded out. I searched the sky for minutes looking for moving clouds or other circumstances which would have caused the fading lights. After about 3 minutes I had one last sighting, this time two lights right next to one another. They also faded out in 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/18/07 21:10|Gillingham (UK/England)||Light|3 mins|Large and Bright light with Steady Course Vanished|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59316.html|206|ndxe200710| Large and Bright light with Steady Course Vanished<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I live there is a large amount of overhead commercial traffic. Both myself and partner generally stand at our back door to smoke, as we prefer not to smoke in the house. We are both sensible, yet open minded people. I am ex Royal Air Force so Im pretty used to seeing many things up in the air (I stress that Im not or ever have been a pilot). We both take great delight in watching the skies at night and have witnessed many things but never have I considered any of them to be a so-called UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither I nor my partner could identify it, so I have labelled it as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event is quite unremarkable and possibly has a valid explanation, I was however left slightly confused after the event but by no means will I exagerate anything witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in question had no shape (round shaped if any) or visible form other than a very bright white light. It was spotted initially whilst my partner and I were facing South. With any aircraft in the area its very easy to determine distance and height, and additionally you can hear each individual aircraft. This however, was substantially different as it was near impossible to ascertain its real height or distance, which struck me as odd given the intensity of the light. Initially it looked considerably low for any type of aircraft, and I had also assumed at first that these must be lights at the front of an aircraft but its heading (approximately a NW to SE direction) did not confirm this. The object moved in a straight line without any deviation but moved rather slowly. (again I discounted the fact that this could have been a shooting star due to the speed of travel). We both would have discounted this totally had it not been for the end result of this light. After a couple of minutes the intense light seemed to diminish. Not so much fade out but seemed to get smaller very quickly to the point that it resembled a faint and distant star, until at last it vanished. During this time its movement did look constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldnt have considered submitting this if it had not been for the latter detail, and of course the other facts brought together.  I have discounted fireworks also, given that the course and apparrant height was linear and never deviated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This, of course, was impossible.  I pointed it out to my brother and then I saw it move...and I said &#34;Ah, must be a plane&#34;.  It continued for a few seconds on it&#39;s path and then stopped.  And then I said &#34;Ummm, that&#39;s not a plane&#34;.  It was a white dot, basically.  Way too high up to be a helicopter, and I don&#39;t know of any aircraft that can go that high and come to a stand-still.  At this point we were fixated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly - and I mean out of nowhere - two other dots appeared and seemed to fly in formation for a few seconds.  The 1st one we had seen starting moving again and then changed course in a highly dramatic way - as in &#34;right angles&#34;.  The dots would appear and disappear.  I then yelled over to my neighbor, who arrived with another adult friend and 2 children.  We ALL saw these things.  I grabbed my camera and filmed for a few seconds, capturing one of them on film (albeit just a white dot in a blue sky).  On the audio track of it you can hear one of the kids getting scared, another kid saying &#34;oooh i see them!&#34;.  I called Andrews AFB and they ref&#39;d me here.  (I told the guy &#34;Look, I&#39;m not a UFO guy, but if you just look out your window towards the moon you&#39;ll see what I mean!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called the air traffic control tower and the Dept. of Homeland Security at LAX and got answering machines.  Go team!  I have no idea what to suggest from this. By definition, they were UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have zero affiliation with anything having to do with UFO&#39;s, this was just a crazy thing that 6 of us saw and I wanted to make a record of it here in case it helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They looked stationary, which seemed odd, so I got my 30 power binoculars out and went out on my deck to get a better look.  I watched these two lights for about 5 minutes which stayed at the same altitude (I’d guess about 2,000 feet) and parallel to each other.  They were rock solid and did not move up or down and stayed the same distance from each other.  I’d estimate they were at least 100 yards, maybe further, from each other and very large and bright.  The light emitted seemed elongated on the bottom side of the lights, so maybe the light of both was being directed downward.  There were no other lights such as colored navigation lights, strobes, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this was very odd.  I am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft lighting as I was an aircraft maintenance specialist (jet over two engines) in the Air Force.  This was no plane or helicopter(s) hovering.  All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes of observation, both lights slowly dimmed down to about 20% of the original intensity.  Then they began to move, one going lower than the other as if a very large craft in a banking turn to the north east.  It then moved to the east and I was amazed that this appeared to be a single craft, not two individual ones.  The lights still kept the same relative distance from each other and sped across the horizon in a matter of seconds, it was totally gone in 4 or 5 seconds.  I never was able to make out a clear structure, but believe it was a chevron or triangle shaped, by observing the lights and how they moved together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/16/07 06:55|Wheaton|MD|Light||Moving point of light in vicinity of Wheaton/Glenmont Metro|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59296.html|224|ndxe200710| Moving point of light in vicinity of Wheaton/Glenmont Metro<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near Cloverly, MD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/15 at around 6:47 A.M. I left the house to drive my husband to the Wheaton/Glenmont Metro Station.  I was traveling south on Layhill Road, and approaching Middlevale Lane, a side street on the left, when I noticed a bright point of light above the trees on my right side.  It was about the same size and magnitude as Venus, except it was in the southwest sky.  I saw that it was moving and wondered if it was a satellite, because it was a steady brightness and there were none of the navigation lights or beacons normally associated with an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it didn’t behave like I would expect a satellite to.  The point of light moved slowly from left to right above the horizon, stopped, resumed moving and then stopped again.  Though I was very interested in watching it some more and looked as long as I dared, Layhill Road descends sharply into a basin at this point and I lost sight of it behind the trees.  I went on and left my husband at the Metro station, drove back, turned around at Bel Pre Road and retraced the route again, just for curiosity’s sake.  This time the light was gone, and the clock in the car now read 7:05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to report this as a UFO, even though it struck me as really odd.  I know that out of the thousands of man-made objects orbiting Earth, occasionally one catches the light.  A little research turned up an Iridium flare in my area (Iridium 45), which would have been visible from that position at 6:43 AM at an azimuth of 165° (SSE), and an altitude of 40° from the horizon.  I have to consider that as a possible explanation, however, if I left home at 6:47, then I passed by later than the time of the flare, which only is visible for a few moments.  I have not found any other satellite passes that coincide with that date, time and location.<n>

I thought it was just an airplane. But it came back couple seconds later. I took a close look. It was a circular object with 3 bright white lights attached. It was moving within a small perimeter. It was not spinning or blinking. It appears and disappears in couple second cycle. When it disappears, it seems to disappear completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From what we could identify, it looked as if the objects were lighting up in different colors, such as blue, red, and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It must have been huge, because it was very high in the sky. I thought that it might be a bird at first, but it flew over, not under a nearby cloud/fog bank. Therefore I knew, that it wasn&#39;t a bird, and that it was very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wings were very large. I did not notice a body shape, just wings. I did not see a plane, but something much larger, shaped like the german flying v aircraft. If it was a plane, that high up, it would have appeared smaller. There was no sound emitted by the object. There was no light. Only the stars behind it were changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These objects were high enough above the horizon that I could see them but not high in the sky from my vantage point which leads me to believe these objects were a good distance away from where I observed them.  If an aircraft were to drop a flare right above you it would seem high in the sky, but if you were 10-20 miles away the flares would seem low on the horizon because of the distance which is how I could describe it.  These lights to me didn&#39;t seem like flares because they did not appeare one after the other. When they appeared it was almost like a formation of fighters that lit there after burners all at the same time only from the distance between the lights and myself it would not be redish white but more like a star.  These objects remained in the sky for about 3 min and then all disappeared like they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I noticed three lights in the same formation as the first formation only these light were due south of town.  They remained in the sky for only a minute and then disapeared as suddenly as they appeared. I am into weather and aviation.  I live and was raised in the air capital of the world and we have both an airport and military airbase here in wichita.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being that my eyes are always in the sky I know aircraft lights and these were not that.  Dont want to say that they werent aircraft but then again have never observed a formation of redish white lights as bright as a flare like that in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The red lights seemed to appear in the sky glowed brightly and then faded out.  The did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not tell how far away or how high they were because it was dark and the sky was a little overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw one light and then another appeared to its right.  Once these faded out there was another that appeared to the right and higher in the sky.  This light remained bright and then another appeared in front of it and to the left and then another as though there was a progression of them.  All the lights were red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was on October 15, 2007 at about 9:30 EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the coast guard and reported it since we didn’t know if this could have been a boat sending up distress flares.  While we were talking to them someone else called to report the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The person at the coast guard took the information and said that they thought it was something that the air force was doing.<n>

It did that twice in a row, and then the third time it got very bright then faded to this red color then broke off into three little circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a couple minutes later it disappeared from the left side of the sky then turned up on the right. It did that for about 10 - 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer to Mission the lights faded then disappeared.  After that we did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the next day that we found out that another person who lives close to the town saw the same thing we saw. She went online and reported it. But I’m not sure what sight she went to, to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just an amazing sight at what we all seen. I am still in shock that I saw that even though it happened a month and a half ago.  It was amazing. I believe that they were UFO’s in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate; no time indicated by the witness.  We have assigned an artificial time above.  PD))<n>

It did not make any noise and moved very slowing sometimes stopping briefly.  At one moment my friend commented that it looked like a giant key.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it would sometimes would fade in and out but it was definately not like the lights on an airplane.  It could have possibly been a helicopter but it made no noise at all.<n>

I thought it was a helicopter but it did not appear to be moving.  It was a dull matte grey color and looked like two inverted contact lenses with a little turret on top, with a large round blue/white light on one side.  Whatever way the object was moving was the way the light faced. A vehicle was stopped on the other side of the road with 3 occupants in it, watching the object.  1 female and 1 male were standing up in the bed of the truck and 1 male was standing on the dash of the driver’s side.  I pulled over, opened my car window and turned my vehicle off to see if I could hear anything.   I was about 60 feet from that vehicle, and sat and watched it for a while.   One of the males yelled over to me if I saw that, I answered yeah, that&#39;s why I stopped.  They asked what it was and I said I didn&#39;t know.  The object would stay in one spot for a while, then move very   slowly, then stop, then move again, never with any noise.  It finally arced around and moved faster away towards the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by MIG: Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to MIG for sharing the information with NUFORC.

10/15/07 18:00|New York City|NY|Teardrop|10 minutes|It was mat black and moved very slow West towards the Hudson River|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65034.html|235|ndxe200710| It was mat black and moved very slow West towards the Hudson River<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking South on 7th Ave and when I approached 16th Street I noticed the craft moving West over the tops of buildings down 14th Street.  It stood out because of how slow it was moving and very level.  The shape was sort of tear dropped but flat on the bottom. I would say it was about the size of a helicopter without a tail. The color was a mat black and I could not tell if it had any windows. It seemed to be about 100 feet above the tallest of the buildings on that block which is about 20 stories. The weather was clear and it was easy to see a great distance. Since it was moving so slow I really tried to see if there were props like a helicopter and there was nothing. I pointed it out to two people and they said it looked bizarre, they could not tell what it was either. They walked away not seeming too interested in fact, no one seemed to care about it or  notice it. It continued over the buildings and out over the Hudson River and then just slowly ascended upwards. Before it was over the Hudson I watched it&#39;s level in relation to the buildings and as far as I could tell it was moving in a straight line until it was out over the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

When I reached my car, I opened the door to get in, and I momentarily turned back toward the research buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a large object in the sky, and a quick comparison allowed me to estimate its altitude to be three times as high as the research building.  This was, of course, without knowing the ultimate size of the object, or the distance at which it appeared, so altitude was merely estimated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was a helicopter, being on the campus of a university hospital, but there was no sound - absolutely no sound.  This caused me to look closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be quite large, larger than a helicopter, and spherical in shape.  Metallic silver best describes the color, with flashes of reddish-silver as the object caught the bright sunlight.  The object appeared to be hovering, slightly bobbing back, forth, up and down, as if it was a gigantic weightless balloon, tethered to the ground, accosted by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the movements seemed different – as if they were defying gravity.  Up, then sideways, then quickly backward.  I’ve never seen any aircraft move that way.  Then, suddenly, the object shot upward and was nearly out of view within a few seconds.  I could still see the shining sunlight reflecting off of the object at its new altitude.  Suddenly, I was able to see a smaller, white object orbiting the object, which eventually shot off into the distance.  The object then ascended to an even higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down in my car, and rapidly opened my window.  The object was still visible.  I pulled out my phone and called my mother.  As she answered, I told her that I was seeing my first U.F.O. – and being a scientist, I wanted to rule out natural phenomena.  I mentioned the helicopter idea, but we both shot that down.  I mentioned an airplane – not likely.  A balloon?  It rose too quickly.  We couldn’t figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as if on cue, a helicopter appeared from behind the hospital.  It passed through the general area where I had originally seen the unidentified object.  This was clearly a helicopter, it was smaller than the object, I could see the red and white paint, and I could make out the unmistakable sounds of the rotors.  It was a perfect controlled comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I was able to see a passenger airplane pass in the distance.  The shape, size, and sound were unmistakable.  Another perfect controlled comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still visible, a mere pinprick of bright light, moving slowly back and forth in the high atmosphere, reflecting sunlight every few seconds.  Suddenly, the object faded from view.  A few seconds later, I viewed a jet approaching the area where the object had been.  I could easily see the wings and shape of the aircraft, although I couldn’t make out the exact type.  The jet proceeded on its course then it disappeared on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited a few more minutes, and the object appeared again.  Only for a few seconds, it quickly enlarged in size and then shrank off into the distance and disappeared for good.  It was 16:22 when I last saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for the events of this afternoon, although I can definitely say that the object was not a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was sleeping on the couch. The blinds in the room give off plenty of light, nearly enough to be daylight indoors. Therefore, even though they were closed, it was plenty light inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, while in a deep sleep, I woke up from a tap on the shoulder.

I saw a being with a cloak or hooded outfit walking away from me. The hood was on. The color of this cloak was a strong brightish brown color. The being was walking toward my garage door about 4-6 feet away from me. It was on a bit of a side angle at one point, and I saw the side of its face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a brownish-scaled face. Similar to the texture of the et in the movie ET. The look of its texture and appearance of skin, not the way it looked. Recall, I only saw it from a side angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The being then dissapeared, while walking toward the garage door. I was then wide awake by this time.

All I saw was a blue flame[s] behind, nothing. I could tell by the flame[s] that it was more than close enough to see the craft, but I just couldn&#39;t see it! It was moving fairly fast, but I couldn&#39;t even hear it. It was near Cheyenne Mountain, NORAD. Over a school called Pikes Peak Elementary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you know from the form, I&#39;ve been waiting a year to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you find anything, it probably won&#39;t be much.

Now it had lights on its 3 ends, which showed the length and shape. I saw this craft moving slowly towards the north, or following the Delaware river going north as it was a very large craft. I did not get to see a good picture of its body, as it was dark and it made no sound. Other planes or flight traffic in the area made noises of their flight. But this did not. I wish that it was what I saw, I may have seen a blimp as I could not hear a sound from it, and the fact that it had lights at the corners of it made me think about it being man made. Just wanted to report what saw and if any one else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It entered into my view from the edge of the roof of my house. So its appearance was constant, unlike a meteor that generally appears out of nowhere as it enters the earth&#39;s atmosphere. This object was within our atmosphere. I did not believe that it was a meteor because meteors generate a straight line as they pass and dissapear. This object changed direction. I was amazed that the speed it was travelling was similar to a meteor. It turned west and dissapeared out of sight. Not sure if anyone else saw this object. The object also generated a small propulsion tail as if it was powered. Maybe someone knows what it was. I find it hard to believe that we have technology to travel at this type of speed. Probably thousands of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Little Rock. Before disappearing into the trees (or disappearing completely?)the green light broke into approximately 4 pieces. At arms length, this craft or light would have been about as big (or as thick) as a #2 pencil and about 4 inches long. At first siting, it was located approx. 50-75 feet above the ground and when it disappeared was just at the tree-line.<n>

We were sitting poolside at the Bellagio hotel. I had been watching planes come in and out of the airport when I noticed a bright star-like object at about 60 degrees. I pointed it out to a couple of other people in our party, who remarked that it seemed unusual. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but its rate of motion, although slow, was faster than what I&#39;d expect for a planet or star. It was way too slow to be a satellite. It continued moving in a straight line until it was directly overhead. After that I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However it appeared to not be moving, and all of sudden it shot off to the west, then back east. It was moving side to side, and up &amp; down, at a slow pace. Then it would move in circles and zig-zags, continuing these patterns for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brothers came inside to get me out of bed and pointed it out to me, I saw it doing everything they had claimed it was doing. Through taking a look at different angles and using different reference points we were able to establish that it was between 50 and 100 miles away, likely over North Bend, Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unidentified light was out before they went outside, at approx. 11pm, and remained out until we all went to bed, after 1am, but it continued moving around and would be in different spots ranging from directly south to directly southeast, constantly moving, then stopping, and changing the pattern of it’s flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can’t come up with any logical reason for any sort of craft to stay in an area for so long, but it quite clearly was moving in a fashion unlike any craft we have ever seen on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It gave me an real weird feeling the way the moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving to dinner heading west towards State Street in Marysville Washington. My wife noticed to long black objects out to the west over the Tulalip Indian Reservation. Both object long and cylinder in shape stayed fairly even with each other, but were in a vertical position for the first 5 to 8 minutes. After arriving at restaurant my wife preceded inside with my youngest son. I could not take my eyes off the objects along with my oldest son do to the fact they had not seemed to move for a good amount of time. I first thought they were balloons tied together, but a commericial aircraft (DC9 I think) actually flew between the ground and the objects at about 6:40 P.M. This gave a great visual reference to the actual size and altitude of the objects in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the aircraft had passed the objects actually changed from a vertical position to a horizontal position and stayed approximately the same distance away from each other. I actually stopped one family coming out of the restaurant to show them but they were not interested at all and looked at me like I was crazy. Two younger men in there early 20&#39;s were going in and I stopped them to ask if they also could see the objects and they trying to figure it out also. After about 2 to 3 minutes the object ascended in altitude and then you could no longer make them out do to darkness and altitude of the objects. As the aircraft passed you could tell they were not balloons and were at a much higher altitude then a commericial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I cannot believe is that no one else in the city saw these objects and reported them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was closer in size to WWII-era zeppelins The object we saw had no markings, no tail fins, and no underbelly cab.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My driving speed at the time went with the flow of traffic, which I estimate to have been approximately 65-70 mph. Traffic was brisk, yet there were plenty of vehicles on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both observed the object for maybe 8-10 seconds before a line of roadside trees momentarily blocked our view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our view of the object was obstructed at the most for 3 seconds before we passed the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon passing said trees, we realized the object was gone from where we had been observing it, and instead we noticed a small circular object far in the distance, now seemingly many miles east of our location, as it appeared to be very close to the adjacent San Gabriel Mtns.<n>

I thought at first it was a helicopter but after a time I realized it was much too high for any helicopter to be flying. After nearly 10 minutes of travelling three quarters of the way across the sky it suddenly stopped. It remained stationary for a minute or two and then headed back the way it came toward the northwest. I assumed it was gaining in altitude as it did so because by the time it reached the northwest position where I first noticed it it was barely perceptable. I stood in the middle of the street and  watched it for aproximately 1/2 hour before it was too high in the sky to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approximately 11:15, noticed object approaching approximately from west, traveling approximately east, paralleling Route 50.  Appeared to be aircraft approaching head-on.  Noticed that there was no contrail, as with other jets in air at time.  As object approached overhead, turned approximately due north.  Did not seem to be aircraft or helicopter.  No change in perspective; object remained speherical in form, and did not change to oblong shape as aircraft would have.  Did not appear to be floating on wind currents, but looked to be propelled.  Was not satelite or space station, because did not travel in straight trajectory, was seen in daylight, and was traveling within earth&#39;s atmosphere.  Object disappeared from view at approximately 11:25.  Called Dulles Airport Operations Center, who contacted FAA radar center in Leesburg, VA.  No reports of weather balloons or other such objects in airspace at time.  Did not appear to be a small mylar &#34;party/birthday&#34; balloon, because did not drift with wind or rise on currents out of view, and seemed too high.  Travelled at constant altitude with constant velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Facing south, I look to the sky(as I always do) to look at the airplanes coming in for landing. I saw a light that looked like it could have been part of the flight path for LAS. The light was traveling from south to north-northeast changing shapes. Changing shapes like from diamond to oval to circle, at no pattern. At this point, I was transfixed. It took about 45 sec. to respond as I was not sure what I was looking at. Then two other lights, also flashing different colors and shapes, were lined up in the same area as I saw the first. All three were moving at the same speed and sames direction but at some distance apart. That was when I walked backwards to open the front door and ask someone to come out. My mother-in-law came out to see all three lights in the sky. It seemed to me that all three were going north-northeast on gaining altitude. We followed them for about 1:30 min. before it they were out of sight. The distance was about 30 miles in 2 minutes. That&#39;s about 900 mph. Unless it was military doing experiments or more than likely, UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was a police car pulling me over for a routine traffic stop, but that was not the case. When I came to a stop sign, I looked back, and I saw the lights floating in the air. I put my vehicle in park and stepped outside of my vehicle to get a better look and that’s when I saw the shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangular shaped craft. The points of the triangle were rounded. The lights, the color that I can only explain as being a “yellow that was almost white”, were just on the inside of the angle of the points.  The craft appeared to be rotating, floating still in the air. From where I was parked, the craft appeared to be approximately five hundred meters away, in area on the outskirts of my town, known as Meadow Creek, which is on the south end of town.  From where I was, the craft appeared to be approximately the size of a small sedan; perhaps the size of mine (Chevrolet Corsica).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing the craft, I immediately rushed home to grab my digital camera to take a picture of it. When I returned to where I had seen the craft, it was gone.  This report is being filled out at 2:25 on the same day that I witnessed the craft, so I do not know if there are any other witnesses to this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting comes off local reports of strange lights being seen on the north side of town last night during the early morning hours of December 12th, 2007. My grandmother, as well as other locals saying they witnessed three “strange” lights in “formation” in the sky. I did not witness that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He stayed in the family room for about 6 minutes. He then said, I want to show you something up in the sky it was brilliant and it changes colors, Green, Red, Blue and Yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He took me outside and showed me towards the East and another one on the South East. He said they have been in that same place since he got home and he thought it was and airplane at first because of the blinking lights, but then he noticed that they did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has the eyes of an Eagle, so I could not tell w/ the naked eye the different colors, I could see some color change but not real clear. Then when I got the binoculars and I looked at it and I screamed!!. It was definitely changing the 4 colors mentioned above. It was brilliant. He went and got the telescope and it really looked brilliant then. It seemed like the colors was going &#39;around&#39; the object. One time I saw through the binoculars like a &#39;light&#39; came out of it, cone shape like= &lt; that pointed towards the other one, that did not last for long. There was a haze around it that throbbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one in the South East seemed bigger or closer to us, than the one in the East. They both had the same color blinking around them. We looked at them until 3:00 AM and they were still relatively in the same spots. Both were too far for us to be able to tell what kind of shape they were. But if we had to guess we would say they might have been round, sphere, or saucer shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wondered if they might have been satellites. But surely a satellite would have moved w/ the earth&#39;s rotation in 3 hours times?!?  Would like to find out if anyone else saw then, and or, if they might have been satellites. Thank you for your time.<n>

I turned off the television about 9:30 p.m. and went to the window to see if I could discover whether the clouds had cleared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;clouds&#34; had been in the making all day by the double-barreled tanker planes that produce chemtrails.  I was checking the sky because I was hoping to be able to open the windows to let in some fresh air.  Since I just recently found information on chemtrails and am still learning about this, I wasn’t sure that it was safe to have my windows open if the “chem-clouds” were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was peering out the window into the dark sky, trying to determine whether I could see anything, a very large mass of light passed behind a chem-cloud showing me that, in fact, the chemtrails were still there.  I would call this a “ball” of light, except the mass was diffused behind the chem-cloud so I couldn’t see any precise shape to it.  But my guess was that it was a “ball” of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t make any sound. This wasn’t like anything I have ever seen before.  Stars and planets and planes all have small points of sparkling light that are either stationary or traveling in a mostly straight path.  This light was many times larger, like a huge cotton ball sliding down a winding path in order to stay behind the curved chem-cloud swooping like a giant bird, covering much more distance than a plane.  Its motion appeared almost playful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared in the east and swooped to the west.  As soon as it was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another one appeared in the east and swooped to the west like it was following the same identical winding path to stay hidden behind the chem-cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When that one was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another appeared.  It finally dawned on me that I should start counting.  So I can’t be positive, but I think that there were approximately 6 in all and identical in size, light, and path--except for the last one.  That one surprised me when it got to the west side, because it turned slightly and came back a short distance before it disappeared.<n>

The street was bustling w/ city night life. I looked up through the open sun-roof while stopped at a light and noticed a non-blinking, off white light and it was not moving fast nor did it have any other blinking lights. Then I noticed another one yars away, then another, then another, equal distance apart eventually forming what looked like a circle. It was just hovering and I could not see anything beyond the lights, just blackness. We eventually proceeded forward and the lights seemed as if they were moving slowly but we lost sight of them. I have never seen anything like them. My Mother had a theory that they were satellites? Really?<n>

The unidentified flying object moved upward, backwards, and then side-to-side. It was visible for approximately 45 minutes and still somewhat visible (with binoculars only) for about another 10 minutes. During this entire time, there we helicopters within a fairly close range circulating the object. I must say that this is my 2nd report submitted to this site. I’ve decided to remain anonymous because I am a mother, stepmother, and a wife living in a small community (depends on where you’re from…I’m from a bigger city). Moreover, I know that there is some danger in speaking about this. I guess I feel the need to report these sightings so that others know that they are not insane. Something very strange is going on in our skies and the media in our country seems to overlook the phenomenon. I feel like our government knows a lot more than they’re letting on. I encourage everyone to report what they see when they see it. I feel uncomfortable knowing that such a huge secret is being kept from us! One must ask why we’re being fed fabricated stories of air balloons and satellites being confused as UFO’s when it is evident (to me and many others) that this is not the case. I’m not a crazy drug-addicted person with nothing better to do than make-up wild science-fiction stories. I’m a relatively “normal” (by society’s standards) woman looking to the sky for answers. Also, I have witnessed chemtrails numerous times in the York skies. I don&#39;t know if there is a connection but I thought it was worth mentioning. I do have photos of these so-called chemtrails that I will submit to this site soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I estimated my location to be over either Indiana or Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the left side of the plane, the sky was clear and we were traveling over what looked to be countryside with a spattering of small towns as indicated by lights from the towns and darkness in the countryside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking out the window I saw 3 round lights down near the ground.

There were a maximum of three, and they would merge into one or two, and then split back into three.

I have a clear view of the Manhattan sky over the Hudson River. I noticed a very bright light directly over the Manhattan skyline.  It seemed brighter than a star and closer. A star (far away) was behind it. It was much tinier than the big light.  The light object did not move and remained in one spot, shining very brightly. I could not discern a shape, but it seemed oval like.  It stayed for a long time in the sky. When I checked back at 6.07am it was gone.  I wondered what it could be that would be static and shining so bright, and figure it might be a UFO or a very bright satellite,  but that didn&#39;t make sense since it seemed to hover in one place in the sky. I have a photo of the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

It would stay lit only a few seconds and go out. It reappeared in a different location and would only stay lit a few seconds and disappear. The last time I saw it it appeared to be saucer shaped and had a light at both ends - one of the others said they saw 3 lights that seemed to be moving around the center. Each time the object appeared it would disappear within a few seconds.

The night was especially clear…you could see thousands of stars and even what I believed were probably galaxies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the planets I was looking for, but I watched one particularly bright star (I thought) in the western sky.  It appeared far away.  The light continuously kind of jerked a bit (unlike the other stars).  As I watched it, I noticed that it moved down and to the right, then left, and then back into its original position (making a triangle).  It took apx. 5 minutes to complete the path of the triangle.  I watched for about 20 minutes and it continued to repeat the path during the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a shooting star fairly close to the bright object.  I did not see it burn out but it dropped below the horizon still very bright.  I went inside, found my cell phone to call my sister who lives approx. 20 minutes to the northeast of me to see if she could see the object and then returned outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I called my sister, I looked to the where the bright object had been, but it was now gone.  To the right of where that light had been I noticed 2 blinking red lights (much closer).  One was below and farther to the right of the other.  I assumed they were airplanes … but while watching those, the lower light immediately moved straight up to be on the same level as the other one (still to the right of it), taking only about 1 second.  It remained there for probably 5 seconds and then dropped back immediately into its original place.  This happened probably 4 times in the span of 3-4 minutes.  They both seemed to be moving slightly to the right during this time but not very far.  Then both lights suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, by the time I got my sister on the phone the red lights had already disappeared so I could not have her confirm it.  She lives in the city and the sky wasn’t nearly as clear where she lives.  We couldn’t find any other unusual occurrences.  I cannot explain what the bright light and blinking red lights were, but their movements were very unusual.  It’s suppose to remain very clear for the next several days here so I’m looking forward to viewing the sky tonight.<n>

We just moved into this area a month ago. I stood from my patio door and watched it just for a little while, and then I closed the door and blinds. I almost wanted to call my neighbor next door, to tell her about it, but I didn’t want to bother since it was late at night and she has 2 young children who might be sleeping. My husband was out of town on a business trip and it was just me and my 4yr old, he was asleep at the time that this was taken place.  The reason why I just now reported this is because I was searching to get some news from our daily newspaper, when I had saw an article saying people had spotted a UFO in the Tinley Park, IL location a few years back, and it kind of looked as what I had observed. Tinley Park is the area that we had moved from. But I had never seen anything like this ever before. If I ever see something like this ever again, I will surely grab my camera.  Thank you<n>

My roomate was having a cigarette out on the porch when he noticed an unusually bright star in the sky above the lake. He came and got me and i grabbed a pair of binoculars. To the naked eye, it appeared to be flashing. upon closer inspection through the binoculars, i could see that the light was flashing/pulsating different colors. It had a uniform sperical shape to it. at this point we were making various conclusions as to what it was. my other roomate dylan seemed convinced that it was a plane, but i was not so sure. it did not seem to be moving. the object remained stationary for some time (5 min) as we watched. It became brighter and slowly began moving to the right (Southwest), and proceeded to move behind a small patch of trees which were blocking our vision. the object emerged from behind the trees and was moving noticibly faster and it seemed closer. the object proceeded towards the right and began ascending upward at which point it went up into the overcast. although we did observe the object from a distance, somewhere between 4-5 miles, i am quite convinced that this object was not a helicopter or plane. i was so startled by what i had seen that I went online to try to figure out what to do, who to report it too, etc... that i how i stumbled upon your website. thank you for giving people the opportunity to go somewhere with these sightings. more attention needs to be paid to the subject of UFOs because what i saw was definitley unlike anything i have ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was ~75 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was close to the same path of the UFO we saw Friday, Oct 5th, but it had a totally different shape.  It almost looked pixelized&lt;sp?&gt;, like a large mass of tiny lights all clustered together in the shape of a large boomerang.  We saw it for about 4 seconds and it disappeared.  The place where we started to see it, to where it disappeared was almost exactly the same place where we saw the one last Friday, but it was higher off the horizon.  I do not think I will be sitting out on the driveway again for a LONG time!!<n>

Oct. 10th to let dogs go to bathroom.  Neighbors dog barking on the east side of my house, looked in that direction and noticed a large boomerang formation between 5,000 - 7,000 ft. altitude, 45 degrees above the east horizon about 300+ yard across.  Moving from north to south along Beltway 8 corridor from Westheimer to Hwy 59 south before I lost sight.  Clear night.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first thought it may be one large single object but as it moved along, noticed some of the 20+ lights moved out of formation slightly so figured they were independent objects moving in formation like a flock of geese.  Having seen geese migrate all my life, quickly ruled this out.  Lights had an orangish/yellowish tint but seemed to be slightly fuzzy.  When the formation moved in front of the stars, the stars would obscure slightly but still be visible so that is also why I believe it to be multiple objects.  I have extensive knowledge of aircraft and know when I am looking at a plane, helicopter, meteor, or satellite in orbit.   Looking from my back yard to the south I can observe approaching aircraft from the west into Hobby airport, but this thing came from north to south and I first observed looking due east.   It made me think, “Phoenix Lights” when I thought about it later because of the boomerang/wedge shape and the color and it being right over the forth largest metro area in the country.   I have no doubt other people in the city probably saw this but just wrote it off as something ordinary.  In fact the only reason I am posting this here and on MUFON is so if anyone else in town saw it and is curiously searching and reads this, knows it was something very unusual and was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

After staring and focusing on it, I realized i was looking at a UFO. It was shooting through the air when it stopped and hovered there. It was oval shaped. It then shot from side to side and in a 90 degreees motion in about 2 seconds coving 10&#39;s-100&#39;s miles. It was white colored and solid light. It then lit up even brighter and starting dimming. It shot across the sky. When an airplane was coming in the same direction, the object dimmed to no lights and vanished. I had a feeling either the plane scared it away or it had a feeling i we were watching it. I am still stoked to this day of this sighting.<n>

This NUFORC witness reports that after a short local trip in Conyers Georgia, that a number of aircraft were observed &#34;hovering above the city&#34;.  Said aircraft had the look of &#34;fighter jets&#34;, with red, white and blue lights, were flying in pairs back and forth at staggered heights.  Upon arriving at home, witness continued to watch and counted appx. ten aircraft.  About 8:30PM, an &#34;object&#34; (not described by the witness) appeared traveling at a high speed downward as if to crash, but disappeared before it &#34;left the skyline&#34;.  Thereafter the aircraft began to clear away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier separate MUFON investigation in nearby Newton County/Covington/Starrsville area:  On 10Oct07 at a few minutes after 8:00PM, a motorist in the Newton County Starrsville community (appx. 14.5 miles SE of Conyers, I-20 connecting the two vicinities) observed a fiery-like glowing orangish sphere shaped object just to the north side of Starrsville Rd., over the treetops at an unknown altitude and distance, but described as low and fairly close.  Object appeared about the size of a baseball held at arms length, including it&#39;s surrounding aura-like glow, and was moving VERY slow in a westerly direction.  The object seemed to have segments within, much like a science book illustration of a human brain.  Witness also noticed appx. 10 aircraft circling the area.  She reported it to a friend via phone, and upon arrival home contacted MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigator met with the MUFON witness in Covington Georgia on 15Oct07, conducted an interview and visited the event site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness was found to be well educated, intelligent, and a long time productive resident of Newton County.  Continued investigation consisted of the search for additional witnesses, contacting the local authorities, the Georgia Air National Guard, the FAA and so forth.  No real progress was made toward a positive identification of what was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequently, this writer discovered the above NUFORC Conyers witness report which seemed to describe the same event as that of the MUFON witness from the Covington/Starrsville occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer contacted NUFORC Director Peter Davenport and a joint investigation was undertaken.  This FI sent an email of explanation to the NUFORC witness, and also placed a phone call to the Conyers residence.  The phone call reached an answering machine, and additional calls thereafter found a recorded message that the line had been disconnected.  There was also no response to this writer&#39;s email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We feel that an interview with NUFORC&#39;s Conyers witness is important to further the Covington/Starrsville investigation, as well as what was described in Conyers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We think that the Conyers witness may have observed the Starrsville event from afar, perhaps from a high vantage point in Conyers that might give a good view toward Convington/Starrsville to the SE.  However, until such time the Conyers witness might come forward we cannot be sure.  Could there have been a second, separate, event in Conyers?  We do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone with information regarding this matter can contact Georgia MUFON, State Director Tom Sheets, at mufonofga1@yahoo.com  If the Conyers witness reads this..........please contact us. There is nothing to fear. We would like to conduct an interview at your convenience, and your identity will be held strictly confidential.  NUFORC and MUFON urges each Georgia citizen to help in the solution to one of mankind&#39;s most enduring mysteries......we can&#39;t do it without grass roots assistance. Thanks!

It was almost complete sundown but the remnants of the sunset could be seen in the upper atmosphere. The kids were searching for fireflies, so I was scouting the tree canopy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a flash of yellow light in the sky and I commented to the kids that I saw a shooting star. It lasted about 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to look up the same flash occurred along the same trajectory about 30 degrees to the left, and then again another 30 degrees, for a series of three yellow pulsing flashes lasting one second each, timed about 2 seconds apart. This object was moving extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting thing is, immediately thereafter a prop jet appeared at about 10,000 feet from behind the tree line from approx. the same point of origin heading perpendicular to the trajectory of the unidentified object, and immediately after that a large jet at approx. 30,000 feet appeared from behind the tree line heading in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vapor trail from the airliner was highlighted by the extreme angle of the setting sun. The impression this left was of the object passing hastily between the headings of the two aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the contrail, I asked myself if the flashes were some kind of natural artifact of the sunset, but my instinct tells me the object was real and traveling at a high velocity.<n>

Seen against sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling home from work (west on 322, chester county) it was a beautiful sky with lots of colors and the sun setting before me (10-20% cloud cover, estimate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:33 I looked up and noticed a bright white light near the sun and horizon (i believe it was to the right of the sun).  Initially I thought, &#34;star/planet&#34; based on the color of light, but quickly decided against that thought based on the brightness of the sky at the time, as well as the size and brightness of the light (it was against the sunset and still brighter than any star/planet I&#39;ve seen at night.)  It seemed to stay stationary, at least laterally to me (though, I was moving in a car).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly fumbled for my camera phone, but by the time I had cleared enough storage space to take the shot, it was gone (probably 20-30 seconds).  A few minutes later I saw it again (at least in the same area it had been in before, but I am unsure as to whether it was in the same exact position or not).  Still driving home, I fumbled for the camera phone again and by the time I unlocked the keys it had dissapeared again* (10-15 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the sky in the following seconds for something, anything...  I saw a few, seemingly lighting-fast, &#34;streaks&#34; of light, creating 3-5 sharp vertices of &#34;streak&#34; (implying ridiculous control), and nothing after that.  The streaks were of the same color as the light I saw, though they were much more faint, to the effect that I am still questioning whether the streaks were corporeal or something produced by my eyes.  For this, I am hoping to find other witnesses to the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * I never saw the light source appear or dissapear.  In other words, I was fuddling with my camera phone too much and it had already appeared/dissapeared by the times I had looked up for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail??  PD))<n>

It appeared to change shape from that of a hexagon to a triangle to a longer sphere.

Sometimes, the shaped changed to a crescent form – like a ladies diamond necklace.  At all times, there appeared to be 8-10 larger lights with all of the remaining dot lights contained within the shape.  At times, the larger lights appeared to be connected with a chain of smaller lights.

10/10/07 03:00|Haskell|TX|Triangle|90 seconds|A brilliant triangular object hovers approximate 50 feet above my backyard for approximately 1 minute, and vanishes.|1/9/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116581.html|316|ndxe200710| A brilliant triangular object hovers approximate 50 feet above my backyard for approximately 1 minute, and vanishes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall the exact date on which this incident occurred, except that it was during the autumn-winter season of 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately three o&#39;clock in the morning, I was playing a video game, and decided to get up and get a glass of water.  When I went to the kitchen and started filling my glass, a very bright blue light came through every window in my house.  It was so bright, I thought it was a spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the window on my backdoor to look outside and I saw something that I initially thought was a helicopter.  I couldn&#39;t make out a shape but I saw two red and blue spinning lights, such as that seen on a vintage ambulance/police car.  For whatever reason, this strengthened my suspicion that it was some sort of helicopter, which is unusual for Haskell, so I stepped outside to see what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of in to the backyard. I looked up at the sky and it became very obvious to me at that point that this object was not a helicopter.  It was a giant triangular craft around the size of a football field with a massive circular light in the middle, and three smaller (yet still huge) lights on each of its corners.  In between these lights, and scattered all around the bottom of the craft, were hundreds of thousands if not millions of little &#34;stars&#34; and &#34;bars&#34; of golden light.  They seemed to glow like the embers of burning wood.  I recall seeing golden bars arranged in patterns along the edges of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared to be squareish &#34;windows&#34; on the craft when viewed laterally, but I did not get a very good look at this because it was so low to the ground.  I remember thinking that it appeared to be only slightly higher than the treeline, which would have placed it maybe 50 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered over me relatively slowly for what felt like about one minute.  It toally obscured the night sky and the moon, and I felt warmth coming off from the bottom of this thing.  I remember this very well because it was a cool night and this impressed me.  The light which was shone from the four big bright lights resembled that emitted by the old incandescent light bulbs of days gone by, which I found beautiful.  The object was so beautiful and impressive that I felt the desire to jump in to it, but alas I cannot jump that high.  At no time did I feel any fear or anything except amazement and curiosity, and a hot urge to join in on the &#34;party&#34; that was passing above me.  It was like a big nightclub hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object came over my house it stopped and a red laser beam shot out from the front of it.  It then tilted and turned slightly, and the big light in the middle began to glow a bright red. It pulsated.  The rate of the pulsing started off slow and then began increase by stages.  It was then that the most spectacular highlight of this event occurred.  The craft shot off in to the horizon at a speed far beyond supersonic.  It was almost as if it vanished, it was moving so quickly.  Still yet there were no sounds, no sonic boom, nothing.  It was a joy and a privilege to watch an object that large accelerate so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite the fact that it was no longer recognizable in the night sky,  I swear to this day that I could still see it far out there in the sky.  It appeared to be a stationary star several miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it shot off, I went inside and turned on the news to see if this was happening all over the world, and it obviously wasn&#39;t.  However, I vividly remember that a few days after this took place I was watching Larry King Live and he was talking about UFOs in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t claim to know exactly what it was that I saw but I&#39;m absolutely certain it was not a known military aircraft.  I was pretty confident it was extraterrestrial in origin the moment I got a good look at it.  I still believe to this day that it has extraterrestrial origins.

I just saw it again tonight. When I first saw it I thought it was a satellite, but then I realized it couldn&#39;t be because Earth made satellites don&#39;t move like that. It shows up around midnight and stays around until 4am or so. Its not out every night, but it has been out the past weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to film it myself, but its so blasted small I couldn&#39;t possibly find it though the lens of the camera in the night sky. This thing also fades in and out and vanishes every now and then, and then comes back a few minutes later. It shows up to the east, but closer to the middle of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I was seeing things so I got my family and they also saw it and confirmed that it was actually moving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area I live in is out in the middle of the woods so there is very little light contamination, and its dark enough to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They must have barked a full 5 minutes before I got out of the bath and put a robe on and my shoes.  I walked outside and they still were barking.  I turned to face south and started to walk towards the back of the house when I spotted an orangish red blinking light in the sky.  It was very slow and was descending straight down in a slow manner too. The altitude this thing was flying at was lower then a commercial aircraft could go.  The dogs were going crazy!! I kept having to back up so I could see the blinking object as it was going down past the trees.  It might have landed somewhere on my property, but I am not sure.  I know it is not a radio or cell phone tower as I have can see those from my land, but this thing was moving.  No sound was emitted at all.  Although before the dogs started barking I heard a very peculiar noise while I was in my bath.  Like a low humming.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

According to her, what she saw was a bizarre light that quickly traveled horizontally across the sky before zig-zagging up and down over and over again (-----/\/\/\/).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, it vanished. She is absolutely adamant that it had not been a shooting star. In fact, the experience was so fantastic to her that, she said, she began to cry a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it&#39;s worth, she neither drinks nor smokes, nor does she do any kind of drugs.<n>

There were about 5 or 6 white lights down the two lengths of the &#34;V&#34;. It was approximately 2-3 miles away. I could only see the lights, no silhouette. As a street light blocked my view, I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were going to Max Patch Mountain, a large mountainous bald approx. 50 acres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at around 8 pm laid out a blanket and looked for meteors as we often do at this site…. Weekly.  We were both sober and neither of us has ever reported a UFO experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat looking at the stars for around an hour the event time listed is approximate, and we saw a few shooting stars as normal.  I lit a cigarette and over the opposite ridge from where we were sitting a large glowing disk shaped object emerged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object slowly drifted in our direction and within seconds was directly over our head.  The bottom of the craft looked like a mass of glowing jelly.  I know this sounds weird but hey its what I saw.  A greenish color that turned a turquoise blue at it’s edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing there looking in amazement when a flash of light broke my concentration.  I looked to my girlfriend and she was as bewildered as I felt.  The cigarette in my hand was burnt to the butt and had burned my fingers to a red color...and of course it hurt like I was burnt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How long did I observe the craft?  Were we abducted? Why don’t I remember the time it took for a full cigarette to burn or remember it burning my hand?  This location is miles from civilization approximately 8 mi’s of dirt road travel from the interstate and is often regarded as one of the most beautiful places on the Appalachian Trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any insight into what may have happened would be appreciated.

I guesstimate its altitude between 2000-3000 feet flying faster than the usual commercial air traffic. The craft had a grayish translucent color (like a jelly-fish), but was still clearly visible. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Its size in the sky was approximately 1.5-2&#34; held out at arm&#39;s length. The entire sighting lasted only 5-10 seconds before it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this was not the most impressive UFO sighting I have had--I have had several UFO sightings over the past 40+ years--this was a first for my wife who, needless to say, was very excited at having finally seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a stationary light in the eastern sky that looked like a star that would be drawn by an artist. If I held a ruler in front of my extended arms, I would guess about 1/2&#34; from side to side, which were the longest rays. To the top and sides were more and shorter rays. The bottom of the item seemed to be reflecting the light, which would suggest the morning sun rising in the east. However, the object was completely stationary and it is still dark out at 0610.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The conclusion from you all here was that it was the planet venus,  I honestly do not think that is the case.  I saw the same object last night with my lady,  this time it was even brighter and flying real low...so low that we got into the car and tried to drive under it.  I have this on video and have zero problems showing the film to you.  This object has changed positions in the sky on many nights,  changes shapes etc.  It looks like a bright white orb.  I zoomed in on the object and you can clearly see things moving inside it.  Please take a look at what I have on tape,  this is not venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the night of Oct 9th, roughly at midnight, I looked out my window to see a surprisingly clear night. There was one &#34;star&#34; that appeared brighter and somewhat vibrating. I grabbed my binoculars and found the object. The reason it seemed as though it was vibrating was because a red and blue light were tightly moving around another object with a bright white light on it. This is when I went outside. I went into my backyard and easily found the object again. I watched it for about 25 minutes. It just hung there in the same spot while the lights moved around. I was too far away to make any sound out, as it appeared to be hovering over Northern Waukegan. Trying to photograph it with my camera phone would have been pointless, so I didn&#39;t bother. Occasionally the lights seemed to blend together and the red and blue lights would disappear. Then it would start up again. I got distracted at about 12:30 by a friend. I periodically checked the spot in the sky until about 3am, when it was finally no longer there. I have looked out to the same spot pretty much every night since just to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing something that should be there and the object has not returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we saw another of the same in the northwest sky. There was a red light blinking and it would move from the center of the row to the left, then back again to the center. It got closer for a short time, and the shape looked like a V shape. It was not close enough to distinguish the color of the craft. The one in the northwest sky moved after about 45 minutes, further north a short distance. Then the one closer began moving away slowly, but before I sat to type this, it was still in the sky. We live on the coast of the Newport River but these lights were inland. We saw them off of our back deck, with no house lights on or reflections from other lighting. Amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My girlfriend at the time was driving.  We just went through a town called Eagle.  In the far distance you could see the bright lights of London, Ontario reflecting off the clouds.  The lit up clouds were darker the further away from the city like it always would until it got pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well right before it got pitch black, I noticed this very long and straight dark patch.  I just thought it was a cloud, but when we kept driving, I noticed that it was a perfectly straight line coming from this blackness.  We kept driving and we started to go under this black object.  The object was not moving through the air.  It wasn’t moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the girlfriend to slow down so she could look at it but she didn’t want to stop the vehicle and possibly wake the baby. We drove under the object and that is when I knew that it wasn’t anything from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark with no lights, and the part I could see that was out of the pitch black clouds was at least 2 kilometres long. The bottom of it was flat and perfectly straight. It wasn’t very tall. I would guess around 50 meters tall. When we drove under it, I saw that both sides were perfectly straight, narrowing from the base (which was in the clouds) to its square ended tip. It looked a lot like a black airport runway up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are a lot of UFO sightings in the rural parts of south western Ontario.

But I grabbed the binoculars and got a better look and passed them around the porch. Everyone there saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and got my video camera and started to record.

Their shape was long but I could not tell if it was long and cylindrical, or long and flat. I do know however that they did NOT have a fuselage or tail section as there was no strobes or lights to indicate such, and were low enough (about 1,500 ft.) that I could tell they were not of any known recognizable aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights are what first caught my attention. The first craft had bright lights like a jet would like landing lights. There was also a bright flash like a strobe that would come from the bottom center, but it was an inconsistent flash, and not the typical consistent strobe like you would see on a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both aircraft had four dimmer white lights evenly spaced located in the front of the craft. The second craft followed behind the first at a 45 degree angle and moved from the left to the right side behind the lead craft as they flew overhead. From what I could tell they were spaced about 200ft apart. The second craft did not have the bright landing lights like the first had, nor did it have the bright strobe underneath but again they both were the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather last night was a light drizzle. These craft emerged from the clouds and flew just below the ceiling until they flew past beyond my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not usually report something like this, but what disturbs me is what I found out today. As I drove in to my college classes this morning I heard on the news that a 6lb. chunk of ice had fallen through an elderly woman’s home injuring her. This occurred in York, PA about 25 minutes from Hanover where I saw the craft. The ice had fallen yesterday morning at 5:30am, and I saw the craft in Hanover at 7:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can find the Ice story on the York Dispatch website:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://yorkdispatch.inyork.com/yd/search/ci_10677963?IADID=Search-yorkdispatch.inyork.com-yorkdispatch.inyork.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ice is currently being examined at York College to see what contents the ice has. As I am a student here I am going in tomorrow to see if I can find out what they have found and get their opinion. It’s a piece of evidence that could possibly be linked to what I saw. I’d hate to see the government get a hold of this and have the Ice findings disappear.

East of town near airport and Bell Helicoptor approx. 10-11pm. Myself and 2 others driving over bridge which gave us the chance of spotting them. One bright bright white light and a secong elevated slightly higher but not as bright. After approx. 5-6 min. of sitting still the smaller light darts directly toward the brighter larger light. Larger light grows slightly brighter and darts away into the sky while second light stays. Second light stays in position until we can no longer see the lights. Later on at approx. 3-4 am we are driving back into town, of course I&#39;m all freaked so my eyes are on the sky. Me and driver (3rd person now at home) spot a dim blue glowing object moving slowly against the wind through the clouds.  After approx. 10 sec. it brightens slightly and we distinctly see the object dart through the clouds and into the sky. Seems as if these sightings occur only in those locations at certain times late at night. In my opinion it is impossible that they were planes due to their movement, appearance and behavior. Objects spotted near airport, Bell Helicoptor and Pantex so maybe they&#39;re OURS.

All other reports of this &#34;UFO&#34; have the similar characteristics.  Its basically a circular disk with blue lights on the the bottom.  It weaves around the sky in a circular manner and climbs and dives very quickly.  I saw this object near the UCI campus towards the south east.  This is the second time my girlfriend and I have seen this object.   My girlfriend and I are both well educated, and although we don&#39;t believe in &#34;UFO&#34;s in the alien sense of the word we do agree that this object is certainly unidentified.  I was able to take about 5 pictures as well as a 1 minute movie file with my low quality digital camera.  Please contact me by email, and I will send them to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He asked me to join him to look at some strange lights. We saw 7 orange, twinkling, star-like lights. They moved independently towards each other and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like stars but as it was a clear night we could see stars and therefore were able to notice that the orange lights were not that far away from us. At the same time an airplane passed. It flew much higher than the orange objects. They made no noise and did not leave a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes they slowly disappeared in the distance, one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed outside a while talking to the neighbor  about these strange objects when suddenly one of the lights came back. It stayed without moving for about 10 minutes and then moved slowly away in to the distance until we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It began at 7:35 PM and lasted until 8:25 PM involving 4 separate objects, each seen at different times during the 50 minute duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was seen at 7:35 PM as I was leaving for a security patrol. The object was seen by me and my co-worker, then later only by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object came from the south west and moved to the north east. This object was a white ball of light. It stopped 2 times completely, then continued across the sky very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a discernable darkness around the object. Though it did not pass over any major stars, there seemed to be a solid object and not just a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane (a regular commercial airliner), about 3-4 minutes into this, came from the north west. Within 30 seconds of the airplane appearing, the light we had been following simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went on my security patrol. About 5 minutes into the patrol, directly overhead, a small light appeared. It then began to grow in intensity and travel in a southerly direction, reaching a -2 or -3 magnitude, not quite the brightness of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8 PM, I reached about the midpoint in my security round. I saw another light, this time very dim, moving from south east to the north east, crossing through the constellation of Pegasus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:10 PM, I went to the same spot where the other security guard had seen a triangular UFO fly over him two nights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing at this point, and left to continue my round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light caught my eye in the mountains to the north east. A very bright light near the top of the mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to my previous position to get a better look. I am very familiar with this mountain range, even in the dark. More pointedly, the stars rise over this mountain range, giving a clear outline of mountains themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If Venus is normally a magnitude of -4 to -5, this was a magnitude of -7 at least. This light/object moved up and down from the top of the mountains, into the sky about a degree or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also moved side to side and two times, and twice increased in brightest and moved in such a way that I felt that it was approaching, however, it never did move overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calling the other guard about this object, and asking him to come out, it faded to the same magnitude of the star I was watching rise over the hill to its left. It then increased in magnitude and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is similar to another sighting I had on September 29th on an adjacent mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to rule out a motorcycle or car headlight in that the light/object clearly moved above the horizon, something a normal vehicle could not do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the other guard arrived, he noticed an aberration in the night sky. He pointed to it, and I saw it as well. 2 objects flying low in the sky. One that seemed to be darker than the night sky, traversing over the background stars and another &#34;ghostly&#34; object behind it that also obscured the stars in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects came from the areas where the bright light had been and traveled beneath the constellation Pegasus in a north to east trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not feeling comfortable about being in that location any longer, we then headed back to our office to complete the patrol.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object completely stationary but as most leaves are still on trees here, I suspect as with the spring sightings it will slowly rotate out of sight.  No sound, no movement, appears very distant (i.e., in space, not in atmosphere).  See the 5/8 North Huntington and 6/5 Allentown reports.  I suspect we are all seeing the same thing.  I am near NY state border, so northwest of Allentown and NE of N. Huntington.  Perhaps this object is in sky between us, over central PA?  If this is a star, can somebody at NUFORC post an addendum and explain why the obvious colored lights?  Could it be atmospheric in some way?

The wind was blowing out of the WSW so we were looking ENE when a spherical silver object flying at a high altitude (higher than the planes) from the North to the Southern sky and then stopped and hovered for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so we noticed another sphere that was hovering in the sky just north of the first object. This object was spherical as well but gave off a redish reflection. The silver one then moved north and the red one moved NW at which point they faded away. Over the next hour about 5 more objects appeared over the bluffs from the NNE and flew into the corona of the sun, SW, where we couldn&#39;t see them anymore. I called LBPD who refered me to Marina Police, who transfered me to Local Lifeguards, who then came out but by that time they were gone. That call was made at 17:11. I called the FSS that told me over LB at 17:00 the wind aloft was out of NW at 15 knots for 3000 ft and out of the NNE at 10 knots for 5000 ft.<n>

I had my daughter at the park and some balloons we released. When watching one of them drift off, I could see a sliver of something in the distance. It seamed to be really far away. I thought mabye it was the International Space station? I could not figure it out, I had my eye on it for at least 5 minutes, just watching when a plane flew by, you could clearly see that this craft was much higher than the plane. We are pretty close to Orange County airport, so we always see plane traffic. As I continued watching it, it made a very fast directional move, I lost eye contact with it. I continued looking in the same direction and saw it once again, it kind of moved side to side like a ping pong ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know what this was, if someone could let me know that would be great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was bright blue, with strong, gusty winds blowing from the northeast. I paused on a bluff that overlooks the Santa Ana riverbed to look at the scenery. I noticed a bright object in the sky to the west. I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity. After watching it hover, the size gradually reduced to where it looked like a star visible in the daytime. After watching the object for almost a half an hour, I started to walk home, stopping every so often to see if the object was still there. I hoped to locate it once I got home, where I could use binoculars to look at it, however the road took a turn through tall trees, and I was unable to find it again. It continued the flashing effect for the entire duration. There were numerous jet and propeller driven aircraft seen in the sky during the time of the sighting. I would assume it was a balloon of some type if it were not for the fact it was unaffected by the strong winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/7/07 03:30|Manteca (above; in flight)|CA|Other|15 minutes|Odd, distinctively shaped craft seen at 21,000 feet east of Manteca by two commercial pilots|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59157.html|352|ndxe200710| Odd, distinctively shaped craft seen at 21,000 feet east of Manteca by two commercial pilots<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred while I was acting as Captain during a routine cargo flight in a BE-1900 from OAK (Oakland, CA) to BUR (Burbank, CA).  We had leveled-off at FL210 and were cruising just south of Manteca VOR (a navigational aid near the city of Manteca, CA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic at this time of night is usually very light and quite easy to spot at ranges exceeding 50 miles.  ATC (Oakland Center) routinely advises us of traffic in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on a mostly southern heading, I noticed a somewhat unusually colored light off to my nine-o-clock position (east of us).  It appeared to be close to our altitude, but many miles distant (over the foothills of the Sierra mountain range).  Normally, lights seen at that altitude and distance appear to be of a clear white color… usually the recognition or landing lights of another aircraft descending into the Bay Area for landing.  This light was exceptionally bright and very yellow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my First Officer, in passing.  He also remarked on how bright it was.  I’d seen unusual lights like this one before – both out over the ocean and on descent into the Bay Area over Concord, CA.  They’d always turned out to be oil refineries/rigs burning off gas.  This light did not flicker as those had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued our flight to BUR, we’d occasionally look out to the left to watch the light – which, over time grew both larger and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes of observing the light, it began to take a definite shape and seemed to be paralleling our course.  The top portion of the light was semispherical, and the bottom portion formed a clear “V” shape coming to a point at the base.  Over time, this “V” shape with a pointed-bottom became larger-and-larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our curiosity piqued, I asked my F/O to call Oakland Center and ask if they had any traffic on their radar at our nine-o-clock, same altitude.  They replied saying that the only traffic in our vicinity was an opposite direction King Air descending out of 13,000 feet (which both I and my F/O already had in sight).  No traffic at our nine-o-clock was seen on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch this bright yellow light grow in size over the next ten minutes, until it filled about a four-inch square through the window on my side.  It was impossible to accurately gauge our distance to the object, or its true size, since we didn’t have any other visible references against with to judge it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anecdotally, all I can say is that it was both LARGE and of a VERY unusual shape and color.  Other aircraft lights (while flying at night) uniformly appear to be circular points of light, and are all in standard colors (red, green, white or white strobe).  The light we saw did NOT appear to be a light ON an aircraft – the light appeared to be the entire outline of some sort of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, the light appeared to be paralleling our course and coming closer (i.e., remaining in the same relative position even though we were moving south at around 300 knots over the ground, yet getting larger).  Please take that observation with a grain of salt though.  Without being close enough to see details on the craft or compare it against a ground reference – it could just as easily be something very large seen at a great distance.  Things observed at a large distance do not appear to have any relative motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the light until it appeared to take a northern course away from us at great speed (both decreasing in brightness and size, without changing altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my F/O and I have 5,000+ hours of experience – most of which was gained under similar circumstances (at night, over California routes)… and we were both flabbergasted by what we saw.  We both admitted it made the hair on our neck stand up.  To be honest, I was spooked by the experience, but have chosen to not bring it up with our airline or the FAA out of concern for being judged a nut-job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not saying the things we saw were of extraterrestrial origin – but I am saying we saw something that (in both of our professional opinions) was nothing like any other aircraft we’ve ever experienced in our careers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately grabbed my binoculars and viewed the object slowly moving in the sky. While viewing this sky anomaly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye another object like it but at a slightly further distance. After about 30 minutes, the 2nd object had completely vanished while the seemingly closer object remained in the sky for another 30 minutes (1 hour total) before slowly disappearing from my view. The object seemed to transition from a white color to a reddish-orange color and then to a bright blue. There were no blinking lights on the object but rather the entire circular shaped anomaly seemed to pulsate its colors. This is not the first time I have viewed something peculiar in the sky. About 3 months ago, I also viewed 2 red orbs floating above an apartment complex for about 15 minutes very close to each other. They both moved erratically like a bee buzzing around in the sky (no sound and very unlike the normal movement of an airplane or helicopter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It appeared to &#39;teleport&#39; in, is the only way I can best explain it as it came from the direction of my lounge window.  It was very tall (approx 7ft), thin, and I could see its spine very clearly.  It had no mouth as such and communicated telepathically.  It mostly kept its back to me, wore a dress and a wig!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that sounds absurd but it felt to me that it didn&#39;t want to alarm me.  It went over to my laptop, which was on at the time, and did something on it.  I asked the being what it wanted, but it didn&#39;t say.  It pressed a few keys and from the ceiling a blue metal star shaped object appeared. It said something about a binary star system, 01, and a machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star &#39;machine&#39; made a loud crackling noise and &#39;on/off&#39; sound 3x. I was told &#39;plasma&#39;.  It said we downloaded and uploaded information like satellites, using stars, which was us, and mentioned supreme! technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was aware it was of no sex but maybe appeared feminine for whatever reason.  I was totally made to feel at ease with it.  I got the sense of Sirius and &#39;star-being&#39;, communication technology and 0-1.  Stellar communication.  I think the blue metal star was 8 pointed, but not 100%, and it wasn&#39;t particularly large, approx 3x3ft.  It was definitely some sort of machine which the being activated using my laptop.  Moments later they both disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I&#39;m in the UK and this encounter happened at my then address in Worthing, West Sussex.<n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure if there is a report center like yours in the UK so I hope it&#39;s ok to come to you with it?

At approximately 10:10PM tonight I walked out my back door to throw some trash away in the city container. As I walked toward the container I looked up and saw a formation of white objects in a &#34;Vee&#34; formation. At first I didn&#39;t think much of it as it looked like a formation of white birds flying southward.As I watched them I suddenly realized they were moving way too fast to be birds. Within 10 seconds they had already flown about a 90-100 degree arc from my stationary position. At my home if I look directly west I am about even with Marina Del Rey. As I watched the object(s) move southward, in those 10 seconds, they moved from directly westward to southeast of where i was standing, an arc of over 90 degrees. I couldn&#39;t really tell how close it was from me and it was absolutely noiseless. Like I said, it looked like a formation of birds so I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a singular object or many objects. If I were to guess I would say multiple objects as the formation seemed th change slightly as it flew across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When we got out my wife was lying back on the steps and I asked if she feel asleep. She said know those stars are moving here, here and here. I looked up in the southwest sky but almost directly overhead and sure enough whatever it was was moving. But not real fast. It hovered then moved with purposes toward a nearby light. First a light would bean out it followed and left a small light trail. There were three main stars with two or three around them in the sky, but the middle one was the brightest and most active so we focused on it. We went inside and got our binaculars and telescope. The binaculars gave us a look at everything going on but like from a distance. Details couldn&#39;t be made out. But it was hard to stay focused because it kept moving. The telescope was almost useless. It was almost too loe for it, but one time I got a good look at it. It was round with a flat gray surface. After an hour we came in with sore necks and tired kids but as I type this it is still going on. I didn&#39;t know where or who to report this to, so I googled and found this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One was always brighter than the other, and when one got brighter, the other dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened again and again, but not flashing, more like pulsing, the lights never quite disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband to pull over so we could have a better look.  About a minute later, I couldn&#39;t find it in the sky, and realized it had jumped quite a distance from the west to the east, but I never saw it move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About three or four minutes later, it was back to where it originally started from.

These lights were dim when first spotted and looked like a flock of birds. The lights then broke from the two line formations and formed two groups of errtacally moving balls of light. Being almost directly overhead they were brighter and more distinct, being orange red in color. I would estimate that each group of lights were numbered at 15 to 25.I yelled at my friend to come see,and he did see the lights just before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was ecstatic, and running to tell my other friend who was down the way I spotted another group of lights. This one group appered approximately ten min. after the first two groups were seen.This last group was identical to the first, travelling the same direction, but located more east and not overhead. This last sighting was visable only for a few seconds. The first two were seen for about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 6:30 pm I noticed what at 1st looked like a huge plane over the KY side of the river. What was unusual was that it look like a plane with its wings tilted at approximately 30 degrees and coming directly at us.  I asked my nephew if he saw this and he confirmed that he had been watching it for a while and wasn&#39;t sure what he was looking at either.  We set there for 30 minutes or longer and watched this object fly east then change course and fly north-northeast.  For quite a while this object looked like it was flying toward us and tilted but then it began moving east.  It had lights on both ends of it and we estimated it had to be very large, mabye a quarter mile from end to end.  The lights on both ends blinked and were both red.  We thought that this was 2 planes at 1st, but it was definetely 1 object.  At no time was any noise noted from the object, or any plane aircraft noises heard during the siting.  This was a very weird object, flying at a very slow speed and I think that it was hovering when we thought it was coming directly at us.  Anyone with any info. on this would be appriciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few min. later the lights reappeared in the same place as before. My wife and I watched the UFO for about 10 min. as it moved towards the  WNW. The sky was clear and the stars were bright it was the strangest thing I&#39;ve seen. We watched other planes moving across the sky but nothing like this.

Approximately a month later, I believe it was Nov. 7, 2007, I saw something unusual in the sky.  I was miles away from others (except for an elderly woman I was caring for.)  She didn&#39;t see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside shaking out some scatter rugs when I saw an object floating overhead pretty high in the sky. I&#39;m estimating a fourth of a mile in the sky.   I was in the country at an isolated house, and it was a sunny day, clear sky, and here was this thing floating in the sky overhead slowly.   I was near my car, and I had a digital camera in the car, so I got it, and took three pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got the camera out and took the first picture, it was some distance away from me, still just floating in the sky soundlessly.  It appeared to be the good year blimp, way far up in the sky.   By the time I took three pictures, it was hard for me to see the object anymore.  The odd thing was, all of a sudden this object created a noise like a large plane (I am not into aircraft but the sound I described at the time was a B1 bomber sound).  Its as if they were floating above, enjoying the peaceful landscape, and then they saw me watching them and they wanted me to think they were a common airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is as if they flipped a switch to create the noise.  Incidentall, I&#39;ve seen blimps, and this really wasn&#39;t a blimp, just resembled one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to send the pictures because I was disgusted at your website for putting down another person who had reported sightings at approximately the same time I did.  You more or less accused him of being a hoax.  I felt he was telling the truth.   All the time, I knew I would send it to you at some time, because I wanted you to enhance it and see what you could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw Larry King Live and three gentlemen were discussing UFO&#39;s, and the lack of evidence.  I got on my computer to see the photos, and this is the only one I can find.  I think it was the best of the three, but I still wonder what happened to the other two photos, they were in my Photo Library, now none are there. I may be wrong.   This was in one of my documents.    I decided to send it tonight in case  this photo  disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may be wrong on the date and time, but I know it was in the afternoon and I&#39;m pretty sure it was Nov. 7th.  I know it was 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere I have it down, but I didn&#39;t want to put this off any longer, as this photo may disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See what you can see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

After just about a half mile, I looked up to see an egg-shaped rust-colored craft moving from the north. It was, I would guess, less than a thousand feet above me and moving to the south. I was near enough that I could see sun glint off its surface and thought it must be a plane of some sort. It didn&#39;t have wings, though (none that I could discern), and it made no sound. It was not like any craft I&#39;ve seen before. I rounded a bend and lost it when oak trees obscured my view. Then, the line of sight opened up and I saw it move very rapidly south until it was out of the sight to the south. It seemed to remain at about the same elevation that I initially observed it as it moved south. I&#39;ve never seen a craft move that rapidly--only 15 to 30 seconds and it was well past the Ojai Valley and on to ranges to the south. Again, I heard no sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/6/07 05:45|Johnstown|NE|Rectangle|2-3 minutes|My Report to the UFO Website October 6, 2007 5:45 a.m. Central Approximately Three Miles West of Johnstown, Nebraska   On October 6, 20|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59180.html|373|ndxe200710| My Report to the UFO Website October 6, 2007 5:45 a.m. Central Approximately Three Miles West of Johnstown, Nebraska   On October 6, 2007, I was driving to Wayne, Nebraska, for a meeting, and I wasn’t sure if I had allowed enough time. I was in a hurry.  It was about 5:45 a.m.Central Daylight. I was traveling from Valentine, Nebraska.  The meeting registration was at 9:30 with the meeting to begin at 10:00. I’m including this piece of information because it did have a small part in my actions at the end of this story, I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was  traveling on Highway 20 approximately two to three miles west of Johnstown, Nebraska, just a very short distance west of Plum Creek. (less than a mile, I approximate)  It was dark and I was watching for deer, porcupine, etc, yet, trying to keep aware of the time and my schedule.    The stars were out.  All of a sudden there is a flying object coming parallel to the road in the opposite direction I was traveling, just clearing the trees. In other words, it came from the other direction and was just beyond the fence line on the opposite side of the road.  It was flying pretty low to the ground, yet, high enough that I was thinking it was a small private plane because I could hear it so well, and because it was so low.  There were a lot of lights flashing, and a pretty loud whirling sound, an unusual sound to me, but the only way I can describe it was like a helicopter sound, but more a whirling sound than a chopping sound.  It definitely was not a helicopter. I remember being amazed as there were twenty or thirty lights flashing on this vehicle.   At first I thought I was close to Ainsworth, as there is an airport there and it was so low to the ground I thought it must have just taken off.  I thought it was a very fancy plane.  I said some things out loud, and I believe they had a bearing on what ensued.  I will relate those comments in a few paragraphs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn’t think much of it, I thought it was a small plane definitely with sophisticated instruments, radar, etc. I continued driving only glancing at it twice. It immediately came back to check me out, as that is when I realized I must stop to see what in the world this was.  I was looking at the road, (driving) so I didn’t see it shift into reverse, but that is what must have happened.   As I think about it now, at that point, I remember being surprised as I could see stars through it, and the lights weren’t flashing and making as much a noise as it had made an instant before, when it first was visible and coming over the trees.    I pulled over, off the road onto the shoulder, put the vehicle in park, and opened my window.  That is when I realized this was a very unusual event in my life.  I stared at it, and remember there wasn’t much of any sound now, and just an instant later, there was no sound.  It was suspended in the air, and just hovering there, about 15 or 20 ft. in the air.  I could see through it.  The lights weren’t flashing then, and there were only a few lights. Also, I remember thinking that whomever was in there, was not visible, but no doubt was looking at me.  The lights I could see were on the exterior of the craft and there were only two or three that I recall along with apparent illumination in the interior.  The visible lights  were in the position of one or two corners of the craft, I believe, but I remember thinking there weren’t lights in each corner, maybe just three lights.  My attention was directed to the interior, illuminated but not a very large space, and I thought two levels. It looked like a large rectangular glass (plastic) box.  The interior wasn’t very wide. There were no desks, no panels of instruments, no anything, but it was dimly lighted allowing me to see functional space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve tried to recall the measurements, but bear in mind, this all happened in a few minutes time.  These measurements are the best I can recall, and here they are.  The plastic box, which this craft appeared to be, was approximately 18 feet long, maybe a little less, but not much.  The height was approximately 13 feet.  It was rectangular with the horizontal measure greater than the vertical measurement.  It appeared there might be two levels, but, of course, I didn’t see any steps, etc.  The space inside was illuminated lightly, I could see some depth to the space, and I’m going to guess that at about 4 feet. The reason I thought it was two levels, it appeared there was some kind of horizontal divider in the craft, in about the middle. I have calculated that I was no more than 120 feet from the craft. 18’x13’x4’ approximately, and about 120 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the rear view mirror and saw two large trucks (cattle trucks I realized after I got out on the road) approximately 1/8th of a mile behind me, coming very fast toward me.  I got scared all of a sudden, and wanted to be in front of the trucks to protect myself.  I remember calculating that it wouldn’t put the trucks in danger if I were to pull out on the road and get up some speed, which is what I did.  I didn’t even glance back, even though I wanted to, to see if I could see the vehicle flying away.   I was in animal country, and I had two large trucks bearing down behind me, so I just drove and concentrated on the road in front of me. The appointment I was traveling to had a very small bearing on my leaving so abruptly, but primarily I felt I wanted the safety of the trucks to escort me away from this experience. It was a very meaningful experience to me, however, and now I know UFO’s exist.  As I was driving away from this experience, I felt a sense of gratitude I had experienced it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting out on the road again, I immediately came to Plum Creek and then Johnstown, and soon after that, Ainsworth.  I pulled in at the gas station, and saw the two big cattle trucks go by, and I’ll always wonder if they saw anything.  They may not have, because the craft was  inconspicitious and the trucks were traveling very fast, and I recall some trees just to the left, or west,  of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights of this craft  appeared to be the source of the energy to navigate it, and with the many flashing lights and the whirling noise, it seemed like a happy little vehicle, just singing and whistling along, before  it spotted me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Forgive me for  being repetitious, but I don’t have time to make this a grammatically correct manuscript. Some of you who are reading this are probably appreciative of my repetition as I don’t want to leave out any important points that I know I experienced. When I was first parked, and looked at it, it shut down to no sound and even though there were some lights, they were not flashing and they were very few in number.  The craft was completely stationary, suspended in air about 15 ft. off the ground.   I could see through the spacecraft, and could see the interior but could see no objects.    I would gauge it just a few feet on the other side of the fence line (standard distance from a road) and suspended approximately 15 ft. in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I want to relate is what I said, outloud, because I think they heard me, understood me, and that is what caused them to take a better look at me.  When I first saw the vehicle (which I assumed was a plane) I distinctly recall what I said, and that I said it out loud.  My windows were rolled up incidentally.   After glancing at this vehicle initially, I assumed it was some rich person’s vehicle because it would cost a lot (just judging from the power and the energy I could see and hear) and I said, “You’re a sophisticated little plane.”   Then I recall saying, as I’m driving down the road not even looking back at it, “little fancy dancy plane!”   Then, I remember saying, not having any idea the craft was anything other than being a mile or two away from me, “Wow, twenty or thirty lights!!” more or less to confirm in my mind what I had just seen. (When I first laid eyes on it, it was just having a good old time, clearing treetops and all those 20 to 30 lights flashing, making a lot of whirling sounds.  It appeared to be feeling very good.)  Then, I realized it had reversed itself, and it was still parallel to the road I was traveling down, at approximately 60 mph, and that’s when I said, out loud, as I pulled off the road,  “Boy, I’ve got to have a better look at you!”  I stopped on the shoulder of the road, put my pickup in park and rolled down the window.  And there was no more talking, just looking at this space craft, as I have attempted to describe it.  I definitely remember hearing the small purr being cut even more, so there was absolutely no sound as it was suspended in air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sensed no evil or ill feeling.  It was a friendly force.  I sensed curiosity on their part, and I greatly appreciated this experience, even though I did get scared and wanted to be ahead of the trucks and not left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope to see another space vessel sometime, if I am so blessed.  If I do, I will  try  to be braver. But, you have to admit, I was pretty brave the other morning when I had this great experience. Before October 6th, I really didn’t believe in UFO’s.  I had not been drinking or smoking anything, I was totally sober and have been for years.  I know what time I left Valentine, and what time I arrived in Ainsworth, and there was no great lapse of time.  I imagine my encounter lasted only a couple minutes from the time I first spotted this noisey  craft, when the craft returned to my proximity, when I parked to observe it and  when I pulled out on the road again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man I talked to on the phone from this website asked me to draw a picture of the relationship of the size of the  vehicle I saw to the sun in the sky.  I think this would be confusing, I’ve given you the measurements as best as I can recall them.  If I would have to do that, it would be close to the relationship of a 3x5 file card to a penny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your attention.<n>

Very symmetrical and evenly spaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, Oct 5th, around 11:55pm., my husband and I witnessed 4 rectangle objects flying in a row like this: ////   It was ~45 degrees above the eastern horizon and was the rectangles were lit up in a white shimmering/waving/pulsing light.  They were very symmetrically shaped and evenly spaced.  We saw them for about 5 seconds and then the lights disappeared instantly.  There was no noise.  We live in a smaller community north of Dallas and there is not a lot of light pollution in our area. I at first thought it was birds flying but there were no lights that could have been reflecting upwards on them and my husband pointed out they were too symmetrical, spaced too perfectly, and too bright.  Also the way they disappeared instantly and they kept their rectangle shaped.  I will say that it kind of freaked us both out for we have never seen anything like it before and we have spent more hours than we can count sitting outside on the driveway, under the stars, enjoying the outdoors.  Also that same night we saw at least 6 falling stars and we have never seen that many in one night, even when we have sat out to watch meteor showers.  We did sit out last night, Weds. Oct 10th, and yet again saw another UFO, but this time it was larger and boomerang shaped.  I will post it on a separate report.  I don’t think I want to sit out again for quite a while for it is really freaking me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving home from a friends house and was traveling south on I-680. At about 11:45pm I was just about up to the Dodge Street exit when I noticed an extremely bright blue white light low in the sky. This object had no tail or contrail and was moving way to quickly to be an aircraft in a tower controlled airspace (TCA). I saw none of the red or green lights associated with conventional aircraft either. The object appeared to fly over the interstate then pitched up a bit before it went completely dark. I raced home and checked the Heavens-above website for any satellite or ISS overflights of the area at that time. I could find nothing flying over Omaha for that time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see the ISS flying overhead at about 7:40pm on Saturday night October 6th. It was not anywhere near as bright nor was it moving as fast as the object I had seen the night before. I reported the friday night sighting to a friend who is a MUFON investigator and he suggested I also send a report to this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had to be flying about as high as a traffic helicopter would, but I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then changed it&#39;s course heading east.  I watched it until it disappeared out of view, and then I decided to see if I could see anything else for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes passed and then I saw what I assume is the same craft going west.  It was probably a quarter of a mile away, but judging by the same flash pattern.  I am pretty sure it is the same kind of craft I saw in August, that I reported here.  I have seen alot of interesting sightings.  Almost one a week it seems like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even two military Helicopters were flying tree top level over my house about two weeks ago.  I heard them from very far away, but didn&#39;t see them until they flew almost directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw an unidentified craft heading in a south to north direction while the helicopters were flying west to east.<n>

These planes always appear as two white winglights having an apparent separation of a couple of millimeters at arm&#39;s length, with red and/or green FAA flashers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week at approximately 2300 on 05 October, my two teenage cousins and I saw a triangle shaped airplane flying VERY LOW in the sky. It was HUGE, having an apparent size of about a half-dollar or full silver dollar held at arms length. I immediately thought it was a civilian heavy aircraft in serious trouble, but it never gave signs of distress, so we waved, because we were sure the pilot should have been able to see us! It had a strange light pattern, three solid, bright white lights in a nearly equilateral triangle pattern, apparently two wingtip lights and a nose light, with a square formation of four dimmer fuselage lights immediatley behind the nose light in a perfect square box pattern. It also had one red and one green light, and at least one of those was flashing. It was definitely a jet aircraft because we could hear the quiet rumble of jet engines, but they seemed much quieter than they should have been for an airplane that sheer size and low altitude. Despite the size, I couldn&#39;t tell anything about the fuselage shape because there was no moon, and the fuselage lights didn&#39;t seem to reflect off of the plane at all (black paint?). It appeared in the north and flew approximately northeast to southwest slowly and steadily with no deviations in course and no contrail. We thought it was a stealth bomber. It was definitely an airplane of some kind, A HUGE airplane. My cousins seemed to think it was the neatest thing they&#39;d seen in a while up in the country, and I agree!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Three light balls were counted, but only two of which interacted with each other in a playful dancing motion, while the third spent most of the time hovering to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No light trail from any angle was visible, nor did the balls of light move in any uniformed pattern. They resembled the shape of Saturn, with a horizontal plane piercing through the center of their somewhat oval shape. The size of these light balls were relatively close to the size of a full moon but had no defined lines or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls of light moved above a cloud formation heading East. When the spectators stopped at the East end of Raspberry Loop to watch them, a dancing display captured their attention till nearly 11:00 pm. Mostly viewed where chasing motions from each direction, spiral patterns, and the occasionally collisions resulting in a spark of extra light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the two spectators headed back to the West side of the street, the balls of light shifted in the direction they were walking. Finding this a fascinating turn of events, the viewers waved goodbye to the balls of light, to be replied to with a quick up and down motion from both lights and then a disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness.  She seemed to us to be unusually sober-minded, and we suspect that she is an excellent witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else witnessed the lights, or knows what their cause was, we would welcome additional information about the event.

Each night she observed this through binoculars &amp; the object appeared like flashing red, blue, green &amp; white lights &amp; even honeycomb shapes appeared on this object. On various nights this object could be seen in the NE &amp; S Chandler, AZ sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, Friday, Oct. 5th, 2007 at approx. 9:15 pm we saw the object from my house in Chandler in the due north sky. This object is definitely not a star as we’ve never seen or heard of stars being colorful or that move. Our planet doesn’t rotate that quickly. We observed this object with both binoculars &amp; a telescope. We noticed the object was moving rather slowly but on a due east course tonight. The colors were absolutely brilliant &amp; something none of us have ever seen before. Not only was it colorful &amp; sphere-shaped but it seemed to rotate, spin, &amp; turn sideways. It also would move just enough for us to lose sight of it from our telescope without us moving the tripod. We wanted to know what this thing was, so we came in to look up anything we could find on the internet that might relate to this object being seen by others &amp; we found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:15 am we went back out to see just how much further this object had moved, when we were amazed by the fact that not only had this object moved further east, but there were two additional objects exactly the same as the one we’d been following all night in a perfect triangular formation. They were not there prior to the earlier observation! We observed all three of them &amp; all were exactly the same. One might say that they were hovering, but you could see them move slightly &amp; yet all remained in perfect triangular formation. We really got a little freaked out, besides being cold &amp; we came back in again. So this was going on for over 3 hours &amp; then some! They are still out there very visible even now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else seen anything like this before, or know what is going on in our skies?    Inquiring sisters want to know Chandler, AZ<n>

We were on our back porch and we saw a red and orange, roundish mystery objest flying up above about a half mile away. We were all instantly enthralled with the object beacuse it had virtually no form, it was glowing, it was silent, it would stop in mid flight (float would be more like it), and then it would change direction and go in reverse. After about twenty seconds of watching it, the thing started dropping a few burning embers that would burn out before hitting the ground or trees. That was when it started getting really weirs. We thought whatever it was was going to crash but it keep hovering over head, moving very slowly. It continued to do so fo almost another minute and a half and then it started to drop quite a lot of burning embers to the ground (the object itself did not look like it was on fire at all) nad then it just disappeared. It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life and I am writing this because I saw an article in the local paper a couple weeks ago about different people witnessing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

About the controller’s scope, he had informed me his scope had a reach of 60+ nautical miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was an unusual shape almost the shape of an animated drawing of a boxy automobile.

All of a sudden all the power went off in my house and in the surrounding area. This happens once or twice a year in this area called the Wenas Valley which is just north of Selah, Washington. I continued what I was doing for about another 10-15 minutes until I noticed a really bright shinning object came straight down out of the clouds. It was about a mile away from me just below the mountain range. It stopped and hovered silently for about 60 seconds and then moved west about ¼ of a mile and stopped again and just hovered. Then it came towards me about ¼ of a mile and stopped again. It stayed there about 30 seconds and then shot straight up back into the clouds. This all happened around 2PM in the afternoon on a overcast day where it had been raining about an hour I called 911 to report this and to also see if anyone else had turned in a similar report. Know one had, but the operator said she would call me back if anyone else did. After that I called the power company to report the outage and know one had reported it yet. About 15 minutes later my power came back on. I told a few people about this and they advised me to say no more. I haven’t for about 4 months now and due to watching all the reports about others seeing similar things around the country I decided to report mine here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For 2 hours now been watching a small round object approximately 10 miles away in the sky. If I hold my hand up, it is about half the size of my pinky nail. It will remain motionless for 15 or so minutes then drop to the ground suddenly. It will then circle around different buildings for a little while. Then it moves back to its same position in the sky and remain motionless (moving back up right now). NOT A BALLOON! A balloon doesnt stay still, drop, circle, and move back to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is an overcast day here in Houston. The sun is not piercing these clouds at all. The 2nd time the object dropped down, it was about 3 miles away. It settled about 100 feet above the ground and then lit up so brightly that it hurt my eyes from this far away. The light was incredibly bright. It was like the tip of a blowtorch or when you are magnifying the sun through a magnifying glass. A coworker saw this and said it might be a helicopter. No sooner than she had said that that the object stopped glowing and shot straight up to about eye level and hovered. It then continued its routine of dropping every 15 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went downstairs for a few minutes to talk to my brother and upon my return the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 2 things just minutes apart which I cannot explain nor forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would have been around 1:00 or 1:05AM when I sat up and barely noticed something off in the sky. It looked like CGI or artists drawing of a comet. It had that leading umbrella like front that a comet does, but it had no tail. It looked like it had a wedge shape but you could only make out a front and the &#34;back&#34; wasn&#39;t visible. It moved from right to left from in the sky and was all but invisible against the sky. I only noticed it because it was moving and it seemed very far away and was very faint. As its view crossed across a streetlight it was obscured (washed out by the light). When it came back into view its wedge shape seemed a less of a point and much more rounded in front. It didn&#39;t do anything specific and very well could have been a comet, but I doubt it as it would have had to move across the sky line in 1-2 minutes. I took 2 pictures with my cell phone but nether show anything except that light across the street (it was that faint).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pretty freaked out and called my friend in VA and talked to her about it and while I was on the phone something else happened and now I am scared in my room. I was on the phone with this girl and getting anxious about what I saw and was about to walk through my window when I saw 3 lights VERY CLOSE. If anyone is familiar as to how low the planes fly over Arlington, VA (above the buildings and high rises) when flying into National Airport, it seemed to be about the highest height the planes take before they drop altitude for final approach. That is to say it was so close that I would have heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from right to left and was very very close. This defiantly had a triangular isosceles shape (from the 3 lights being in the corner). It was nearly straight above me and moved in a straight line or maybe it had a slight curve to its path. The lights did not illuminate a body of any sort but kept a perfect triangular shape. There was no blinking, NO NOISE and no fucking way I want to see it again. It was fast, but if it was as close as I think it was then it wouldn&#39;t have been as fast as the faint/far first object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend on the phone was panicing because I was panicing and I woke one of my new roommates but he didn&#39;t want anything to do with it. At least he saw the fear I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has any idea what it was or can collaborate what was in the sky please please post it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, I have been in Austin less then 24 hours and I am almost willing to pack the car and move back to DC... deposit be damned. I won&#39;t be sleeping tonight until my roommates wake up, it isn&#39;t as though I&#39;m a coward, far from it. I just can&#39;t explain what it is. If I could explain it or understand it or even deny it I&#39;d probably feel a lot better right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n>

It was lower to the ground, maybe just a little higher in elevation than the local ski resort&#39;s highest point.  There was no sound, nor were there any lights on the craft.  The light pollution from the roads and stores reflected on the bottom of the craft, allowing it to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just happened to look and saw what I first thought was a plane or helicopter off in the distance with colored lights that were changing. Then I noticed that it would just sit still for a few seconds then dart very quickly in different directions. I then thought that it was very strange so I went in and asked my girlfriend to come out and see what I was witnessing. At first she said that it wasn&#39;t moving then all of a sudden it started darting around again. The light would change from red to a yellow white, and then to a greenish color. She said that it must be some type of military special plane or something that was making all of the darting movements and then hovering. She went in and I stayed out. All of a sudden it disappeared. I sat there for a few more minutes looking around and then a little further south and in a lower trajectory from me in the sky i saw what I thought was the same one but had just moved. After about 5 min. of watching that one I looked where the first sighting was and the original one was back. I watched both of them for a few minutes and the second one disappeared on me. The original one was moving up and down almost like it was dodging something. I thought maybe it was a comet that was changing colors due to temperature changes. She said that she didn&#39;t think so. That the lights looked mechanical to her. I am an IT manager for a large construction company and she is a nurse at a local hospital. We are both educated and are not ready to admit we saw alien spacecraft but it was definitely something we have never seen before. I was just wondering if anyone else had reported seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Apparent micrometeoroid flash  1)	I went outside the club around 9:10 p.m. tonight to get some air, and walked to a dark area near the end of a parking lot between some trees. At about 50 degrees SE of the zenith there was a bright cloud over Parker, CO, at a height of about 10,000-15,000 feet.  It was oblong and extended down to the horizon.  Otherwise the seeing was great overhead with a dark and crisp sky (usual for autumn in Colorado).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  	I looked up and found Cygnus (extending about 0-30 degrees southeast of the zenith), then over to the west to find Lyra (normal sky gazing for me), then back at Cygnus, and then slightly to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  	A very faint micrometeoroid flash occurred in Lyra.  What struck me was that it was extremely faint, so short (less than 2 moon widths) and that it had a slight “j” hook to the east. This was at about 10-20 degrees SSW of the zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  	Total sightig--about 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> II. UFO  1)  	Following the trajectory of the micrometeoroid flash (contrail?), within  a second or so and starting about 10 degrees due south, I saw an object moving across the star field at an apparent high altitude, squareish, with a cluster of lights centrally located within the square (perhaps a violet and a white light, extremely faint, and perhaps 1-2 others).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  	The object at first moved generally east toward Cygnus, shifting erratically back and forth at 90 degrees, while jumping erratically 5+ degrees north and south, instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  	The object appeared to maintain the same altitude throughout the sighting, and was less than ¼ of a moon width. It finally disappeared to the SE into the glare of the cloud over Parker, and I waited to see if it appeared under the cloud--it didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  	Total sighting- about 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> III. Personal notes  1)	I’ve been a sky gazing hobbyist for over 45 years (I’m 54 now), and I know what to look for in the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)	I’m a veteran of seven archaeological projects including a survey, and am used to looking quickly for unusual detail (20:13 vision).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)	Except for some inconsistencies with the Nasca features and the nearby hill theory, or an occasional mutilation that goes against the predator theory, I’m afraid I’m pretty much a “Skeptical Inquirer” type.  Crop circles are all pranks, etc.<n>
10/4/07 21:00|Toledo|OH|Light|10 minutes|Unknown Lights above The Maumee River|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59118.html|395|ndxe200710| Unknown Lights above The Maumee River<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten a phone call on 9-04-07 at 9pm from my cousin who was down at the Maumee river behind Marshall School(near 75). He had told me to come outside and look above Marshall school and tell him if I see weird lights floating in the sky. Sure enough I was looking at the same thing he was. It was a slanted line of about 9 lights all flashing red,green,blue, and white. I ran back to the front door and called my Grandma and Grandpa  to come outside to see what we were looking at. Sure enough they seen it to. I ran back to the house and got the camera. When I came back outside 4 of our neighbors heard us saying &#34;Oh my god what is that?&#34; and came outside. They were right along with us with there cameras taking pictures. Nothing showed up on our cameras. All of a sudden the object started to lower very slowly and all of a sudden vanished. We were all just stunned. I came back into the house and downloaded the pictures. Nothing was on them. I Redid the contrast and lightened the pics and sure engough weird lights and speckles were on the pictures. I have some pictures I will be sending you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/4/07 19:00|Burkeville|VA|Light|5 minutes|Red lights flashing and moving erratically through the sky|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59136.html|396|ndxe200710| Red lights flashing and moving erratically through the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I were sitting on our porch talking around 7:00 p.m. (it was dusk).  Our house faces the southeast, and we live in the country (14 miles from town and 50 miles from a big city).  The weather was fair and the sky was party cloudy.  Just before this happened, there were no commercial aircraft directly in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 12-year-old daughter saw something unusual in the sky, to the southeast, and asked me what it was.  I watched for about 30 seconds, sure I could come up with a reasonable explanation (yet pretty curious because I didn&#39;t know what it was).  I saw 5 bright red lights (diamond-shaped), which were spaced at equal distances apart and flashed in sequence from right to left (like a strobe light).  After each sequence was complete, the object would move and appear in a different part of the sky.  I use the term &#34;object&#34; very loosely, as we could not see the object&#39;s profile nor did it make any noise.  Although its movement seemed jerky and unpredictable, the flashing lights were always in a straight line, as if the lights were attached to something straight, but the object was moving in a zigzag pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what I was seeing, I called for my son (very much a skeptic and someone who always has an explanation for everything) to join us outside.  When he looked toward the sky, he responded with &#34;What the flying hell is THAT?!&#34;  He had no idea what he was seeing, and no explanation.  We watch the sky for about 5 minutes, as the object blinked and moved erratically across the sky toward the northwest.  The lights never changed colors or patterns, except in the way the object(s) moved.  Whether in, or out of, cloud cover, we could clearly see the lights -- but never a shape.  The span across, from light to light, was MUCH WIDER than anything I&#39;ve seen before.  I have watched commercial aircraft, helicopters, and various types of military aircraft fly over our farmland for the past 5 years, and I&#39;ve never seen anything that could explain this.  Even fighter jets, when they play war games over our farm, are easy to see, move somewhat predictably, and make a lot of noise.  These lights were silent.  No noise whatsoever. The lights never changed color or shape.  There were no other lights, as you would expect to see on a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object(s) moved further northwest, and nearing the end of my visibility, I saw see three red lights in a V pattern, but I didn&#39;t get to watch long enough to determine whether the original object was changing shape or if other(s) joined it.  If the lights I saw changed shape from a straight line into a V, I would have to wonder what happened to the remaining lights.  Within seconds of losing sight of this &#34;object&#34; or the lights, the sky was, once again, filled with commercial aircraft (and the noise you would expect them to make).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He had a videobox recording that was receiving a wireless signal from the camera he mounted in his fuselage. He asked me to be a spotter while he flown the plane via 3rd person perspective his 3 inch screen hooked up to the receiver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He the plane was directly overhead, I noticed a perfectly round shape that was hovering above us.  It looked like a donut because it appeared to have two circles in each other. (A small circle in a larger circle)  The color was tan or orange and dull and was moving slowly and then disappeared. I believe it was going upwards maybe.  I could not tell if it disappeared or went up out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rubbed my eyes thinking I was seeing sun spots because of the time of day, but sure enough it was still there directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too flabbergasted to say anything to my friend because he was flying his plane and I did not want to distract him.  Nor did I want to be ridiculed or laughed at.  I guess I did not know how to deal with this situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to the link that was posted in the report of that date and time and there IS an object which appears just above the vehicle about to be blown up by the EOD guys. It traverses the screen in a split second but can be seen if you fiddle around with the pause button right after the narrator says &#34;That way nobody gets hurt.&#34; I saved this video to my computer and have been able to catch this object in several progressive moments. The thing is that there appears to be another object just above and to the right of the entry point of the main object. Also, the point of first entry, just above the explosive car, remains visible during the event. It IS very interesting and understandable that it might not have been noticed by the camera crew or others at the time. It is moving at an incredible speed.  If this is not a hoax, it is extremely interesting. Take a look. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an insect as it moves way to fast for that and appears to be in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought you should know that that report may be more than meets the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the link that was included in the report: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8861352531472015562<n>

It flew at a distance of about 6 miles from my point of view and above the mountain at a high altitude. The object traveled in a linear direction at a rate as fast or faster than a jet. It was brighter than a plane and did not have colored lights. I watched it for a few moments more before I noticed a similar bright object that traveled on a path behind the first object. The milkway &amp; constellations were bright and at a significant distance behind object and there was not a cloud in the sky. The first object disappeared after traveling about some miles from my point of view.

My son and his girlfriend observed a large green soundless circular orb in the sky that moved slowly over the city then faded away. A friend of theirs across town called and reported seeing the same phenomenon that also coincided with a power outage at his location. The power was out about 45 seconds. There was some chatter today on local radio about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is no hoax. Although some logical explanation may exist, my son can think of none that match his current scope of knowledge. He is 22 years of age and he and I are both skeptical yet fascinated by the possibility of &#34;visitors.&#34;  He informed me that this was the &#34;real deal&#34; and an incredible sighting of a very large craft. If you are interested in his first hand account or can provide us with an explanation, I’ll put you in touch with him. I have yet to get details from him yet because he was headed to work and pressed for time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He nor I seek any fortune or fame nor attention but are willing to help an investigation, in the interest of an explanation. Unfortunately, I can only attest to the power outage, but you can bet I’ll be running like hell outside if the power flickers tonight. I am sure there are many that could provide details and I simply wanted to let you know, in case you wanted to talk to eyewitnesses in our city. Maybe somebody got a picture.<n>

Walking home from a restaurant about 10:30 I stopped on a darkened street to look at the stars because the night was so clear...after a minute or two I saw a distinct but not lit up crescent shape travelling in a southwesterly direction. It was in view long enough for me to say &#34;Oh my God!...look right there, it&#39;s not lit up&#34;  My husband saw it then and said the same thing. The only reason we could see it were the city lights reflecting off of it...and because we happened to be in a very dark place..there were no lights from it. It was not a plane or a kite or a bird, etc. It moved across the sky and out of sight in about a minute. My husband commented that it couldn&#39;t be that high for the lights to reflect off of it  like they did. It was also two or three fingers wide at arms length...not so small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s relevant, but when I first stopped and looked up I caught sight of a meteorite. Then just a minute or so later the crescent shaped craft came from exactly the same direction that the meteorite had ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was going in the general direction of a Naval Air station not far from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to say it was not a triangle or chevron shape, it was a perfect crescent...with the round part as the leading edge, the points to the back. )<n>

Then 5 minutes later i saw it again for one second, then once more about 5 minutes later it flashed.  There was no sound accompanied by the lights.

While traveling north on Scott Blvd., my S.O. pointed to the 4:00 position, as viewed through the front windshield and said, “Is that a UFO.”  It seemed to be approximately ¼ mile or less from our position and moving very slowly (drifting) to the west, very low, less than a 1000 ft. altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an aviation buff my entire life and have observed anything that flies at one time or another in all types of conditions.  This was close and strange, no sound, appeared spherical (i.e. best guess 60 – 80 ft. diameter), flat metal or gray color and four small lights, my S.O. reported that the lights changed at one point, however, they all appeared red to me, which was my first clue that this was something odd (i.e. not standard aircraft lights.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to follow the craft, as I was in somewhat in shock, I was actually looking at something I couldn’t ID.  I attempted to follow it as it drifted west, I turned off of Scott into a neighborhood trying to follow it, but it eventually drifted behind a tree line.  I then thought I would try to get on highway 70 west in hopes of seeing the object out in the open, however, it took a few minutes to get to 70 and it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancée previously adamantly disbelieved in the possibility of UFO’s, in fact she made fun of my interest frequently.  However, as I was driving and trying not to wreck the car, she got a better look than I did and couldn’t deny what she saw, she was actually sick after the event and somewhat in shock.  We were both sick, as we couldn’t believe what just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Extensive vehicle traffic was present, I expected people to be parked and watching the object, however, the traffic just kept flowing.  Other people had to have seen this, we just don’t want to ask anyone because we both work in a professional field.  I know I saw something I couldn’t ID, I want to know if other people saw it.  Even though we both saw it, both of us have some fear that we are crazy, neither of us slept last night, things were just strange.  I always had hoped I would see a UFO,  but driving home from a baseball game, in the middle of traffic and in a populated area, it caught us completely off guard.  I desperately want to talk to someone about it, we both still feel a little sick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the event happened last night and I missed part of the local news, I don’t know if it is in the Columbia News or paper, I will monitor throughout the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional note:   Before the event I was at a little league baseball game on Scott Blvd., a mile or so from our UFO event.  At 5:50p.m. approximately, a C130 flew over the field fairly low, maybe 3000 ft. or less.  My S.O. asked me to ID the plane, I told her, she said , “why is a military plane flying so low.”  I didn’t think it was anything strange until after the event she mentioned the C130 again, might be nothing, but just wanted to include.  Also, as I was driving, frantic, trying to watch the UFO, it’s possible my directions are off, but I did review a map of the area after the event and I do believe the UFO was drifting to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My phone # is 573-((number deleted)), if someone wants to talk to me, please don’t release my phone number to anyone else, thanks.   Also I tried to send this same message earlier, don&#39;t know if if went through, as I have an old computer, also may have used the wrong month, it was last night, 10-3-07.<n>

On the night of october 3, 2007 8 30 pm ish, I walked out my back door for a cigarette.  Right over my yard, and I will have to guess at the altitude, 1000 ft, perhaps only about 500, as i am not good at judging distance at night,, I saw a bright light, very similar to how a street light looks, only it was traveling from south to north very slowly.  In my mind, I was thinking that if it were a plane it should have flashing lights, and as close as it was, I would definitely  be able to hear it.  this was absolutely silent.  As I was watching, &#34;they, meaning the pilot(s)&#34; turned off the &#34;light&#34;.  It did not instantly go dark, but it gradually dimmed.  Sort of like when you turn off your tv at night, it &#34;glows&#34; for a few moments, before going black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats what this thing did.  And during the 4 or 5 seconds it took from going from bright light to dim then dark, I could clearly see it make a sharp turn to the east, and continued in a eastward direction before it completely disappeared from my sight.  In my opinion, it disappeared from my sight because it was no longer illuminated, as I believe that it continued to travel to the east, rather than disappear &#34; up into space&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was actually quite shaken by this, as I was by myself, but I was not in disbelief, because I have seen similar unexplainable flying objects on several other occasions.  This was different in that it was very close, and also directly over my back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went back inside, and watched tv for about an hour, to calm down, and I decided to go back outside and have another look, to see if I saw anything again.  A couple minutes after stepping out my back door, I saw a VERY bright &#34;meteor?&#34;, or what looked like a meteor, or falling star, except VERY close to the earth, and &#34;fell&#34; from northwest, towards the southeast, and left a very long tail.  This fell, not down from the sky, but fell or traveled horizontally to the earth.  I have seen lots of falling stars before and have seen meteor  showers and the like, but this was the biggest, brightest, and longest lasting thing of that type that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, at this point, i was inclined to go inside the house and stay there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This meteor thing could very well be just that, a meteor, but I found it unusually coincidental that it occurred such a short time after seeing the lit up craft over my yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/3/07 19:15|Burnsville|MN|Light|Hour and a half|UFO lights over Minnesota River in Burnsville that resemble the Phoenix lights.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59087.html|407|ndxe200710| UFO lights over Minnesota River in Burnsville that resemble the Phoenix lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a female and I&#39;m 26 years old.  My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old.  I have seen UFO&#39;s before, but nothing like this.  It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I&#39;m so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn&#39;t see the UFO&#39;s any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO&#39;s and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were.  The UFO&#39;s were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That&#39;s my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white.  I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O&#39;s were n&#39;t as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO&#39;s didn&#39;t move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it&#39;s size, but then the lights weren&#39;t flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO&#39;s, the one in the middle drifted off and did it&#39;s own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn&#39;t come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn&#39;t get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO&#39;s appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P.S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality.  P.S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half.  From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The late afternoon sky was clear. I noticed this bright silver orb at a very high altitude (about the height of a cumulus cloud). And then another. And then another, until there were 7-8 of them. They were tiny, like pinheads and flew randomly, quickly. They would appear and disappear from sight. Before they would disappear, they would turn dull, then dark (aImost black). They would reappear suddenly. There movement was very similar to a swarm of fruitflie:, in close proximity to each other, very random, in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps they were floaters in my eyes, but when I closed them, I didn&#39;t see anything; when I followed the objects, they didn&#39;t move in my field of vision like floaters would. They&#39;d stay where I focussed or followed their movement. I said &#34;Wow! Look at this!,&#34; to alert my co-driver, but I couldn&#39;t get him to see where I indicated, before they all faded and disappeared. &#34;You seeing UFOs?,&#34; he said sarcastically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a single silver orb appeared in the east and flew west, which he did see. It was a bit larger (maybe lower) than the others. This one crossed the sky like an aircraft would, but he agreed it looked strange and not like a plane at all. It moved too slow for a plane at that altitude. It had an aura around it and left a slight trail.  It kept going in a straight line until we lost sight of it due to the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see planes all the time (we are not far from Detroit Metro Airport), but this one was not in a regular flight path, moved too slow and didn&#39;t look like plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college grad in my early 50&#39;s, my co-driver is an army veteran in his mid 40&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think it was probably space junk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance of it seemed to be metallic because I briefly saw a bright glare from it as if the sun behind me were reflecting off of it. The size of it was big at first and then seemed to shrink in size before disintegrating. It didn’t leave any smoke trail after it disappeared. The largest size of it was about the same as if you were to look at a golf ball from 10 feet across the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a 34 year old male, former AF meteorologist and was alone in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I told her it was a star, but she was sure it was moving, and had blinking lights on it. I got my binoculars and looked at it. It was hard to tell if it was moving, but then when I saw an electric line in my foreground, and sitting in the same position I could tell it was moving very slowly. It was pretty far off but I could distinguish red, green, and white lights that blinked. I watched it for about 20 minutes, until I couldn’t see the blinking lights. It appeared to be moving southeast, away from us. We didn’t here any sound from it at any time, and it was just too far away to make out a distinct shape. I might mention it appeared to be very high in altitude. We went back to bed around 2:30 and it was still visible, but barely.

On Oct. 2, 2007 around 11:00 PM I was outside saying goodbye to a few friends.  As they drove away I looked up at the night stars and noticed something strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was what appeared at first to be an airplane flying east to west toward an area between Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain. The object was flashing red and white lights and was flying in and unusual jerking manner.  It may have been the irregually flashing lights that made it appear to be not flying straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple neighbors where out walking.  I mentioned what I was watching and they stopped for about 5 mins. and also saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for about 10 mins. the object moved more south toward Cheyenne Mt. It was over the mountains now.  Then it disappeard for a quick second or two. When it reappeard there were two objects now flashing. They stayed together for only a couple mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first (I think it was the first object) began heading back toward the east the same way it had come.  The other object remained stationary above the mountain.  The object above the mountain slowly &#34;flickered out&#34; over several minutes.  The other object continued headed east. As it passed overhead I could make out the shape of the craft by the configuration of the lights. I could make out four distinct lights.  It was triangular. After a few more minutes the object was no longer in my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like the second object became visible when the first object reached it&#39;s destination. I have seen similar objects with these kind of flickering lights over Colorado Springs previously.  However, I have never seen one appear out of no where.  They usually just fly a straight path until they&#39;re out of sight.  This one had a purpose to it&#39;s flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a stationary object in the sky which appeared to be oval.  As soon as I looked towards it, it took off in a south eastern direction at such a speed which no human machine is capable of doing.  It left a trail similar in appearance to a vapour trail for approximately a 15 degree arc across the horizon which was bright blue in colour. The trail faded gradually over several seconds.  The whole event took no more than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was seated on an a lawn chair on a slope overlooking a bay; there was not much obscuring my view  except a clump of pine trees. The star disapeared behind the stand of trees. I thought it had fizzled. A full two to three seconds elapsed, and it reappeared going the same direction and same speed, toward grand Manan. I shouted  &#34; You&#39;re not supposed to do that!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up though my front windshield, and noticed a triangle formation of three whitish/bright lights.  The formation or “craft” was moving smoothly in a “straight” path.  I called my niece’s attention to it, saying, “What is that?”.   As we watched (and I drove), the lights moved from right to left (east to west, I think) and suddenly disappeared. We heard no noise at all. It appeared to be about the size of dime or less at arm’s length, but it appeared to be very high in the sky, so it was probably very large if it was one craft lighted on three corners.  It was a bright, sunny day with very few clouds in the sky, and none in the area of the craft that it could have gone behind. The craft was visible to us approximately 2 to 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/2/07 02:00|Everett|WA|Light|20min - 30min|A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66749.html|426|ndxe200710| A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred at about 2:00am during the first week of October 2007 while I was visiting my parents in Washington State.  I had just gotten off the phone with my fiancé and was settling down to read myself to sleep on the fold-out bed in the living room.  I was lying on my stomach, absorbed in my book, when a strange feeling of something being amiss suddenly washed over me.  I can&#39;t really explain the feeling better than that; it simply seemed as though something was not quite right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out of the open window, which was directly in front of me at the head of the bed.  This window faces east and overlooks a high school football field at the bottom of the hill that my parents&#39; house sits on.  Beyond the field lies Broadway Ave. and a section of I-5, and beyond that one has a view of the countryside, the small town of Snohomish, and the Cascade Mountains way off in the distance. Peering out the window, I didn&#39;t see or hear anything unusual, just some cars zipping along the freeway and a few lights dotting the foothills of the Cascades.  I shook my head and silently scolded myself for being silly and went back to my book.  After a few moments I glanced out the window again and saw a light in the sky off in the distance.  This light was quite bright and seemed to shift colors; it went back and forth very slowly between muddy yellow and pale orange.  I assumed it was just a helicopter checking out the traffic on the freeway, but I kept watching it anyway.  It stayed in one spot, not moving at all, and I suddenly realised that it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter, at least not any kind of helicopter I&#39;m familiar with.  The light it was giving off was all wrong.  What&#39;s more, I couldn&#39;t hear a thing other than the windchimes on the porch and the traffic on the roads.  Sounds carry very well in that part of the state, and had it been any kind of conventional aircraft I&#39;m certain that I would have been able to hear and identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off the lamp next to my bed and lay in the dark watching the light.  It hovered over I-5 for about 10 minutes, then drifted slowly to the south, along the line of the freeway, and was concealed by a stand of pine trees about 500 feet from the house.  I figured it had gone away, but I stayed in the dark and continued to look out the window.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the light suddenly reappeared from behind the trees.  It moved north and took up its former position over the road and just hovered there, not doing much of anything that I could see.  It stayed in that spot for about 5 to 10 minutes. I started to feel uneasy; I squeezed my eyes shut, lowered my head, and counted to ten.  When I glanced out of the window again the light was gone.  I looked all over the sky but there wasn&#39;t a trace of it anywhere. I waited for a bit to see if it would come back, but it never did.  Finally I turned the lamp on and picked up my book, eventually falling asleep sometime around 3:00am.  Nothing else of note happened the rest of the time I was visiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that I did not feel at all threatened by this light, and if it was a UFO I very much doubt that the intentions of the pilots were hostile in any way.  I have the feeling that whoever, if anyone, was inside this craft was simply interested in seeing what the freeway was all about.  I did feel uneasy, as I said, but this mostly because I was faced with something strange, something I could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been sitting on this story for a year, too embarrassed to tell it to anyone aside from my fiancé.  I am above all else a realist, and when I see something strange I like to exhaust all mundane explanations before I label the experience paranormal.  I have been very intrigued the UFO phenomenon for years, though, and I firmly believe that our vast universe is capable of supporting life on distant planets.  Why those lifeforms should be interested in visiting Earth is beyond me, but as long as they&#39;re not engaging in harmful activities, I say the more the merrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It happened so fast we were both stunned. We couldn’t believe what we saw. If it were something man made it was incredibly fast. It disappeared out of sight too fast for us to see what it was. It looked like a shooting star only going out of the atmosphere.

I was sitting outside just staring up and noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving across the sky.  The object looked like a star moving across the sky.  I have seen other satellites moving across the sky at consistent speeds and directions.  I watched the object and it seem to move.  I stared more intently as the object changed directions and accelerated.  It was a relatively quiet night and there was no sound.  I am an aviation professional and am positive it was not an aircraft.  The change of direction and the speed of the acceleration was unlike any aircraft I am familiar with.  The object also appeared exactly like a satellite or moving star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We thought it was a star or an aircraft, but the lights were blinking in consistency; 3 white flickers then 1 red flicker and back. We live near an airport so we are very familiar on how an aircraft looks like.  Something interesting to point out was that when an aircraft did fly by the lights disappeared, then returned back to the same spot when the aircraft was gone.  It hovered over the same spot for a good 10-15 minutes, moving back and forth.  Then, it suddenly disappeared.  It couldn&#39;t have been a star since stars don&#39;t move.  This sighting was actually the second one for the 2 witnesses, which happened a few years back in 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We looked out in front of the windshield and noticed a huge disk shaped  multi colored object moving slowly across the sky.  It was as big as a Air Canada jumbo plane and it was so low it was just above roofs of houses it flew by.  This is the first time any of us ever seen anything like this.  It was hard to believe . We asked around if anybody in our area spotted one and there were numerous sightings but no one knows where to report such a sighting.  As i was driving practically underneath it we all seen the under Neath of it . It was like the movies where you could clearly see the lights were red,blue,green,yellowish/orange, and in the middle of it glowed a bright light ,you could see  the part that zaps people up ,i don’t know any other way to explain it. But my mother and auntie live in the country and they say every 3 days a bright circle object lands in a field and remains hovering not far from the earth from 3 am ! till 5 am before sunrise and at the end of it three or more little objects shoot out from it in every direction. But that sighting i have never witnessed but my mother would give more detail of that event.<n>

T|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59031.html|446|ndxe200710| Me and my friend were facing north-west a few minutes after midnight and saw two or maybe four objects flashing bright red and white.  They were extremely active moving in the south-west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the airplanes flew out of range the objects appeard as two. I was not sure if there were four initially or two moving at high speeds to appear to fly in a zig-zag above the airplanes which were flying towards LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my girlfriend up and she them too. Very exciting and chilling as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, J, Los Angeles  I work at a healthfood store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriends brother is unemployed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend is a sign language interpreter.<n>
