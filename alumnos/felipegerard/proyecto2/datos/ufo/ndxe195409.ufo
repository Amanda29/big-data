Soon we were on our way to the porch, headed for the front door, when I heard my mother exclaim &#34;Look, what&#39;s that in the sky over the neighbor&#39;s house?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, who was very fatigued, first scoffed at the notion, but then, as he was about to say something, he was cut short by awe, and fell silent for a moment.  A second later, I heard him murmur &#34;I don&#39;t know what that is...&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew my father was not one to be surprised, so I took a look as well.  When I turned, I saw something that bewilders me to this day.  The object was shaped like the planet Saturn, however both the &#39;ring&#39; and the sphere were one piece.  The peculiar craft spun in a jerky fashion, and the color was a soft luminous green, similar to that seen on glow-in-the-dark toys and LED clock screens.  The object came from the north, and was moving in a southward direction.  The craft made no discernible noise. We watched the craft for 3-4 minutes until it changed course, seemingly veering west, until it seemed to ascend and disappear from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident, we went inside and we all discussed the bizarre occurrence for a few minutes, until my mother said &#34;it&#39;s bedtime&#34;, which prompted me to go upstairs, where I drifted slowly to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus ends the odd affair, something I will not soon forget, and something that I hope can help prove what I know is true, the fact that there is life in this universe aside from our own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned above an arbitrary date, which reflects &#34;fall of 1954.&#34;  PD))<n>
9/9/54 12:30|Beaumont|TX|Disk|5 MINUTES|Aprox. 30 Disk shaped UFOs fell out of clouds got in V formatin  and shot toward a black rain cloud avoiding a Jet Plane.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34019.html|2|ndxe195409| Aprox. 30 Disk shaped UFOs fell out of clouds got in V formatin  and shot toward a black rain cloud avoiding a Jet Plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A brother and I were working on the outside of a house in South Beaumont on 9/9/1954 or 9/11/1954. I remember that New York had a hurricane of their coast on that day. We heard a Jet Plane overhead. It was cloudy so we did not see the Jet. (We are both Air Force Vets and know their sound which were few in number in 54.) We saw what appeared to be free falling disks. They had the motion of free falling paper plates (powerless). They then stopped decending and slowly got in a V formation. The Jet, which they appeared to be avoiding, was out of hearing range at that time. Then they started moving in a southerly direction. The Jet plane was going north. They flickered as they moved and turned to the East toward a large Black rain cloud. They quickly accelerated to a very high speed still in V formation. Estimated speed was about 450 MPH. They were unstable and took turns shooting up or down (90 deg.turns) and then returning to their position in the fast moving V formation. These dull metallic colored disks then disappeared into the dark rain cloud. No lights or sounds were noted. They were at approx. 4000 ft elevation and appeared to me to be about 4 to 6 ft. in diameter. I have seen no more UFOs in the last 49 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made no report since the Blue Book croud were calling everything Weather baloons. We did see reports that UFOs were seen in 5 Nations on that same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

September 1954, I caught a glimpse overhead of a disc-shaped, metallic in color object that just came from nowhere straight down and stopped.  The bottom was concave and very distinct in detail.  I was called upon to &#34;eyes front&#34; while I marched, but I couldn&#39;t help but look back up and when I did, it just shot straight up from a large disc to nothing.  What I mean is, it shot up at such speed that it kept getting smaller and smaller and then disappeared.  I know what I saw and can draw a very vivid picture of it if needs be.  It was definitely not a weather balloon ! !  I&#39;ve never spoken of it.  You just didn&#39;t do that.  Until now.  Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
