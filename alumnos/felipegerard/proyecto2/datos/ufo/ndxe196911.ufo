The lights were so bright we turned our eyes away from them and shielded our eyes with our hands. We were riding a snow machine so we stopped and waited for  what we thought was a car. There was no sound and then the lights began to back up, and then dissapeared as if the driver had changed their mind and was going back down the hill instead of coming toward us. We got back on the snow machine and started up toward the road, but when we got to where the lights had been there were no tracks of any kind, not even snow machine tracks.  We continued on and then my brother told me to turn off the flashlight so the batteries would not wear down. I told him I didn&#39;t have the flashlight on and he said &#34;oh sh_t !  I looked down to where he had been looking and saw what looked like a number of light patterns that were running along beside us on the snow.  Each light pattern had like three separate lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the light patterns took off and went through the woods, but not like normal lights. It was as if they were going somewhere and they did not float in the air they skimmed over the snow around trees and dissappeared over a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

While hovering, craft made a moaning sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were travelling cross country and stopped at a camp ground for the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very deserted there because it was the off season. We parked at the top of a hill. Just as my mom and dad exited the car I heard my dad say &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; He sounded afraid. I jumped out of the car and stood next to them and in the night sky very close to us was a round, well light ufo. I say UFO because I simply don&#39;t know what else to call it. I was very young, about 8 at the time and really in shock so I can&#39;t give much in the way of detail. The craft seemed to be hoovering in one spot and I do recall an eerie sound. The only time I have ever heard a sound like that again was during an earthquake. The only way I could describe it would be as a moaning noise that went up and down in pitch. After staring at the craft for a moment or two, it just dropped straight down very quickly and then shot off in a straight line and was gone. I have never really discussed this with anyone even my mom and dad. I think we were all too shaken to ever discuss it again. I have only one other memory of that incident. I beleive it was the next day. Walking thru a little country market with my parents. I was still very shaken and I honestly don&#39;t remember what happened between watching that craft shoot off and when I was next walking in the store. I don&#39;t think we were abducted because I watched it leave but I do seem to have some time memory loss. Thank you for hearing my story<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

11/1/69 22:00|Camp Pendleton|CA|Light|2 minutes|Object could only be seen through a Starlight Scope (infra-red device)|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65968.html|6|ndxe196911| Object could only be seen through a Starlight Scope (infra-red device)<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Report November, 1969 Camp Pendleton, CA  While attending Scout/Sniper School for the Marine Corp I was witness along with at least 30 other Marines of a UFO.  This occurred during our night training on the firing range using Starlight Scopes.  This night was a clear night but without a moon.  The background in the distance was the mountain range on Camp Pendleton.  During the firing practice everyone who was firing using a Starlight Scope became exited by a bright light they could see through the scope.  The light was flying/hovering fairly low to the ground in the distance.  The weird part was that you could only see this light using the Starlight Scope.  With the naked eye you saw nothing; no light whatsoever.  Through the scope the light was obvious and moving over the horizon.  My recollection of this event would have been over a 30-90 second time period.  I looked at least 3 times through the scope to observe the UFO then with my naked eye and could see nothing.  I was watching through the scope when the bright object went around one of the mountains and came into view again from a valley.  The object began to rise into the air higher and then disappeared into the sky in a streak of light similar to a falling star but away from the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I noticed  an unusual star formation of 5 shiny objects, in a perfect Pentagon pattern.  That is what caught my eyes, as there were a tremendous number of stars visible, due to the very Clear Arctic sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some 2 minutes or so, I saw them all converge, at the same time, into the center of the Pentagon, at an upward angle, leaving a shiny trail behind each one, like a flash.  After several seconds, after they formed what appeared to be a single object, the single now larger object left up an upward angle into space, at an amazing speed. leaving what appeared to be a streak of light, until the object got smaller, and smaller, then eventually disappeared in some 5 seconds or so!   Amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be silvery shiny, and very small, for altitude,  I would guess some 15 to 30 miles!   I wish I had a digital camera!<n> <n><n> <n><n> How the objects went from a Pentagon formation, into one object was amazing, all moved at the same time, and converged at the same point, all together, then after a few seconds, the now larger silvery object, traveled out into space at about a 80 degree angle, very fast, leaving just one solid streak of light as it accelerated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done a lot of work on Weather Balloon systems, Radiosonde Tracking Systems, called WBRT&#39;s, for many years, and have tracked these many times as part of my job.  I have also seen several visible rocket launches on experiments by the Univ. Of Alaska, ESSA, etc., in tracking Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.  I had a good background of electronics, radio, and radars, etc., and Weather Observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have talked to Eskimos in the Arctic, at Point Barrow, Nome, Kotzebue, and Barter Island, of some of their sightings over the Arctic Ocean.  This was the first, and only time, I have ever seen anything so unusual, that I could not identify.  I have worked extensively with certified Weather Observers at many airports, and very familiar with Weather Observations, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I am retired from NOAA NWS, having worked on their new WSR-88D NEXRAD Doppler Radars, with their towers, having Fiberglass Panels, in the shape of a Pentagon!  This has always been a reminder to me, of that nite in Fairbanks, back around 1969.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if anyone else has seen a formation like this, in the shape of a Pentagon??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

11/1/69 07:00|San Juan Capistrano|CA|Unknown|10 seconds|My brother saw a little man.|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32799.html|8|ndxe196911| My brother saw a little man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One morning in either late 1969 or early 1970, my six-year-old brother told me that he had seen a &#34;little man&#34; just outside his window.  His bed was just under the window, which looked out onto the front doorstep area.  I was eight at the time, and I pressed him for details, but all he could tell me was he had seen a &#34;little man.&#34;  The house we lived in at the time was at the very edge of a brand new housing development, very near the top of the hill.  Just over the hill was nothing but rolling hills, rattlesnakes, jackrabbits, and a horse stable.  This area would therefore have provided the perfect place to land undetected, and was within walking distance of our house.  To the &#34;little man,&#34; I am sure our neighborhood would have seemed like a new human colony which had just sprung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
