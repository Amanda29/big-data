1/31/07 20:15|Bushey (UK/England)||Light|Ongoing|Green and white flashing light over Bushey, Hertfordshire, England. has been observed for past 40 mins..  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD)|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55060.html|1|ndxe200701| Green and white flashing light over Bushey, Hertfordshire, England. has been observed for past 40 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object has been observed for the past 17 minutes, and as I write is still visible in the night sky. Weather conditions are fine and clear with excellent visibility and a full moon.  It is at present situated 149 degrees SSE and I calculate it to be approximately 23 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After first sighting the object, I mistook it for a bright star/planet.  However, as I watched I noticed that the object was flashing the colours white/green/white/green and so on.  I instantly dismissed what I thought was a star/planet for an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned inside my house and gave the object no further thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my rear garden between 5 and 10 minutes later to discover that the object was and still is, clearly visible.  My interest now aroused I decided to study it.  I called to my wife and pointed out the object to her, and what I had already seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we began to watch, I had a feeling that the object was not in the same position it was when I had first seen it, unfortunately I could not be sure. I timed our study which lasted 17 minutes. Within this time we saw the object move in a manner I would describe as follows; far to slow for a plane, too high and in one position for too long to be a helicopter and too fast for a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The constellation of Orion is clearly visible in the south eastern sky and having just looked the object is now in the 8 o&#39;clock position as you look at the constellation. (If that makes sense?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is of use to someone?? I am a 34 yr old police officer and my wife is a 35yr old hair stylist. We have lived at our current home for the past 18 months.  This is the first time any object like this has been seen by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have written back to the source of the report, inquiring whether the object might have been the star, Sirius.  His angular estimates are very accurate, and indicate to us that he and his wife may have been looking at Sirius.  We have invited them to look again on the next night, to establish whether the object might be visible again, or not.  PD))<n>

We looked upand a large triangle was hovering above us. It was changing colors from red to blue to gray to white. There was a haze around the object. There were 2 lights on the flat edge of the triangle. When it was hovering, our METAL tennis rackets startedto try to get away from us.  A third light turned on then it madea large popping noise and a flame went out of the flat edge and it took off leaving a trail that looked like toxic chemicals. The trail was glowing yellow.<n>

My girlfriend suggested that maybe it could be an helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as soon we were approaching, we realized that the speed was very very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its direction was opposite to ours, like it was taking the highway direction opposed to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed under it we were surprised to see that it had a triangular shape, with the same size as a small airplane. Besides the strong light in the front, we saw green lights (which weren&#39;t blinking) on the borders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was already dark at that time, but it seemed that this object had a dark color too. Between dark grey and black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with a speed around 80Km/h which allowed us to have a small glimpse of some of its details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a normal aircraft for sure it hadn&#39;t any normal patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These white lights really caught my attention, the weather clear with and with good visibility. They appeared to be very close, maybe at about an altitude of 10,000 feet. They did not move for about 2 or 3 minutes then one of the white lights started moving, breaking the formation and making a straight line formation. Then suddenly I saw several other smaller lights (star-like) appearing in the sky and moving towards these 3 big white bright lights, some were steady and others were traveling at fast speed. I was able to count at least 25 of them, but I saw more appearing from the north east, it looked like it was an invasion. I’m a private pilot and I’m 100% sure that it was not an plane nor an air show. I have never seen anything like that before because of the way they were moving,  and clearly it couldn’t have been a plane because there were no red or green blinking lights. Whatever it was it seemed as if they were observing us. After a while about 10 to 15 minutes later they all starting moving and dispersing from the sky; my friend was trying to take pictures with her camera phone but the resolution was very poor. I later went back to our office and I tried to contact the FAA to report it, but I was not able to get in touch with them, I called the 24 Hour Safety Hotline at 800-255-1111 and all I got was a recording but I never left a message about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report is helpful to you, and should you find something relating to our sighting please let us know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind regards, Mauricio Diaz<n>

I observed the object over a period of 12 minutes. The object exhibited a bouncing motion at times. Occasionally there where pin point lights that flashed at an extended distance from the three point configuration. There were no stars in the sky at the time of this sighted. You could however see the moon. I watched closely for 12 minutes and then laid back down. I couldn&#39;t sleep so I looked out the window again and the triangle formation was much further in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I have winessed this type of object in the sky. The first time was approximately 10 years ago. At that time the object appeared to be a greater distance from the earth and did not have the pin point lights extending from a distance. At that time I was with a friend and we thought it might possibly be a satillite but had never seen anything like it in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/30/07 23:30|London (UK/England)||Sphere|20 minutes|Slow moving bright sphere, 5x as large as star, 10x brighter. Intense white, blue and red.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius sighting.  PD))|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55040.html|6|ndxe200701| Slow moving bright sphere, 5x as large as star, 10x brighter. Intense white, blue and red colours<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only witness as the rest of my family has gone to bed.  I was watching TV but the blinds were open and a bright light appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop of the house opposite mine.  The object was in view for approximately 30 minutes and then it disappeared behind the outline of the chimney on the same house opposite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 22 years old and a recent Psychology graduate.  I am currently studying in preparation to begin a medical degree in September 2007.  I have perfect eyesight and at the time of viewing this object, I was completely sober and alert.  I’m now writing this description immediately after viewing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop it caught the corner of my eye as I was watching TV.  It was hard to determine the shape because it was obviously very far away, but it seemed round.  I thought it might be a star but because I live in London it is unusual to see such a bright star and with the naked eye I could not see any other stars in the sky from my living room.  This was partly because there is a sodium street lamp right outside my house which generates quite a lot of orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed almost immediately that this round bright object was pulsating.  I would say it was pulsating every 3-5 seconds.  Also I originally thought it was white but soon realised it was actually very colourful. It was predominantly a bright white but parts of it were blue and red.  With the naked eye it was about the size of a typical large star in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get some binoculars and then the colours and pulsating were very obvious - it was quite mesmerizing.  Through the binoculars I could see some very faint stars in the night sky around the object and I would say the object was 5 times as large as the stars and 10 times as bright.  It was very bright to look at through the binoculars which actually caused me to become dazed after a few minutes of constantly watching it to the point that I needed a short break.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely wasn&#39;t an aircraft because it was too far away and because the pulsating colours were very different from the blinking lights of an aircraft i.e., the pulses were non-uniform and the colours de-localised.  I live under the flight path to Heathrow Airport, so I&#39;m very familiar with aircraft and what they look like from all altitudes.  I wouldn&#39;t say it was a star because it was moving too fast across the sky and conversely it was too slow to be an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, that maybe it was a satellite.  Anyway, the object was moving South at about 1 degree every 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d be interested to see if anyone else reports it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the source of the report, inquiring whether he might have been viewing the star, Sirius.

1/30/07 23:00|St. Thomas (near; on cruise ship)||Oval|several hours|Many clusters lof lights over the Caribbean|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55225.html|7|ndxe200701| Many clusters lof lights over the Caribbean<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past several years we have noticed flashing lights over the Caribbean while we have been on cruises.  I have pointed them out to many people on the ship and that would always say that they were aircraft.  I noted that they would not move as I watched them for several hours.  On Jan28, 28 and 30 I was on top deck of a cruise ship and seen a group of flashing lights off the starboard side at both 11 o&#39;clock and 1 o&#39;clock.  The cluster at 1 o&#39;clock was very bright  with red, blue, white and yellow flashing lights.  Very bright.  At about 12 midnight we heard a loud &#34;gong&#34; and a deep voice which the wife and I could not understand.  The nest day I contacted an engineer on the bridge of our ship and inquired as to the existance of the lights and if they were a satalite.  He said he had seen the lights, described them and could not tell me their origin.  The wife snd also noted several more light clusters way off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/30/07 22:50|Quincy|CA|Cylinder|1-2 minutes|Tri-colored cylinder shaped object at about 500 feet disappears into mountains 5-10 miles away.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55050.html|8|ndxe200701| Tri-colored cylinder shaped object at about 500 feet disappears into mountains 5-10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking toward the southeast. I saw a flashing yellow light.  As it got closer, I noticed that this object was low.  The surrounding hills are about 500 -1000 feet high.  The craft kept moving to my right and at this point I saw 3 colors. The right side was the yellow light.  The middle was red and the left side was white.  The shape of the craft was like a cylinder, in that all of the lights seemed uniform in size and shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange was that the craft, which I thought was a plane or helicopter, its lights would dim and brighten up at the same time.  It was not like the usual &#34;blip&#34; of a plane, but the lights would fade in and out, all at the same time.  Imagine opening and closing your hand.  That was the effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon is almost full, so I could see the silhouette of the hills to my right.  The object crossed over the first set of hills, and then disappeared behind the 2nd.  The hills at this point are no higher than 500 feet.  So, I expected whatever this was to bank over them and then go to the local airport only 3 or 4 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object never reappeared. I was not in a very noisy area, but not perfectly quiet, so I cannot tell you if it was making any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One very interesting thing is that at about 7:00 to 7:15 PM a large helicopter flew over our town.  Although the moon was out, the helicopter was at about 2 o’clock and I could not make out its shape against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the helicopter first, and then saw that it had a yellow or orange light. It made the usual &#34;blip.&#34;  A very small white light preceded these lights.  It was very hard to see because of the streetlights, but based on its location, this helicopter was very long.  It could have been one of the dual propeller ones. Anyway, it banked over the town and headed northwest.  As it left, there were 2 lights in the back, blipping at different quick intervals, then a minute later, back to only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have had helicopters fly over before.  However, they usually land at the airport.  This one banked away from the airport, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I actually expected to see a flash of light because of how low the craft was.  I thought it was going to crash.  However, there was no flash.  All I know is that this tri-colored cylindrical object was visible for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then disappeared behind some hills.  Perhaps it was a plane, but I have never seen one that low that did not land at the airport.<n>

I didn&#39;t think too much about it until the next day when I downloaded the images onto the computer and was puzzled as to what the object (besides the moon) was. It was way above the landline so not a car light, nor could it be a reflection from the window glass or interior of room as I was leaning right out of window. As I had experienced a perplexing possible close encounter before I wondered if it was a ufo.??<n>

Went to go pick up cousin and tell him.  Then went looking for it but couldn’t find it.  So, we went to Hagley Landing for a better view.  We arrived at about 7:05 pm, we saw the white/orange colored lights, not as bright as before.  The light seemed to be hovering in place but it seemed as if it was dropping extremely slow.  We could see a reflection of the light on the Waccamaw River and noticed that the reflection was decreasing in light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to leave because it was cold, then as we got into the truck and started to leave, out of nowhere another orange colored light was moving in a straight line from right to left until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get out of the truck once again and thought it might be an airplane but it didn’t have any blinking lights.  We looked over to the first light and noticed it was almost gone, behind the trees.  The whole event took place over 40 minutes.<n>

((NUFORC Note:  May be Venus in the SW sky.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was the usual busy air traffic coming and going from McCord AFB, Sea-Tac Int., and Boeing Field which we were both very familiar with.  Each airplane in the normal traffic routinely displays white, red, and green lights, frequently to be seen blinking rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-worker first noticed a bright fire engine red colored light moving at a slower speed than the average airplane, and was not following the normal traffic approach pattern.  There were no white or green lights or blinking associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first appeared southeast of our location moving toward the southwest from over the ridge top behind Port Orchard, WA, moved out into the open, and then from our viewpoint appeared to stop and hover over that town.  My general feeling was that it was a much greater distance away, and was not actually over the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 20 minute sighting the object stopped four times, the last time it stopped for almost ten minutes.  Then it simply blinked out and was gone.  It didn’t fade into the distance as it moved, it just went out and wasn’t there any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting happed from 18:45 to 19:05.<n>

It reappeared and then faded out a minute or so later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through my hand in a cupped shape to block out any peripheral vision blur or flare. It looked just like a red star moving very slow.It did not blink,it was solid red the whole time,just a star sized red dot.

In addition, I&#39;ve been a life long aviation enthusiast, so I often watch the sky&#39;s. This evening I saw a light pattern that I&#39;ve NEVER seen on a commercial or military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading westbound on Lake St. in Bloomingdale IL, and had just past Bloomingdale Ave.  I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane in the sky, on final approach to O&#39;Hare, heading in a north easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the object caught my eye, because of the flashing lights that it was producing.  I saw what initially appeared to be wingtip landing lights, except that they were flashing in an alternating pattern.  I found this unusual, because I&#39;ve never seen a commercial airliner &#34;flash&#34; it&#39;s landing lights like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed a smaller, flashing red light on top of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I&#39;m pondering this, all of the sudden, four to five more white lights illuminate sequentially from right to left along the same horizontal plane between what I considered the &#34;wing tip&#34; lights and they began to flash intermittently as well!  That is something that I have NEVER seen a commercial  airplane do!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was paying so much attention to the object that I decided to pull off and turn around before I hit another vehicle on the road.  However, by the time I did so, I had lost sight of it, and could only see &#34;normal&#34; air traffic in the pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be unusually eloquent and credible.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  We have estimated the time of the sighting, and assigned an arbitrary time.

The objects were paralell to one another but yet one seemed to be traveling in a downward path and the other one up. Both had a wide short tail following them. I say wide in comparison to the comercial aircraft that were also flying the skies that day, it made them look very small. After about 5 minutes or so the obect on the left made a fast hook-like motion leaving a trail and they both disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving faster than I would expect a plane to move, and at first I thought it must be a meteor.  As it sped by me, I could see that it was in fact some sort of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on the approach, I could only see a few smallish cluster of bright lights, looking at it from behind, I could see a rectangular grid area strongly lit, most likely the propulsion system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to look at it in my rear view mirror, I saw that it quickly slowed down, and the rear grid greatly increased in brightness.  Soon after that it disappeard from view, probably around the side of the bank of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft couldn&#39;t have been more than 100 feet above the ground, more likely 50 feet.  After realizing that it wasn&#39;t a meteor, the next logical conclusion would be that it was a low flying aircraft, but it was moving quite fast, much faster than 100 miles an hour.  I was only able to see it for about three seconds, even though it was running parallel to the road.  Even though at its closest it couldn&#39;t have been more than 300 feet away, it never made even a glimmer of a sound.  However, my windows were up at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lit rectangular grid region on the back of the craft was unusual, however, and I can&#39;t quite think of anything I&#39;ve previously seen that would describe it.  Its flaring up as the craft quickly decelerated was also odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving so fast, and traveling so close to the ground, that the pilot must have been using night vision, or else have been extremely fool-hardy.<n>

The weather was less then partly cloudy with an almost invisible layer of patchy mist or fog closer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 degrees south of the full moon, I noticed a pulsating white light.  About one pulse every ten seconds.

The duration has increased from one hour to two and three hours.  Last week they stayed till almost daylight which was quite unusual.  They come up off the desert floor and seperate.  They were farther in the distance before but the longer I observe the closer they appear to come.  Small craft comes off larger craft for longer periods of time.  The smaller craft (or circles) stay and bounce off the desert floor then return to the larger sphere.  The sphere has changed color on occasion from just white with red rimmed lights to a green white glow that changes shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looks as if the crafts change from one night to the next.

1/28/07 00:01|Ballard (Seattle)|WA|Chevron|7 secondds|Chevron shaped craft turning at low altitude to intercept a jet in Seattle|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54995.html|39|ndxe200701| Chevron shaped craft turning at low altitude to intercept a jet in Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was midnight.  Standing on my porch, I looked up to notice what initially appeared to be a large hang glider with soft lights on each wing.  The craft was flying gracefully from south to north direction and then tilted its body to show the under side of the craft.  I could then see the chevron shape of the craft. Soft lights were evenly spaced on the bottom of the wings.  It moved off toward the west and gained altitude.  The craft flew into a heavier cloud of fog away from me.  It flew beautifully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night conditions were pretty bright considering the patches light fog in the area.  There was more than a half-moon out, just above the ufo.  I could see the brightest stars in the sky as well as a dimly-lit  group of stars formed in a irregular shaped diamond pattern just below the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting, I noticed a jet flying south to north approximately 5 miles west of ufo.  It appeared the craft was attempting to intercept the craft.  I&#39;ll bet the people on the jet witnessed the ufo as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was completely silent.  I live north of Sea-Tac Airport where the planes start their descent to land and the sounds of the planes are easily identifiable.  I could hear the sound of the jet in background yet, this craft being closer, made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance of the jet and the ufo were definitely hard to ascertain.   Even the relative distance between them was hard to gauge. Given this, I can only give a pretty rough estimate as the size of the ufo.  Originally, I thought I was witnessing a hang glider with lights.  I soon realized this was incorrect, since it was too large.  Compared to a modern fighter aircraft, I would guess it was similar in size. It could be twice this size. It was flying at relatively low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the craft tilted and made the turn west, I could see the thickness of it.  Looking from the rear of the craft, the height and width appeared to be the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t flying at high speed.  I would guess between 65-250 mph.  However, there really is no way to tell with a high degree of certainty because of the distance and size are unknowns as well.  The sighting lasted around 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the ufo were very soft, perhaps with some color.  There was some thin fog in the area so this could have been an illusion.  The jet in the background had much brighter and white lights.  There were 3 lights per &#39;wing&#39; on the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft is really impressive.

A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness&#39; perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker&#39;s stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue. Moving south to north, from the direction of the sun towards north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and looked at the faces of the crowd together with the media risers close behind me- NO REACTION AT ALL ! That really bothered me, too !<n>

I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game &#34;Breakout&#34; where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I’ve ever seen, and it’s in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it’s position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this makes sense; I’ve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don&#39;t know how to use the thing!)<n>

(Our friend’s home is north of Hendersonville, TN and is located near Beech High School.  The visibility of the night sky is fantastic, as no strong city-light presence exists.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came out to his garage and we both noticed an unusual set of fairly-bright lights back toward the southwest.  I got back out of my car, not looking away from the set of lights, and asked him if he was seeing those lights as well.   He commented out loud that he’s never seen anything like that before.  (He and I work for the same company, where he’s been a technical engineer for 25+ years.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two set of lights were approximately the size of peas, at arm’s length.  The lower set of lights seemed to have blinking/nav-lights on the outer edges.  Basically, both sets initially appeared the same; three lights across a plane with the middle being brighter and the outer two blinking at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both sets of lights hung motionless for approximately 3-5 minutes.  The lower set started to dim then slowly dropped downward and arced off toward the east.  We lost sight of it when it dropped below the ridgeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining (slightly higher) set of three lights, still hung motionless for another few minutes.   After simply hanging there for a few minutes, the middle light started growing in intensity.   So much so, that my buddy and I were still talking out loud about it (not taking our eyes off of it) asking each other if we were seeing them same things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My six year old daughter came outside and saw them too.  She freaked out, hearing us talking about them in wonderment, and ran back inside.  (We had a good chuckle about that.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle light grew so bright, that the three lights appeared to merge into a single light.  That’s the best I can describe how much it grew in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or two of that brilliance, it appeared to also start descending and arcing off toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The point at which both of these sets of lights dropped and started arcing off toward the east, it really reminded me of the way a normal aircraft would have localized and turned toward the traffic pattern to land.   However, neither of us has ever seen anything quite like this before.  (I have been an aviation enthusiast for 25+ years and consider myself very knowledgeable of the subject matter.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the local news reports, hoping to see/hear any references to this event as I’m sure this happened near, or just to the north of, Nashville proper.  However, I did not hear any mention of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These could have been some military aircraft, but I have never seen any night-landing configuration quite like it; nor have I watched something like this just hang motionless in the sky for several minutes, all without any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were close enough to have produced some engine-signature, had they been normal aircraft.<n>

I passed a group of trees which blocked my view for about 3 secs. and the single orange point of light was no longer at the horizon, instead it was nearly above me but this time it was 2 seperate bright orange lights.  It was moving very fast from due south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stop my truck and rolled the window down.  There was no sound coming from it.

I took a left onto Green Valley Road, Stockton Springs, Maine from Old County Road. I and my son riding in the front seat saw a fiery object rapidly descending from the sky to the east of our position. My son in the rear seat did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was orange (according to my son; I am color blind), it appeared to me to be the color of fire).  At first I thought it might be a shooting star but it lasted a bit too long and appeared to be very close to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought it might be a flare or, perhaps, an exploding transformer since the temperature was below zero Fahrenheit.  But it seemed to fall way too rapidly and in too straight a path to be either of those things.  It doesn’t seem plausible that it was any known aircraft since it featured just the one fiery light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it might have landed behind our house, perhaps within hundreds of feet.  Of course if it was a large object, it’s possible it fell miles away.  Less than three miles to the east here takes you over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Green Valley Road is a sparsely populated neighborhood in a very small town in a very rural state. To give you some perspective, our back yard is 44 mostly wooded acres.  Anyway, we went up the road a few hundred yards to see if anything was smoldering but saw nothing of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a listen but the wind was howling with gusts, I believe, of more than twenty miles per hour, perhaps twice that.  Obviously, conditions not conducive to detecting unusual sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I speculate it was a meteor or a piece of space junk.

1/26/07 18:30|Honolulu|HI|Light||Strange light over Hawaii doing zig zag. ((News article by Andrew Pereira.))  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a photo of a contrail.  PD))|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55065.html|58|ndxe200701| Strange light ofer hawaii doing zig zag<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO’s seen over South Shore sky By Andrew Pereira<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to draw a surfer&#39;s attention away from the next wave, but whatever was in the northwest sky Friday evening around 6:20 p.m. drew a crowd along Kewalo Basin and Ala Moana Beach Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honolulu resident Peter Hollingworth described as two lights circling in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video of one of the lights was recorded from the Channel 2 SkyCam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;These two little fireballs with a stream behind it,&#34; said Hollingworth.  &#34;Looked kind of like a shooting star, but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, Then it went out then it came back in again&#34;  Hollingworth was surfing with his 12 year old son when the unexpected show began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing&#39;s coming straight for Honolulu.  It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.&#34;   So what was it?  The National Weather Service says nothing showed up on their radar at the time of the sighting and the Federal Aviation Administration didn&#39;t report anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The U.S. military conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai Friday evening but the test didn&#39;t begin until 7:20 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;This in a sense is an unidentified flying object,&#34; said University of Hawaii astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams.  &#34;It&#39;s something in the sky that&#39;s moving that we haven&#39;t identified.&#34;  Wynn-Williams believes there&#39;s a simple explanation behind the UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It&#39;s probably a contrail of some kind,&#34; he said while watching video of one of the lights at his Kailua home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The professor says contrails are caused by high flying airplanes burning hydrogen based fuels. One of the byproducts of the fuel exhaust is water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.&#34;  Wynn-Williams doubts little green men from Mars are behind the UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Some people just think differently than scientists and they like to look for the fanciest most exciting explanation. Those people would like to think it&#39;s little green men, I think that&#39;s very unlikely.&#34;  According to published reports this is not the first time a UFO has grabbed the attention of Hawaii residents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December of 2004 an unexplained streak of light was captured by a camera on Haleakala moving southwest to northeast. No official explanation has been given for that UFO either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video on www.khon.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at a still image, taken from the video, and the object appears to us to be a typical contrail.

We took it for granted it was a satellite passing over head, but the star or satellite stopped moving after crossing the sky slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object in the stationary position for three minutes before returning back to our work areas. The object never flickered, it was a constant light the size of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a deep back yard with lots of trees.  As I was standing at the foot of my deck, I saw what I first thought was a very large, oversized plane with every light that they had on it and in it turned on.  I saw it come over the tree tops at the very back of the lot and it slowly kept coming, passed to the side of my house and then I did not see it.....they were not a streak of light, no color, it just looked like a pallet full of light, though not square...not oblong not round but a combination of these shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still believing it was a plane, I tried to see the red/green/blinking lights on a wing but I DID NOT see a wing and I saw no color.  The ligts were more individual than a blur....<n> <n><n> <n><n> While dressing for work around 6:30 am I saw on CNN news about sitings from the evening before, around 8:00 PM.  They were talking about &#34;blue, yellow white, lights&#34; flashes, etc.  What I saw was very large and ver lit up.  It moved slowly, not as fast as an airplane...I did not see anything hanging down nor did it make erratic movements....it was just there.  I said, out loud, &#34;Gosh, that looks like a floating city in the sky&#34; not because of buildings or shape but because it was large and lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the same report I just sent...I misspelled NASH County<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was about the size of a silver dollar held at arm&#39;s length away.  Could not tell how far away it was.  The color looked orange like the sun when it rising or setting on the horizon but was not as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my husband and he obsereved the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object after just being still for some time then shot straight up and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not leave any visible trail and we did not see it again.  Also the sky was clear and the stars were very bright as they always are in this rural area.<n>

Then white flash explosion<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:30pm Thursday night, I went outside to take out the trash and walk my dog (live in an apartment complex with a wooded area next to it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually I look up at the night sky when im on my nightly dog walking trip, just in case something happens to fly by.  Usually I might catch a shooting star, or an airplane but nothing out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this night, it seems I looked up at exactly the right time.  When I looked up, a falling spherical object caught my eye.  It was a whitish-blue and looked to have yellowish sparks as a kind of &#34;tail.&#34;  It just kinda appeared mid-air (well out of &#34;thin air&#34; I guess you could say), not very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to follow it to see if it would make contact with the ground, but when it fell behind the treeline of the wooded area next to my apartments (beyond my line of vision, hindered by the trees) there was just a bright white flash, as if it had exploded.  There was no sound or anything though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what it was...could have been some kind of falling space junk or just a small meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunatly I didnt have my digital camera at the time, or else I could have taken a picture.<n>

At 10:55pm on 1/25/07 I went to take my dogs outside before bed and noticed a bright light (not flashing) and relatively close to the ground staying in one location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a plane, but that quickly faded the more I looked at it.  It was not moving, just sitting still in the air.  I could see traces of light or smoke (looked kind of like what sparklers do when you light them and swing them around) and it was a bluish color.  I watched the object for the entire period.  It all of a sudden went slowly higher and the light became a small dot in the sky, and then proceeded to fly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that it was indeed not a plane because I have a hot tub outside and have seen many planes fly over at night, and this was totally different.  There were no flashing lights on this object at all and a plane can&#39;t sit still in the air and then go higher at the same location, and then take off (atleast not to my knowledge).<n>

She saw a moving red light that moved east to west across the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 30 degrees up from the ground, the red colored-light appeared to zig-zag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an unusual amount of helicopter and large aircraft traffic in the area at that time.<n>

The visual size near the tree line was about half an inch, and as it rose, it became smaller until it looked like a star and disappeared.  The oval was bisected by a line that &#34;looked like a tutu,&#34; extending out from the sides of the oval, perhaps going all the way around the object.  The line was composed of alternating red and green lights which did not blink.  No sound was heard.  The lower portion of the oval appeared to have a darker triangular shape in its center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed for almost 5 minutes as it gradually rose into the sky and disappeared.  This object was definitely not a plane, and moved more like a helicopter since it moved straight up…but without rotor blades and was silent.  An aircraft was seen and heard flying in the sky behind the observer moving in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed by 18 year old female from driveway after returning from dance instruction.<n>

It is a very clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to see what they were.   One was obviously a plane with a blinking light on it.  The other one however was a what seemed to be a sort of cone shaped thing with one white light on the bottom and a strip of lights on the top part of it that would change colors from red, blue, green, and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane flew near it and then the object changed direction and flew over me (west to east) until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane then flew in the opposite direction and then away from me (north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange object seemed to be much bigger than the plane.<n>

I saw a bright, orange light in the sky that looked just a bit smaller than the lights on a plane usually look as it travels through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the light disappeared.  I thought perhaps it was a radio tower with a flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later (probably between 10-15 seconds) the light reappeared to the left of where it originally was.  The light continued to do this five or six more times, moving left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw it was directly outside of my driver’s side window, and it seemed that it was as far off in the distance as originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing that struck me that was odd was that the light would disappear and reappear, but once it had reappeared it was almost as if I could still see a light or trace of where it had originally been, and then it would fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never actually saw any trails or saw the light moving, it would just disappear completely and then reappear.<n>

I was in my car traveling South on Wendy Dr. at the intersection with Ruth st. I saw it through my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was descending rapidly into the hills south of Newbury Park, or possibly into the Portrero Regional Park area. It seemed to be very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if you heard anything about sightings in that area around that time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Ventura County Sherriff about 20:00, and they confirmed my sighting by telling me that they had another call reporting a possible plane crashing in the hills and were sending a helicopter to investigate. I called the next morning and the deputy I spoke to told me that he was on duty the night before and that there was no helicopter dispatched. I repeated the name of the deputy I had spoken to the night before (Gloria). He put me on hold, and after a minute or so came back and confirmed that a helicopter had been dispatched, and that nothing was found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife told me she was listening to the Coast To Coast radio program Jan. 30th, and that you said you had spoken to Sydney Sheldon  last week before he passed away about a sighting in Malibu. We called Malibu Sherriff and they told us of a report of green lights in the sky between 19:00 and 20:00 that same night...Malibu is just south of this area.<n>

About 6 - 8 minutes later saw four orange balls higher in the sky, all appeared separately and further apart and faded away seaparatley (within 1 - 2 seconds of each other).  These were approx. 40 degrees up from my point of reference.  Total lapse of time 6 - 8 seconds.  None appeared to be moving...very stationary.  About 5 minutes later saw one orange ball very high (approx. 75 degrees up and now more NW of Frankfort) in the sky, same fade in/fade out over 5 seconds.  No sound.  5 minutes later saw two pair of jet aircraft (could hear them) flying in pairs criss cross the area of sky where I saw the orange balls. Jet aircraft had one white strobe light each.  Then one prop aircraft flew low through the area with multiple lights.  Returned to my car and drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded exceptionally sober-minded and credible to us.

The night was dark &amp; clear, lots of stars/ crescent moon.  I was on Rt 684 moving to the point where 684 ends &amp; becomes RT 22.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not positive at what point I first noticed the light, but I saw an extremely bright, low light in the sky. At first my mind processed it as a star, but it was huge, low (seemed just above the treetops) &amp; too bright for a star.  The light hovered; there was a smaller less bright light above &amp; to the right of it.  I realized these were not stars and kept looking. I slowed down. There were other vehicles on the road, but only a few, I was surprised they did not slow down to look.   The incident was fleeting.  Basically, there was this huge bright light (and a lesser ,but too large for a star light above it) , it seemed like hole was punched in the sky.  Within it (both) there appeared a string of blue lights like the outline of a circular shape, but only the blue lights were visible.  These lights did not move at first, the entire scene hovered.  Then, suddenly, quickly, the blue lights in the large light spun diagonally and dropped vertically, then &#34;sucked&#34; into the light and the entire image closed. The smaller light with blue lights within did the same within a second.  There was no sound I was aware of.<n>

TOM SHEETS, FOR SHARING THIS CASE WITH NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFONGA Investigation-Glowing Orb Flies Low Pass Over School Bus<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following described event and investigation resulted from a Georgia citizen&#39;s report filed via MUFON&#39;s CMS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 05Feb07, MUFONGA received the CMS report from MUFON Hqs. and launched an inquiry.  The event occurred on 25Jan07 at about 6:45AM, and involved a witness living in Forsyth County Georgia (about 40 miles NNE of Atlanta).  This writer contacted the witness and found her to be a 45YOA mother and homemaker who wished for her identity to remain confidential for the time being.  For the purpose of this report, she will be referred to only as &#34;Monserrat&#34;, as is her preference in this matter.  Witness was found to be well educated, articulate, seemed forthright, and had traveled and lived internationally during earlier periods in her life.  The witness&#39; neighborhood is upscale suburban, the area also containing small pastures, horses, a few cattle, and MANY children.  She has resided therein for about 3+ years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial conversation with Monserrat, this writer assigned Jim Clifford, a HIGHLY experienced MUFONGA investigator, to visit the event site and conduct a &#34;sit-down&#34; with the witness. Jim interviewed the witness at her home on 9Feb07.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event---- On 25Jan07, Monserrat was going about her early morning routine, getting her children ready for school and so forth.  At about 6:45AM, she walked them out to the bus stop which is only about 20 feet from her driveway.  Some other parents had driven to the bus stop and were sitting in their vehicles up and down the block.   She put her children safely aboard and turned to go back to the house.  At this time, the witness noticed what she initially THOUGHT was a &#34;tossed&#34; ball fly over the bus.  She reacted as most people do when something is tossed, a quick awareness and focus on what has been tossed.  She observed a SOFTBALL SIZED ORB, GLOWING MUCH LIKE AN EMBER FROM A FIRE, SILENTLY FLY OVER THE BUS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE THE VEHICLE&#39;S ROOF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She stated that this ORB was gliding along at about 3/4&#39;s LESS VELOCITY than a regular tossed ball. It continued on toward a neighbor&#39;s home across the street, flew OVER the roof and on toward a wooded treeline behind.  During the progress of this slow flight, the ORB grew smaller and smaller, from SOFTBALL SIZE, to about TENNIS BALL SIZE until it VANISHED.  The witness was very surprised, and unfortunately, the other parents did not make the same observation due to sitting in their vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After returning to the house, the witness tried to go on with her normal morning chores, but found herself uncharacteristically fatigued.  She fell into bed and slept soundly for about 4  hours (this extended morning nap being TOTALLY out of character).  She was awakened by the sound of LOW FLYING HELICOPTERS, so low that she indicated the window panes were rattling.  Adding that this had NEVER happened before during their years in the neighborhood, saying there were no military or similar aviation facilities nearby.  Later that evening, at about 8:00PM, she was preparing for her children&#39;s next school day and happened to see a strange light outside and heard what sounded like a tractor in the rear......where no light and no tractor should be.  During this period she heard distant helicopter sounds, and then the low, window rattling fly-over again.  After contemplating all that had occurred, she felt that what she had observed was a living, organic, intelligent entity of some sort, and perhaps the government had also picked up on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During his visit to the scene, FI Clifford routinely checked the area and orb&#39;s flight path with an EM Field Tester and compass......no unusual readings were noted.   He found nothing else that could be related to the event.  Jim is a retired 20+ years veteran of the U.S. Navy and a communications specialist.  He later checked the various military authorities that might dispatch helo flights into the Forsyth area......no source for the helos was found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness recounted her original statement at least three times during this investigation, once to this writer, once to Jim Clifford, and once to the MUFONGA metro staff at a meeting.......consistent throughout, credibility throughout.  Jim Clifford classified this event  as an &#34;Unknown&#34; in MUFON&#39;s CMS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any other Forsyth County citizen(s) has observed anything similar on or about 25Jan07, or at any other time, please do the following;  1) Fill out the NUFORC report form as described on this site;  2) Next go to www.mufon.com and file a report on the CMS;  3) Last, contact me here at www.mufonofga1@yahoo.com.

I could not tell the distance to the light, but we were able to watch it for quite some time (over 20 minutes) as it traveled slowly in a south west direction.  We were able to observe it until we lost it behind a tree and a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.  It moved faster than other celestial objects in the sky (sky was clear - stars plainly visible).  The colors were not similar to colors found on plane markers.  It was extremely bright.  It also did not move west as planets and/or stars would - it was moving south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place from the back patio, 1st floor, of a common condo complex.  Our view is to the west, overlooking a pool area with other units on the opposite side.  There are trees and other landscaping here as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, there were no other planes visible in the sky - which is hardly ever the case.<n>

1/24/07 20:36|Bellevue|WA|Other|5 minutes|Bright Lights Over Bellevue, WA|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54930.html|83|ndxe200701| Bright Lights Over Bellevue, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight at approx 8:35 pm while driving West bound on I-90 from Issaquah, WA, to Bellevue, WA, (Factoria area) my son in the passenger seat noticed 2 bright golden lights in a northeasterly direction (over the West Lake Sammamish area, almost over Embassy Suite Hotel and Verizon buildings which are visible from the I-90 freeway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unable to look at the lights for a prolonged period of time while driving and so as not to alarm my son I initially thought the lights must be that of approaching planes landing gear.  As I continued to glance from the road to the sky to my right, I realized the lights were not moving, were very bright, and appeared to be over one another like a bright landing tower pole, only they were in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright golden yellow in the center throughout and tipped on opposite ends in red, and were stationary non flashing lights.  The brightness of the light around the objects appeared to blur at the edges.  These lights appeared to resemble a long thin backwards K.  The lights appeared large in size, each K leg spanning approximately 30 to 50 feet and the lights appeared very low to the ground (less than ½ to one mile up in the sky.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I reached the Eastgate exit, the top light object began to lift up slightly, then appeared to tip completely sideways and disappeared in a northeast direction very quickly.  The object disappeared from view within 3 seconds.  The 2nd light object remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made my way towards Factoria; I pulled off into the Korean restaurant parking lot and faced the car northeast to better observe the remaining light.  By this time I had exhausted all logical possibilities, such as weather balloons, Boeing testing aircraft, or satellites, and had to admit to my son that I didn’t know what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sons view was obstructed by the parking lot trees and so I decided to venture further toward Factoria as the road parallels the freeway all the way there.  As I reached the summit of 36th Street (near the Bellevue Community college over ramp) I pulled over and dialed 911 and gave the description of my observation to the dispatcher and they referred me to the National UFO Hotline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then dialed the hotline, (bear in mind the light object remained stationary during this entire time.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I began to relay my story to the hotline, the light object hovered straight up slowly, paused for a moment, then moved upward and left (imagine the pattern of left side of a Y in a broken movement).  The object then moved slowly in a western direction (parallel with us across the freeway) as I descended down into the Factoria area, where I then lost sight of it with the freeway above my head.<n>
1/24/07 20:00|Greenville|SC|Light|5-10 seconds|A Bright COlor Changing Light over Southern NC and Upstate SC is seen and reported by Thousands.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54939.html|84|ndxe200701| A Bright COlor Changing Light over Southern NC and Upstate SC is seen and reported by Thousands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early evening of 01/24/07, around 20:00 hours (8:00 pm Eastern Standard time), thousands of local residents began calling into local news stations and the local police call center to report a bright, color-changing object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As reports continued to be filed, the magnitude of this occurrence began to be more fully understood.  People within a several hundred mile radius (myself included) witnessed a high velocity blue light, moving across the sky in a southern direction, leaving a trail behind it.  This &#34;light&#34; changed in color from blue, to White, to green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point, the light (at this point was green in color) seemed to take a sharp dive toward the ground and was lost behind the tree line.  Shortly before it reached the tree line, a smokey or hazy effect surounding the light became visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was partly cloudy that evening, and the light seemed to pass between myself and the clouds upon its descent.  [Note:  This haze may have been the light passing through a low cloud, giving it a smokey look...it happened very fast, and the refraction of light in cloud vapor may very well be the source of the haze.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> The national weather service has begun investigating, but so far has not yielded any results.  There are various reports of Government entities in the area including FBI and NSA, but no comments or official statements have been released thus far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Greenville/Spartanburg Airport has not released any information as to a possible radar tagging of this object, and anyone official that could possibly verify the presence of something in the South Carolina skies that night has remained annoyingly mum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those of us that witnessed the event all agree that this object was far to bright and concentrated to be weather related, and the nature of its movements, and the brilliance of the light that was emitted, lead all of us to believe that it was not an airplane, or known  aerial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The presence of these government agencies in our relatively small southern town has raised a few eyebrows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this a UFO?  I have no clue, but I have never seen anything like it, and I am anxiously awaiting an official answer/report on the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you’d like to view our local Fox News Affiliate’s story, you can do so at this link.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.whns.com/global/story.asp?s=5987366<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, -Slinky (watchdog)<n>

I turned my head and saw a green &#34;ball of light&#34; for a split second, then it moved away rapidly.  It proceeded to move NE out of view.  The whole &#34;event&#34; was no more than 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were reports of this sighting on an Asheville, NC, newschannel (ABC 13) this morning (1/26/07) - Asheville is an hour away, (ENE) so there are others who may have viewed the object along this direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sightline of this object was between a two trees.  It was not close as there was no glow on &#34;local&#34; vegetation.  I would guess the object&#39;s size to be that of a tennis ball, based loosely in comparison to the trees.  I do not know how close or how far away the object was from me, so my size estimate is only in reference to the trees and therefore not absolute!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object HAD to be in a state of no motion when I first viewed it, for as it moved away (rapidly), the &#34;shape&#34; was indiscernable.   As the object moved away, it had properties of a &#34;comet&#34; - longer with a green tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an incredible experience and I&#39;d like others to &#34;share&#34; their story as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

And blue. Or green. Or blue-green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Bright blue-green ball with a white tail,&#34; says one man from Shelby, who spotted it just west of Blacksburg, S.C., after dinner at a Steak House.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;A greenish-like light low in the sky,&#34; says a woman, driving home from church with her kids near Matthews. &#34;We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash.&#34;  &#34;A slow-moving bluish glow,&#34; says a man from Polkton and who watched it while soaking in his hot tub.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Large, bright green ball,&#34; says another man, who was headed to Chick-fil-A in Gastonia with his wife and four children after church. &#34;Had a haze about it.&#34;  &#34;Almost looked like a flare,&#34; reports a lady, who was on Interstate 485. &#34;Kind of creepy.&#34;  Venus, perhaps? It&#39;s often a suspect in UFO sightings, particularly when it&#39;s as bright as it is right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not Venus. It vanished beneath the horizon about 7 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stricken plane?  Nope. All aircraft accounted for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Space junk? Errant satellite?  Negative, says NORAD. No re-entries of the sizable man-made objects they track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK. So ... alien object?  Bingo. But not the E.T. variety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;A fireball,&#34; says the observatory director and astronomy professor at Appalachian State University in Boone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the reports, the director believes it was an unusually bright meteor that burned up about 30 miles high in the atmosphere somewhere above Charlotte. Sightings came from more than 100 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many witnesses say the light appeared to fizzle at the end and break into pieces, making it a special kind of fireball called a bolide. In the universe of meteors, they&#39;re A-List entertainers, known for their splashy finales.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each day, an estimated 4 billion meteors burn up in Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Most are the size of sand grains, but rocks tumble in, too. NASA estimates that the Earth packs on several tons a day in meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some witnesses who contacted the Observer on Thursday wondered whether it could be debris from the recent anti-satellite test by China.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably not - but maybe, says a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks satellites and space junk - everything from lost screwdrivers to astronaut gloves. He says he&#39;s been getting an unusually high number of calls this week about things spotted in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> China&#39;s satellite-zapping exercise has probably increased space litter by about a million pieces, making it nearly as untidy as Interstate 77 in Charlotte.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess,&#34; the spokesman says, &#34;what direction this stuff has gone.&#34;<n>

It circled our car about four times.  The only 3 lights on the craft were in a triangular shape always the same distance from each other.  The lights were yellow and did not blink at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:50 p.m.  I was still watching the lights.  We were 3 miles outside of Leupp.  The lights were still doing its circular turns in a counterclockwise direction while we were headed east.

I noticed that the outline of it was distinguishable to a disk with 4 lights, equal distance from each other on the circumference of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the lights went out as it flew over the community and one light came on in the middle.  I saw the craft was about twice the size of the school gym at the school.   As it passed over the community it turned on its side and kept going toward the East in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:04 p.m. I got home.   It was still headed east and starting to make the circles again with the one light in the middle.  I saw 2 jets intercept and follow it east out of sight.  The lights made no sound even when low to the ground but you could clearly hear the sound of the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:08 p.m. the lights looped around and went back over the community.  I noticed that the craft had 5 lights on it, 4 around it and the last light in the dead center of it.  The craft then headed east and out of sight at 8:35 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time a larger jet showed up and my dad said that it looked like they were doing aerial refueling as small jets would come close behind it and then leave toward the East where the lights had disappeared.  Two more small jets appeared and refueled and headed to the South.  It was unusual to see jets refueling at night in this area.<n>

After around 5 mintues it looked to be eliptical.  It looked so close, we saw planes fly below it and above it but the object was 50 times the size of the other lights from the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother-in-law came out and I showed her with the binnoculars and she was puzzled at what this could of been.  It moved from about 10 feet above the treeline towards the right and down extremely slowly, and moved below the treeline and away within about 15 minutes of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the summer of &#39;06 I have seen the object several times, calling the police department, and also a local news station with no results.  There have been several witnesses in my neighborhood also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When contacting the police, 2 minutes after a quickly blinking light streaked across the sky underneath it and the object darted away as if a warning shot had been fired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is always seen to the Western sky, from my house in the Northeast portion of my town.<n>

No noise was detected and there were no lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking the dog about 5:30 PM Wed..,  Jan 24th, 2007.  The weather was very clear and breezy with some clouds.  The sun was beginning to go down in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an object way off in the distance approaching from the north west.  It was quite high in the sky and moving slower than a jet plane moves. There were no clouds obscuring my view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched to see if I could see any lights but there were no bright lights or blinking lights. I could see no wings.  It was difficult to determine the shape but looked slightly triangular at one point.  I thought I could determine some shifting of the shape but I couldn&#39;t really tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It curved around to the west towards the setting sun.  It never varied in altitude, neither going up or down and the speed always remained the same.  I wondered if possibly it was a weather balloon but I have seen those before and usually the balloons relect white and this was dark brown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered about a large bird but it looked too big a bird and it wasn&#39;t a flock of birds but a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for about ten to twelve minutes and then had to go inside because of the cold air.  It was still in sight when I went in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not have my camera and was the only person outside at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point it was high enough in the sky to be way above the two story buildings and trees.  The size from where I was was about one eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have alot of air traffic in the area because of DFW airport, Lockheed, and  what used to be Carswell AFB.  It looked as if it was high over the base at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with all types of aircrafts and balloons and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know if this was a weather balloon or if any other reports have come in.<n>

They made no sound.   The first UFO looked to be the size of my thumb nail held out at arms distance and extremely bright white sphere of light followed by 7 elongated triangles.  The triangles were the size of my thumb held at arm&#39;s distance and showed depth as the edge of the craft as it was illuminated.  Under the spear shaped triangles were 6 amber colored lights.3 to each side of the triangle.  The first bright shimmering light went over, and then the first triangle.then the second. the third went over and made a sharp maneuver to the right, to the left then backs to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth triangle went over, then the fifth, the sixth and when the seventh one went over I said to the witness with me that this was not a flock of birds and at that instant the triangle turned ino a flock of birds in front of our eyes.  The total time of the incident was approximately one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My witness has worked 23 years at a major medical facility in the security department and is a trained observer.  I am the daughter of two law enforcement officers. I do not seek out attention for any reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We met with both witnesses, at the location from which they experienced the sighting, and we believe that both are highly credible.  It was a very dramatic sighting.  PD))<n>

The first that went over was a large (about the size of my thumb nail) and extremely bright spherical light, then 7 elongated triangular flying objects flew over.  The triangles were as long as my thumb (held at arms distance).  The edges were illuminated and showed depth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 6 amber colored lights under each one of the triangles.  There was no sound.  This occurred during the fireworks display for the opening ceremonies of the United States Figure Skating Championship.  The fireworks had just started, perhaps about a minute into the display when up above the arrow head shaped craft flew over following the sphere of extremely bright light.  The first triangle went over, then the second, then the third turned sharply to the left then the right, the fourth one went over, then the fifth, the sixth and when the seventh one went over itchanged shape.  The moment I said to the witness with me that these were not a flock of birds.they transformed to a flock of birds in front of our eyes. Soon after the event, perhaps a minute or two, an unexpected heavy fog set in over the city and above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness with me is a trained observer who has worked for a major medical facility for over 23 years in security.

A cylindrical object, which appeared white, but seemed translucent was seen with no clouds in the sky at all.  The object moved fast initially then slowed down for a little over 3 minutes.  The object then rapidly gained velocity and streaked across half the sky in about 20 to 30 seconds.  The object didn’t just drop in altitude since the size decreased as it was moving across the sky.  The object was extremely bright in the noon day sun.  Not the entire cylinder just a line that went down the entire body length.  Basically the closest part to my eye.  The object was brightest when it was highest in the sky.  When it made its closest approach to the sun overhead it was difficult to look at, I needed to squint.  As the object traveled away from the sun the object became less brilliantly lit up, in fact dramatically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to pass over a 737 as it was travelling the 737 visually appeared about 10 millimeters long for reference.  I have no idea how close it passed by.  I couldn’t make out if the object had any wings.  The cylinder appeared to be about 1 unit in diameter and 15 units long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to know if anyone else noticed this object, as well if anyone could identify the object as a known aircraft.  Does this object relate to any anomalous weather behavior.  If someone knows something please post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

See addendum below.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photographed triangular object moving slowly 30&#39;-50&#39; over Tacoma narrows heading north: 2min duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a photographer.  I was on the walkway along the beach at Titlow Beach Park in Tacoma, Washington between 8:30 and noon 24 January 2007.  I was there for the purpose of photographing trains on the BNSF tracks that run along the shoreline.  While waiting for trains I photographed cormorants perched on pilings just offshore using a Nikon D80, Nikkor 70-200mm lens with a Nikkor TC2EII teleconverter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a varying layer of fog over the area during this time period with the sun occasionally shining through.  While looking for a good shot of the cormorants I saw two bright reflections coming through the fog (looking west across the water).  At first I thought them to be reflections from windows on a house across the narrows on Point Fosdick.  But as I watched the reflections were moving slowly northward.  I estimate they were moving about 5 mph. I zoomed my lens to 400mm and looked at the reflections through the camera-lens.  Through the lens I saw that the reflections were coming from two rectangular surfaces on a triangular shaped object.  The object appeared to be roughly 30’-50’ above the surface of the water.  I watched it for about two minutes.  It was difficult to judge the distance above the water due to the fog obscuring the far shoreline.  I estimated the object to be a half mile away.  I wondered if I was just seeing the top of a barge or tug but I could see nothing below the triangle which I could see fairly well.  I shot two photographs of the object.  In subsequent review of the images I can discern nothing below the triangular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound that I could attribute to the object although I could hear traffic noise from the Narrows Bridge a mile to the north.  After taking the two photos I looked around to see if there was anyone nearby to ask if they had seen the object.  There was nobody nearby and when I looked back the object was gone.  I continued to look out across the water for the next five minutes or so and did not see the object again.  I specifically looked farther to the north to see if this was a barge or tug and did not see anything even though the fog was thinner in that direction and I could clearly see the Dockwise, the bridge deck carrier ship anchored under the bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are the two original images I photographed 24 Jan 2007 of a triangular object moving slowly northward over (estimate 30’-50’) the Tacoma narrows.  Photos taken westward from the shoreline along Titlow Beach Park, Tacoma Wa toward Point Fosdick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m really hoping someone can identify this object so that it will no linger be ‘unidentified’ to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really thought I’d seen and photographed a UFO yesterday 24 Jan 2007.  I emailed the two original images to this email address yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent several hours yesterday enhancing the images using photoshop and consulted with some photographer friends of mine.  We came to the conclusion that I had become disoriented in the fog and my perception of where the far shoreline was in my photos was incorrect.  We have also come to the conclusion that what I photographed was in fact something floating IN the Tacoma narrows rather than something moving ABOVE the narrows.  Our best guess is that it is a partially sunk dock that has broken away from its original mooring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back out to the location this morning and using the same camera, lens and focal length re-shot the scene from the exact same vantage point using the same two pilings as reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve enclosed a photoshopped image of my now tentatively identified ufo with a line marking where the far shoreline really was (upper line) and another line (lower) to indicate where I had thought the far shoreline was in the fog.  I superimposed today’s image over yesterday’s to locate the lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m very sorry to have taken your time and even sorrier that I filed a report when in fact what I saw was not a UFO.  Please know that I did not do this as a hoax; at the time I really thought that what I saw was slowly floating 30’-50’ feet above the water.  Also, until I had the chance to enhance the image using photoshop (unfortunately after I’d made my call and report) I could not make out the details of the object I’d seen with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I’m sorry to have taken your time.  Can you please remove the report I made from your database?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks in advance,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM #2))<n>

Having commuted at night for nearly two decades, she is familiar with the air base&#39;s lit-up landing strip of lights (which flash during inclement weather) off the left side of the roadway.  She noticed that the lights were off that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she was about a mile south of the air base, she noticed a large, triangular craft over a field off the right side of the highway.  (There are several miles of fields and marshes just past the air base off both sides of the highway.)  There were white lights on both sides of the object, yet no airplane beacon below it.  (She has worked with airplanes.)  It was silent.  She couldn&#39;t tell what altitude it was at, thus making it impossible to judge the size, whether it was 200 feet, 500 feet or 1,000 feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She kept watching it for several miles as she continued driving and wondered why it was making such a slow decent and why it wasn&#39;t landing faster.  She eventually came to the perplexing conclusion that it was hovering, despite the fact that it obviously wasn&#39;t a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She has never seen a UFO and believes it was possibly an experimental military aircraft.<n>

My wife is a lab tech at a pathology lab, and I work in library management.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of January 23, 2007 at approximately 8:55 p.m., we were standing on the back deck of the duplex we live in,  which is on the 2nd floor.  From there we have a fairly unobstructed view of the sky.  We also have a good view of airplanes coming in from the North and heading South for landing approaches at SeaTac airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were talking and watching planes, when I leaned my head back to stretch my neck and saw two red balls of light flying parallel to each other heading from East to West.  They were at an altitude higher than the incoming planes, but lower than high flying jets.  There were both blood red in color with a slight diffusion of light around their centers.  No structure to either was visible.  They appeared identical, and the size of the lights was approximately twice that of the landing lights on low flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they traveled side by side from East to West  their paths were converging, but they did not meet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, when they were approximately over downtown Seattle the two lights vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said that she saw them briefly begin to climb and then they were gone from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted a little over three seconds and we couldn’t hear any noise that seemed associated with the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be unusually objective and eloquent in his description of the event.

1/23/07 19:40|Franklin|VA|Triangle|5 minutes|Three big orange lights in triangle formation|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54925.html|108|ndxe200701| Three big orange lights in triangle formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, January 23, 2007, at approximately 7:40p.m. I was driving SE with my four year old son on my way home from a friends house when I spotted what I thought at first was a planet--possibly Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was to my left in the eastern sky, and looked to be a few miles away from me--(after some researching today I found out that this object was most probably 2-3 miles away from my location when I first spotted it.) This object was VERY bright, and a light orange color. Even thought I thought it looked awful large for a planet, I still assumed it must be since it was not twinkling like stars do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the light out to my son, and proceeded to bore him with trivia like how to tell if a star is a star or if its a planet. The object was in my view the entire time I was driving-(except short periods when trees obscured it.) A little over 2 miles up the road I had to make a left turn to head due east. I had started thinking there was something weird looking about the light so once I turned, and saw no other cars were coming, I stopped in the road to have a safer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was when I noticed the light was not a single light, but THREE lights. I thought to myself that it was weird for an airplane to have three large lights underneath it like that because for it to have been an airplane the two front lights would have had to have been on the end of each wing, and the third rear one on the tail, but all would have had to have been UNDERNEATH the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights all looked to be the same distance apart and were very big looking lights, all large, all the same light orange color, no pulsing, or color changing, and they were set in a triangle pattern--(note I stated the shape of the craft was triangular, but I am unsure of the actual shape of the craft itself--only what formation the three lights were in.)  They didn&#39;t appear to be landing lights, especially since the plane was not coming from, or going towards the direction of the closest airport, so I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t landing or taking off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was closer to me by the time I stopped to look and was heading towards me in a diagonal path. I made no unusual note of speed, or movement--(it appeared to move slowly, but I wouldn&#39;t say notably slow, nor did I see any unusual movements that defy conventional aircraft performance.) I heard no sounds as if an airplane was passing overhead, but I never actually cut my van off, so I suppose it&#39;s possible there were some sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared to be flying pretty low, yet was too high for me to make out any of the aircraft itself--I could only see the three lights.  It&#39;s possible this may have been a normal, everyday aircraft, but I have to say that I&#39;ve been driving for many years, and have been out lots of times at night, and I have seen many, MANY, airplanes, helicopters, and such in the night sky at varying distances. I&#39;ve seen all kinds of colored lights on planes at night time,at different altitudes, sometimes steady, sometimes blinking and blipping around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More than a few of them have given me pause, but I always realize very quickly that it is in fact just an airplane, or some other form of &#39;normal&#39; aircraft. You just--KNOW when what you are seeing is normal, and when it is not, and this didn&#39;t look normal to me. I can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever seen three big orange colored lights in that formation on the very bottom of an airplane like that before. Ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought I should mention that I submitted a report to the NUFORC a while back....I think it was a year or two ago and it concerned a possible UFO sighting I had when I was younger back in the early 80&#39;s in nearby Suffolk, Va. (I believe that was the last time I have seen anything &#39;unidentified&#39; in the skies until last night, btw...lol)  The one I saw in the 80&#39;s was a single big, bright light, but was orange like the lights I saw last night. Might be nothing, but thought worth bringing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made and am sending you two drawings I made via a computer paint program. The first drawing represents pretty much the exact way I saw the object in the sky--the direction it was heading, as well as the size in relation to how it looked to me up in the sky from my van. The second represents how large the &#39;orange planet&#39; appeared to me when I first spotted it by comparing it to the &#39;north star&#39;.<n>

Well, I looked-up, and saw an object movie across the day-sky.   I thought, &#34;It looks odd.&#34;  I could only see three silver dots, in the shape of the sky as they moved at the speed of normal aircraft across the sky...maybe we make triangle shaped ships.   I could not see any body structure, just three dots.

This Saturday, at around 12:00 PM, I looked up and saw three silver dots, smaller than the tips of my fingers moving in the shape of a triangle...less than a tenth the  size of the tips of my finger, that&#39;s how high-up it seemed...they moved across the sky at a normal rate of speed for a craft as high-up as this one.   I thought maybe the wind, which was kicking-up, had carried something skyward, so I watched until it went out of vision&#39;s range, but it wasn&#39;t an object kicked about by the wind...too regular...watched about a minute until it went out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.   Can&#39;t say it glowed...may have reflected...maybe holographic...maybe we have something new up in the sky these days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was how the sun hit, but it seems like the sun would have changed as it glistened across a metallic cover...not a light, but more of a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whitish-silver.  Or, maybe, it was three very distant normal craft moving in perfect formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just don&#39;t know...they were close, though...if they measure less one tenth the tip of my finger, then the three together measured half, or less, than the tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Saturday was January 23, 2007.

I was on my third floor balcony having a smoke at about 10:30pm on the evening of 1/22/07.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a star because it just appeared to be a weak white light in the sky.  Then I realized it was moving slowly in a straight horizontal line, and so I assumed it was a private aircraft. After I watched it for maybe 10 seconds, it suddenly dropped straight down in a vertical line about a thousand feet or so in just a few seconds, so I knew immediately it was not a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend to join me outside and take a look, because I didn&#39;t know if I could trust my own eyes with what I was seeing.  He witnessed the same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, the light began to shine brilliantly, pulsing between red, blue, green, purple and white while flying again in a perfect horizontal line - only now it had dropped below the tree line.  But because it was winter and many of the trees had lost their leaves, it was still fairly easy to track.  The light would extinguish sometimes and then reappear in seconds a mile or so away - and at different heights.  And after watching it for about 7 minutes, it finally disappeared.  It was a perfectly clear night sky, so I know it could not have been a spotlight reflecting off of a cloud.  Additionally the craft generated no sound, and no other aircraft were observed during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was hanging still, so it wasn&#39;t an airplane. 1 Min. later it started moving, so it wasn&#39;t a star. Because it left a smoke trail it couldn&#39;t have been a sattelite, I thought to myself. The smoke trail would never be visible to the naked eye if it was a sattelite.

I first saw a small flying saucer that looked very much like a toy.  The center circle moved rapidly, but the outer disk did not move.  It had a blue blinking light bulb on each side of the outer disk and I noticed that the direction of the object was well centered to the lights.  That is, that the lights were always on the side of this flying object as if they were the wings of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought it was a remote control toy but what really caught my attention is that this one flying saucer was followed by another one, and another one after that, etc.  There were about 5 or 6 of them flying together one after the other.  They were going slow, at about 25 miles per hour and bordering the backyards of the houses that were parallel to this avenue.  They were flying parallel to the avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I still thought they were kids playing from the backyards, but when I noticed these disks were not turning around, I realized it had to be something else.  They kept on going along the avenue. Two of them went up and moved slightly to the right and I was able to keep them in sight until they were two microscopic dots in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that someone else must have seen it because this happened in the middle of Miami during traffic hours.  The objects were small, about the size of a large round pizza which led me to believe immediately that it had to be a toy.  I can’t imagine that it could be used for traveling.  I have never heard of such small size aliens.  I imagine that they could be used to scan an area, etc.  All I know is that they were small; they traveled at a steady pace and about 25 miles per hour and very close to the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were gray in the center section which spinned and black on the outer disk with blue blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still find it difficult to imagine they were space crafts because they really looked like a toy.   However, I can’t explain how they were able to travel for such a long distance, especially the two crafts that went up in the sky until they became unnoticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still shocked and would love to understand what happened.<n>

1/21/07 19:30|Accrington (UK/England)||Other|10 minutes|Strange aircraft in sky over Lancashire,|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54910.html|123|ndxe200701| Strange aircraft in sky over Lancashire,<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place on Sunday 21st of January 2007 at around 7.30pm. I was driving from Clitheroe to Altham to return a van i borrowed from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked South towards Blackburn and noticed a low flying aircraft flying directly towards me, it looked quite bit (737 size) and had flashing lights quite similar to a standard passenger plane. As i planes quite often i just ignored it and assumed it was making a landing approach, it was only when it turned that i noticed the light pattern underneath, again it was similar to an plane but there were subtle differences, the rear 4 lights made up a large diamond shape and there was another light at the front but the gap between these was very large, again this does not sound that much different to a plane until you compared it to other planes in the sky, as they make a diamond shape of lights, one at the front, one at the rear on and one on each wing tip, but this did not explain the extra light at the front and the distance between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now i decided to keep a close eye on this mysterious plane. It circled the entire ribble valley about 5 time between 1000 and 2000 feet, far too low to be a commercial plane and why would it keep circling over populated area in an area that is not on route to any local airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried as hard as i could to get into a position where i could see the actual body of the aircraft not just the lights, but this proved to be quite difficult.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My suspicions were however confirmed when the strange aircraft was intercepted by a Royal air force Tornado jet. The jet assumed a position above and behind the craft and continued to follow it were ever it went, this carried on for about 3 minutes then they both went out of view.  I kept looking for about 10 minutes but so no sign of either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a coast guard helicopter but this object was round and floating still.  It was a blimp shape with a slight edge on each side forming kind of a saucer, but it was more blimp like in shape, definitely shiny metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that stood out the most was a red marking of some type, looked like a red door on the side of it or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going really fast on the bike at that moment and the tree line blocked my view of it, yelling for my friend to stop, I explained to him that I had just saw something odd, we headed to a side road to get a view of where I saw it, he thinking I&#39;ve lost my mind at that moment, and me too, it was gone, of course!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hoping someone has seen what I saw that day and reports something similar because it was floating about the same height as the top of the bridge, and was near the bridge on the east side.<n>

It was heading east slowly at about 600ft apprx. i watched this for about 3 mins as its flashes were so bright so fast. i changed direction instantly, now it was heading south west and it began to rise up,a couple of times it just stopped completely then moved to the south west again while rising higher. it cruised higher to about 1000 ft and seemed to get even brighter by this time i,d say i was watching it for about 10-12 mins. as the object passed over my block, now it was heading away from me about 2-4 miles just over 1000 ft high. still very bright heading more west  than east toward the port mann bridge new westminister ot surrey area.the last bit i could see was brighter blue flashes along with lesser colors...it was just small lights when i lost track of it...very cool...made me amazed and freaked out a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> wait,...theres more...i came in the house after this event about 15-20 mins long.no more than 6-8 mins i heard the buzz of a low fast helicopter...magnum p.i. type(bumblebee)...i went out on the deck and this chopper with a samll white light and a very bright green light buzzed over my area LOUGHEED HWY/207TH MAPLERIDGE,BC...he quickly buzzed the area making a quick circle and just full throttled it south/west in the path of the lights...he was really quick...defenitly looking for something.like i said the object came from the east maperidge area and turned south west then more westerly. if anyone knows what it was ...i would love to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> seems like someone knew about it before i saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks ((name deleted))<n>

It was a night with great visibility. I only had hunting binoculars to watch the stars.  Then I saw the object on the East. It looked just like the other stars, it was white, bright and round. In binoculars, I saw a shadow on it, it reminded a crescent moon, so I suppose it was some sort of sphere.   It was not blinking or making any sound and it was flying very fast. I thought, it was a satelite, but it flew little faster.  It was making strange zig-zag movements for circa 20 seconds.  Then it came back where I first saw it.  But I also noticed exactly the same object that stood still until the first one came to it and then they flew together and soon I lost them, they were flying North, but soon there was only one object remaining (I lost sight for couple of seconds, because they were flying above my roof, so I had run to other side of appartment).  It all happened too fast to take pictures or record. No witnesses. I li! ve in a vicinity of army airport in Sliac, so I think I can distinguish a flight of a air-fighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It hovered over the area for several minutes or moved slowly.  It was rather far away and I did not get a really up close view of it.  It seemed larger than a plane from a distance and did not look like any lights that I had seen on an aircraft before or move the way a plane does. It did not look like signal lights either.  Eventually it moved out of sight below the horizon.  It stayed close to the horizon, just above the tree line. The lights did not blink like ordinary plain lights either.<n>

Moved back east again and hovered again for a few minutes.  Object again moved due west and glowed bright red dipping downward and after shot straight up and disapeared. Several helicopters were in the area.  To the west a large craft with with off white lights was hovering and broke through the clouds.  Duration was about 3 minutes.  The lights went out and object was no longer visible.  A few minutes later 3 craft appeared in the same location with the same description as the first then it looked like the lights simply went out.<n>

It looked like one of those flashing red lights on top of a huge radio tower. I called for my daughter to come out to keep an eye on it while I grabbed the camera. She saw it as it drifted further away and our view became obstructed by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of it so we jumped in our car and headed North down Delany Rd. to Wadsworth Rd. and headed West. It was no where in sight. We continued on to U.S. Rt. 41 where we turned southeast. We spotted it again way down the highway, same thing, huge slowly flashing red light. We tried to follow it and get closer but it kept moving. It was covering a lot of ground in a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We last saw it heading towards Great Lakes Naval Base and it looked like it had gained altitude to avoid planes in the area. I&#39;m not sure but it looked like these planes might have been trying to investigate the light to see what it was. That was the last we saw it...heading over Great Lakes Naval Base/Lake Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we would have just stayed home we would have seen it come back our way heading in the opposite direction we had 1st saw it moving. :(  Slightly overcast, 13 degrees, could see some stars out. Never got a picture.<n>

I am a construction worker, and I was working in Tacoma Washington at the Simpson Pulp Mill at the mouth of the Puyallup River on the edge of Commencement Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working what is called a shutdown on the mill, this is when the Boiler is taken off line and is repaired, my boss was setting me up on a job to replace the hanger rods on the primary exhaust which feeds directly into the smokestack which is at a height of fifty to sixty feet. Scaffolding had been erected around the duct as to give us access to work. The sky at that time was partially cloudy with a 30% to 40% cloud cover. My lead man and I were climbing one of the ladders on the scaffolding when I noticed a round brilliant white object at a high altitude moving across the sky it looked somewhat like a weather balloon and I pointed it out to my lead when he reached the top of the ladder. My lead man asked me what I though it was, and I told him I wasn’t sure but it looked similar to a weather balloon, and it was moving slowly from west to the east, and we watched it for thirty seconds or so, my lead man then said common I want to show you something else which pertained to the job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stepped out of direct sight, but I kept looking back into the sky at the object. The object continued to slowly move to the east at almost a 12 o’clock position in the sky. I then noticed a second object which looked identical to the other it was positioned directly in the path of the first at the same high altitude, but it was stationary both objects appeared to be about a quarter the diameter of the sun or slightly less. The first object then stopped and held position close to the second both not moving, I then summoned my lead man and said check this out, there are two of them now. My lead man then asked what do you think they are, and said “I am not sure what they are! but they are UFO’s.” My lead man then stated that I must be smoking something if I think they’re UFO’s, to which I replied “it must be the same thing your smoking because you’re seeing them too,” but neither one of was smoking anything, and they were real. The boss said common I’ve got to show you something else and we moved out of visual contact and when I came back they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole encounter didn’t last five minutes, but I remember looking at my watch several times to confirm the time, it read 12:35 pm. One other thing that was kind of strange is that I kept thinking, to myself that they must be surveying our industrial progress, and I am not sure why I was thinking that, but they were directly over the heavy industrialized area of Commencement Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I first thought was an airplane or helicopter moving slowly north for about 15 to 20 seconds then began to change direction more to the north east.  I thought, it must be correcting for landing an Arcata/Eureka airport in McKinleyville.  It traveled on its new course for about 10 more seconds then seemed to change course again and head south.  As it moved away, the lights got dimmer and flickered like a cloud was crossing in front of the object, and then the lights went out completely.  1 or 2 seconds later, I saw a grey wedge-shaped object flying with its right edge downward, west towards the ocean.  It looked much larger than a plane, but was not making any noise and no longer had any lights on it.  I waited for a loud noise of a crash when I lost sight of it behind the tree line but didn’t hear anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caused me to report it was that it didn’t seem like it should be able to travel across the sky on edge.  (No lift…?)<n>

Then seconds later it looked as if a human was floating in the air with a long black coat.

It was apx 8:20 am and it was just beginning to turn daylight.  My daughter and I saw a single bright light in the sky ahead of us, slighly off to the left.  It looked slightly smaller than a dime from our view.  We watched this bright light, first it looked like it was hovering, but then it was slowly moving.  Real slow. The light was shimmering, not blinking, but like it would dim then grow brighter, dim again, etc. We watched for abt. 1 min and it just disappeared.  Like a light switch, it was on and then it was off and there was nothing there.   We saw it again about 2-3 minutes later, except by the second sighting it had moved it&#39;s position in the sky to where it was directly ahead of us.  We watched for about a minute, and again, like a light switch, it just vanished.  It was totally light out at this point now and there was not a cloud in the sky.  We found it a third time in the sky, and we could tell it was moving slowly again. We followed it with our eyes, and within a minute, the bright light went totally out again, but this time instead of being nothing there, as soon as the bight light went out, we saw some kind of object (resembled a rocket) with three blinking lights running parallel  underneath it ( two white, one red).  It had two small...wings, for lack of a better word, positioned midway on the object.  It looked black or a dark color.  The three lights were not the same bright light that we had originally saw when we first spotted it in the sky.  These were different lights, much smaller. This object just disapeared in the sky, just like it had the first two times we saw it.  No trail, tail, no haze, no nothing.  There one minute and gone the next.  It didn&#39;t fly off, it just disapeared into thin air.  This was unlike any plane I have ever seen.   I should also mention that this sighting was near the Fermi Nuclear Power plant in Monroe, Mi. The &#39;wings&#39; that I mention! ed were very small.  It was like this thing had some sort of cloaking device that made it invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was searching the Internet for maps to locate McNaught comet (C/2006 P1) in my place (Latitude: 7° 06&#39;, South. Longitude: 34° 53&#39;, West), Joao Pessoa, Brazil.  I was upset because I realized it wouldn&#39;t be easy to see the comet from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to bed thinking about the comet and stayed observing the nice spot of clear sky I have trough my large bedroom&#39;s window (6th floor) which is always kept open during the warm summer season. I have a nice view from here since there are no buildings around and we are only 100 m from the beach - in fact, from my window, I am facing the sea and &#34;Ponta do Seixas&#34; - the eastern most point of the Americas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds neither the moon and I was observing the sky and the constellations (The Southern Cross, The Great Dog, Orion...) when I suddenly spotted what, at a first sight, looked like a tiny cloud blown by the wind - I felt strange because it was moving quite fast.  When I observed it properly, I have noticed its triangular shape without a clear contour made up of some faint points of white light (I could not count how many points - may be six or seven...).  The delta shaped &#34;thing&#34; was traveling soundless from southeast to northwest in a peculiar way with its wider angle pointing sideway (even a delta shaped airplane would not fly with one of the wings heading!).  I then realized that could be a formation of orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to guess the altitude but it could be compared to a commercial plane flying at 3000 m or more. It soon went of my visual field (passing over my roof) - I run to another room, facing north, and in a second I could spot the triangular shape again. I observed it until it faded into the light sky of the city (away from the sea)  I doubt a person who was not intentionally watching the night sky would ever have noticed that &#34;thing&#34; - I had the impression it was traveling camouflaged...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add to this report that I have an engineering background and a considerable experience in observing the sky (I was an amateurs junior astronomer while at the university).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have made a lot of suppositions and calculations:  I have taken a time average of many repetitions of my movements again and I found time of observation=20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude (h): I had to guess - my first impression is (h &gt; 3000 m) = 3 km . Reason: I am used to observe things closer than 3 km by just looking out from my window, boats, people at the beach, cars, planes - at smaller distances I see more details even at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Length (L): since the thing&#39;s longer side comprised approximately a 2º angle (2 full moon size), which equals 0.255 rd and then, L = 3000 x 0.255 = 76.5 m<n> <n><n> <n><n> By estimating angles I could also calculate the speed (s) of the &#34;thing&#34;:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Supposing h = 3 km, then v = 954 km/h !<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Supposing h = 6 km, then v = 1908 km/h !!!  (In this case the length would be L = 6000 x 0.524 = 153 m !)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. I don&#39;t want to suppose any higher because that would mean faster and bigger!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, they looked like faint stars (+6 magnitude) (as I can see Pleyads M45 with the naked eye) - I was not able to count them but they were more than 5 and less then 8 points of light spread over the triangular area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time my street and the region around is always completely silent - just the sea at a distance, no restaurants are open and everyone else at home (2 more people) were asleep.  I would have heard the sound of a plane or anything like if closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear glass windows measuring 1.50 x 1.20 (half of them open), no wind blowing (it is terrible warm by this time of the year) - 6th floor without any other apartment building around (only houses). Good visibility!<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are only 4 commercial flights per day arriving at Joao Pessoa since the main airports in the region are in neighbor cities (Recife and Natal) and even though, the local airport is 30 km to the west away from here.  I don&#39;t think this direction (Southeast to Northwest) is a flight corridor - I see some planes from South to North (over the sea) and the ones arriving here, I see at a distance East to West.  I will observe more carefully from now on!  As I have estimated, the &#34;thing&#34; was really faster then a plane at cruise altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The additional impression I can tell is that at first I thought it was a tiny cloud... when I realized it was to fast and had points of light I was really frightened because I found strange, what appeared to me like a &#34;flying blade&#34;. I have even said to me - &#34;Oh my God, what is that?  I just calmed down when I thought it could be transparent, or, less frightening, a formation of smaller points of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made a simple drawn of what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue shade is just an ilustration as it was in the same colour as the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

You could see this light pass through the clouds, that’s how powerful that light was. It was low in the horizon and just hovered in the sky. A couple minutes later a second bright yellow light appeared next to it about a football field length away. It wasn’t as bright as the first and it too hovered in place. After about 5 minutes of staring at it, they began to alternate in brightness. One would get dim and the other brighter. I had never seen anything like this before. After about 5 minutes of that, one of the lights began to move away in a southwest direction. It was slow moving but as it passed overhead the light disappeared. While this was happening the other light remained hovering in place. After the 1st light dimmed out the second light followed in the same direction and passed closer to us where I could make out the shape of the object. It was diamond shaped and had bright yellow lights on each corner. It too dimmed out and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Upon closer examination, I saw that it had not just one light, but three large lights, arranged in a triangular pattern.  It was large, about one and a half inches in the sky, but it moved slowly, about the same speed as a plane at full altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it and realized that it was triangular, and it flew, point-forward, across the sky.  It had about 5 lights on it.  Three whites ones situated in a triangular pattern near the front point, and two bright, red lights on each of the other points of the triangle, in this case, which was the back of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew over the bonnet of my car, so I couldn&#39;t see it, and there are quite a few trees so it went out of view, but I got one last look of it flying into the horizon.

I was outside with my dogs when I heard a military jet.  Because of my rural upbringing, I still look up every time I hear a plane and since I&#39;m 46 yrs old, I&#39;ve seen a lot of different planes.  I know by sound what type of plane is flying over before I see it.  I live below the flight path between Duluth International Airport and the Minot North Dakota air base so there is a fair amount of ESE to WNW air traffic over my area, though most of it is pretty high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell by the sound and the flight path that this was a military jet of some type and since it was about the time that there was talk of deploying more troops to Iraq, I&#39;d been seeing and hearing military jets fly over more frequently in the previous month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in time to see the jet headed West and at the same time, a small red light caught my eye as it came from the South, perpendicular to the path of the jet.  The red light was the same size as the satellites that I see, and I couldn&#39;t see a definite shape.  The red light did a 90-degree turn to the West alongside the jet, and followed the same flight path. I have watched the sky all my life and know the difference between stars, satellites, and meteors, and this was like none of those.  I&#39;ve even seen some meteors that were quite spectacular, including a double one that was bright green, and I knew that wasn&#39;t a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shoved the dogs inside and yelled for my husband, who had to bolt up a flight of stairs to get outside where I was, and he agreed it was nothing like he&#39;d ever seen before.  We watched the plane and the red light until they were out of sight on the horizon.  The jet wasn&#39;t low in the sky, but a lot lower than the passenger planes that fly over this area, and even at night it was unmistakably military.  The red light kept pace with the jet the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just kept on wondering what the heck it could be and tried to think of a rational explanation. I guess it was unidentified, it was flying, and all I can say is that I know what it &#34;wasn&#39;t&#34;. Even if I&#39;d had a camera on me at the time, it wouldn&#39;t have photographed well, unfortunately.<n>

The sun had set almost west-northwest of my line of sight; it was dusk condition (still light enough, but not dark - about 30 min to 1 hour before darkness was to set in), and that is when I saw the bright circular object on the SW horizon, just above and slightly beyond the mountain peaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was setting slowly behind the mountains; again, it was bright enough that no stars or other planet(s) were visible.  At first I thought that it might have been Venus, but it seemed too low on the horizon to be Venus, and it was sinking faster than any planet&#39;s movement rate across the sky and/or horizon. It&#39;s size seemed quite large (3-4 times larger in diameter than any planet which would be visible via the naked eye - possible visual refraction error due to the object being located pretty much right on the horizon (objects look larger on the horizon, i.e. - the sun looks bigger as does the moon when setting or rising), and the distance had to be at least one hundred miles away, over the mountains to the southwest (beyond downtown Calgary), which are about 50 miles away from Calgary due west, as the crow flies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular, had a very bright white colored light, moved through a roughly 5 to 10 degrees vertical arc within 5 minutes. I watched it until it totally disappeared out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other option that I come up with what it could possibly have been is the space station?

One of the neighbors happens to catch something out of the corner of his eye, and says: &#34;Look at that!&#34; and I turned to look. I had time to turn and see it for about a good 2 seconds. We all witnessed a large, (about the size of a quarter to your naked eye at arms length) orange light traveling in an arc (with the shape of the earth, or atmosphere) The reason I say it was large is that it appeared to be at a very high altitude. It traveled slowly for the few short seconds we saw it.  It crossed the sky on a heading or west to north west, and then simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought was that this was a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere. I have no idea what it was, but it was moving a lot slower than a shooting star would move.  I&#39;ve seen Russian Rocket bodies enter the atmosphere, and generally they tend to disintegrate and you can see different parts, or a shower of sparks as they fall. My other thought was that it had something to do with a Chinese Anti Sattelite weapon test, and could have been debris from that.  Again, it didnt splinter or spark. It was just solid. This was really odd.  We have no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Silver saucer/disk shaped object hovering in the sky completely motionless at about 6000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the description of what I witnessed on Wednesday morning, January 17th, 2007 at approximately 10:30 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me give some background, I am married, 40 years old, 2 children, I am a general contractor, self employed in the construction trades and have worked in the northern Lake county, Illinois, area for the past 19 years.  Prior to the 17th, I remained skeptical on the whole UFO issue, since I had no direct experience to justify any existence of such phenomena one way or the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to the jobsite about 10:30 in the morning, heading eastbound on route 120 in the Hainesville, Grayslake area I turned onto Alleghany road southbound about 45 mph. the stretch is perhaps three miles to Peterson road, about halfway I noticed something in the sky at about 45 to 50 degrees south-southwest of my position, it caught my eye I believe because it was not moving, just floating-hovering stationary my best guess at about 5000-7000 ft. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drive a G20 Chevy van with a large windshield; it appeared about ½&#34; in size as I watched through the windshield. The object was saucer- disk shaped and very silver, the sky was clear and its definition crisp, no movement at all; it appeared as if someone held up a silver plate in the sky. I watched the object for about a minute or more until I reached Peterson road, when I turned east it left my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had sort of a photographic memory and as the minutes progressed it started to hit me what that may have been, I then regretted I did not stop to observe it further as I never saw anything like it, motionless just sitting stationary, I think back and believe now I should have stopped and called the police because it was close enough to plainly see it was not any recognizable aircraft or a balloon, it was a silver saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose I was in a state of denial at the time but it just keeps coming back to me and I can still see it. That night I remarked to my wife and kids that I saw a flying saucer on the way to work in a matter of fact way as if the reality of what I saw did not quite compute, it seemed ridiculous in a way, I tried to shrug it off.  In a strange way it has taken some time to process this, because silver saucers don’t just float in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a couple of other people about it, one person mentioned that UFO’s were recently sighted over O’Hare airport, so after about 10 days of still picturing it just hovering in the sky I googled<n> <n><n> &#34;“O’Hare UFO&#34; and came up with a photo someone took over the airport, and I thought to myself that that was what I saw, except more crispy defined and silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its been a few weeks now and I decided that I have to tell someone who could possibly make sense or use of this, I am trying to reconcile the fact that I really don’t believe in UFO’s with seeing this thing, this just won’t go away, silver saucers don’t just float in the sky and its starting to mess with my mind, I am a very rational logical person not given to superstition or the like so I pass this information on to try to lay it to rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what good this will do but to possibly validate other like sightings in that area, in any case the above I affirm to be as accurate in fact as I can testify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If for any reason you need anything that I did not think of here feel free to e-mail back to this address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((initials deleted))<n>

Approximate time was 9:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up in the sky in front of me and to the south, up above what appeared to be an airport were 3 glowing slightly flashing objects white/orange in color they appeared for about ten to twenty seconds. When the 3 large objects became 5 objects and appeared and disappeared back into the 3 objects.  This lasted for an additional ten to twenty second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was I would say they were one thousand to two thousand feet above the airport.  Very large larger than a house. I pulled off the road to see if what ever I saw would reappear. I waited for a few minutes enough time to get a little spooked. I got back on the road to San Diego. I do not know what I saw but I know it was not any thing I had seen before at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back to San Diego just out side of Gila Bend I saw a lot of aircraft flying towards the direction I just had come from. I got off the highway one more time and notice they were about 4 helicopters and to the west and south and 4 jet aircraft to the north heading in an easterly direction. I could not tell if they were military or not.<n>

My drive is about an hour and a half on the interstate so I&#39;ve started breaking up my trip home by taking a secondary highway at the halfway point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on 150 East in Davidson County and just happened to be looking at the sky out of my driver&#39;s side window when an object seemed to streak out of the sky towards the trees an undetermined number of miles away... without falling from all that far up. And it didn&#39;t leave a residue trail like something that large would leave. It fell from (roughly) south to north at a steep angle maybe a couple of thousand feet, nowhere near tens of thousands, or from orbit. All this happened very fast and I would have discounted it as a meteor except that right before it disappeared from my sight into the trees or whatever it landed in, a really bright tinier flash of green emanated from it and it looked like it actually slowed down. I observed no impact sound, vibration, or light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I kept looking at the sky around my car. I noticed a few minuted later that heading from my north and east was a craft that could have been an airplane--it looked like it was up there a few thousand feet and it wasn&#39;t flying erratically or extremely fast. What caused me to pay attention to this craft, though, was that its &#34;headlight&#34; (white) was blinking in a signal pattern I&#39;ve not seen airplanes use. As it flew above me I observed that the placement of the port and starboard lights as compared to airplanes I&#39;ve seen was... well that thing either had really short wings or it was triangular in shape. I watched it off and on for a good three minutes maybe more before it left my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Approx. 35 deg. 53&#39;19&#34;N by 80deg.19&#39;33&#34;W)<n>

It was about the size of a car and was falling from the sky from east to west over 272 in the area of shiprock road.  My girlfriend and I were taking our dog out when we noticed it.  It was a reddish pinkish color with a reddish haze around the outside.  The light from the object was so bright that the pavement on the road had the red light cast on it.  It fell slowly towards the West and once it was close to the ground suddenly disappeared.  I am extremely skeptical as to what this was.  I know it was not a flair, this was far too big, high and bright but similar in color. I called the local news right when I had seen this and reported it. Then on Thursday a friend who was traveling north about 2 miles from where I was on the 17th, at 11:30, had reported seeing the same mysterious light.  Our stories were identical when we compared notes.  I know more people had seen the object, there were cars traveling on 272 at the time and there&#39;s no way you could miss this thing.  I would greatly appreciate if you looked into this further.  This was a large object, again about the size of a 4 door car, where ever it landed it should be visible.  It went down behind the tree line somewhere starting from the west of 272 in the shiprock road area heading towards the frogtown area.  Please let me know if your hear anything more or find anything out.  It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update of  reddish pink lights over southern lancaster<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow up to the sighting I had seen on Tuesday, January 16.  I had got my days confused and originally had written Wednesday, January 17 but after comparing notes with other witnesses realized it was indeed the night of the 16th.  In addition three more people have come forward and described seeing the same reddish pink light.  I had described seeing a reddish pink glowing object approx. 100 - 1000 feet high slowly moving east to west across 272 by shiprock road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of the witnesses that have recently come forward were located about 1 Mile north of my location on 272 south by the end of herrville road.  They reported seeing the same object but had said there was 2. They had said the objects were traveling west over shiprock road , where i was located, when one of the objects suddenly dissapeared. The other continued descending to the west.  In addition a close friends mother has come forward and had seen the exact same object (only one) while taking her dogs out from her home on Mount Hope School Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iam working on my triangulation&#39;s and other visual aids and will be sending them soon.

The sky was completely clear; no fog.  I began looking at the stars about 30 minutes after having come down from North Chalone Peak.  I was looking in a northwest direction as I walked along Chalone Peak Trail.  I was about 3.3 miles away from the Bear Gulch Visitor Center when I stopped to see the moving &#34;star&#34;.  I&#39;m really skeptical about martians or people from other planets but this was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I observed what I never imagined I&#39;d ever see.  Too strange and kind of eerie.  The way it moved was unlike anything that humans have made.  A &#34;star&#34; barely visible and twinkling just like a very distant star--moved sideways, stopped for a few seconds...slowly moved in another direction...stopped.  It seemed like a little bug with no particular direction or course.  It happened several times and it seemed to have a life of its own rather than a manned craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved suddenly downward at an incredible speed; kind of like a slow-moving shooting star but without a trail or sudden brightness.  It slowly went up a little and stopped.  It continued on a very slow-moving course.  I&#39;m sure it continued to travel but I began walking and it was impossible to see if it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen satellites in California and Canada smaller than stars move quickly in a north &gt; south or east &gt; west direction but this was somthing else.  No plane, satellite or anything created by humans can do that.  I don&#39;t if I want to see that again.<n>

I was observing a small aircraft, I know that it was a small plane be-cause I could hear the plane&#39;s engine running, at night you really can&#39;t make out any details out on the plane like wings or tail all you can really make out are the lights. Well anyway I was watching this plane when I noticed what I thought was another aircraft flying behind and just slightly above the first plane that I was watchig, I noticed that the second aircrafts lights were all the same color and that they were very dim for being an aircraft, I also noted that I could make out details about the shape of the craft, it was oval! There were no wings and no tail I realy do not understand how I could make out so much detail if the lights were so dim. I do not go around making ufo reports. The only other ufo I have ever seen was in the early sixties when I was a youg boy. My brother and I were walking to the corner neihborhood store when a huge green ball of fire flew right over our heads all I realy want to know if anybody out ther has had a similar expierence to mine and I want to know are these things real?<n>

This area of our hike was also the most silent and darkest.  A report that was submitted on 11/30/06 mentions that &#34;SETI wanted to put their Scientific Instruments near the Pinnacle National Monument area&#34; and that &#34;their was reports of local boys in the Pinnacles area that even reported seeing UFOS&#34;.  Indeed Pinnacles seems to be a hotspot for this kind of activity.  My brother and I saw the same lights that he and others saw two years ago.  The first set of lights were observed around 8 PM as we traveled toward the top of North Chalone Peak.  We were on Chalone Peak Trail looking eastwards and down towards a large uninhabited canyon.  My brother had told me about strange lights in that same area and I wanted to see them for myself.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing something natural but after several minutes, I saw one of the lights kind of float and move southwards in a very slow but deliberate manner.  The blue light seemed to move just like the star-like light I had observed much later in the sky.  This blue light on the canyon would stop and then move again after several seconds.  About two other lights appeared later but up further towards the south.  As we walked further, about two lights also appeared below us but in a southwest location between Jackass Canyon and Divide Canyon.  Incidentally, about 2,000 Native Americans were slaughtered and buried below that area.  This is where we observed one of the lights also float in the canyon except that this particular light seemed to very slowly travel in a parallel direction toward the trail that we were on.  We then continued our ascent to the top.  After about 40 minutes, we then began to travel back on the trail to head back home.  We again saw the same light continue to travel and float but we then continued on our journey.  It started to rain a few minutes after we ! began ou r descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had been lightly raining for a few minutes and we were making our way on Chalone Peak Trail toward the bottom of the mountain about 10 minutes before Bear Gulch, we saw a normal-looking white light--the kind emitted by a light bulb--in the distance.  We took the wrong trail near Bear Gulch Cave when we noticed the light directly below us in the northwest at the bottom of a canyon.  I thought it was a light from the national park&#39;s employees&#39; living quarters.  After a few minutes, my brother commented on how the light seemed to be a guide for us since we had trouble finding our way back.  The most surprising incident occured when we were nearing our way towards the end of the trail.  This is when I saw that same light traveling passed us in the opposite direction, through a canyon that was to the left of the trail we were on.  The light seemed to be about 70 feet directly across us to the left and at the same height of our  heads.  I only noticed it slightly but my brother asked me if I had seen the light to which I answered, yes.  I quickly thought it was another hiker but realized that we were the only ones on the mountain, plus it was around 11:30 PM.  Why would a hiker be traveling up the canyon where there are no trails on that canyon at that time?  It was too late and it was raining.  I later learned that the light didn&#39;t just pass us as I thought.  My brother saw that same light floating and then disappearing in an instant.  He didn&#39;t tell me that then because he said that I might have gotten scared.  I then realized that the employees&#39; living quarters was far away from the canyon where we had seen the light.  I never felt any fear but I don&#39;t think I will ever travel there at night unless I do it with a group of people.  I hate to think what would have happened if we had come into contact with any of those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 9 pm I looked to the left (south) and saw a V-shaped craft hovering about 1000 feet in the air. It was quite close to the highway, close enough to see a series of red and white light along the wings. It looked like an airplane without the body. It did not move or emit any sound. It appeared to be shiny metal with some reflected light off the surface. I did not stop as I was on my way home from a local hospital where I work as a physician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO and have always been skeptical that any aliens have visited earth as we have no physical proof. This did not strike me as an &#34;alien&#34; or extraterrestrial craft, it just looked like a man-made craft that somehow was able to hover silently. However, I have no explanation for what kind of craft could have appeared as it did.<n>

I was out walking my dog and I saw a very low flying object around 8- 8:30 PM.  It was over a corn field near Old Collinsville Road.  The object came towards me and I panicked and ran home.  Then I went back out and from a distance observed the object.  I don&#39;t see how this could be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would go very low, then zoom high.  I am not 100% sure of the shape, although it had 2 white headlights in front and a red flashing light on the side.  I think it might have been triangle shaped. I think it was gray or silver, but it was dark outside.  I thought it was a plane at first, but planes can&#39;t zoom up and down.  About 30 minutes later I noticed lot&#39;s of other planes in sky and around 9:15 I noticed another object flying low.  I am fairly sure it was a helicopter (sounded like one) and I think it was looking for the UFO.  Two of the other planes were flying close together and I think they were also looking for / following the object.  The helicopter flew around the area for at least 30 - 40 minutes and kept back tracking.  The object I saw made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You might be interested to know that the Travel Channel did a special called UFO in Illinios and it was specifically about a UFO in this area back in January of 2000 or 2001.  However, I wasn&#39;t looking for what I saw.  I regret not getting in my car to follow the object, but I was alone and afraid.  I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t provide more details.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From a distance it loked like an airplane it had a triangle look form a distance and once upon it it looked like a flying triangle hovering. Teh lights were redish and white lights. just like a plane but none were flashing or like landing lights. me and my wife are not really believers in UFO but this was somehting very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a helicopter or plane headed my way but the more I looked it wasnt moving in any direction. SO i figured it was a helicopter hovering (we had a large ice storm with powerlines down) checking for damage or drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However after a minute of sitting there the light starts to dim as if its turning then moves to the left a little bit then shoots straight up into the sky, through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was going up it almost reminded me of when a space shuttle has taken off and is going into space( i lived in FL and have witnessed many launches) It had the speed of one, but no jet trail or anything. The only light i saw from it seemed to be a flame almost like an afterburner of a aircraft, but not blue, coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared into the clouds, I didnt see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to be logical and rule out as many things as I could since i dont want to come on here sounding like some idiot who sees a plane or sattelite and thinks its a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We traveled west on Hwy 72 and the light was not a plane or a tower light and I don&#39;t believe that it was a planet. It was yellow-orange in color and would move slightly from left to right. It wasn&#39;t blinking. As we got into Huntsville, the light was still there but not as bright because of the city lights. It had gone further down the horizon because it takes about 20 minutes to get to Huntsville. I know my planets and stars and I know that this isn&#39;t suppose to be where it is. What is it? An asteriod? It doesn&#39;t have a noticeable tail or anything. Just looks Venus but much brighter and not white but yellow-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was flying horizontally to the ground metallic cherry red on one half and silver metallic on the other half.  As it turned and moved n a tumbling fashion the sun reflected off its highly polished surface. It moved along and tumbled 3 or 4 times so that I got to look at each side of the oval shaped object (like a zero on a computer on its side).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was totally silent.

The light had about the same intensity as the other actual stars.In the early morning light,I could faintly make out what looked like some sort of craft behind and to the right of it.( The light actually looked like an aircraft headlight but the light was emitting from it&#39;s side rather than the front.)Therewas also no sound or flashing lights as are typical on most aircraft.The &#34;craft&#34; continued on a perfectly straight course to the East and off into the horizon.<n>

I was taking random shots of the beach and of us and then just to test the camera I aimed it at the sky and snapped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first all I got were black shots with tiny little dots for stars and then I got something that I had never seen before. At first I thought the meteoroid shower had started, but I couldn’t see anything with my naked eye and plus, these lights were going in all different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I snapped another shot and again, the black screen with just the dots. Then I tried the &#34;series&#34;option on the camera (takes several photos in one minute) and what I got was amazing.  A couple of the shots were just black, but I got 2 more pictures of these light streaks and I was baffled because I could not see any of this with my naked eye, only when I snapped the picture, and only 4 times out of the 50 something shots I took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed the pictures to my boyfriend and when we got home we uploaded them and took a closer look at these streaks on the computer.

I was looking at the stars as it was a cold clear night. I noticed an area of stars that were disappearing then coming back. Something was blocking them out. If you held out your arm full length and had your index finger and thumb about two inches apart that would be about the size of the area. I watched it moving slow for about two minutes then the area got a white area about the size of a nickel. It was very bright and all white. It started to move faster and looked as if it was ascending .The light started moving to the right and getting smaller. Then it was gone. The object the whole time was moving from north to south but when it lit up it moved slightly to the east before it disappeared. I thought it might have been a satellite with a north to south orbit. After thinking about it the area was to large for a satellite. There was no sound with this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

1/15/07 19:00|Fayetteville|NC|Light|7 min|Two bright star like objects swooping down then hugging tree line....|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56160.html|200|ndxe200701| Two bright star like objects swooping down then hugging tree line....<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 2007, Fayetteville NC  It was around 7:00pm. I was heading west to my parents house on Cliffdale Rd. I saw these two bright lights coming out of the clouds (storm clouds just hit the area.(no rain tho) The clouds were mid altitude to low, running fast west. Now at first I thought they were helicopters, because my parents live right next to Fort Bragg. And it’s totally normal to see them in the area. Now what caught my attention was the light as they came out of the clouds (it was kinda dark all around), I thought dam that’s cool to be flying and doing that(coming out of a storm like that). I saw them and lost them as I drove. They came out of the clouds and started to head down. Now when I turned into my parents housing area, as I was going down the road and I saw the lights again behind the houses (not right behind the houses) but I could see where they were still moving west and heading down. I pulled into my parents house and ran to the back yard. The lights were bright, very bright. Both the lights seem to be independent from each other but kept a tight formation. One light was a head of the other. As I watch them, they swooped down and started hugging the tree line real close, I mean right down in the tree line. I could see the lights thru the trees, its January and the trees had relatively no leaves on them. They where constantly changing altitude, up, up, up, down, up, down up..etc... Very quick tho. I had a clear line of sight on them, before hugging the tree line. The description of the light was as follow: bright white (dead center) to white/yellowish around its edges. The light was not glowing perfectly around the object but had spikes of lights around it but north, east and west the spikes of light where at there greatest, with a long tail down (kind of like in Christmas cards, how they draw the star of Bethlehem) The tail down was really weird, it sparkled half way down the tail, slightly wavy and sparkling. As I sat there watching them, I really could not focus on them because it was all light. But I did squint m! y eyes a nd I saw a hint of blue and yellow blinking light (only one time) coming from dead center of the object. They got closer and closer down into the tree line and keep moving west right into Fort Bragg. Now I thought of every thing that it could have been. I am a military brat, seen all types of aircraft daytime and nighttime. No way was it a helicopter. If it was they are very irresponsible for flying that low in that kind of weather. Also it moved up and down so fast and tight when hugging the tree line. The other thing that I thought it could be is a flare canister with a parachute that larger military aircraft release. But the wind was strong and they would of flow apart unless they were tied together, if so I didn’t see the chute, which I think I should have been seen easily with that large of a light source. And the light was so large that I think that the chute would have caught on fire. Also when they came out of the sky the were coming down at a constant rate and smoothly straighten out before hugging the tree line. The wind was to my back going west but I tried to see if I heard anything but the wind on my ears made that impossible. The light source is what made me think. If it was any type of aircraft the light source completely envelop the whole aircraft. Never seen anything like that. I looked all over the internet and read this whole website trying to validate what I saw. The only thing that I keep reading is that people see a star like object, but I wish people be a bit more detail....thus me writing a lot...PS When I say they flew into Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg is a big base, I don’t mean the main base were the housing area is and the PX/BX, mini mall is at. But there is a large area west of bragg that’s all impact area and they have drop zones there, field exercise area, etc., also I will be sending you a map as soon as i can get it done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They seemed to look almost like orbs or silverish bubbles at first. But they would dip and dive and approach another larger shape that was more cigar shaped and just melt into it.Then after a moment or two would reappear from the longer one. At first I had thought that they might have been balloons. But after watching them it was pretty obvious that they were something else.They were far to large to be balloons,and they seemed to react to each other the way that mercury does in its liquid form.  Sort of running into one another and becoming absorbed.It was very exciting to watch and I am still unable to identify these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear, starry night. I was talking to him, when from the Corner of my eye I saw a round/oval shape of light shooting by. This only lasted for 2 to 3 seconds. We were moving east at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about the size of a headlight of a car, maybe even bigger and it was radiating a very bright light. I would say the light had a color between yellow and orange. The object radiated those 2 colors intermittently (You can compare it to a star blinking in the sky.) The object was moving downwards choosing a curved path. It looked like it was going to land, but we can&#39;t be sure of this. The object then disappeared behind the tree line. There was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to say to him: “look a shooting star”. But because of the size of the object I don’t think it was a shooting star. Then he asked me if I just saw that, I answered yes, and we compared our sightings. We came to the conclusion that we both saw the same thing and that it wasn’t a shooting star or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sharty after two more sets of lights flew under the stationary set, they set out in opposite directions west and east. It is now 2 am and the stationary set is still visable. I found a old pair of binoculars and was shock at the row of lights spinning around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?   Sirius??  PD))<n>

We observed several planes fly by the crafts over 2 hours, but got too cold so we went inside.  We called different people we knew and told them to go outside and look.  They all saw the crafts too.

1/14/07 21:50|Navarre|FL|Triangle|one second|Nighttime one second observation of low level black silent triangle with lights over Gulf coast|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54768.html|212|ndxe200701| Nighttime one second observation of low level black silent triangle with lights over Gulf coast<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were staying at the Best Western Motel, 8697 Navarre Parkway (Highway 98), in a second story room overlooking the sound to the south (and the Gulf beyond.)  I was standing on the balcony just outside the room door at the railing watching the sky.  It was very quiet and the only noise to be heard was from small waves rippling against the beach below.  There was a very light breeze at the time.  There was broken, widely scattered, low level cloud cover-- very thin, wispy clouds, and stars were visible for the most part through them.  (It was difficult to estimate the actual altitude of the clouds, as they reflected the glare of the city on the underneath side and it made them seem as if they wer 500 to 1,000 feet up; however, similar clouds observed during daylight appeared to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude.) There was no moon, and the sky, particularly directly overhead, was otherwise crystal clear.  Horizontally, visibility out to the gulf was unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second successive evening that I had stood on the balcony watching the sky for any action (I know this area experiences  a high number of UFO reports.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly noted movement to my left.  I observed a triangular black craft at approximately at the 11:00 o&#39;clock position to my left.  The craft had a single white light at each corner and a slightly larger, brighter light in the center.  The craft&#39;s corner lights were relatively brighter than the other stars.  The craft was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon and was proceeding in a straight line due west.  I observed it as it crossed my field of view until it was obscured by clouds at approximately the 2:00 o&#39;clock position to my right. The craft traversed this space in approximately one second and was completely silent.  There were no other lights, e.g., red/ green wingtip running lights, otherwise visible.  The craft was flying above the clouds, but appeared to be at a relatively low level of altitude.  Again, it was very difficult to estimate accurately, but if I had to guess, I would say absolutely no higher than 5,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately raised my arm to estimate the approximate size of the craft by spacing my fore finger and thumb.  I did this repeatedly and concluded an approximate width of one and 1/4 to one and 1/2 inches.  I continued to watch but did not again see the craft, and within 30 minutes the cloud cover continued to build to the point that further observation was pointless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a three day stay in Navarre, I also observed a variety of Navy military aircraft in the vicinity, including &#34;Huey&#34; med-evac choppers, Marine Sea Stallion choppers, and an executive jet skimming the coast line.  All aircraft flew at relatively low levels, 1,000 to 3,500 feet.  Navarre lies between Pensacola Naval Air Station and Eglin/ Hurlburt Air Force Base, and a wide variety of military aircraft fly in the area daily, both day and night, including the USAF F-117 Stealth Fighter.  The area is also known for conducting a wide variety of research and development activities, tests, evaluations, etc.  I don&#39;t think the craft I observed could have been an F-117, as its shape varied (more triangular) and there were no running lights.  While the Stealth i sconfigured to fly with minumum engine noise, there was absolutely no sound from this craft, and at that altitude in such a quiet setting, I believe I would have heard a jet engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By way of background, I am 62, a retired Air Force officer (Lt. Col., 25 years service) and have observed a wide variety of aircraft, US and allied, military and civilian, under varying conditions.)<n>

We both looked over to the North East over Sinclair Inlet and saw 3 objects all in formation above the water. They were in a row over the Navy shipyard in Bremerton. They were all standing still. They all had a white light coming from the top and what looked like a red and blue light on the bottom. They had a round/saucer shape. As we drove North to Silverdale, the trees finally were blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I casually looked up at the sky to see maybe the big dipper.  I then notice what I thought was a shooting star but it travelled in a straight line for 5 seconds and came to a complete stop.  It then started moving back and forth perpendicular to the origianl path. It did this oscillating motion for several minutes and the would make darting and hook like movements, erratic then settle down a little, then start up again. it proceed to my right. I tried to call several friends, I reached one and asked to go outside and look at the sky. I told where to look based on the bright stars in a vertical line. I told her to look to her left quite aways and look at the star by itself. I said what do you see. She said its moving up and down. I called other friends but by then it had receded. The event lasted about 30 minutes or so.<n>
1/14/07 17:00|Murfreesboro|TN|Light|5-10 Seconds|2 ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT APPEARED IN THE SKY 30 SECS AFTER ONE ANOTHER AND SHOT OFF AS A GREEN STREAK LIGHT|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54934.html|217|ndxe200701| 2 ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT APPEARED IN THE SKY 30 SECS AFTER ONE ANOTHER AND SHOT OFF AS A GREEN STREAK LIGHT<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT I WITNESSED:  I saw a yellowish-orange colored ball of light suddenly appear and accelerate so quickly it was far beyond the capabilities of all known aircraft.  When this ball of light shot of to the west, it appeared and I firmly believe it was traveling level to the ground as though it was completely parallel to the ground.  As it accelerated and shot out of sight, the object went from a solid yellowish-orange colored ball of light to a green streak of light that disappeared as quickly as it came. This entire event took no longer than 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Less than 30 seconds later, I was still looking at the point in the sky where I had just witnessed something fantastic and rare when the event was repeated with all details the exact same as described above except this object was less than 100 yards to the north (the right) of the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SPECIFICS: -I stepped outside and stood on my friend&#39;s porch to smoke and check out the current weather conditions as it had been snowing hard all day.  It was still snowing heavily and the clouds had to be at an altitude no higher than 2,000 AGL.  I was closely examining the cloud layer in an attempt to predict whether the snow would be letting soon or not.  I was of sober mind when I observed these 2 events witnessed this event and was looking west focusing on the fast-moving cloud layers coming out of the west and moving toward the east.  It is important to note that the weather conditions were such that the stars were not at all visible, flying conditions were IFR only, and there are neither airports nor victor nor jet airways in this area, neither are there any towers or buildings (only flat farmland) in this area.

Me and my wife were asleep but the flash was bright enough that I saw it through my eyelids.  There was also the sound of a very distant crash or explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly jumped out of bed thinking a plane or possibly a meteorite just crashed in the distance.  At this point my wife also woke up an asked what&#39;s wrong.  I told her what I thought happened and proceeded to peek through the blinds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the sudden with another flash the entire back yard lights up in bright red color.  My wife jumps out of bed and rushs to the window yelling &#34;what is that!&#34;  I told her I have no idea and both of us proceed to look out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 1 to 2 min. later another flash of light only this time its green and it appears to be coming from the roof.  Now were both freaking out, I throw some pj&#39;s on grab my spot light and gun and head for the front door.  I pause in the kitchen, looking out the front window thinking maybe a transformer blew up but saw nothing to prove that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly there&#39;s another green flash and immediatly after it the power in the house fades out with a buzzing sound and then returns.  My wife screams &#34;it&#39;s coming from the roof&#34;.  So I proceed cautiously to the front yard and shine my light up on the roof but see nothing then I walk around to the back yard and do the same, nothing on the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Way off to the east I observe a couple flashes of white light almost like lightening except with out a noticable bolt.  Then I run back inside and back into the bedroom, we open both blinds and wait.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 10 min. later to the southwest we observe another green flash then about 5 min. after that to the south another green flash and finally about 10 min. after that again to the south we notice another light which starts faint and white in color and then builds brighter changing to red.  This one lasts about 1 to 2 min. and then fades out.  All the other flashes lasted only about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting awhile and not seeing anything else we decide to lay back down.  I did notice a couple more flashes but couldn&#39;t tell where they were coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had an ice storm that night and everything was covered in ice.  I&#39;m not sure if this was caused by some sort of electrical phenomenom or not.  Maybe someone has the answer, maybe not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It is now 12:05 AM as I write this sentence. What I saw happened not less than an hour ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving westbound on Old Sumner Buckley Highway just behind the fairly recently built Target. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at a redlight admiring the stars on an unusually clear night. I then proceeded westbound with the greenlight when to my right (north of me) I saw a bright light moving VERY swiftly in an arcing vector. It was moving relatively parallel to me heading westbound and dissapeared behind the treeline. It looked as if it were already on a trajectory somewhat like a missile coming down to a target in an arcing manor. To be honest as stupid as it sounds, I thought it was in fact a missile. It looked fairly high in the sky but nothing like an airplane. Maybe a 2 or 3 thousand feet at the highest. It came eastbound across a large field in a straight trajectory until getting closer to the treeline when it took I&#39;d say a 15-20 degree angle change and dove in a curving manor behind the treeline. All of this happened so quickly, it couldn&#39;t have been more than a second. It must have moved a a mile or so in that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was basically just a white ball. There was no tail like a comet what have and no blinking lights like an airplane. That&#39;s why I thought it might have been the tail of the missile and not a comet or something. After it passed however, there was no exhaust trail and furthermore why would there be a missile flying over Bonney Lake. I then repeated what I saw to my girlfriend who is thanks to me probably having trouble falling asleep right now. I took a few side roads driving home in hopes of seeing it again, but had no such luck. I&#39;ve never reported a UFO before and feel silly doing so right now, but I&#39;m sort of hoping to find out what it really was or could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was already dark and I looked into the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night without any clouds and I was so glad to see the stars.  After few seconds I noticed sort of two geese formations in the direction of Orion Constellation.  The first strange thing that I noticed was the fact that every &#34;goose&#34; in the formation &#34;kind-off&#34; glowed. There was a small formation of 5 or 6 objects in front and a larger formation behind of 10 to 12 objects. Every object glow very clearly in the dark sky making apparent the object’s chevron shape. There was no sound, no air tail, nor any other lights except the glow of each object. The traveling direction was from North-East to South-South-West. At the moment when I saw the objects they were on my left at aprox 45 degrees of my walking direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a split of a second my thoughts were: Gooses?  Now in January?  Impossible; and anyway they would have been more like dark pots on the sky rather than glowing. What a heck it this?  During the next 15-20 seconds the 2 formations already passed the Orion Constellation and started to assemble themselves (in a &#34;goose&#34; like fashion) in a single formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I lowered my sight for no more than 10 seconds to check over my dog. When I looked again in the sky, the &#34;geese&#34; formation was this times on my right at aprox 45 degrees of the same walking direction. After 10-15 more seconds the formation was out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I realized the incredible speed that these objects should have to be able to travel more than 90 degrees of the sky in less than 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing my walk with the dog, 2 to 3 min later I noticed a linear cloud or air tail following the direction of the &#34;geese&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air tail seamed to move in the wind and after several minutes it was completely dissipated.<n>

Este yacimiento cientifico fue encontrado en una casa fabricacion arquitectonica.  Su habitat es de un clima tropical y su fauna silvestre.  Los hijos aparecieron en el mismo lugar de los hechos. Por eso no cabe la menor duda de que su muerte fue la causa de un parto prematuro. Esta formula es una corporacion y se acoje al premio Nobel de sciencia.<n>

I was driving north on Hollywood Way toward the Hollywood/Burbank airport.  I noticed a jet that had just taken off going southwest and was watching it climb (and I criticize cell phone users).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right behind it and moving toward the northwest I noticed a white cylindrical object.  I thought it may have been a private aircraft but private aircraft aren&#39;t permitted to be that close to the airport.  It wasn&#39;t directly behind it but probably a few hundred feet behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was kind of &#34;floating&#34; as it was moving.  I continued watching it as I was driving until the car next to me (I was in the inside lane) slowed down and began moving toward the lane I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my eyes off of the object for less than 10 seconds.  When I looked back, the object was gone.<n>

It seemed stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With binoculars I could see that the body of the light was chartreuse green, surrounded by red lights.  It may have been round.  It seemed to emit green flashes of light, reminding me of a 4th of July firework, where separate streams of light shoot out geyser-like, all at once, arcing in different directions. The red lights didn&#39;t seem to flash like the center chartreuse green light.   The object seemed located much above and beyond Blake Island, at a position of about one o&#39;clock from the center of the island.  I noticed another similar stationary red/green light at a position of about three o&#39;clock in the sky, that wasn&#39;t irridescent or flashing.   I watched these lights for about 45 minutes before going to bed.  What with the unusually cold temperatures, I thought it might have been a phenomenon caused by ice in the air - although the stars visible that morning were unremarkable.  The next morning (Sunday 1/14/07) at 2:00am I checked to see if the two objects were still there, but they were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD))<n>

Sort of reminded me of a search light on a helicopter, which was my first thought.  Then I realized, there wasn&#39;t any helicopter sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried to see where the light was coming from, but the conditions prevented viewing of any object.  The light just looked like it was coming straight down out of the clouds/mist.  This lasted approx. 5 minutes and then the light disappeared.<n>

About 15 minutes later I walked outside to smoke and I seen another bright light similar to the one I had previously seen. I was astounded to find at least five bright lights in the similar pulsating fashion. One of the lights seemed to be moving closer. I knew it was not a plane because I could only see one plane out there in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was too large to be an airplane, and it didnt move for about 5 minutes---it just hung in the air and when we stopped to continue to look at it---it just took off straight into the sky-not like an airplane or a hot air balloon. It seemed to be in the Plano area or past DFW airport. It didnt have any lights flashing--it was just a very massive object hovering in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Hughes Overpass and I looked up briefly and saw two, identical objects in the sky, directly in front of me, slowly moving in a NNE direction.  I checked my vehicle’s clock and it was at 10:19.  It was difficult to pinpoint their distance as they were traveling slightly away from me.  They were about 30 degrees vertically from the Eastern Horizon line.   The strange part was that they were moving together, in unison, about a half-mile apart by my estimates.  They were off in the distance and difficult to look at with all the ground clutter and light scatter from the highway flood lights.  They were moving slower than a typical plane on its landing approach to Lambert-St. Louis Airport in Bridgeton and were not headed in the right direction for a landing approach.  Each object had one light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further study, the two objects were moving in unison, as previously stated and were about 3+ miles away visible only through a large break in the clouds. They had a fluid movement to them and were not jaggedly moving through the night sky. They were visible for about 60 seconds before they disappeared behind a passing cloud and were not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighting on the objects was relatively clear. There was one light visible on each object and had a red/pink hue to both of them.  It was not like any landing light I have ever seen before. Both lights were bright and high-intensity.  The shape of the objects couldn’t be made out due to their distance from me.<n>

We all three then looked out the back window but only one light was visible at this point so we all three decided to go outside for a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once outside we could still only see one light which had remained in the same spot since I first saw it and which was still not making any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the light for another couple of minutes when it began moving northward and then shot off instantaneously out of sight just like you see UFO&#39;s do in movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it in my life and I am certain it was no currently known man made flying technology.<n>

The radius of these turns was small, and very smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the aircraft approached, I notices green wing-tip lights as opposed to the customary red left wing, green right wing tips.  I wondered what kind of airplane this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to drive northbound I could see the shape of the craft via the light configuration.  It had a triangular shape and appeared to be hovering and not moving across my field of vision as a regular airplane would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled open my sunroof and heard no airplane prop or jet engine noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then proceed to slowly move in a continuingly southeastern direction, at what seemed like a slow drifting motion.  I then lost sight of it due to the tree-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky tonight is clear and cold...about 30 degrees.  I&#39;m not sure what it was.  I would estimate that its altitude was approx. 2000-3000 ft. up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a centrally positioned red light in the middle of the undersurface of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m wondering if anyone else saw this object tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting lasted about 60 seconds.  Closest intersection is Il. Rt 14 and Dundee Rd. @ 10.00 p.m..<n>

I was walking my dogs back home and when I got to the front porch, I happened to look at the sky and saw a bright light just streak across the sky and then go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light looked light blue, but probably looked that color against the black sky.  It was very bright but did not light up the sky, more like a skylight would look or one of those white light flashlights. It lasted only seconds and streaked across the sky, so I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say what it looked like, since there was no real shape I could see in that short time frame.  It was just weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe me or not, I saw something and I can&#39;t even think what it could be<n>

This light was moving at a very fast rate in a straight line.  There were no blinking lights - it was constant and the same brightness.  The movement was from North to South and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We initially thought that it could be a satellite, but then thought since Sydney is far south, there are no other no other big cities than Melbourne so it seemed quite unlikely for a satellite to go North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites &#34;go&#34; almost anywhere their owners want them to go.

The other 2 were like kites also kinda just floating in out of each other.  I stood there for about 2 minutes ran in the house and got my husband he came out and started taking pictures with the digital camera.  We got  a few pictures taken then the 2 craft that were just hanging there started to move and the other 2 followed.  I was outside a good 15minutes then they left  wanted to follow them but I didnt know where to go.  I had told my friends at work the next day and one of them thought It might be some of the Russian Satellite that fell but i thought that was to far away to be seen.  I am a big UFO searcher and into the Paranormal so I know these were real and the were watching us and then left.  This was a great discovery  I will continue to look in the sky and keep the website upto date.<n>

At first, I thought this was a high altitude aircraft which I often see and paid it no mind.  As I got closer to home I noticed that it was pretty big even though it was very high up and seemed to be traveling west.  At that moment my son was pulling into the driveway exclaiming, &#34;What the hell is that!&#34;  I told him I thought it was a high altitude aircraft and he disagreed.  He said &#34;Dad, really take a look at it!  Thats no plane!&#34;  I told him to run inside and get my binoculars and when he returned with them, the object was farther away and nearing the treeline.  We observed this object, which he was right, was no plane, traveling high and appearing to be burning up in the atmosphere.  It was cylindrical in shape and was bright orange and yellow and leaving a smoke trail behind it.  It also seemed incredibly large in size considering that it was so high up. We couldnt make out any windows or control surfaces such as wings and such, but it was very high and far downrange when we finally looked at it with binoculars.  large object entering our atmosphere and  Also at the time I looked at it with binoculars it seemed to have changed from traveling like a missle, to traveling on its side and like a bar and at an angle so contrails were forming from both its ends.  Very cool looking and extremely odd to see at that time of day.  The sun wasnt exactly setting yet and it was pretty much still daylight outside.  The sun really brightened up the contrails in the sky too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed my camera (an 8 megapixel digital) at the object and took a sequence of seven photographs. One image in the sequence shows a red light. When I loaded the images into my computer and saw them on the screen, I noticed that the light is not blurred by motion. This would indicate to me that the object I photographed is not blurred by motion. The images show that the object was not a helicopter or an airplane. (It made no audible sound).

I have NO IDEA what it was, but I can tell you I &#39;supposedly&#39; had an abduction earlier that month(it was January).

This was in a East direction. She had sat there many times before without seeing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this occasion, the light caught her attention.  Light appeared as a Yellow White light that was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness moved head while sitting to get a better view throught the window blinds. The blinds were about 1/3 to 1/2 open at the time.  The witness said the object was above the one story building next door.  It sat stationary for 15 seconds then it took off in northernly direction in a diagonal upward direction.  It was gone within 1 sec and the observer stated the light left a visual trail during that departure.  Possible visual after-effect.  Witness claims no head movement during this departure sequence as best as she could remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness reported no change in the size or shape during the entire visual encounter.  Object remained circular in shape and witness describes as a &#34;light shinning at you&#34; appearance.  This description was further clarified by the witness as a briht center with rays of light all around it.  Her impression was that this object was close and it was estimated to be about 300 feet away and about 25 ft above the ground and about 2 ft in diameter based on similar size objects like a fan on a trailer nearby at the same distance but only 8 ft off the ground.  The witness then went up to the window to open the blinds futher and then looked and saw nothing more for one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same color light was seen again toward the southeast but appeared smaller (about a bbsize at arms length) and assumed to be further away and still above the building.

At first it was loud almost like an aircraft engine directly above us. Then it changed to a lower pitched sound and then after a few seconds it changed to a higher pitch, almost as if some thing was accelerating, then back to a low pitch before it beacame quite again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after that we heard a commercial aircraft in the distance which passed over our house as usual.  Not sure what it was but the sound was definitely coming from above and it came as suddenly as it stopped.  It did not sound like a vehicle or motorcycle we live on a fairly quiet street and now when cars pass by.<n>

Less than one block from our home, we turned off the side street and something caught our eye at the same instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the passenger seat of our pick-up truck and saw three large yellow-orange lights that appeared directly over several homes in our neighborhood.  The lights made a perfect large triangle shape.  They appeared to be just below the treeline.  From the angle I was viewing, I could see the lights (very orb like and very bright, but they were constant and shining straight down and not rotating). The object seemed to just hover right below the treeline. I could barely make out a rough outline of a large dark triangular craft. I would say the craft was about the size of two small homes, but I could not judge it&#39;s height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I saw it, my fiancee asked, &#34;Do you see what I see?&#34;  I asked him what he saw.  He said he saw three bright lights shaped in a triangular form and as soon as he said this, the object disapppeared, just seemed to be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not believe what we had seen, and when we got home, I immediately asked him to draw on paper the shape of the lights and told him I would do the same.  Our drawings were identical.  However, he said he could not make out anything but the lights but that it did just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee&#39;s truck window was slightly down and there was absolutely no noise.  This was on a clear night.  We live near Wichita, KS where there is a large airport and many flights cross our skies, but my fiancee and I have never seen an airplane with a triangluar form and lights that hovered and then as quickly disappear, with no sound at all.<n>

North sky going west to east.  Light traveling at slow speed for the first 30 seconds, very dim.  Light became very bright for 2 seconds then dimmed to almost nothing.  Followed the very dim light for another minute which suddenly sped up, grew extremely bright and glowing white, then grew dim once more.  Was only able to follow for this dim light for another few seconds.  Approximately 2 minutes later, a fighter plane coming from the south, flew to the west, in the exact direction of the unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was heading out of town (on the same side of the road as McDonalds). I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and immediately shifted my focus to the object. It was metallic in appearance and was shaped like a thick circle. It was moving at an &#34;unearthly&#34; rate of speed. The thing that most caught my attention was how fast it was moving. It was so close that I could hear sort of a seering sound when I rolled my window down. It appeard as if it was emitting heat (kind of like the road looks on a hot summer day - sort of a haze). I felt like the object must have hit the ground on the other side of the hill based on its speed and rate of decline. I have no explanation as to what this object was. It was travelling 3 times faster than a jet and was shaped like a thick, metallic plate. Almost looked like a weightlifting disk on a bench press. Its hard to estimate the size, but it was about the size of a nickel if I hold it straight out in front of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

1/9/07 07:35|Pontiac|MI|Sphere|20 minutes|..It split into two halves-like a "Pac-Man" mouth.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54830.html|277|ndxe200701| ..It split into two halves-like a &#34;Pac-Man&#34; mouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning is January 9th, 2007. Tuesday.  Went to work as usual except woke up with a lingering headache. This worked into feeling terrible like a bug had gotten me.  Was going to punch out right away but went to get coffee and waited to start feeling better.  I was parked sideways in the restaurants empty backlot staring into the sky towards our local Truck Assembly Plant.  There were some dim parking lot lights and some evergreens across the area.  The time was 7:35 or so and the Sun was not upvery high yet. Clear sky and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one overly bright star that caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again and stared. 20 degrees up and bright it was moving. As I looked into the SouthWest is was moving West to South straight across slowly for about 20 degrees  and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I was glassy eyed and head pounding and was trying to decide how good it would feel to fly into bed under a foot of covers. Today was freezing and Windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I squinted and looked again. The light was still there and now bigger. It looked intense like when I saw Venus thru the planetarium telescope. It looked like there was activity in its brilliance. Like a fire or something molen which was changing as I watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The was a thin horizontal line of calm thru the middle which the brilliance was around. As I watched the thing it grew bigger in roundness and brilliance. From the size of a large Michigan star to the size of three large stars. The light seemed to form a horizontal halo thru its center. It moved slightly back to the West and remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things are all happening slowly. It has been three or four minutes so far. The brilliance stayed the same for about a full minute and I started looking around the sky. About 3 or 4 fingers South of this and the same distance below it was another smaller light and it was motionless for about five or ten seconds after I noticed it. It looked kind of like Mercury when you see it far down on the horizon only a little higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind thought O.K. that really IS a star. O.K. now its moving- it is a plane. O.K. now it stopped right under the big one-which is going NOWHERE.---- At around this time I was wondering how this is happening and other things about this-like Good Explanations.  Maybe plane search lights-much bigger than normal-must be Police helicopters-no search light trail though.  No directional beam coming off it at all. If it was Police or Plant helicopters in the sky they hovered without motion way too long.  If it was aircraft and I was staring headlong into their searchlight the time was still way too long. The plane would&#39;ve covered a few miles coming straight at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began filtering thru many thoughts. Is this something I should notify about? Is it dangerous? Is anybody else seeing this? No-no one really looks up and it is still halfway dark out. Am I really seeing UFO&#39;s? Are they working with authorities or Who Care&#39;s. Could my head hurt anymore than this? The second light was not brilliant. It very definitely stopped right under the brilliant one-or-at least looked like it from my vantage point. This was a steady point of light which was staying-then-it moved slowly three fingers over to where it appeared right under the big one and stopped momentarily. It was ten or twenty seconds then faded off slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brilliant one was still flaring and now it looked like it sprang an arm of light out about half its diameter and a quarter of its diameter in width.Sticking right out at about one o&#39;clock to me. I had to scratch my head and rellok at it. What the-what NOW? It stayed that way for about twenty seconds then in the space of about a second, from the nine o&#39;clock point on it, split into two halves just enough to open like a &#34;Pac-Man&#34; mouth and again I could see a dark line forming thru the center of the diameter and disappear as the two halves closed up. As this was happening the whole light seemed to give a shudder or extra volume and brilliance then back to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it was motionless again and drifted slowly to a point behind a sparse evergreen limb where I couldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there thinking-should I pursue this? Can my head hurt anymore than this? I moved the van over about ten feet East and about twenty feet South and there was a light. It was holding steady and brilliant but smaller. There was now also an obvious small Cessna type plane in the area. It was far off in the distance. Maybe flying due South and climbing at a steep pitch because I remember thinking-wow-is he doing acrobatics? But right now? This early in the morning? The brilliant one was still there but small-seemed like holding there again. I put the van in gear and took off out of the parking lot towards the highway (I-75). In the right lane the paved shoulder stops there and traffic at the red light got me stuck. I looked and looked there but nothing left. I could barely hold my head up off the steering wheel. The time was 7:58 AM. Waited for traffic to clear and the one guy stopped behind me to pull around then drove into the fast food place right there and got coffee. After driving the mile back to work I paged my boss and punched out on the time clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I look back on this event of about six hours ago it is my feeling the lights were less than a mile away which would put them right over the Plant or Hotel next door. Everything written down in this report is my best recollection, albeit my flu bug and sinus headache. I work on an outside crew and look at the stars alot in the early morning but have never experienced this kind of thing before. In the aftermath of this I had that feeling of a Cheshire Cat grin like you just got lucky enough to experience something few people do. That feeling was intense for several days<n>

There were also airplanes in the sky since we were close to the air port. These lights seemed to be moving as if this was one object. They were very bright blueish/white lights. First there were 6-7 lights all looked the same brightness, same color, etc. We lost it as we got onto an area with trees etc. but when the sky became visiable again they were still there. they seemed to be about a mile away, and seemed to be going in the same direction that we were. We lose them again and did not see them any more while in the car. After we had been home approx. 20 min. I looked out at the sky toward Raleigh, the direction that we had come from. There the lights were. It was only three lights this time. it seemed to be slowing turning and heading back toward the north west. The lights seemed to be stationary on an object. If this was a solid object. from the distance it was from us it would have been 100ftx100ftx100ftx it appeared the size if eraser on a pencil. a this was about a mile away. flying very low in the sky. This was not a star because it was moving. I don&#39;t believe it was a plane. I have never seem those kind of lights on any plane. The lights were not blinking or any thing they (glowed) steady, without fading in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it seemed like it noticed that I was watching it, and it fliped like it was flying at an angle, and was moving very fast twords my car. When it turned to its side it had green and almost white lights, but they weren&#39;t flashing, or blinking, like some people describe it. The best way that I can describe it is that the lights were almost dancing in the air, they just flowed. I pulled over to the side of the road to make sure that this was what I was really seeing, It flew so fast. I started to panic, because it was just myself and my three year old daughter in the middle of the night, and sped up to get to the nearest public place. The craft followed me all the way to Quick Trip, where I was going to get out of my car to look at it better, but when I got out it was gone. This was the neatest and scariest thing that I have ever seen in my entire life.<n>

Just around 7 pm, I was driving my car north on highway 24 approximately 2 or 3 miles out of Newington, GA.  I was changing the station on my radio, which had a lot of static.  I don&#39;t know if this is significant, but it was more static than usual, even for our remote area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a bright green light to the east, falling at a fairly steep angle towards the North Carolina state line, maybe a little closer.  The light fell at a very fast rate, faster than any falling star I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was also larger than a falling star or meteor I have seen.  It didn&#39;t have a trail, so I highly doubt it was a comet.  It was visible for approximately 6 seconds.  I would assume that it was approximately 1000 feet in altitude.  It disappeared fairly close to the tree line across the field I saw the light appear above.<n>

Exact incident in Singapore|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54663.html|285|ndxe200701| Three lights or fireballs over Los Angeles, one was green, purple and blueish/white, at 7:40pm 1/8/07.  Exact incident in Singapore<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left work at 7:30pm on Monday and walked up Larchmont Blvd in Los Angeles.  When I got to the intersection of Larchmont and Melrose I noticed the sky lighting up towards the east.  One block east of me is Paramount Pictures and I figured it was filming (battle scenes for Transformers have been shot all over LA the past 2 months).  But the light got brighter and when I looked up I saw three things shooting down from the sky.  I clearly remember seeing green, purple, and a white/blueish color.  It got so bright I closed my eyes and it hit the floor.  Power on that street shut down (and just that street).  The floor shook and I remember hearing what sounded like an electrical voltage sound.  Besides Paramount Pictures, the area around me is mostly residential, including the section of Melrose that the light hit.  I saw several people walk outside to see what it was.  I also noticed that some cars stopped dead as if they ran out of power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later I saw the LAPD arrive but they had no sirens on... just lights and they were don&#39;t anything.  The cop cars (3 of them) just stopped in the middle of the street and the police officers just stood on the street outside the main entrance of Paramount looking at eachother.  Cars continued to drive up and down the street.  My bus arrived about 5 minutes later and I saw the cops and leaving and several black cars showing up.  I also heard some kind of aircraft in the sky.  Once before I had seen a black helicopter in the sky that only let off a humming noise instead of the usual noise helicopters make.  Although I looked around I didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home (Wilshire &amp; Western) I told my roomate that something wierd had happened and told him of what came out of the sky and he said he saw the same thing from outside our building.  He said he was texting someone from inside his truck and noticed lights.  He specifically recalled seeing 3 beams of light and seeing green.  He blow it off as electrical transformers blowing up (LA had a Santa Ana winds kicking up that day).  But from my angle and view, no electrical transformer could ever be has high as I saw those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something we both noticed a short time later were hazmat trucks driving towards Paramount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing on the news reported what I saw.  When I looked on the Craigslist, there was no talk to mention of what we saw.  And I know there were other witnesses because not only did I see people walk out of the restuarants and homes, but because it was in the middle of Los Angeles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day local news still had not reported anything, neither had the LA Times or yahoo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I found a story that on Sunday in Singapore people reported the exact same thing I saw.  3 beams of light or fire, most mentioned they saw green.  And the wierdest and scariest part that my roomate pointed out that I failed to look at, the Singapore newspaper story stated it happened at 7:40pm Sunday (they&#39;re a day behind Pacific time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t find any more information though.  Anyone else notice it?  Or can find a news report about it??<n>

One second it was there and the next it was gone like it just turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a very exciting viewing, but it was a clear evening (actually just before sun down) and it was there for 3 to 5 minutes, the blinking was at an unusual rate compared to the little ones you see on airplanes.<n>

Tonight it is overcast, no chance of seeing Venus. I was out walking my dog, very same scenario as 2 years ago. Suddenly a bright yellow-white light appeared over the Black Hills in the west. It looked as if it was either &#34;perched&#34; on the Hills or right over them, hard to see in the dark. It stayed there not moving. Then it disappeared for about a second or two and then again the light was there. It stayed a couple of minutes more and suddenly was gone- just like that, disappeared. It didn&#39;t fade away or look like it wad flying away, the light suddenly completely went out. As far as I know, there is nothing on that hill at all. I go out there every night and there is never anything there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked larger, brighter and slower than a jet airliner approaching.  I kept watching for it as I drove home.  By the time I got near home I could see that it had split into three unicolor lights hovering over the city staggered at varying elevations.  I pulled up to the house and ran in and got my wife to show her. The neighbor was also pulling up and she saw it as well. My young daughter may have seen them as well. At this point they were all amber colored lights with a slow rotating twinkle.  The three lights were hovering and slowing moving.  They were maybe 500 to 1000 feet in elevation, staggered at elevations maybe 200 feet apart.  The two higher lights were rising in elevation.  The top light started to fade and flutter out.  Then the middle light faded out and then the bottom light started to twinkle slightly more brightly and then started to flutter out finally dissapearing.  The air was quite cold at about 18 degrees F. The sky was fairly clear with stars being visible and there was a slight haze in the air.  The city light reflecting on the haze was enough that I think that I would have been able to see the shadow of an object once the lights went out, but the lights appeared to extinguish and then dissapear with no trace of an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t jet black; it was a dark grey in color and it moved *VERY* rapidly - I only saw it for perhaps 200ms (0.2 second) from the time it emerged from the limb of the roof of a neighbouring structure, crossed what little sky I could see overhead, and disappeared past the roof of the structure I was on the porch of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an aircraft in the area (I could hear the engines), but it was travelling in a south-to-north trajectory at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were mostly clear skies, and a temperature of 55°F at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was round, light yellow to white, it seemed to be at the height of a cruising altitude jet, but much larger than a jet (at that altitude a jet would look like a sewing needle with tiny flashing lights) this object seemed to be the size of a half dollar in comparison. The object was completely still for 20-30 seconds and then vanished (there were no clouds around the object when it did so). The object then reapeared about 40 seconds later, much further north, apearing smaller (dime size), was stationary ruoghly the same amount of time, then disapeared again.<n>

But it cruised right across the sky in about five seconds, from one side of the horizon down to the other. This was 2 AM, so it was in Earth&#39;s shadow, right? So why did it glow?  Anybody else ever seen one of these?  This was in Sabial County, North Texas, no lights anywhere. Everything is blocked off by hills and it was very faint. I keep thinking it was a satellite, but it was definitely towing something. I could see the connecting line. The tow line was about half a thumb long, come to think of it. Maybe an inch?  It was was all very bluish and faint. But it cruised right over the horizon from one end to the other, and the towed object swung slighly like it was on a pendulum bob.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Um, juast wanted you guys to know.

I saw a light and thought &#34;I don&#39;t remember a security light there.&#34;   because that is kind of what it looked like, without the pole.  We live in the country, so any unusual light would be noticed quckly.  It was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband, &#34;What is that?&#34;   He looked out, but didn&#39;t know either, but suggested that it might be a hellicoptor with bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was, I don&#39;t know, but it didn&#39;t look like that to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when it moved away the light was the same during the whole event.  In other words, if it had been a light on a aircraft I would have thought you could see the lights direction change, this didn&#39;t at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had reached over to put on my glasses to see it better when I looked back it continued to hover in the same spot, but then it began its move to the east.   I was facing North, and thought for a moment &#39;wow, that star is really bright&#39;, but then thats when it began to move, so it definately wasn&#39;t a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s probably nothing, but it did look odd.<n>

I work for a church and have never seen what I considered a UFO, though I do believe such phenomena exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jan 6, 2007 at approximately 11:25 PM, I was standing in my backyard when I looked directly southward into the sky and noticed what appeared to be brighter than normal airplane or helicopter lights. It was approximately 4 miles south and about 800-1000 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought maybe it might be a blimp coming in my direction so the display would be on its eastern facing side. But as I watched the lights I saw that it was moving faster than a blimp would and it seemed to turn to the west and sit stationary with 6-8 white lights in a circular to square configuration. The lights alternated from all white to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen numerous airplanes being situated in the airplane flight path to Sky Harbor Airport, I observe that most aircrafts have 2 flight lights in the center with one red and one green light on the end of the wings.  These lights I witnessed seemed more brilliant than normal and the manner in which it flew was unlike any aircraft I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to float in a circular pattern and also moved directionally slightly to the east and then west and up and then down before it turned and headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went inside to tell my friend to see this.  Her report has been sent in also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately came out and as I was describing to her what I saw, we both saw in the south west sky approximately 1-2 miles off, a glowing object seemingly hanging in the sky about 40-60 feet in width.  I don’t know if this was the same object or a second one as I had gone in the house for about 30 seconds to get my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t appear to be a helicopter or airplane.  It appeared to turn on its left side and I saw a bright singular light and 4-6 smaller lights surrounding it in a ring shape pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although dark in the sky, I could see that it was an aircraft with a shape unlike an airplane.  It moved without any engine sound or propeller sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed for about 10-15 seconds before floating westward quickly and silently.<n>

As it turned, it tilted downward and the light became less evident and its shape was more visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a circular aircraft with what appeared to have as one brilliant head light with a circular light pattern of about 6 lights around it.  The lights were mostly white and red, switching to either all white or just all red.  It was silent and did not make a normal jet engine sound or any sound that would indicate to us that it was a helicopter or airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in the Phoenix area we witness nightly, helicopters with spotlights.

I ran and got my wife and daughters and video camera  but the battery was dead. We watched them fly over in formation then a couple started overtaking the others.They looked just like the view of looking down on a gear cog. They had an orange glow and it was hazey at the edge. They were flying at approx 500 to 1000ft high and made no sound.We all ran to the back of the house and watched them fly into the Western horizon. Standing there bewildered as to what we had just witnessed I noticed another one coming from where the others had come from and was on the same course. I went inside to quickly get my binoculars and managed to get a closer look. It was just like an orange flying gear cog, I could not believe my eyes! 4 of us witnessed the event and have been watching the local news all day to see if anyone has reported anything. I have been interested in astronomy since I was a child and currently possess binoculars and a powerful telescope. I know the difference between planes and helicopters even flying at night, in fact we saw a couple of aircraft a few mins later and they were totally different and had flashing strobes.We are a very level headed family and I didn&#39;t even believe in UFO&#39;s but I&#39;m convinced now!<n>

It appeared to be almost over the neighbor’s house approximately 200 yards to the west (I will contact them tomorrow to see if they saw it as well.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I held out my arm fully extended with an old silver dollar that would be close to the size.  It did not travel at an approaching angle like a shooting star does. No vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say I saw it for about 4 seconds, I then ran into the house and shouted at my mother,  &#34;Look out the window, look out the window, look out the window!&#34;  She was on the phone with her friend And said, &#34;I have to go Doug does thinks there is a UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t even say there is a UFO she could just read my body language and my concern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She hung up and turned around to look through the window, and  &#34;of course&#34; by that time there was no sign off it.  However there were some obstructions such as an old vine and some trees in the path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is I have never seen a shooting star that big (and blue) and fly across the sky so horizontally to the ground.  I mean it was super close to the ground flying from north to south (I live 20 miles west of Portland Oregon). I usually see a shooting star leaving a trail, and this did not.  I mean it was HUGE!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the world is going nuts over what happened at O’Hare and I am not jumping on the bandwagon, but OMG I have never seen something like that.  It was also silent, therefore, it could not be some conventional jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, I know two people involved with the disclosure Project (I am not a UFO nut btw, well at least not till now). I call this a UFO Because I cannot identify it.  In addition, I was completely sober, just having a nice warm cup of green tea.  I am skeptical of just about everything, and I like to believe that nearly everything can be explained by science, and reason  this I cannot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness about his sighting, just minutes after it had occurred.  He sounded quite serious-minded, and we suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD))<n>
1/6/07 16:30|Boulder Creek|CA|Other|10-15 minutes|Bight point of light drifting slowly over the Monterey Bay 1/6/07|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54580.html|318|ndxe200701| Bight point of light drifting slowly over the Monterey Bay 1/6/07<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 16:30 on 1/6/07 in Boulder Creek CA I noticed a point of light very high in the south east sky at roughly 120 degrees by compass.  At first I thought it to be a star or planet but then realized it was much too early.  The sun, albeit low on the horizon, was still up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While laying on my back with a small pair of binoculars I watched for some 10 more minutes.  The object still appeared as a point of a bright white/blue light.  I couldn&#39;t hold the binoculars steady enough to make out a shape. At times it appeared slightly circular but I can&#39;t be certain of that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I briefly pulled the binoculars away to watch with the naked eye.  All this while the object was ever so slowly drifitng toward the northwest.  After perhaps a minute the object winked out.  I quickly resumed the observation with the binoculars and found that the single point of light had seperated into two points of light. These two points were moving away from one another.  Within the next 30 seconds I lost the visuals altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this might be a high altitude weather balloon so I started a search on the San Francisco/Monterey National Weather Service.  By chance I checked the the Short Range Composite Radar Loop and noted that there were 4 very strange echoes detected at frames 16:27 (PST), 16:37, 16:46, and 16:56 on the MUX radar.  The echoes were detected to the west and had a generally northern movement.  I couldn&#39;t save the radar images but I did manage a screen print of the 16:27 image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then checked the winds aloft on the NWS website and found that the winds from the surface up to 42,000 feet were all generally blowing NW to SE.  So if this was a balloon it had to be much, much higher in the atmosphere where the wind was blowing in the opposite direction.  I then sent an email to the Answers@NOAA describing the situation and if they might think it to be a very high altitude balloon. They had no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m sending this along to you.  Later that same evening when Orion rose over the horizon I tried using the stars Rigel and Aldeberan to estimate the approximate positions of this light and it&#39;s motion through the sky.  By this rough estimation I concluded that the object was first seen at about +5 degrees declination (above the ecliptic). It then drifted roughly -1 hour of right acension to about +15 degrees declination over the course of 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry that&#39;s the best I can do, and moreover I was home alone.<n>

1/5/07 20:59|Huntsville|AL|Light|2 sec|Rapidly moving object looks like it might impact ground|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54509.html|324|ndxe200701| Rapidly moving object looks like it might impact ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked west and up, I saw a light moving rapidly through the sky.  My first impression was that it was a satellite, but it was moving much too rapidly.  I have observed the International Space Station and it moved very slowly, in comparison. The magnitude and color (white like that of a satellite) of the light of the object was constant, and there was no tail behind the object, nor trail left in the sky following the object.  The object, at first, appeared to travelling roughly parallel to the ground, but as it moved away from me, it looked as though it had changed trajectory toward the ground and that it might impact somewhere on the Redstone Arsenal.  No impact was observed.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small aircraft was flying from north to south at the time of the sighting and the object would have been visible to the pilot through the right-hand window.  My vantage  point is high above the city (approximately 600 feet) and visibility was unlimited.  The sky was perfectly clear with good astronomical seeing conditions.  I would estimate the object to have had a constant brightness of approximately equivalent to a star magnitude of 3 to 3.4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that the object was a meteor, but its characteristics did not convince me that it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in a dark southern sky, falling toward the west .  It seemed to be a small airplane or helicopter with fire flaming from the rear of the craft.  We thought it would fall on the outskirts of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me, it seemed to wobble slightly before disappearing behind a hill.  The flames were bluish-green with flashes of red.  We waited, stunned, for a few seconds expecting to hear sounds of impact or an explosion.  Neither happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I witnessed a meteor was on the Deshutes River in Oregon.  It was a huge red fire ball which we believed would fall on us, but instead it flashed overhead and disappeared almost instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later we heard a huge explosion.  We later read an item in the newspaper stating that a meteor had exploded over the Willamette Valley and had disturbed some people.  The Deschutes River is on the east side of the Cascades more than 100 miles from the Willamette Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was not reported in the Prescott or Phoenix newspapers, nor did it get reported on TV.  I remain worried that what we saw was a small aircraft going down, which has not been reported.<n>

It was north of the moon and south of the dipper.  It was very bright even more than the moon.  I kept walking and until I heard a fant buzzing noise.  I looked back up at the star and what looked like a pin light came out of the star.   It was going back forth with quick speed.  It was headed south and crossed the moon 3 or four times.  As it was heading south.  I looked back toward the star and it was gone.<n>

I saw what I first believed to be a star.  However, about three seconds into looking at the star it disappeared.  I then noticed this same light reappear several miles to the Southeast of where I first saw it.  Then the light disappeared again.  The next time I saw the light was about five seconds later.  The light was almost exactly where I saw it the first time.  I thought this was odd flying for an aircraft, especially at this odd hour of the morning.  It almost felt like the object knew or sensed that I was watching it.<n>

What I saw was a ball of light near the ground just jumping all around. There was also another that would go above these trees and then just dart down below the trees as a search light passed by it. The search light was apart of the airport. Everytime this light passed the UFO darted around. The other light that was behind us was the real weird one. I accually have a video of it on my Phone. These lights stayed all evening and when dawn broke the darted off towards the east. The shape was just a ball of light. A circle that was as bright as a star. This was the wierdest thing I have seen. The object I saw was on the ground not landed but just hoovering over the ground the light just kept getting closer and closer so we backed off of it and waited till it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 11:45 on the evening of January 4th, 2007, I was just laying down for bed.  I happened to look out the window and spotted something that wasn&#39;t quite right.  My initial thought was that it was an airplane over McChord AFB.  We have constant overhead flights from the base.  After watching this object move slowly in a southeast direction towards or over McChord AFB I realized that it was not a normal craft.  This is what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was dark and overcast I was not able to discern an actual outline.  The object was probably 7 or more miles away on the horizon but it was pretty good size.  There were dozens of white lights that were constantly flashing (twinkling) in rapid and non-uniform fashion.  It almost appeared like the lights were moving rapidly in a circular motion but I cannot say for sure.  All of the lights were white.  Every aircraft I have watched fly anywhere in the area would have no more than 7 or 8 lights (multi-colored) on it at any time and if they flashed it was in a constant rhythm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this craft come to a stop and hover for about 30 seconds when every light shut off completely and it appeared to disappear.  I figured then that it was just something that could probably be easily explained and was turning to go back to bed.  After about 15 seconds of darkness the lights came back in the same position and the craft started to slowly move off in a southwesterly direction towards Ft. Lewis.  This lasted for about a minute when it sped off and winked out.<n>

At the same time I heard a helicopter flying over my home (there is a hospital trauma center nearby and the emergency helicopters fly over sometimes)..... I thought that was the helicopter, then the helicopter passed right above me and I realized the red light was not the helicopter.....the red light object I saw was not making that noise.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of bed and walked out to the balcony.  It was a very clear night and I swear that it looked like a bright light, steady, very bright, just staying in one spot over the hills..... probably for about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a space shuttle landing or possibly a plane that had exploded, but it was stationary and didn&#39;t move....so I knew it wasn&#39;t either of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there and all of a sudden it became a tiny white light (like a star) and dissapeared up and away towards the night sky until it was gone, almost instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that someone out there had to have seen this besides me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything like this and am kind of scared/interested in what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not use drugs or drink, I am 31 yrs old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

About 5 minutes after we passed though Chandler, we notice some extreamly bright lights behind us. At first we thought that it was another vechile pulling on to the hghway, until we looked behind us. Our intensions were to tell the driver to turn off his brights but then we realized that wasn&#39;t a car. We watched the item hoover behind us for a few moments then shoot off towards the south and disappear. We know this can&#39;t an aircraft from our panet becuase it was so low to the ground (no higher than 10 feet) but we felt no rumbling of the truck, and heard no air craft noises like that off a plane. Also when it flew off it flew much faster than any aircraft I&#39;d ever seen-and I see them everyday being in the military. This was undoubtingly a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two lights that appeared to be a kind of amber color.  I thought it was odd because the sky was totally clear but the lights looked like they were subdued by some sort of fog or haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my point of view the lights appeared to be either on the same vehicle or in perfect formation.  They looked like they were no more than 200 yards away from me at the most.  But it was moving so fast that it should have been making a whole bunch of noise.  Instead, it was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights moved off to the southeast they seemed to rapidly dim until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that there was no street noise at all.

On closer inspection with binoculars it is seen to have 3 lights, (a red, blue and white) which blink on and off, but not like airplane lights. It makes no sound and acts as if it knows it is being observed, which is one of the creepiest aspects of this. Then it begins to move ever so slightly as if it is hovering and has no noise. It remains stationary and then begins to change shape, getting less bright but the colors remain. It will stay like this for about 30 minutes longer before disappearing quickly. I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a good view of this from our kitchen window. Every night for a week in the summer of 2006 we saw it and it would come out in the same location but at a later time, around 11:30 p.m. and stay until around 1:00 a.m. I almost called the authorities about it but I assumed they would think we were nuts. My husband, the skeptic, was even intrigued by it and stood out in the back yard and watched it for 1/2 hour. Even he could not figure it out. My son and I were the ones who watched it tonight however,(1/5/07). It is always located in the southwest corner of the field behind us, eventually moving and disappearing suddenly to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius?

The objects or object was flying from the north and traveling south, no sound noticed with travel of object and was traveling very fast then everything vanished. I have seen stuff fall into the earth but nothing like this. whatever this was got me excited, this is one is for the x files.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was the smoke stacks that are part of the power plant located at St. Joseph City, but they were on the wrong side of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad, being ex military thought we were getting nuked. I tried to be rational about it and said maybe they put up a new smoke stack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I slowed the car from the posted 75 mph not wanting to stop because I had a court date to attend in Chinle, I looked more closely.  We both asked each other if we were seeing th same thing and we concurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about this time the bottom of the smoke trail began to light up like something was entering the atmosphere.  I compared it to the footage I saw of the shuttle burning up upon re-entry but on a grander scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fire/sparks died down, 4 objects remained.  They were red in color and were in a diamond formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smoke trail disappeared, but the four objects remained and no longer followed a free fall trajectory. They leveled off and continued their southernly route toward us appearing larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about to stop the car, three of them vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both strained to keep the fourth in view but it appeared to turn eastward and it too disappeared. Even though we had court to attend, it continued to be our travel topic all the way to court and on the return trip to Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a huge sceptic of UFO&#39;s,..... was.

It was close, traveling very slowly-I thought, too slow for a fixed wing aircraft-about as fast as a helicopter on approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopped the vehicle and raised my cell phone to get a picture, had it in the viewfinder, and it disappeared.

As it approached, I initially thought it was a helicopter because it was making a humming sound.  As it got nearer though, the sound was not as loud as I would have expected as it first seemed to look like one of those Chinook twin-propellor helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cylindrical in shape, with a very bright, white light slightly above either end of the aircraft. In between the two lights, a red strobe light moved back and forth between the two.  This was unusual for a helicopter, and it was also much larger and much quieter.  It did not move particularly fast and it was relatively low to the ground, at typical helicopter altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark, but as it passed near the moon (it was nearly full) I tried to discern the rotating helicopter blades to reassure me, however I did not see any.  This is also a remote area where we rarely ever see helicopters, particularly large Chinook ones.  It passed by me and over my apartment to the point that I could not see or hear it any longer.  From the time I first noticed the light to the point where it passed by was about 3 minutes in duration.<n>

There were four, rectangular craft flying pretty close to the ground. They were changing colors every few seconds all over their surface, except for a central, dark spot. We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car. They would zoom ahead and then slow down, often retracing where they had just flown. The traffic was really light, and we couldn&#39;t hear them making any noise, and we were pretty close to them. Then, they broke their formation suddenly and went in different directions, dousing thier lights suddenly.  We drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Student report.  PD))<n>
1/3/07 23:00|Marks|MS|Disk|2 Hours|Lighted objects silently flew in from S to N, many in northern sky, no more than few hundred feet up|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79492.html|349|ndxe200701| Lighted objects silently flew in from S to N, many in northern sky, no more than few hundred feet up<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this report will be filed for sightings on January 3-4, 2007, this is not the only sighting in this area by me and my family and friends. My parents, my sister, her fiancé, my cousin and I had just finished watching the 2007 Sugar Bowl at my parent’s house in Belen, MS, a small, unincorporated community not far from Marks, MS. My sister’s fiancé left just after the game ended around 10:45PM Central time. My cousin stayed for another few minutes and then got ready to leave. I walked out to his car with him and we were talking. I happened to look north over the empty field in front of my parent’s house when I noticed a couple of lighted objects that appeared to be hovering not far above the treetops over the woods about a half-mile or so north of the house. I watched them for a minute or so and mentioned the lights to my cousin. We first thought they may have been helicopters or planes, but there was no sound and little movement coming from them. Then! I saw one of them produce a faint beam of light under it. I told my cousin that it sure was strange that we couldn’t hear the helicopter engine. Belen is a very small rural community (population less than 100) and at night, except for occasional cars on Hwy. 316, everything is still and very quiet. I can easily hear a plane or helicopter engine when it is going across the sky. I then noticed a couple of planes in the sky and began to hear their jet engines. They looked totally different from the objects we were seeing. The silent objects we saw appeared to be lighted up very brightly, compared to the navigational lights of the planes we saw in the sky. The objects looked to be a mile or so to our north, and that is why I couldn’t tell anything about their shape at that point. The sky was very clear that night, and you could see all the stars and planes flying around. Belen is only about 75 miles or so from Memphis International Airport, but we could clearly see the differe! nces in the look of the objects that were lined up to the nort! h. After a couple minutes of looking at the objects to the north and commenting on how strange they were, we noticed a very big and bright lighted object to our west/southwest, moving toward the north. It appeared to be no more than 1,000 feet above the ground. These objects had white and (at times) red lights on them, but the lights remained constantly “on.” We went inside and told my parents and sister what we were seeing. They came out and observed them. My Dad said they were back again. He and Mom had been seeing them periodically since February 2006, when he said there were between 50 and 100 of the objects in sight at one point. I had not been around to see them until that January night. They had told me about them before, but I didn’t know what to think of their sightings before seeing them myself. My father, my cousin and I ended up driving toward the lights on a road toward the north. At one point we were no more than ¼ mile away from one of them which was crossing a field ! to our west (left). This was the closest I ever got to one of the objects. It made no sound and it had lights all around it. Looking at it through binoculars, I could make out a disk shape with lights all around it. Most of the lights appeared to me to be white and red. I believe if I had shot at it with my 30.06, I could have hit it, but I didn’t have a rifle with me. That particular object moved on toward the NE slowly and eventually turned off its lights and we couldn’t see it anymore. My Dad said he had tried to follow them before and when he would get into the same area as them, the lights would fade and you couldn’t see it any longer. Dad also said the first time he and Mom saw them, some were making patterns in the sky and moving around a lot, some slow, some very fast. This night, January 3-4, I saw a few of them line up with each other as if they were a column in the sky. Then slowly one of them would start to move out of this “formation.” We watched the objects al! l around Belen for almost 2 hours before they all turned their! lights off and/or moved away. I would estimate that we saw 2-3 dozen silent, lighted objects that night. The most I ever saw in the sky at one time was around a dozen. I have seen these lights, although in smaller numbers, at various times since then. Some were in the same location; some were further west of Belen, toward Jonestown and Clarksdale, MS. There in the Mississippi Delta, the land is almost completely flat, and you can see for miles if you are in an open area (which most of it is). I saw more in the summer of 2007, again on December 22, 2007, the night after my sister got married. We’ve seen more since I got married and have gone back home to visit, usually in the spring and at Christmas time. My parents see them fairly often. Although they have no clue what the objects are, they have come to accept them as a fairly natural part of their lives. My sister saw a few one night in late October when we were home because of my Dad’s surgery. The last time we saw any was last W! ednesday night, December 29, 2010. My wife and I saw two over the same trees to the north of Belen as we came in from visiting my grandmother around 7:30PM. Mom and Dad both said that after the first sightings in February 2006, the clocks in their cars were messed up. We didn’t notice any problems with the car clocks in January 2007, or after any of the other sightings since. My Uncle and Aunt live next door, but my Aunt dismisses what we have all seen as “silent helicopters doing maneuvers.” One of my best friends, who saw some of the lights in December 2007, has several years experience in the National Guard and has studied military aircraft for quite some time. He said these objects don’t look like or move like anything he’s seen before. The main reason I am writing this now is because I want people to know what we have been seeing and that there are some kind of unidentified lighted objects flying around the northern part of the Mississippi Delta on a regular basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no trail, just this dazzling blue-white light like you see in high powered lcd flashlights.  There was no sound, and the object did not fade instead it just blinked out, like it had gone behind a building or a hill, but where I saw it was at my house on top of a hill, where it would not have gone behind any other objects.  Definately freaked me out, as Ive never seen anything so random.<n>

It was located directly below Orions belt half way to the horizon and was the brightest object in the sky. I got a pair of binoculars out (7x35) to take a closer look and became intrigued. Through the binoculars the color changes were more prominent and I was convinced it wasn&#39;t a star. We had just gotten a new telescope over Christmas (Celestron) so I called my husband up (who is a total skeptic) and showed him thru the binoculars and had him bring the telescope out on the patio and focus on the object. What we saw left us both speechless. It was a spherical shaped object with a 2 rows of spinning color lights and an open center (like a donut). There were at least 5 different colors and they were spinning very rapidly. We don&#39;t have a video recorder, but did attempt to video it on our camera. I was so excited!! I called fox 11 news, and reported it on a different ufo sighting website. I ran and got my 7 yr old daughter and let her watch thru the telescope. I also called a friend that I was hoping had a telescope - but turned out not to have one. I then called the Griffith Observatory. The man who answered listened to my description and put me on hold. When he came back, he said it was just a star (the brightest one in the sky with an orange tint - and said it was called something like Orions dog?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certainly not an astronomer... but, since when do stars have holes in the middle and spinning rows of light? The object did not change its behavior other than drifting upward very gradually until I went to sleep at 930pm. It&#39;s too cloudy tonite for me to check for it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both Management level professionals in the healthcare field, and neither of us have ever seen anything looking like a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.

From the North-West, I noticed a bright white light in the distance. I thought it odd, because the light was much brighter than one would expect for an airplane. I kept watching the light aproaching while slowly moving through traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be moving slowly and on a level path to go directly over the Interstate. As it aproached I noticed it was more than one light. It apeared to be 5-6 lights in a row and the were pulsing in a left to right pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I looked around to see if anyone else was observing and several drivers around me were also looking in that direction and pointing, to show their passengers the lights. By now it was getting fairly close to where I was located and I could make out more definition of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights apeared to be circulating around whatever object was. I could not definately make out a shape, due to the highway lights and the orientation of the object to my vehicle. The lights were not only white, but seemed to posess an irridecent color shifting quality, with different hues of red, blue and possibly yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed over, and behind my car, I rolled down the window to see if I could identify what it was. Unfortunately, the angle of the crafts travel took it at an akward angle that I could not see, due to the fact that I was still trying to drive and watch traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice any sound, though there may have been. With many cars around me traffic possibly would have drown out any noise the craft was making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw, but it was unlike anything I had seen in the past. I am interested in finding out if anyone esle present on the interstate that evening will report it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it might be the Internation Space Station but it was a little smaller (we had just seen the ISS a couple weeks ago when it had passed over our city).  We continued to watch the object and then it started to make a left turn and start to ascend and then pick up speed and shot upward and then disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were coming up on a stoplight and I glanced up into the sky as a frequently do and I noticed what I thought at first to be an odd arrangement of stars. I asked my son what he thought and he replied those are not stars mom they are moving. I pulled over so we could get a better look and as it came closer we could see 5 red objects in a V shape formation. We all got out to see better. It was up very high..higher than a jet normally flies but it appeared even from that high up to be the span of half a football field in width. We could not tell if the objects were connected or flying solo but they did stay in a perfect V shape and did not appear to be moving seperatly from one another. There was no sound that we could hear either. The only object to change was the one in the lead and after a couple minutes started going from red to white. The other ones stayed red the entire time. It was going in a north eastern direction at a very sloe rate of speed. I have no idea what we saw that night, and I am no expert, but it caught my attention and I know it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the moon light to the left of the moon i noticed a jet steak, the jet streak was vertical not horizantal. At this point i knew something was up i thought how can an airplane travel like that? as i was traveling closer to exit 10 to the right of the moon away from the moon light i saw a light blue blinking light in the sky with a smaller light to the right of it, the color of the smaller non blinking light was either light blue or red. the lights were not moving they were staying still in the sky. the blinking light blue light reminded me of a camera flash, it was blinking every 2-3 secs. after i passed exit 10 and getting closer to exit 11 i was noticing that it was still not moving and i was about to travel under the lights i then started freaking out not knowing what would happen if i traveled under this object. as i merged onto exit 11 i did not see the lights anymore because i was traveling under them. once i got to the red traffic light at exit 11 about to turn right with 4 or 5 cars in front of me and several behind me i took a moment to look around and to the right in the distance out of the front passenger window i noticed the moon and the jet streak in the moon light. i then leaned toward the windshield over the steering wheel and looked up and towards the right of my car by where the park and ride at exit 11 is, i saw the bottom of the object. the bottom looked like a car grill or a grill you can cook off of, there were 3 or 4 lines and in between the lines were yellow lights. the object was bigger because it was at a diffrent hieght than it was when it was above the highway. after what i saw i started freaking out again the traffic light was still red and i was waiting in fear for it to turn green. once i parked at school i looked at ! the moon again but i could not find the vertical jet streak. or the object where i saw it before. that was the last time i saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> now when i look at the sky i always think that a star is moving or a cloud by the moon light is that jet stream i have become very paranoid and i always travel with my camera for evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound, moving very,very fast. Was visible from horizon to horizon. There were 3 witnesses, one of them an Ordained Minister. A digital photograph of the object was taken, and is available. There were no blinking lights or any other phenomena discernable by the naked eye. No contrails, no other aircraft in sky. Appeared to be very high in altitude, and the light seen may have been reflected sunlight.Picture shows a black aura surrounding object when zooming in on it, and white light has a striation of black coming from forward end to 3/4 of its length. White light is curved on both legs with one side shorter, giving it the appearance of a fishhook, with direction of travel towards the longer side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My commute home generally takes 2 hours because of the stop-and-go traffic on the 91 freeway, therefore I have plenty of time to observe more than just the back bumper of the car in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:45 p.m. (dusk) the sun had just set and the full moon was rising just over the north east horizon.  It was crystal clear sky.  The direction of the freeway is due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the lights in the sky of many planes/helicopters, some reporting on traffic conditions and others in a typical landing approach for near by airports, when a bright light (distant, but bright) caught my attention to the north, or out my driver&#39;s side window.  I know the difference between aircraft landing and strobe lights and a star.  This was more like a star in the sense that its light was consistent and its intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the left of me it traveled from as high as I could see (top of my window), to what seemed to be straight down towards the earth, but more like it was traveling beyond the horizon moving away from me and disappearing as it followed the curvature of the earth.  No trail was following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately question myself as to what I had just seen and tried to apply earthly logic to explain it away, but I came to the same conclusion.  It was not a plane, meteor, or star.  I did consider that perhaps it was a falling star.  I have seen falling stars on many occasions and the light seems to fizzle out as it is traveling and they appear (obviously) very high in the atmosphere.  It was not dark enough at that time to see stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this seemed to propel itself across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed as opposed to &#34;falling&#34;.  It was way to far away to see a shape, as I mentioned it was star-like, but there is something deep inside of me that knows it was either not of this world or a vehicle that is not known to the general public (if it is of this world).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the late 80&#39;s I saw the &#34;three orange lights&#34; type of UFO.  I can tell that story to if you care to know about it.<n>

It moved extremely slow south/southwest about 1/2 to 1 mile then stopped.  I could not have been a plane, I watched other planes fly passed and out of view.  What ever it was it was able to just sit.  I thought it could have been a reflection from the sun on the underbody of a plane but there were no such reflections on any planes that flew in and out of my sight.  Clearly the light was its own, weird.  Now that it is dark the sky is clear and there is no stars in the same spot. UFO<n>

It had gotten low enough for me to hear and see the wing span but I could not see the outline of the plane and it was afull moon last night. No trees no nothing was blocking my view. The sound was weird to it sounded like a one propellar plane but not nearly loud enough. It suddenly kindof hovered near me and took off, in the opposite direction it was heading. It went over the mountians, I tell you it was strange. The other thing is my dogs when something gets that close to us or a weird noise happens, they get freaked it was like they didn&#39;t notice it at all. The other thing is you&#39;ll prob think I&#39;m crazy but before this happened I was getting ready to take out the dogs and I saw something on the porch. It was a figure of a man and as soon I opened the door it took off, no noise just heard feet rustling through bushes into the field. I don&#39;t know if there is a connection or not but realy weird night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The red lighted craft went on fire. At that moment I got the most detail of it. I saw the reflections of the fire on metal with symbols. None ive everseen, The inflamed craft came down, In the feild. I decided since I have a phone with me, To take a picture of it. After the &#34;Click!&#34; of the picture, The fire on the craft engulfed the whole craft and vansished, With only one clue left. A peice of metal. Its symbol was what seemed like the alleged &#34;Crop Circle&#34; Shapes. I took the metal to a neerby cop (who was one of the witnesses) When he was examining the metal. It glowed a vomit-like green. (only the symbol was glowing) and the blue lighted craft flew overhead. The metal vanished like the ship. And the blue craft flew upwards, And went through the cloud layer without making a hole in the cloud! Normally, I wasnt superspicious, But now, This experiance made me belive were not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Note: The witnesses didnt give contact info]<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as a &#34;college student.&#34;  Possible hoaxed report, we believe.

It appeared at first to be a very bright star but when I got home I got a better look at it.  It appeared to change colors like a strobelight.  Blue,green,red,white,yellow one after the other over and over again,very fast.  This object appear to be slowly moving to the left and right while hovering @1,000feet.(assuming it was @the hieght of clouds) It also seemed to have spikes of light coming out of it (very symetrical. Well called a friend who called a friend with a telescope and rushed and set it up. We observed what looked like a purple ball(perfect circle) with a cell membrain around it.(no other star in the sky looked like this through the telescope) It was very hard to get a good view throught the telescope as it was moving. THere were many witnesses to this, many cars were to the side of the road observing this.  We also saw what appeared to be planes doing fly byes of this object and then circleing around to check again.  One plane (flying extremely fast) came very close to the object, we thought it was going to collide but then aircraft veered below it.  Have no clue what we saw but it was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius sighting?  PD))<n>

The car was facing in the direction of the Pacific Ocean (I live a mile inland) when I noticed a slow moving object with square or rectangular lights low in the sky appearing above the area between Pacific Coast Highway and San Joaquin Hills Drive over Corona del Mar (a suburb of Newport Beach, just south). I could not ascertain how far away the object was but it seemed close.  It was moving slowly and silently southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so shocked that I circled around and parked the car where we could get a better look.  It continued to move slowly and then seemed to go a little higher in the sky as it approached Newport Coast.  I reported this to the Newport Beach Police.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did find it very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 14:00 Hrs. (2 pm), my daughter pointed out a fast moving object in the sky through our skylight window.  We see a lot of high flying (assumed commercial) aircraft over our general area.  We also have a small airport over the mountain (to the east) from our home.  Normally the high flying aircraft travel from east to west, west to east.  The same holds true for the low flying aircraft in transit to and from the small airport nearby (save the occasional low flying personal aircraft either alone or with a glider in tow).  I grew up in the neighbor hood in which I now have a home so I am familiar with the normal flightpaths of the regular air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found particularly strange about this object was not only the direction in which it was travelling (from south to north) but the speed in which it was travelling.  You can normally watch a commercial aircraft (at high altitude) flying from east to west, wast to east, horizon to horizon for several minutes as it passes over. We viewed this object for only few seconds through the skylight and as it passed our view and as I exited the house through the back door, was only able to observe it for few more short seconds before it passed from my line of sight. In addition, the vapor trail left behind by the object dissapated very quickly whereas the normal trails left by high flying commercial craft seem to linger long after the aircraft are out of sight (really don&#39;t know if that is significant or not). As I stated previously, I don&#39;t know if this was an actual UFO sighting, but it was a very strange event. My daughter sees planes flying overhead regularly, but she was excited enough about watching this object as it sped over us that she brought it to my attention. If there is any info about any commercial flights on this paticular tragectory, I would be interested in hearing about it as it would set my mind at ease about the whole event. I should add that I am an amateur ! UFO enth usiast (I have never seen fit to report a UFO sighting) and would not want to waste anyones time chasing a false or easily explainable sighting.<n>

But I am a bit skeptical what I witnessed last night I am a bit scared and also embarassaed I almost contacted the police station here in town but.But I chose not to appear like an idiot or laughing stock because it was no longer in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:15PM I came home from work before I even walked into the apartment I looked up at the sky. I noticed the moon was very bright you can see little puffs of clouds in the sky here and there. I went inside grabbed my dog went outside so she can do her business. Looking north towards plainsboro/princeton a big bright fast moving light shot from south to north at an incredible speed I was so scared I thought something crashed in the corn field off old trenton rd I ran upstairs told my girlfriend and told her I would be right back I walked down the street thinking it was a small plane or something that crashed but there is nothing there. I was scared confused as I began walking back I just glanced over my shoulder to the side of me every now and then because I could not explain what I seen. Something caught my eye half way home to the north west of me I would say 5 miles or more in that direction I watched a big diamond shaped thing made up of lots of flashing lights but these lights seemed like they would fade colors similar to the effect you see from fiber optic tree light. It moved side to side slowly like it did not know which direction to go then the thing shot up to an altitude of about 2000ft just below cloud cover then made a sharp turn heading south so fast it penetrated the cloud then went straight up to the clear sky where all you can see is this amazing fast tiny light move around like a star then disapeared. Please I dont want anyone to think I am a nut or anything but to me this makes no sense I am beating my head trying to explain this I have one question what are you supposed to do when you experience something like this? the cops wont believe you if they do come out they will think you are a wack job. is not like I have a contact phone number for air traffic controller. I know someone else had to see this because they are always planes in the air flying above to philly and newark airports as well as mcguiress air force base so I would think if you where a pilot you had to see this not to mention people driving on old trenton road<n>

She turned of the car and shut off the headlights. 10 seconds passed, I was staring at the car when I saw the entire ground light up as if a bolt of lightning had struck within a 500 yard radius. My first thought was that someone was playing with a camera flash nearby because there were no clouds the sky was clear. I looked up and over towards Cassiopeia and spotted a huge glowing orange object. My wife ran over to where I was standing and we watched it flare up and settle into a consistent magnitude. Comparing it to a couple of stars, the object did not appear to move for the first 4 minutes or so. I ran and grabbed my binoculars and upon closer review, the object seemed to be spherical and above a 30,000 foot ceiling. I am assuming this because I could see a slight hint of atmosphere distorting the light. The event lasted approx. 6 minutes. At the end, the light flickered and faded rapidly. It did not look as though it was moving away, but rather that it lost its illumination much like T.V. set turning off in slow motion. From edge out, the light faded inward until only a small dot could be seen. The tiny dot then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an exceptionally dark night; usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn&#39;t either an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft; by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had four lights that I could see; two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door; I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house; the nearest one is about three miles south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I saw a third light come on very close to the other and in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of ECM flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then went off.  I could then see three flashing lights much like the strobes on standard aircraft.  One strobe light went east and one went west at very fast speeds.  If the altitude was 2,000 feet then the speed would have been around 500 mph.  I saw the strobes stop moving and reconverge on the first sight.  I then saw the strobes moving amost like playing tag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the next five minutes I could see the &#34;Landing lights&#34; turn on and turn off at random times.

I was driving east, about 30 miles away from eagle pass when, He goes, &#34;Hey, what&#39;s that up there, it&#39;s not a plane!?&#34;  I look, I&#39;m driving but I clearly see it&#39;s not a normal object, it fixed in the sky like a black dot.  We pull over off from the highway, and we use a digital camera that&#39;s not for taking distant pictures, yet we&#39;re still able to catch the black dot in the sky, it takes time finding it in the picture but it is there, as we were leaving a smaller circular object could be seen underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Size was indeterminate as it was witnessed off the coast and I had no point of reference to judge size or elevation. I estimate it was 2-3 degrees + off the horizon. No noise was noted, however surf conditions are semi rough and loud therefore I cannot speak if there was noise from the craft or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighting was mute, dull green on the outer area of the craft, no other point source lighting was observed. Craft was visible for a little over two minutes in a stationary manner after which it left over the horizon. Speed is hard to estimate, but the original subjective size (spacing my fingers across it&#39;s apparent width approximately .7 meters in front of my face) of the craft was approximately 100mm. It was reduced to invisible in approximately 2 seconds. I have no idea if that is significant but it seemed awful fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Perfect weather and clear skies.  My husband said &#34;look up, what is that?&#34;  The first one was round and black with silver lining.  It just floated above our house while we were outside for a new year&#39;s day barbeque.  It floated for about 5-10 minutes, then slowly went up into the clouds and disappeard.. the second one came about 5 minutes later.  At first it was round and silver, suddenly, it changed to a tube shape and turn gold, then it went back to being round and silver and had four round gold things spinning around it.  It kept changing back and forth and just sat there for about ten minutes.  Neither one of the objects ever made a sound.  Suddenly, several military jets started going over the house and the object floated up and disappeared.  I don&#39;t mean it disappeard into the clouds, I mean it actually disappeard, like a cartoon.  When my son and I turned around, we saw a black object coming straight down from the sky into a field across the street.  It came down really fast and kind of looked like a person parachuting, but with no parachute.  It actually looked like a tall black object with two legs, like a human, but the upper body was not clear to us.  No one else saw the third &#34;thing&#34;.  I really can&#39;t describe what it was because it came down so fast.  The military jets continued to fly around for about half an hour and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several people in my family were outside that day, but only a few of us will admit what we saw.<n>

The object was above me, it was a disc with lights around the edges, though it also appeared to have red and green lamps like a normal aircraft.  it moved at almost a jog, 10-15 miles per hour.  it continued away from me ..then slowly banked towards Tampa, home of centcom. It then accelerated to a very high speed, and was instantly gone. the object flew slower then any modern aircraft. any known. It accelerated in a way that is impossible for a normal aircraft.i have noted that it resembles an x-47b with a rounder shape...and is also similar in size. the recent pics of an x-47 being moved, under a cover , with wings removed... was a very similar shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

So I thought &#34;maybe this is a bird&#34;. But then the birds flew next to it, and they did not look similar at all. Then I thought &#34;maybe this is a kite&#34;, but the area that it flew over was too big for kite range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered over an island in the distance at the beach, it changed shapes, going back and forth, scanning the island. At some points it was compleatly still. It would morph from a cashew shape to a pill shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one craft that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shapes would change, it was black or a very dark color. After the craft was done scanning this island, its shape got skinny and shot into the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background was just sky, and a little island, there were no trees in the way its a compleatly open area at the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some people in cars but I dont think anyone was looking at what I was looking at, from their point of view there might have been a tree in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were Airliners heading towards Heathrow and Stansted Airports and it was much higher than the planes and moving in the opposite direction. I told my wife about it and she saw it too. It was too distant to see within 3-4 minutes of initial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also remember saying quick we better check the news, there was a fear of we where being invaded..  there is something chilling about this encounter and as time goes on we are constantly reminded of things, little pieces of this puzzle come back to us with startling reality..  we also have had another dream at the same time as we slept and when we woke in morning we told the same thing to each other that there was something with long fingers coming to get us, we both put it down to Freddy crougar type nightmare..   this Freddy crougar dream happened in my fiancée’s house five years ago. this airborne vision was only 3years a! go .. there was no sound we can remember.. I think 1’m going m! ad.. I u sed to have a good memory , now I feel my short time memory has had something done to it and also I find facial recognition hard  in my short term memory ..I am beginning to think I’ve been brain washed. I periodically have dreams that something is at me or coming for me and I cannot open my eyes, I keep fighting this to no avail . eventually I can open my eyes  . these dreams come on for no reason, I feel helpless and I cannot move no matter how hard I try, its like my eyes are glued shut but I am conscious and aware of something being there. Please let me know if anyone else has experienced these things as we have and I still do..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an auto technician until I hurt myself in an accident, I have an average education, I have all these things in my head about stuff I should know nothing about, I have emailed professor Stephen Hawking about these things,, I am yet to have a satisfactory answer, I have also emailed Ronald Mallett, Professor at the University of Connecticut.. I have yet to get a reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  do not know why I know this stuff or at least know how to question the things I do, I am no physicist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> yours sincerely<n>

I then noticed a sphere/disk shaped bright light, making a strange patern under the water.  The scale of it compared to the docks and boats, makes me think it couldn&#39;t possibly be a boat.

I kind of looked like the old star trek ship in the old series.<n> <n><n> <n><n> well this thing was about the same size as the bomber.  At first I thought I was crazy but then I quickly asked my mom if she saw that thing, and she told me that she did and she was just as amazed by it as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I saw the english version of the parade on channel 5 and the didn&#39;t catch on theyre channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So maybe if you can get the recording from the parade on the channel 34 los angeles i think you will definitely catch it to. call me back I would really like to see you investigate this thing.

At 2:15 AM she woke me and asked me to come downstairs to her den. As we looked out of the window (facing east) we saw lights (sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes four) rotating above the trees. Something seemed to be hovering, moving slightly from side to side....the lights seemed to be oval shaped and I could sense an aura or kind of jet stream as the lights continued to spin. They would speed up and slow down from time to time. I sensed it to be very close to us, but my sister felt it was further away, towards Jennerstown area. We watched it for at least twenty minutes, and suddenly it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then another light appeared out of no where and joined the other object, circling it a few times then disappeared behind another range. It looked as if they were &#39;playing&#39;- we watched for a good 15 minutes as they would move straight up and down and then sideways, at one point I thought I spotted a third but it was so difficult to tell because it appeared so dim- They would pulsate, these objects would get very bright and change almost like a rainbow of warmer colors red yellows etc. They did get very dim and disappear and then reappear very bright or fade back into view, very strange, yet very exciting- I would have sat there forever but the boys in the backseat were so scared they were getting sick to ther stomachs-Sounds silly but I though well If I can see them this clear they must be able to see my headlights, so I jokingly flashed my head lights on and off a few times  but what happened then really freaked us all out- both objects shot out in a perfect line up as if someone screamed at them to stop- I started to drive and the objects slowly followed us around the ridgline for about 20 seconds then one stayed with us for apprx 2 minutes as if Peeking at us from behind the mountain-  I am still bothered that I could not sit there forever and watch- We tried to capture them on video but it was sso dark It justwould not focus so far away :-(( I want to go back I want to see more I guess! I reall y want to know what the hell I was watching  out there- We have seen a lot of the same type things in the skies in this  same general area, but never this close or vivid in the past 4 years - we go camping and hiking almost every weekend rain or shine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I suggested we would park on the side of the street for a minute suddenly when we stopped the light stopped and pointed right toward us so then i was joking around and said wouldn&#39;t that be scary if it backed up in mid air which planes can&#39;t do  and suddenly it backed up in mid air and drove the other way quicker then what a plane could do.<n>

I was the only witness to this event that I know of (no one I know made any mention of it, anyway), though anyone could have seen it, provided they had the right view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 12:11 AM on New Year&#39;s Day, 1-January-2007, I witnessed a single, strangely bright, white light in the sky north of Cedar Falls, Iowa.  At first, I thought it was either an airplane or an unusually bright star.  I realized it wasn&#39;t an airplane when I noticed that not only were there none of the telltale noises of an airplane, but there were none of the characteristic blinking lights either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My suspicions of it being a star were disproved when it slowly began growing in size and moving slightly upward, as if whatever it was moved closer to my location.  It stopped where it was after about 20 seconds, and at this point it was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm&#39;s length.  It hovered in the same position for about 40 seconds.  It then moved slowly to the east for about 5 seconds, before moving first up, then down, all slowly.  It returned to its original height, then moved back west to its original position.  It stopped again, then moved west and began the same process once more: up, down, middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It returned to its first stopping position once again, and repeated the same ordeal, moving up, then down, then middle.  It then began moving slowly to the east once more, and when it stopped in the same position it had before, I thought it was about to repeat the whole thing over again.  But after sitting still for about 15 seconds, it began moving fairly quickly to the southwest, which, from where I was standing, almost seemed like it was just circling around the east side of the city and heading south.  It became obstructed by houses and trees at that point, and although I continued to watch for it, I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we looked up we noticed what looked like a whole swath of stars that were amber in color were travelling in a column, we watched them for about 13 to 14 minutes.  I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me and managed to hand the binoculars to everyone in our party.  From what I saw, when I had my binoculars were these objects were spherical in shape and were slightly pulsing in 1 second intervals.  Some were swirling around one another.  At the end of the 13 - 14 minute window I saw the objects gather in a swarm on the horizon and split off, one part of the swarm going right the others going left with only a couple going straight up and disappearing.  A few minutes after the sighting I noticed a couple jets in the vincinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our party had one amateur astronomer and one fireman.  Our astronomer states they were not stars or airplanes. Please contact me if anyone else has reported anything of this sort in the area. Every person in the party is still stunned from this experience as am I, we need to know that we are not crazy.<n>

1/1/07 00:01|Windsor|CA|Light|10 min|Series of 17 unidentifiable lights cross the skies of Northern California.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is aviation specialist.  PD))|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54389.html|438|ndxe200701| Series of 17 unidentifiable lights cross the skies of Northern California<n> <n><n> <n><n> At midnight, Jan 1st of 2007, we stepped out on the deck for New Years and observed a bright Satellite moving Southeast from the Northwest. Magnitude was as great as Mars at it&#39;s closest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 more appeared behind the roof into view, so we stepped out to see if there were more moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 17 lights in total, all within 70 degrees of each other moving South-East from the North-West.  All were the same brightness and color. A bright Orange to reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first 3-4 moved through the 12 o&#39;clock(meridian) they started to change course. A few slowed then turned about 90 degrees and out of the path, then a few faded and made a left 270. 2 actually stopped, as noted against a clear sky of stars and a bright moon. All in all, about 7 or 8 &#34;danced&#34; overhead, the rest continued on course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I recalled we had just bought a new video camera so I ran in, grabbed it and shot the last few minutes of the &#34;satellites&#34; continuing across the sky.  At this point, pretty much all those that had not faded were continuing SE bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since moving into the country from the city 5 years ago, watching satellites and meteors has become one of my families evening pastimes.  We are quite adept at this pastime now and can identify the difference between Satellites, Space Station, Etc. and Aircraft.  And I have spent the better part of my 36 years, watching aircraft,  As well, I am employed as an ((deleted--aviation specialist.)).  So something like this event really stood out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no contrails visible as they would have been with the moon as a backlight. There were no stobe lights or red and green wings lights as associated with A/C.  There was no sound associable with these &#34;satellites&#34;. The time for the &#34;Non Dancing&#34; lights to traverse the sky was about 9 minutes, the same as a satellite or the Space Shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quiet check of the net did show that the prevailing winds aloft were moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighted Weather Balloons?  ROV&#39;s?   I truly hope someone else who might have noticed these lights will also report something.<n>

We went outside of our Windsor, California home to ‘ring in the new year’ and saw dots in the sky.  They looked like they could have been stars, but there were too many of them and the Milky Way does not look like that.  Each of them were yellowish color and they were all identical.  There were approximately 30-50 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband to go in and get the video camera, but it could not record the dots.  They just seemed to be hovering but then they would move into various formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given there was some fireworks in the western skys, we thought about that, but there was nothing in the vicinity of the dots.  Then we thought of the possibility of planes, but there were too many for that to  be the case.  We are astonished.  What are they???<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly started to move from south east in various directions again, so we went from our back yard to the front yard and they were almost all gone accept for a few that were going into formation, four of them in a straight line.  Then, nothing. It was like they just disappeared.  No way to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So strange!  Any thought as to what it was, or any other sightings??<n>

There were six to seven in a row forming two parrelel rows.  They were moving across the sky, and then clustered together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once clustered, they all moved off into the sky where they couldn&#39;t be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like it before!<n>
