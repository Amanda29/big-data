The craft made absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the week of August 30, 1999, my friend Laura and I were visiting Matthews, NC, a suburb ten miles south east of Charlotte NC. (We’re from Spartanburg, SC, approximately 60 miles south. I (36 year old white male) have worked in law enforcement for fifteen years and Laura (30 year old while female) has been a school teacher for eight years.) On Tuesday August 31, we attended an outdoor concert in a park located approximately three miles east of Matthews. As the concert ended, around 2330 hours, Laura and I headed toward the parking lot with approximately thirty other people. We were between the park and parking lot, in a wooded walkway area, when all the lights – in the park, wooded area, and parking lot – went out. Everyone stopped in their place to let our eyes adjust to the darkness and someone said something about a power failure. I then noticed something – like a shadow – over my shoulder. (The sky was clear with a quarter moon. The moon, however, was not high in the sky yet.) I turned and looked directly up. Floating above us, approximately 150 feet up, was a huge, black craft. The two front sides of the craft were triangular, but the back side was wing shaped. The craft was at least 100 yards wide (wing tip to wing tip) and 50 to 60 yards long (front to back). (All of these measurements are based upon the height of the trees and light poles we saw the craft pass over). I said loudly enough to make sure everyone heard me, &#34;Look up.” As everyone looked up, there was a group gasp. This craft FLOATED above us (from east to west) and out over the parking lot. The craft made absolutely NO sound. There were no lights on or around the craft – it was completely black. A man standing in front of us had a video camera. He attempted to video the craft but his battery had died. I grabbed Laura’s hand and moved quickly into the parking lot to get a better look and the others followed us. The craft traveled over the lot and then turned north, away from Matthews and Charlotte. As the craft moved away, all ! the ligh ts in the lot came back on and we could no longer see the craft. (The craft was visible for approximately 15 minutes). I grabbed Laura’s hand again and pulled her toward the car. She did not want to moved and I then realized she was crying. She asked where we were going and I said I wanted to follow the craft. I finally got her into the car. As I looked back to the other people, I saw that most of them seemed to be very upset. Some, including men, were also crying. I attempted to follow the craft in the car, but not being familiar with the area, quickly became lost. We never saw the craft again. I found my way back to the parking lot. Now there were 70 to 80 people in the lot. (Some of the others had been elsewhere in the park when the craft went over and had followed it’s direction to the lot.) Everyone seemed calm again. The man with the video camera now found it working again. Another man called two radio stations and reported what had happened. The radio people listened politely but didn’t seem too concerned. The man then called a local television station. When the television person heard what the call was about, she hung up. A group of us stayed around and talked for a while and then went our own ways. I asked Laura if the craft had scared her enough to make her cry. She stated she wasn’t scared but felt very emotional. She also couldn’t understand why I wanted to chase the “thing.” This was the first time either Laura or I had seen any sort of strange craft. She was never interested in UFOs before but I always have been. The next morning we checked the news – television, radio, and newspapers – but there was no mention whatsoever of this event.<n>

Many such reports are evident in the database.  If, in fact, the objects described here were traveling to the southwest, they almost certainly were not satellites, since almost never do orbitting objects have a westerly component to their direction of travel.  However, the direction of flight described here may be an estimate.  We cannot be certain of the objects&#39; direction of flight.))<n>

There were about 8 or 10 more of them in 5 minute intervals.  I believe that they were a craft being launched from a larger craft.

Then, the fire burned out and they disappeared.<n>

It was not a steady line of travel and it circled around.My son acted like a plane that was dragging a banner.  After a short time of its circling over head, two other lights with a red glow began following it.  Where ever the large light went the other two crafts followed behing it.  Then all of a sudden the two crafts just seemed to join the large craft and became just one.  Also about a month ago, while sitting on my porch, I witnessed to large white balls of light, that just seemed to explode and then would show up on my left and explode again.  This was in my hometown of Fillmore, NY--50 miles south of Buffalo.<n>

I am not sure of the exact date of my sighting, but it was about 22:30 on a summer evening and it was very possibly 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on the beach (very dark) at Golden Beach Campground with my father, (we were viewing shooting stars and had on a different visit witnessed a very bright flare, or flash from a iridium satellite, now defunct) we were able to see a airplane with lights making repeated large oblong circles over the mountains.  The plane was south of the lake, in the general direction of Sagamore, or Cedar River Flow to Moose River Plains, but probably was only a few miles from Raquette Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity made us very curious and we watched very closely as the plane continued the loops.  Finally, a similar plane entered from the east and closed the distance on the initial plane.  The second plane was now trailing the first one by a very short distance and was following an identical pattern.  This remained the situation for quite a while, only now they flew off into the distance. (Subsequent conversations and internet searches have led me to believe that they were military planes that were practicing refueling maneuvers over the desolate and isolated Adirondack Park)  An hour or so later, one of the planes flew extremely low over the the main street of the campground (and it contiued west over the lake) as I stood in the street between campsite 13 and 18 and the plane did not appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

Then we realized that if you look with out blinking you would be able to see it move in small cirlces.The UFO was flying East-South. Every time a passeger plane flue by it the UFO seems to freez in one place. The UFO had some blue laser light above the craft and it looked like an anttena. From the leftside of the craft it had a short bright red beam. The UFO wasn&#39;t flying smoothly, it kind of moved liked a kite (back,forward,up and down). The blue light anttena started moving under the UFO and began moving higher until the light around it started to fade away.<n>

But tonight it came closer and we could see three lights in the shape of a triangle.  It circled our house for awhile.  It seemed to hide on the horizon and when I went outside to let the dog in from the backyard it came up towards me.  I didn&#39;t hear a sound the whole time.  We live right by the main international airport and we also live by the military base.  Is this a new aircraft they are trying?  It hovers!  It sits in one place for a while (3 minutes, 15 minutes, hours...  then with no warning it flys.  It flys like an airplane, but I get the sense that it, or they can see me because it reacts to me when I go out of doors!  Very strange!  Have seen similar triangular lights following jet contrails in the sky throughout the summer!  I pulled my husband out twice to look because I didn&#39;t want to think I was seeing something that could be explained away as a regular aircraft.  The oddest thing about this experience was that there was no sound at all the whole time!<n>

But it did flicker several times for a very brief period. One of the times it flickered myself and another witness noticed the lights in our backyard dimmed as if the power was about to go out. At the same time, my brother who was in the house, stated the television and cable box had shut off. The object finally disappeared from our view by flickering one last time and slowly faded into the night sky.<n>

At the time of one the flickers, myself and another witness observed the the lights in our backyard dim in sequence with the flickering light in the sky. At the same time my brother who was inside the house told us his T.V. and cable box had shut off. The object moved very slowly towards the north. It moved so slow we hadn&#39;t realized it had moved until we all were looking at the object at a different point in the sky. The object finally disappeared from our site after about 15 minutes. It began to dim again and slowly faded from view.<n>

It was very black and the sun seemed to reflect off the front every now and then. There was no noise. I observed this from the airport fire station were I am stationed. It was going in a direction that the usual aircraft flight pattern comes from. It looked to be about a quarter mile away when first noticed at 340 degrees. In about 1 minutes time it seemed to be at 270 degrees and about 1 mile away. I had to leave then when a fire run came in. The next day I compared what I had saw to a black huey helicopter. The sphere was very black unlike the huey and might have been up to 10 feet in diameter as it was smaller than the helicopter at a comparable distance.<n>

I was looking thru my 8mm camcorder, which is looking thru the scope at 48X magnification (not too much).  The moon was East/SouthEast at the time.  The approximate point in the sky of the moon was Right Angle 0hr15.0m and Declination -3*37 degrees.(I couldn&#39;t find the degree character on my keyboard). I then see a round object with no lights or distingquishing marks move across the face of the moon in a straight type of motion. It made no sound, no strange anything at all, just a round/disclike object going across the moon.  I am highly interested in UFOs and such, so I immediately thought it was strange. I was recording, so I have it on tape.  I still wanted to mess around and see what I could get on tape of the moon, so once again I started to look at the moon as I had done just a minute or so before, and I SAW THE SAME THING AGAIN, GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION!  I don&#39;t know if it was the same object or a second one, but I did see 2 round dislike objects, at 2 different times, which had no lights or anything, they were just round, black and moving across the face of the moon. I couldnt tell how far away these things were, and I didnt have a chance to see them with the naked eye.  I was recording when I saw them, so I have them both on tape. I will try to send you a vhs copy of this event. I do not claim this to be a spacecraft, or meteor, or satellite, or meteor, or anything else.  I am just a amatuer astronomer who saw something weird.   I have tried to use some deductive reasoning to come to some conclusion.  And my conclusion is that it simply is a UFO.  No doubt about it.<n>

Lit up whole backyard. At about 20 deg due West from Zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking up at the sky at 8:40 PM PDT viewing an aircraft with strobing white lights, I experienced an extremely bright white flash to my right lasting about 1 second from a pin-point in space that lit up the whole backyard. It was located at about 20 deg due West from Zenith (straight overhead). With my arm fully outstretched, this came out to be about five fist diameters from straight overhead and moving straight west. My right eye just happened to be centered over this spot in the sky and I was able to see the flash move from this pin-point of light to an adjacent star about five star diameters away to the south. I was facing southwest when this event occured. It may be my imagination, but I thought I heard a slight buzzing at the very moment of the flash. (You know how your mind simulates sound when it sees a sequence of lights? Well this is what I mean when it may be my imagination). This is the third time during the past two months that I witnessed such pin-point flashes coming from the sky. The other two occurred within a minute of each other and was just due east of Zenith at about midnight. I was looking out of my kitchen window at the sky (as I do every night during at the top of the hour during Art Bell&#39;s program) and I saw this flash. It drew my attention to look in this area closer and I saw another flash from the same spot. Since it has been about two months, perhaps this part of the sky is now 20 degrees due west of Zenith where I saw last night&#39;s flash. I will keep looking.<n>

August 28th) when my husband tried to draw my attention to what he thought was a satellite travelling across the darkening sky. The sky was clear, with no haze or clouds to speak of. I had trouble locating the object initially, but he persisted until I saw it too. It was a small yellow light, not unlike a distant star, but was moving steadily across the sky on what appeared to be a satellite orbit path. However, seconds after I laid eyes on it, we both watched in amazement as it suddenly stopped dead in it&#39;s tracks. Almost instantly, it changed direction 180%, back-tracking on it&#39;s orginal path. About three seconds into its new path, it flashed very brightly, at LEAST 10 times as bright as it had been originally, and moved rapidly upward in an arching path, fading from our vision within four or five seconds. It did not re-appear in the next 5 minutes, and we came in to report it somewhere, which I guess has turned out to be here! It was a very exiciting and unusual experience, as the flight manouvers of the object were hardly typical of a conventional aircraft! Please let us know via e-mail if others have reported this object, or if there is a simple explanation for this unusual phenomenon. Thanks!<n>

I noticed in the Western sky a slow-moving oblongular object that appeared to be heading South in direction.  If I had to guess I would say that it looked like a comet or shooting star in the daylight.  As I kept watching this object noticed that it stopped for an extended amount of time.  (probably 3-4 minutes)  Then all of a sudden it shot off much quicker than it had been moving before in a Northwesterly direction.<n>

It looked on the order of a huge parasail  or parachute (curved top and not so high considering the long body and a slight curve to the ends.)  Our home looks down on the city and up at the mountains.  We see planes all the time but this was nothing like a plane and several times larger as well as the fastest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I had a camera on the table and just didn&#39;t even think to pick it up.  My mind just didn&#39;t know how to take this in.  Here it was in broad daylight!  Not a disk  like on TV but a huge long object that just sailed through the air.  Surely others had to have seen this aircraft.. We&#39;re rather excited that we got the chance to witness it. That&#39;s about all I can really tell you.<n>

Looking out the car window I noticed birds flying eraticly into trees. Just then My father and I noticed a Very bright silver ball wobbleling across the sky infront of us. The object was bright silver Round or sphereical with a belt of slightly darker silver acrossit&#39;s equator region. It wobbled like crazy but flew in a straight line. We lost sight of it as it passed behind a tree and then a building. At that time the light changed and we spead to our driveway to catch it as it passed over my back yard(which was in it&#39;s flight path).  But it never passed! it must have excelerated or disappeared. It could not have landed because there are to many houses in the area, I asked around and we were the only ones who witnessed it.<n>

Obviously I would have a long time ago if I had planned to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the National Geographic Channel last night (history of UFO&#39;s) and something said there really struck me.  A female witness to the 8 o&#39;clock sighting of the large &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; shaped craft in the Phoenix area (I believe it was one of the first sightings of the Phoenix lights) said that the underside looked like compartments, similar to stores at a mall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In late August, 1999 my wife and I witnessed a huge craft in the night sky above Cayey, Puerto Rico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a Chief Cryptologic Technician attached to Naval Security Group Activity, Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico from August 1997 to July 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in Cayey for the entire period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had attended a party at the Chiefs&#39; Club on the base and arrived home at approximately 2am.  My wife had driven home and had not been drinking.  I had a few, and didn&#39;t want to drive the 30+ miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We parked in the driveway and my wife was first out of the truck.  On the sidewalk she stopped in her tracks, as I caught up with her, she said &amp;quot;please tell me you&#39;re seeing this&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, I saw a huge craft in the sky to the west, directly over the city. The craft was at least a mile across.  It was at a very low altitude, 100-150 feet above ground and was well lit by all the city lights. When I first saw it, it was at a range about a mile or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly drifted toward us, heading east.  As it approached Highway 52 (4 lane Autopista), it slowed and came to a complete stop.  Then it rotated from an easterly heading to a north-northeast heading. I could then tell that it was shaped like a huge &#34;V&#34; and not a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it rotated, the &amp;quot;wing tip&amp;quot; passed directly over one of the highway lights.  The lights are 40-50 feet tall, and the highway is no more than 50 yards from where we were standing.  Our vantage point was about 30 feet higher than the road surface, at the base of a large hill, on the east side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the tip of the right wing passed over the highway light and stopped, I could see detail on the underside. It was a dark grey color, nearly black.  I was taken by how &amp;quot;boxy&amp;quot; it looked, not aerodynamic at all.  There were several compartments and metal reinforcement structures that I could clearly see.  There were no windows and no lights that I saw.  The wing appeared to be 15-20 feet thick from top to bottom and massive in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been around many aircraft in the military (C-5&#39;s, C-17&#39;s etc.).  Before the Navy, I worked for an in-flight catering company at Anchorage International Airport (Anchorage, AK) and have been in, around and under everything from a 747 to a DC-8.  Nothing I&#39;ve seen before even comes close to the size of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After rotating, it stayed motionless, but only for a few seconds.  It then started moving forward, slowly at first, then accelerated very rapidly and vanished into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted 12-15 seconds.  The craft made absolutely no noise. We were frozen there, motionless and speechless.  We couldn&#39;t have gotten to a camera, even if one of us had thought about it. We stayed awake the rest of the night, talking about what we had seen.  Predictably, my wife saw some things that I didn&#39;t (lights), and I saw some things that she didn&#39;t.  I know that I became fixated with the underside of the wing above the highway light, and didn&#39;t look at the rest of the craft again until it started moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It sounded like it could have been a half a block away. The sound occurred just after I had seen a &#34;shooting star&#34; pass overhead from the south traveling north. The sound continued for about a minute and I looked up in the direction of the sound to see a chevron-shaped, pale blue-ish lit object passing overhead. It was traveling at a great rate of speed with the sound accompanying it, in the same south to north direction as the &#34;shooting star&#34;. Then in the blink of an eye it and the sound disappeared.  It was chevron-shaped with individual pale blue or ultra-violet lights in precise and equal distance from one another forming the sides of the chevron.  It was either one unit or several smaller units moving in absolute, precise unison with each other. I couldn&#39;t tell how high or how big it was, but I could hear the pulsating sound with it as it passed overhead, so it couldn&#39;t have been out of audio range and deducing from that it must have been pretty big. There was about seven lights in all.  I&#39;m 48, a single female, I have a MFA from the Univ. of Alaska.  I don&#39;t have any particular interest in UFO&#39;s and have never had any previous experience or &#34;sightings&#34;.  I don&#39;t have much of a scientific/mathematical background and my interests have usually been more of an artistic/creative nature. I just happened to be out walking to my motor home on some friends&#39; property that night and saw what I saw. What prompted me to file this report is: I saw an article in the Everett Herald (Wed. Jan 19th, 2000)about sightings in SE Illinois that fit the description of the object I saw this last August. You can contact me if you want.<n>

The light was so strong it hurt my eyes. It was twice the size of Venus or Jupiter, moving slowly from the NorthWest to the SouthEast direction directly overhead. After approx. 20 seconds it instantly &#34;shut down&#34;, and changed to emitting light like Venus while still moving slowly to the SouthEast. This action left a temporary pale white radiance surrounding the light it was now emitting as the object slowly moved. The weather was warm, I saw no clouds and no moon in the sky at the time. As it slowly moved, it began to slowly fade in intensity until it was gone. The entire sighting was very short less than a minute. Approximately three months ago I saw something similar, the object was slowly moving from East to West. The brightness was that of a small star. It caught my eye because of its slow movement and it too, gradually faded in br! ightness until I could no longer see it. There were no clouds in the area and I do not remember if there was a moon that night. It was shortly after sunset, but before 9:30pm EDST.<n>

I am not sure on the date, since it has been so long ago, but I think it was the end of August of 1999.At that time, I was not aware of this site, so my posting is late. But,I am aware that there was at least one other person that saw the same thing I did. That person filed a report here and I found it when doing a search in the archives of this site. For that person--- Here is what I too, saw. I was leaving my home in Lakeland Hills @ 0530, turned the corner and looked over to the left towards the dead in road, where the the hill drops off to a valley. I saw a low-lying- almost at the horizon level &#34;harvest moon&#34; but it had some kind of angular shape in front of it. It was huge and beautiful but something about the black angular shape in front of it bothered me- a weird, weird black shape. I turned right  and kept driving- a few seconds later, I then looked over to my left again to try to get a glimse of Mt. Raineer. I was completely shocked when I saw the real moon way, way up in the sky and it was not a full moon at all!! I wondered then, what had I seen just a few seconds earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the distance I saw a very, very bright blue and white fireball with a orange-yellow halo and tail traveling at great speed to the north, towards the city of Victoria, British Columbia.  From the time I initially saw it, to the point where an object was obstructing my vision of the object, it traveled about 10 miles in two seconds. It looked similar to a meteorite, and I thought it was one at first. After staring up, looking for something else I then realized that there were clouds out that night, and the object was below the clouds. [Note: I will draw a picture of the object, scan it, and send it in a day or two when I get some time. Also note that I work evenings/nights.]<n>

They both started screaming and yelling and pointing, behind us , up at the sky, yelling, &#34;WHAT IS IT!!!???WHAT IS THAT?!&#34;. I got up,turned around and saw something BRIGHT SILVER ,gleaming it seems in the sun. No wings. Seemed at an angle. Deep in height. A wave knocked me down. When I looked again it was going up at a steep angle, high rate of speed. Looked white in co lor against a perfect clear blue sky, and was saucer/disked shape. It was travelling so so fast and went far up quickly, becoming very small and, high. I was knocked down three or four more times by the water, each time getting up, and finding it and tracking it until we could barely see it at all. Way up in the atmosphere, it appeared to suddenly change direction, heading more vertical, and away from us up the coast. We screamed and yelled at family on the beach , but with the surf pounding and the distance they could not hear us, and didn&#39;t see what we were pointing at.  I have never seen anything like it.  I wished I would have been looking earlier, or have saw it exactly when the boys did. I saw it just after.  I was camping, at Kalaloch Campground , which I have done many years. The boys were my sister in laws nephews, whom I took to play in the Ocean waves.  I am a 48 yrs young, woman, mother,and grandmother. I have an Assc. of Arts degree in Education.  I am a regular person.  I grew up out on the Penninsula, and have no reason to make this up.  It seemed to be that as soon as we started pointing and yelling, the object (flying), left.  I don&#39;t know that to be true either way, as I don&#39;t know how long it was there before we saw it. As I said,  I saw now wings, was smooth, larger, and silver...then when it turned and went up, at that angle it was white , and disc/ saucer shaped. I have never seen anything travel that fast and get so small and so high, that quick.  I can probably get the exact date, or close, figured out, if I sit down with a calander. Oh,  we heard nothing... .<n>

All of a sudden, unmistakenly and very vividly, at about a 10 o’clock angle, I noticed two very bright white lights take off from the ground, one right after the other.  The time frame from the moment they left the ground to where they disappeared going straight up at the top of the sky was about 2 or 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way I recalled the description was like this:  there was a light within a light.  The outside white light was fairly round, but was spread out/diffused around its perimeter, making it translucent.  The light in the center was more solid, more opaque, as if that was the craft and the light around it was maybe its power source, or a result of its power being emanated from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I realized that that location where it emanated from was probably Vandenberg Air Force Base.  My instinct at the time told me that perhaps our military was working with the aliens and allowing them to use their base to land and take off when they wished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as time passed closer to the present, having learned how much technology that we’ve reversed engineered from the aliens, or, even technology I’ve read about from Tesla and a fascinating interview with Ralph Ring, who worked with Otis Carr, protégé of Tesla, I’m more inclined to think that what I saw was our own “UFO” technology at work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported on this siting back then or any other time?

I was a graduate student in neurobiology at the time and my mother had come to visit me at my apartment for a few days (she is a teacher).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening, around eleven o&#39;clock, we were standing on my balcony looking up at the stars before retiring to bed.  My apartment balcony faced southwest, and it was a very clear summer night.  We were standing by the railing, engaged in conversation while just enjoying the view.  As I was looking around, I noticed a what first looked like a star moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast (it seems to be moving in a direction that would eventually pass directly overhead).  I then noticed another point of light very close to it.  When I first noticed the two lights, they were at around a 50 degree angle to the horizon and were approximately thumbs width apart.  I pointed them out to my mother.  At this time I assumed they were satellites. I have seen satellites many times before and these appeared like them.  They were moving slightly faster than other satellites I have observed however.  As they moved closer to being almost directly overhead, they suddenly did something no satellite would do.  Both lights began moving in a completely erratic manner.  They slowed, then began forming loops in the sky, weaving to and fro and forming circles and zig-zagging manouvers with smooth precision.  We continued to watch until they passed out of our sight beyond the roof of the apartment building directly overhead.  At this point my mother and I both looked at each other and didn&#39;t even need to speak.  But when we did, we both wondered what in the world we had just seen.  They seemed the brightness of a star or satellite, but moved in a completely different way.  There was no sound, no colour change (the lights were pinkish).  They were very high up, they were not insects, birds, airplanes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been interested in astronomy for years, have taken several university courses on the subject, and I have observed comets, meteor showers and even a fireball or two.  What my mother and I saw that night neither of us could explain, and we still wonder about it to this day.  I was listening to Coast to Coast AM last night and heard Mr. Davenport implore people to report their sightings, so I am doing so now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, Sincerely ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Again, after 15 seconds or so, it disappeared. About a half a minute later, it reappearred, and brought with it a second craft, looking identical to the first, in size, color and shape.  They stayed a uniform distance from each other (150 feet?) while moving slowly across the sky for around 45 seconds, then disappeared.  That time when they &#34;left&#34;, it was as if you could feel them depart, and we knew they would not reappear to us again that night.<n>

I couldn&#39;t make out a definite shape, only they were round and and glowed like a flame, they never flickered and I couldn&#39;t see any lights other than this orange glow. I followed them through my binoculars as they moved slowly above the ridge for about 5 minutes, then they both seem to stop moving for about 30 second, then one of them moved down and behind the other side of the ridge and I could no longer see it, the second one stayed still, just hovering there above the ridge for about 30 seconds, as I watched it, it just turn off ? Like turning off a light. It didn&#39;t move up or down like the other one had, it just dissapeared right in front of my eyes ? My Husband and I are amateur star gazer, we&#39;ve seen quite a few interesting things up here in the Santa Cruz Mtns, like Muir and a couple of comets, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this !<n>

Ilistened to the radio, but no one reported it, surprisingly. My friend said she saw the same event twice in the sameplace in quick succession, I only caughtthe last event. The streak came from nowhere and an object appeared, also green and then faded, (not reducing in size apparently) distance could have been in orbit or very high up. I have previously (in the last few months at different times, again travelling on HW680) twice seen bright blue balls of light descending at night towards Moffet Field direction-don&#39;t know if that is something they were doing (Nasa Aimes is there too) I have often seen shooting starts (meteors) but nothing even remotely like this. I am a CEO of a small telecommunications company (Engineering background), my friend is a Director of Montessori Academy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving on 680 south at 9.00 am 8-25-99, both I travelling in my car and my friend who was on the same freeway heading the same southerly direction saw something in the bright blue sky above and slightly south of us. I noticed a green (bright light color)streak, but instead of the streak disappearing into nothing it became more intese and bigger resulting in some kind of object. The object was green for 2-3 seconds and totally vanished. My friend said she saw exactly the same thing, only it had repeated twice. I only saw it the once. I have seen glowing blue balls before descending quickly in the Moffett Field/Nasa Aimes direction. his happened several months ago, I did not report it then. I am now very convinced that soemthing is going on. Note the object got bigger after a trail, not the reverse which would suggest a meteor perhaps. The object appeared last, and from the distance could have been any shape, the duration was several seconds, but very very bright and very observable for anyone with good peripheral vision on the freeway.<n>

There seemed to be many colors flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 object was seen about 10 inches above the northern mountains ( approx 15 miles distant )There seemed to be a series of pulses of red, amber and green with the occasional blue which was brighter than the other colors. It was moving very slowly in an eastern direction. We scanned the sky and noticed another to the east much farther off and another to the west which was much brighter and semmed to be much closer. I looked with my binoculars and could actualy see that the closest object to the west of us looked to be revolving with the light patterns. My wife looked and confirmed what I was seeing. The fourth object appeared close to the first object and could be seen moving in an easterly direction and went out of sight behind a tree. I&#39;m no expert in judging distances, but I estimate that the closest object in the west had to be at least 100 feet in diameter for us to see it so clearly. It did not appear saucer like at all, but rather more spherical.<n>

My brother first noticed a light in the western sky. He turned and asked me what it was. He had been observing this light for approximately 30 seconds before I saw the same light. We both then observed this light from approximately 1950 to 2000 hrs. During this time the object or light remained suspended. It looked to be 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the air. We noticed that the object seem to have a black line that ran vertical through 3/4 of the length of the object. The object had a distinctive steady yellowish orange light. At approximately 2000 hrs. it then begin to move slowly in a vertical direction. It took approximately 3 to 5 seconds before it disappeared completely. The movement that was observed was very fluid.<n>

I heard an airplane above so I looked up.  When I looked up, I saw the airplane, but I also saw the object.  The object was stationary.  The airplane moved underneath the object, but you could tell that the object was very much higher than the airplane (the plane was at least at 15,000 feet), possibly by many thousands of feet.  After the airplane passed, I kept looking at the object, trying to figure out what it was.  It looked like one of those rectangular parachutes, that sort of shape.  It was brown in color.  It made no movements at all and no noise that I could tell.  I told my wife to look up and I had to point it out to her because it was so high up that it was very small and I had to have her look off the point of my finger to see it.  She did see it and she could not make out anything more that what I saw.  We watched it for about 5 minutes or so and it never moved.  I told my wife that it must be a geostationary sattelite in orbit and we went on with our business.<n>

I was sitting in my office at my residence, using the Internet, and listening to my police scanners.  The Christian County Sheriff&#39;s office dispatcher started having problems communicating with all of their patrol cars in the field.  (freq. 155.565 transmit and receive) I could hear a humming sound that was effecting the radio and I could hear the humming in my office.  I thought that we had just had a power surge that effected the town of Ozark, MO, and that is what I was hearing.  About five minutes had past and I was still hearing the humming and the dispatcher was getting frantic.  She called Radiophone Engineering, Inc. ( the people who handle radio problems ).  I was very interested about the humming so I finally walked outside my residence.  Looking to the west, I saw nothing, the sky was mostly clear but a bit overcast. As I walked down my front porch, I noticed a silver-gray disk object directly above my residence towards the southeast.  It was approx. 100 yards long and 15 feet high, it was tilted at about 25 degrees towards the earth.  I live next to the power transformers for my subdivision, and the disk just hovered approx. 250 feet above me and the power lines for at least twenty minutes.  The humming sound continued constantly.  The disk had a blue, then white, then red light coming from the bottom moving in a perfect circle.  The sheriff&#39;s dispatcher was still having problems with her radio transmissions as I continued to hear on my police scanner.  It then moved directly from the southeast to northwest of my location, along the Finley river that runs through the town and disappeared strait upward. Special notes:  Sheriff&#39;s radio cleared up after the disk left the area.  Brake lights on two vehicles at Dennis Hanks Chevrolet dealership where stuck on ( two calls to the ozark police department as heard on the scanner).  Many ozark citizens standing on main street right after the event looking into the sky.  Five minutes of time was ADDED to my watch.  Many jet aircraft and helicopters where heard and seen around ozark for approx. one hour after the event.  Earthquake occurred at New Madrid fault line ( southeast tip of Missouri ) approx. four hours before this sighting. Well, this is my first UFO report, I would never ever believed it, until I witnessed it for myself!<n>

I noticed a silver shining sphere like object to the west of the noonday sun. I watched the object move east towards the sun at the rate of speed of a comercial airliner.  I had to keep  glancing up as it moved closer to the sun due to the glare.  At the same time I noticed the reception on my radio became poor and scrambled.  I also noticed the vehicle traveling ahead of me had slowed down and appeared to be watching the object also.  As I descended the hill into Steelville the object disappeared.<n>

We were looking toward the mountain range in the north east off to our right. I suddenly saw a fuzzy white object that then began to streak brilliantly through the corridor heading east. It first looked like a comet or meteor but then it turned towards the direction of our car and quickly changed appearance to a huge bright blue and white firey ball. As I said coming right towards us. It moved very fast, then it began to look misty at the top of the ball and seemed to streak light in different directions. I could see the light through the trees as it dissapated and then disappeared. Needless to say we were just totally blown away. The girls and I all had the sense that the ball was coming AT us. I felt like it was aware of us. We all described what we saw the same way. Our background is: My husband is a pastor. I am a homemaker. The girls are in highschool and are A students.

There was no other star visile. There was an aircraft (leaving combustion gases trace)  3 - 5  degrees below this object. It seemd that the craft which was silver reflected object`s light. Visibility time -  60 - 90 seconds, than obscured by trees nearby the road for about 40 - 60 seconds. When the trees ended the aircraft was about 10 -15 degrees higher to the left side and the object was gone . Sky was cloudless, visibility for about 15-20 km. Moon almost full - 25-30 degrees to the West driection. We both ensured i discussion to see the same view and referred to it as an UFO.There were 9 people at the car but only us two seen it.We forgot to notice exact time it was between 21.00 and 21.40 Location impossible to recall s! omewhere on the highway  between Opole and Lednica<n>

We had been delayed because of the night time paving that was taking place along the highway between Selma and Cave Juntion. I pull the four door sedan into the Dairy Queen in Cave Juntion and we all went inside. After getting our ice creams we got back into the car and before I started to pull out of the drive way of the Dairy Queen and making a left turn onto the highway I noticed some lights up on the hills that were about two miles away as the crow flies. Teasing my wife I said &#34;Look a UFO&#34;. As I continued to look at the object it apeared to me that it was a large house and I commented that &#34;that was a neat place to have a house&#34; since it was at the very top of the hills and looking down into the Illinois Valley directly above Cave Juntion, Or. I remember thinking how big the house was because of what I though were large  picture windows with light coming out of them.  The object was huge. It appeared to be made of equally narrow bars of light and amber colored bars that were not illuminated. Equal in size and spacing in a horzontial line. Suddenly the object began to rotate counter clock wise in a very smooth fashion, much like a merry go round -not fast. The object then began moving north in a horizontal direction and I instantly knew that it was a UFO. At this point I was stopped in the middle of the Highway though no cars were coming and we were in the middle of town. So I took my eyes off of the object and pulled the car across the street. I did not see what took place next but wife saw the object and it began to stretch out and develope a mist around it, and then just disapperaed while it was still traveling in the same direction. My two daughters who were in the back of the car did not see the event. Of course my wife and I were in shock. We continued to head south on Hwy 199 into California. I had a deep sence that we would see the object again, so I instructed them to keep looking for the object. The area is very hilling and forest on the Coast range in southern Oregon and into Northern California. After traveling for about 15 miles just after the check stop at the Calif. boarder you climb a hill that takes you through a tunnel. As we were approaching the tunnel my wife, and two daughters saw a blue fire ball approach the car at great speed before it banked away. I was driving, and did not hear or see it. I turned around to catch a glimps of it, but it was gone. My question is why did it come after us as their impression of it was that it was behaving in a agressive manner? They will send you the information in another report. On a lighter note, when they woke up the next morning they began to sing the old Monkeys song...&#34;I&#39;m a Believer&#34; &lt;&gt;&lt;<n>

I saw it over the roof af the neighboring building, traveling faster than any plane, silently. It was very bright, with a mix of red, green and regular bright white light. I have never seen anything like this, and it is embedded in my memory.  I was born and raised in Seattle, raised a family, and ten years ago moved to Maui, where I habe worked for the historic organization here, doing research. I have excellent eyesight! This sphere was so large and so bright, that I cannot believe that no one else saw it. Many people are outside on Maui evenings, I will watch the newspapers for reports from others.<n>

I realized the object was coming out of the clouds downward, in a zig-zag, falling leaf fashion, then thinking I was seeing a parachute coming down, I stopped to get a better view and looked for the lines and person but there was only this round white object about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. It appeared to be landing. As I drove on the trees and houses on the street obstructed my view of it.<n>

It had no windows, no wings, no jet powered engin, no tale like a shooting star..it had to be something from somewhere else because it was able to control its spead adn take off faster then a jet...and i seen jets in the air show so i know how fast they can take off ..

While we were sitting their I noticed a red light above the hills on the other side of the water. (the other side is probably 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile  away) I couldn&#39;t give a descent distance reading, but It looked to be a ways of (5-10 miles). I was looking at it at probably a 20 degree angle so it would have been pretty high above the ground (1000 feet?) I would have thought it was some natural occurance (radio antenna light, plane, etc) except for that it was moving back and forth and making some very random movements (small loops, stopping quickly and then going the other way.) If it was as far away as a felt it was it would have been moving at least a mile back and forth in these movements. It would have done this in about 3-4 seconds. I never saw the object disappear and it was their when I left at about 3:40 in the morning. For all I know it could be something natural and I wouldn&#39;t have reported it except for the odd movements. If you happen to have any investigators up in oak harbor here&#39;s some precise information to my location. I was on the east shoreline (the beach you can see from the bridge) of the beach, about a hundred yards down from some large rock formations. Right below where the object was their was a flashing light/lighthouse (or something similar) something on the hill across from where we were. If you were to sit in the spot and look at the lighthouse then look up above the hill a degree or two that&#39;s were the object was.<n>

I was the first one to the window and saw an object- probably about 100-150 feet long- with a  bright light encompassing it descending from the sky, approximately 3/4 mile away.  It landed across the water from our house behind a line of trees, where it sat for about 2 minutes, during which time all we could see was a glow extending above the tree line.  After 2-3 minutes there was a bright flash and then nothing.  We checked the general area of the landing- very rural- the next day, but found no signs of anything.  We brought our dog with us- a hunting dog who had been bird hunting in this area with us many times.  Although we didn&#39;t notice that the area had been physically disturbed, our dog acted very odd-  very nervous, like he does in the middle of a thunder storm.  But when we got him back in the boat and away from the area he calmed down and returned to normal.<n>

A friend filmed it on his video camera and gave it to him after the game.  Sunday morning he was watching the &#34;plays&#34; in slow motion and he called us in to the living room to watch this unidentifiable object streak across the screen.  He slowed it down to frame by frame and there is no denying it!  It is not a plane or a jet or a helicopter, etc.!  By comparing the player&#39;s action in the freeze frame it is the time he lifts his leg at a full run and partially steps down.  It isn&#39;t an aircraft.  One of my co-workers says it is light infraction from the lens of the camera, but I don&#39;t think so.  We never would have seen it if he hadn&#39;t been in slow-mo and if he hadn&#39;t seen it!<n>

I have observed many high flying jets traveling to Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis and who knows where else. I have also seen, at numerous times what appear to be satellites moving in the sky from south to north and southwest to northeast. I use a good pair of binoculars and have seen no running lights or heard any muffled roars when these satellites pass over. Last night I saw a movement near or just slightly northeast of straight up. In the first 2-3 seconds of viewing, I thought I was looking at another satellite. Then about 3 seconds into view the object brightened almost instantly to the apparent brightness of Jupiter and it was seen as about the same size of Jupiter. Approximately 3 seconds after it brightened, it started dimming again. The objest was traveling from the northeast to the south. The half moon was behind some trees to my south as I was laying. There was a row of trees blocking the moon. By the time I found the object in my binoculars ( maybe 5 more seconds ) it had dimmed and then it looked exactly like a dim satellite in motion and brightness. It disappeared from view behind the row of trees in the vicinity of the moon. There was no trail visible and the object never veered from its course. ( If I had to guess what I saw I would say I saw a satellite with the ability to instantly turn on a light source; other than that it looked like the pinpoint of light you see from passing satellites. I live @ 20 miles north northeast of Louisville International airport and am used to seeing various running lights on all types of planes. This was not an aircraft, unless, of course, it was one trying to look like a satellite. I am a 52 year old retired male who has spent most of my life looking at the sky occasionally. This is the first time I have ever reported anything like this to any organization.<n>

Daylight.Hovering.15-20 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:20 PM while driving westbound from Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 I looked out my driver&#39;s side window and noticed an object above and to the side of my vehicle. I estimate that it was about 300-400 feet above the terrain and I was no more than 1000 feet away. What I saw was a solid object which seemed to be a rectangular box-like configuration or maybe a diamond shape, I can&#39;t be to sure of the detail as I only was able to view it for about 10 seconds. It did not seem to be moving but I could not be sure, as I was going at highway speed in its direction. I would estimate its size to be 15-20 feet long and was a dark color with no lights although it was not black as some highlights were visible. It was not a simple rectangle but seemed to have some features on it. I watched it for a few seconds before I realized that it was not an aircraft and then I looked for overhanging power lines or cables or some means of suspension but there were none. At that point it became obvious to me that this was not anything like I had ever seen and it began to dawn on me that I was witnessing something quite out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, within 10 seconds I could not see it anymore as I had passed it by. I strained to see it in my rear view mirror but I could not see it again. I did not pull over because of heavy traffic. It took a few seconds to process what I saw because it was so hard to believe what I was seeing. It seemed so ordinary yet an object (a box, no less) just doesn&#39;t hover in mid air, but there it was. I tried to tell my wife what I was seeing but she could not see it from her side of the car. This was a daylight sighting, although the sun was already below the horizon there was still plenty of light. I am very familiar with aircraft and have never made a sighting like this before. I know what I saw but I don&#39;t know what I was looking at. I am at a loss to explain what this was. I don&#39;t have the slightest idea what I saw. I have never heard of UFO&#39;s in this configuration before. This is not a joke.<n>

Both my brother and I are private pilots. In our 40&#39;s. While watching aircraft superpolluting the skys. (and they make us take our cars in for a emissions test) Through binoculars, my brother became very excited he said I see something else up there. I ran to get some binoculars too. The one he saw was stationary above the area where the contrails were being made. ie amost directly above our house. Then after a couple of minutes is started to move fairly fast to the east. Untill out of sight. He then spotted another which I did see. Definately a metallic look to it. It was moving to the east went out of sight behind some trees. The third one (all these in the same general area above our house) moved to the east but then slowed down and seemed to make some aerobatic manuvers like turns to the left and some small circles and then proceeded to the east. All these were traveling much faster than the upper atmosphere winds could carry them.<n>

We are almost directly beneath a southeastern approach corridor to Vancouver International Airport. I looked up to watch the passing commercial passenger jet, which was heading northwest about a thousand feet or so above. I suddenly noticed a strange &#34;light&#34;, which seemed to suddenly zip in front of the jet, before coming to a sudden stop. As it moved through the air, it left  what looked like a vapor trail that almost instantly disappeared. I thought that the movement seemed very strange, and continued to watch the light, but it did not seem to move, or only moved slightly, as the jet passed by. I believe that the jet was beneath the light when it passed it. My estimate is that if the object at the same or higher elevation than the jet, then it was probably traveling at a velocity of about one thousand miles per hour when I first noticed it, before coming to an instantaneous stop. I rushed inside to get my binoculars, and when I returned, the object was still there. I focused on it and discovered the object was actually shaped like an orb, although I seem to recall that it looked slightly flattened in the vertical dimension. It had a pronounced  metallic or pearly luster. The outer edges had a reddish color. The brighter, more reflective center seemed more like a silvery gold color. It was hard for me to guess at the height of the object, as I had no real reference point - other than the passing jet. I reasoned to myself that maybe it was a type of balloon, even if its initial movement did not seem to indicate this. The object did not seem to rise, as you would expect from a balloon. It did start to move, in a sort of random manner until it was finally hidden behind a nearby tree and I lost sight of it. I probably observed it for a period of about five minutes.<n>

As we stood there and watched the remaining object it began to seem as if it were getting closer as it soon took on shape, and one set of lights,turned into 2 and then into 3...The lights seemed to be in the form of a triangle and flashed multi colors.. After about 15 minutes of watching we went back to work and as we made our way further south my wife looked out her open window and said it looks like a giant triangle..I immediately stopped and at this point you could see the out line of something between the 3 sets of lights that appeared to be a Huge Triangle..As we watched the lights suddenly got bright enough to light up the area around us,it was light enough that we could see the deer in the area as if they were out in the daylight.At that time I got on the CB radio to ask if any of the local Truck drivers were observing this,but the radio and my truck just went dead!Then just as quickly as it lit up it was dark and my truck started right back up,we got in and went back to work and observed this object go up and down and every now and then it would zip from one side of us to the other and then back again! We observed this till about 6am when as we made our way across the Whitney Dam the object was highly visible and looking more like a triangle,then suddenly it shot up and to the side and was gone! Also I am unable to recieve Collect calls,but if you have any questions please Email me,I check it 2-3 times daily and will repond as soon as I get it!<n>

As usual we planned to travel at night so that we might catch teh early fishing in the morning. Alonmg the route is a lake called Carpenter Lake. I belive it approximately 15 miles long. We neared the end of the lake and decided to pull over and grab some coffee from the trunk of the car. It was an extremely clear night and all the stars where out. We noticed a few sattelite and where tracking them in the sky. One was moving in what appeared to much faster than the others. It tracked accross the sky from left to right. It centered on us and flared, The light was brigt red and flickery, almost like fire. It stayed like this moving very little. It flared once fast and bright. The flash appeared to be about hand sized if you where to hold your hand in front of your face. Thats all, I am unsure as to what it was, and perhaps my story does not convey all the emotions that where felt before and after. It was a satellite, certainly not a meteor as it was to close, to bright and to in our face, the pathway for it would not have been possible.

Above Valley Medical Center I saw an oragnge/red object (approx. 100-200 yrds in length).  My distance from object approx. 1/2 mile.  It hovered in that position for approx. 1-2 minutes.  Object then began moving to SW accross the Renton/Kent Valley, above Demoines hill.  Object appeared to maintain altitude.  The object appeared to nearly crest the horizon from my vantage when it began approaching Renton again.  It continued back towards me across the valley in the same path it had taken on its departure.  It continued until it was somewhere above the vacinity of the Valley Medical Center.  The object hovered for approx 1-2 minutes again. The object began moving and departed towards the SW again, but this time disappeared over the horizon.  It did not reappear.  I took several pictures of the item, however the negatives came back without exposure.  The object did not appear to have any exterior lighting and did not make any sound.  It appeared to just glow.<n>

I thought at first it was a reflection from the plane but as the plane was flying I was having to look back to see them as the plane was flying away from them. They were much too fast and turning too quickly to be any kind of aircraft.<n>

Immediately I realized that it was not one but a satellite. I was looking South East when I first saw the object. It was travelling at a fairly fast rate of speed from East to West at about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon. I then saw following the object 3 more lights of the exact same size in a V formation following the first object, moving at the exact same speed and at the same height in the sky. Then following the first group of 3 was another group of 3 lights in a V formation following the previous lights at the same speed and in the same position in the sky. All the lights were of the same intensity and appeared to be somewhat blurred. They did not strobe so I assume they were not airplanes. I got off the steps and followed them moving in the sky until the street light from behind a tree made it impossible to track them. I was wearing a personal CD player so I did not hear if there was any sound or not. My impression was they were flying very high in the sky.<n>

(Around 2100 hours on clear nights, the object can be seen, as it was upon this night, hovering in the eastern sky) I looked out the back door around 2130, and surely the object could be seen at an approximate height of 2 to 3,000 feet in the air.  I couldn&#39;t make out a definate shape, but the object changed from red to blue to green to white.  The Startling thing to me was that it remained  stationary the entire time I watched it.  It was visible for abut an hour then just simply disappeared.<n>

The object flew (or floated?) at an apparently inexplicable speed, heading roughly NE. The object seemed to be composed of two parts arranged in unchanging formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student at home in the Upper Penninsula for the summer. I am a painter, and drove to the remotely located Crisp Point Lighthouse on Lake Superior to paint a picture of the adandoned lighthouse still standing there. I stood my easel up on the beach and had been painting for roughly 45 minutes when an object on the horizon of Lake Superior caught my eye. Visibility was perfect that day, and the sky at that time was cloudless. A small shape was closely followed by another small shape on the very edge of the sky, slightly above a thin layer of reflecting air atop the water, but I do not remember if I could see the shapes reflecting on the water. The shapes, if I were made to guess, were rectangular, but I am not certain what their shape was so perhaps this is an association of my own with the Great Lakes freighters commonly seen on the horizons of lakes: the cabins atop the hulls of which are angular in form. The object (I will assume it to be one object, for the two shapes moved in connection), however, moved at a rate of impossible speed for any sea-going craft, given its distance from me at the time. I watched it soundlessly cross nearly a third of the 180 degree horizon in about ten seconds, then I looked down for a reason I do not remember, either to look for my camera or pick up a dropped brush. When I looked up, the object&#39;s path had taken it behind the remains of a defunct pier jutting out from Crisp Point which obscures the horizon. I assume it vanished over the horizon behind the pier, for it did not emerge from behind it. The object followed a roughly north easterly course from where I first noticed it to the NNW, travelling consistently at the same rapid speed. The largest visibility possible across water on a clear day is twelve miles, so I assume it to have been at that distance. Though it is possible that two large supersonic jets, perhaps bombers, somehow flying in close formation at an altitude lower than about 500 feet above the water could explain the sighting, the sighting still remains mysterious to me, given how unlikely it is that two such jets would be following this course towards the elevated shoreline hills of Pancake Bay and batchawana Provincial Parks in Ontario (hills visible to the ENE of Crisp Point, and furthermore that the speed of the object seemed greater than any plane I have ever seen at that distance. The object moved far faster than a jumbo jet cruising overhead (which would be cruising at six or seven miles away), and either of its two portions were at least as large as a jumbo jet appears at that lesser distance. I have spent a lot of time on the Great Lakes and never seen anything similar, so I thought I would report it, especially as I expect it would have been visible from the region of Ontario around Pancake Bay, east of Crisp Point and Whitefish Point in Michigan. Perhaps the Canadian Navy is secretly testing a new supersonic freighter that will put American shipping to shame?!<n>

Even though it was fairly late (around 1AM) there are always a good number of cars on the road at that time.  I was driving when my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, pointed to a beam of light that was pointing straight down at the highway in front of us. At first I thought it was a helicopter shining a spotlight down, but later I would realize that I was wrong.  The light, which was coming from what seemed to be 100-200ft from above the highway, started drifting off to the right.  In 1-2 minutes, the highway turned and we realized that the light was flying directly over the highway.  Just then, the beam turned off and from where it was shining from, a blue light appeared and sped away at an incredible speed over the horizon. About two seconds after the light sped off, another large bright blue light shot down from what seemed to be outer space to the area that the origional light went to. As we continued along the highway, about five miles down the road we noticed that off to our right, several miles away (in the general viscinity of where the lights earlier flew to), several blue and red balls of light were flying around each other at odd velocities and manuvering like no aircraft we had ever seen.  At this point we figured we would get the best view if we got out of the car to look.  The four of us stood and observed the manuvering craft for a few minutes before all but one blue one flew away over the horizon.  The remaining craft, we realized, was flying towards us!  All four of us began to get nervous about this strange event but we couldn&#39;t turn away.  Slowly, the craft flew directly over us, silently, at an unknown altitude.  This gave us the opportunity to see, by the orientation of 9 blue lights on it&#39;s leading edge that were flickering like strobe lights, that it was v shaped.  It continued on at this speed until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. We were glad a beam didn&#39;t shine on us when it passed directly over us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

It came to a complete stop for 10 seconds, then proceded to climb straight upward, stopped again for 10 sec. and proceded straight upward at a high rate of speed.  Heading northeast and upward it raced completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was  oval shaped and silver gleaming, and  was at a very high attitude.  Myself Randy and Jon witnessed this event on August 19, 1999, at 20:00.  The craft came to a complete halt at a high altitude, and remained completely stationery for long enough for us to get out of the vehicle and looked at the object through a pair binoculars.  It then proceeded at a high rate of speed straight up and again came to complete stop.  It then started in a direction towards us overhead and upward gainin in altitude quickly northeast towards Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, Montana. For a moment there was a small stream of white trailing behind the object.   Within moments it disappeared into thin air.  Even with high power binoculars  the object was gone.   It was broad daylight with a few light clouds, and we were on the northside of town along the Missouri River.<n>

Our location was about 10 miles SE of downtown Nashville, TN, at the Starwood Amphitheatre.  The time was 19:45.  Because of the angle of the sun and the height of the &#34;speck&#34;, my first guess was that we were seeing a low-orbit satellite.  It was tracking WNW at an altitude of at least 100,000 feet. We had two sets of binoculars with us, so I watched it with 10x50&#39;s while my wife watched it with 8x35&#39;s.  It resembled a lollipop, of all things, with the round sphere brightly reflecting the sunlight and the &#34;stick&#34; end clearly rotating around its axis once every 4-5 seconds.  This was all pretty cool -- I had never been able to see one so clearly before. And then a strange thing happened: it appeared to &#34;explode&#34;.  Right before our eyes, we watched this object, still tracking to the West, split up into several pieces.  The largest chunk emitted something like a cluster of BB&#39;s, in other words, where there was one object before, now there were two or more smaller objects and an array of tiny pieces, each reflecting the sunlight perfectly, fanning out toward the South.  The fan of BB&#39;s and the main object(s) continued tracking together, but gradually increased the distance between themselves.   A third piece moved rapidly away from the main group, at a faster velocity than the BB&#39;s, toward the SE. My first thoughts were that we had just witnessed some space junk disintegrating on re-entry, but the speed didn&#39;t seem excessive, and the movement of the third piece didn&#39;t seem to jive with the general motion of the main body.  The total elapsed time of viewing this thing before it was obscured by clouds was about 5 minutes.  In that time, it traversed maybe 10 degrees of overhead sky.<n>

I watched as dark clouds approached from the northwest. While looking at the sky through my sliding glass door, something odd moving in the sky, caught my attention.  I quickly opened the door and ran outside to get a better look.  Moving directly ahead of the storm front and below the clouds was an object that I could not identify.  At first, I thought it was some type of missile.  It didn&#39;t have any wings. The object was silvery white and then it changed to black.  I realized it was actually in a continuous roll, end over end, as it crossed the sky.  On one roll it was very narrow and oblong.  On the next roll, there was the unmistakable shape of a triangle.  The triangle was black and equalateral with the corners slightly rounded.  The object continued to roll very quickly across the sky, and then it was gone from sight. This all happened in a matter of between eight to ten seconds.  The time was approximately 3:45pm.  The directional movement of the object was northwest to southeast.  There was no sound made by the object that I could detect.  There was only the sound of thunder in the distance.  The size of the object was about that of a nickel held at arms length.<n>

As I was laying there (on the cement of the spillway/dam) a light caught my eye across the other side of the lake.  A bluish white light about he size of a basketball zoomed (I say that because it went really fast) over a couple of feet above the water, kinda slowed toward the center, then sped into the trees on the oppisite side.  It had a bright reflection that actually seemed brighter than the object itself and there was no sound at all.  Actually I dont even remember hearing the crickets or splash of water.  I totally freaked and ran all the way home.  I never said anything to anybody until today and they suggested I call the police or something so I reported it here.

I viewed this object for about 10 to 15 Seconds.  It had what appeared to be nav. lights on all three cornors, they were as bright as the lights on other aircraft I have seen in the area.  The strange thing about this object is that the lights were as wide apart as 12 to 15 normal size aircraft.  I have been in the aircraft industry for 30 years as an inspector for boeing and as a forward aircontroller in the Air Force and have never seen anything like this. What helped to give shape to this object is that the sky was full of star&#39;s and as this object passed it blocked out the star&#39;s.  I did not hear any noise as one would hear from an aircraft overhead on its approach into Seattle International.<n>

I looked up and saw four white lights spaced in the shape of a diamond. The size was about the size of a laptop computer held at arms length. There was a dark superstructure filling in the area between the lights as contrasted against the cloud cover behind it.  It hovered for a few minutes then shot off to the north, N. Phoenix, then shot back to the south, then back to the origin- al position, and then shot straight up through the clouds, dissappearing. There was no noise from it.  There was no build up of speed as most of our conventional aircraft would exhibit. It appeared to move at a constant, very rapid velocity. And did not appear to slow down. It just came to an immediate stop.  The local radio station (93.5Mz??) was asking for people, who saw it, to call in.  People from N. Phoenix did see it and called it in.  I was expecting to see it in the local paper but there was nothing at all, which is quite supprising since so many people saw it and it was talked about on a local radio station.  I am not a local. Was in town on business.<n>

I looked up at a twin-engine Cessna climbing out southward (roughly 1500 feet as it passed overhead) and noticed a small speck apparantly far above it.  At first I thought this was sunlight reflecting off a high-altitude jet.  (While it was quite light enough to read, the sun was not yet actually over the horizon, so it would reflect from a high-altitude object even though we were in shadow.) I watched to see whether this &#34;jet&#34; was going south or north.  (Almost all high altitude air traffic here is to San Francisco or Seattle.) It did neither, but rather stayed in one place.  After a couple of minutes of this, I checked to see if the scattered cirrus clouds were moving. They were drifting slowly westward.  At the surface, we had a breeze moving from north to south.  In either case the object should have drifted (if loose), but did not. I looked carefully to see if I could detect any bobbing or any air patterns that might indicate this was something much smaller and closer, such as a tethered balloon, but another airplane went by climbing out, and passed between me and the object, so I concluded that it was likely higher than the plane.  Also, I saw no bobbing movements or shadows anywhere indicating a tether.  (They might exist, but I did not see any.) After a few minutes, the angle with the sun had changed enough that I did not get a specular reflection, but a diffuse one.  The object appeared to be white, and shaped like a &#34;Y&#34;.  On the other hand, it was extremely small and so I can&#39;t guarantee that I wasn&#39;t seeing glare or artifacts from my eyeglasses. About this time the thing seemed to rotate a little bit, then move a few feet, and then hover again, as though it were under control and &#34;keeping station.&#34;  It repeated this behavior occassionally until I lost sight of it. The object continued to stay in place, with no noticable changes, until my bus came at 06:05, when I lost sight of if.  At this point, other boarding passengers asked what I was looking at, and so I pointed it out.  Two saw it right away, both shrugged.  At about 06:15 I tried to find it again after I got off the bus in Northwest Portland, but was unsuccessful. ====== end of report I have the feeling that this was some kind of recon aircraft, but it&#39;s the frist sighting I&#39;ve had I can&#39;t actually explain away.  I&#39;m a licensed pilot, have a degree in physics, have done professional photojournalism, and now write software.  Even if I&#39;d had a camera, there wasn&#39;t much to take a picture of without a very long lens. The phone number is at home.  If you call, please do so in the evening, when I&#39;m likely to be home.(not that this sighting needs much work ...)<n>

We thought maybe we would see some of those meteors from the Perseid shower, but instead we seen an object that appeared to change from a bright green to a dimmer blueish green and then suddenly changed to 3 seperate lights that stayed in a triangle formation and after a few seconds rejoined to become one object again. We watched this object(s) for I&#39;d say about 5 minutes. The object(s) made absolutely no sound. We have many aircraft fly over, since Japan Airlines trains their pilots here and we also have alot of military traffic and the occasional life flight chopper, all of which however make lots of noise and the blinking lights of those aircraft are unmistakable. As to what those silent lights in the nightsky could have been - your guess is as good as mine! Did you get any other reports about this from our area?<n>

Earlier in the evening I had witnessed (at around 12:30 a.m.) the launch of a satellite from KSC, then continued fishing (as my campsite bordered the mosquito lagoon and Indian rivers), until about 2:00 a.m. At around 2:30 a.m. I exited my camping tent to toss a few logs onto the fire, hoping that the increased light from the fire would ward off a few raccoons, which had been keeping me awake by their scampering around the campsite. As I had left my flashlight in the tent, I utilized what little campfire light remained to scout out some of the numerous fallen tree limbs surrounding the tent (for firewood). While peering around in this semi-darkness I was startled in that I noted wooded area around me began to lighten and even pronounced shadows appeared behind the trees surrounding me. Looking up through the trees I could see that there was something very bright emerging in the Western Hemisphere, but I couldn&#39;t make it out due to the tree cover above me. I was perplexed by this and while at first thinking &#34;Holy smokes, I&#39;ve never heard of the cape sending up two rockets in one night (as it was that pronounced a light)&#34; quickly reasoned that the light was coming from the direction opposite of the launch facilities. So, I quickly moved through the brush to a point jetting out toward the open lagoon and witnessed the following: What I saw was a steady light blue glowing object moving from the east out toward the ocean. I immediately determined it was a meteorite, as it seemed to leave a slight glowing orange-white contrail behind it. But as I continued to observe it, that initial impression seemed improbably for several reasons. It didn&#39;t move as quickly as one would think a meteor would. It seemed to move at a speed slightly faster than a commercial airliner. As it neared it became nearer the object&#39;s brightness increased significantly - and by - that I mean it was frightfully bright. When it was at it&#39;s nearest, I&#39;d guess 20 - 30 miles off, it produced enough light to have read a book - it literally seemed like daylight. As it passed, I could somewhat discern (especially as it proceeded away) that the intensity of the object varied - from bright, to less so, back to it&#39;s full intensity. It continued out easterly and over the ocean until disappearing over the horizon. I at first stood just staring in shock trying to recall all the details of what I had seen, as I figured that since such an event would be widely reported the following morning, and because I was up and awake and in such a perfect environment for viewing it (being away from the city lights), that my testimony about it might be important. After a few moments (probably 5 minutes) I witnessed two helicopters flying very quickly out from the direction of KSC toward the northeast. I mean they were moving at top speed. I simply thought to myself concerning them - &#34;good luck catching that sh*t!&#34; and wandered over to the opposite side of the campsite to view the KSC launch area and VAB to determine if there were any other noticeable signs of activity there as a result of the event, but couldn&#39;t discern such. I might have heard a slight (difficult to describe) sound during the event, but the surrounding water&#39;s activity may have be partly to blame, so I would offer that possibility as a fact, only that I believe I might have noted a slight sound from the object during the event. I did not report the sighting for two reasons 1). My girlfriend slept through the entire event (in the tent) and believing she&#39;d suspect I was acting like a crackpot, decided I&#39;d best keep it to myself until getting back to town in the morning where the event would be collaborated by others, and 2). because one is not normally permitted to camp out in that area during launch activities and I did not want (and still do not want) my presence there to be made common knowledge. Therefore, I&#39;d request that this report include only that I was camping in the mosquito lagoon area ONLY. After returning to town I noted (and in days to follow) I&#39;ve not run across anyone else who sighted the object (which seems hard to believe - but I suppose I&#39;ve just not run into them). Well, two days ago I related this event to a friend of mine who laughed it off, giving me the same dreaded reaction I had avoided by having told no one else sooner. Then, this morning, he called me and informed me that he had been up late last night and listened to a radio program (yours?) discussing a similar event, around the same time, but in Mexico. He told me your web site listing &#34;ufocenter.com&#34; and recommended I pull it up on the web for any information. And here I am. Don&#39;t know what else to add, other than that you may contact me if desired. ((name deleted))<n>

I t was an exceptionally clear evening with a view of the Milky Way stretching across the sky at about 11:00 P.M.-11:30 P.M.  I had just stepped outside onto a small deck of the cabin with a clear view of the lake and ridgeline and was looking towards the town of Grand Marais.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I felt as if someone was standing behind me and I turned around to see what was going on. I saw a large circular shape of concentrated white light, without a halo, larger than a full moon, about five to ten miles away above the ridgeline and not obstructed in any way.  My first thought was that it was a very large meteor but it was stationary without movement. My next thought was that it might be some kind of aircraft but I quickly dismissed that idea.  This initial observation of the object lasted about 8-10 minutes.  Then, within the white ligh! t, at about 2/3rds of the inside diameter, a bright red ring of light developed in a clockwise fashion. This internal red ring was maintained for several more minutes and then vanished.  Next, the overall white circular light contracted to where the red ring had appeared.  Then this object suddenly and at great speed ascended at about an 85 degree angle towards the north without a sound. I watched the ascent of the object to where it was about the size of a small star and watched it travel at high speed some distance and over the horizon, heading north over Canada.  Besides the physical visual experience, what also stood out about the encounter was the very strong sense of presence of the object.  I have never seen anything like this in my life before or since. I have no explanation of it and it was clearly not a natural phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Until last night, they were always to the south of us and sometimes in pairs.  Each time, they would seem to hover for a short period of time, then fade out. Last night (08-15) we were in our back yard and saw a large (or close) one east from our place hovering above the grain elevator.  After 30-60 seconds, it faded out and we never saw it return.  It was an orange glow.  To the eye, it appeared to be the size of a push pin head.  One time before, my wife got a decent look at one with the binoculars and she said that it appeared to have lights going around in a circular motion. Tonight, my wife went to walk our dog and she saw it again.  She knocked on the window to tell me that it was back.  I ran out to get the binoculars and when I got back there (in the back yard), it was gone.  She left for her walk, and on her way back, she looked over and it was back.  She ran to the house and just as she was getting ready to knock on the window again, she looked up and it was gone.  She said that the second time, it looked closer and seemed to light up the soybean field behind our house.<n>

The object passed directly over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ball was green, almost flourescent, and was white to silver in the center. It was silent.  Not a sound. The thing that surprised me is that it flew across air traffic. I thought it was going to hit something. I work second shift as a help desk analyst in Langhorne, PA, which is between three airports, Philadelphia, North Philadelphia and Mercer Airport in Trenton. Air traffic was a little heavier than usual that night because the weather was clear. There were a lot of light planes in the air. I was on break and standing outside the building with another analyst. I said, &#34;Whoa, did you see that?&#34;  She didn&#39;t see it.  She was looking at the ground, and by time I finished my question, and she looked up, it was gone. This object seemed to come from the northeast (from the Trenton area) toward Philadelphia, south-southeast. It was somewhere between 9-10 PM. I don&#39;t remember looking at my watch but it was dark out. Two weeks later, while listening to the Art Bell show, a man called in who happened to mention that he observed the same object, at the same time, on the same date, in Philadelphia. By the way, none of the criteria below apply to what I saw, unless you consider the glow to be an aura or haze. I have reported this to Linda Moulton Howe.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this object.<n>

However, since they were flying to the northeast, it is not at all clear why they should disappear from sight.  Satellites disappear from sight during the evening hours because they are coursing AWAY from the sun.  During the morning hours, they are flying TOWARD the sun, so unless the sky is light, they should not disappear from sight.))<n>

I was at work and we were outside taking a break when I saw a giant flash of light in the sky it was 50 times bigger then any star in the sky and lasted about 2 or 3 seconds. At around 02:00 am I was looking up in the sky where I saw the flash and an object that at first I thought was a shooting star was flying across the sky at a high rate of speed it took about 5 to 7 seconds to cross the entire sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting at a picnic table facing ESE when an incredible huge flash of light appeared 2 of the 3 of us saw it and tried to figure what it could have been. It was bright white and seemed orange/red in the middle it was probably two thirds the size of the moon it lasted about two to three seconds and was gone. About ten to fifteen minutes later I was scaning the sky about where I saw the light when out of the south west an object traveling at an unbeleivable pace crossed the sky heading northeast it took about five to seven seconds to cross the sky I watched it until it disappeared . It was what I thought to be a falling star based on the speed and the color but it didnt burn out like a falling star it just kept going.<n>

Glowing bright like lightning, and getting dimmer and farther away.  Coming back at a fast rate and disapearing.  This all elapsed in a 5 minute range.  The thing is that the whole sky was dark overcast.  Which means the object had only between 7,000-10,000ft to manouver around in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happend at 00:25hrs on Monday, August 16/1999.  I was at my home out in the country almost falling asleep in my room.  My sister came down stairs (which she rarely does), knocked on my door telling me to come up stairs fast and look at this &#34;thing&#34; in the sky.  I got up and not really beliving in this whole space craft thing,  I was kinda interested.  I ran into the living room and looked out the bay windows and saw nothing.  Then she started calling me from the kitchen.  I ran into the kitchen and looked out the side window.  In the distance there was an object floating around the city.  I just thought it was a plane getting ready to land.  But dont planes have differn&#39;t colours flikering off the back wings? This was a really bright white light flikering really fast in a solid outburst.  My sister said that it went really bright, almost like when lightning flashes.  All of a sudden it started coming back towards our home.  It hovard around our area for a while (ruffly 2mins).  The night was all overcast and the clouds were very low.  This object was below them, so it would have to be about 2000-4000 ft above ground.  The object was getting brighter and brighter, almost lighting up the sky around itself.  Started moving really fast South West and getting brighter and then it felt like it went behind some trees.  It was completely gone.  Since then nothing has happend.<n>

One pointed out what we thought at first was a plane. All that could be seen was a blue ring of light that looked to be at a very high altitude. When we all managed to see it far up, it suddenly accelerated our line of vision, then as quickly as it started to accelerate, it stopped in mid air, and then zoomed backwards in a semi-circular motion. After this it accelerated again at a fantastic speed back in the original direction. Later on one (circa 15mins) of my friends saw it again returning toward the direction from which it originally came, again at a fantastic speed. Before the rest of us could locate it in the sky this time it was too late and had gone. Initially we were trying to justify what we saw, for instance lasers from a local nightclub, however we could see these as a shaft light led from the source up to the sky. It certainly was not anything man made that the general public are aware of, especially considering the speed at which it accelerated, stopped and then changed direction. Description: could not see any detail at all, condidering it was late and it was most likely very high up.m What we did see was a light blue ring of light the cntre of which was indiscernible from the night sky. The blue colour was quite  similar to the hyperlink colour on this page (where it says &#34;Click here to see examples&#34;) although bright like a light and not a dull colour. The ring of light was basically all we could see, and it probably was a perfect circle. The friends I was with included a psychiatric nurse and a news editor (my cousin), whereas I was a student at the time, although now I work for an investment bank. This is genuine, however it is not worth contacting me, as these really are all the details that have. Email me if need be though.<n>

There I saw in a left to right diagonal pattern a &#34;fireball&#34; type object that was first white, then red, green orange and then appeared to have &#34;hit&#34; the earth with a large white flash. The event lasted no more than 3-4 seconds.  It was impossible to tell how far away it was, and I immediately thought it was a meteor that had burned up, and maybe even impacted.  I turned the AM news on and in about 15 minutes, heard a new report that others had seen it too.  Then the local Denver talk radio station made this event its topic for the next few hours. I called the station from a pay phone and told them what I had seen. After, I saw a newspaper article that had listed the phenomena to a meteor. I told friends and family of the event and had not really thought about it until Sat. March 24, 2001 when I was attending the Aztec UFO Symposium in Aztec NM, and a person got up and told of his sighting on the same night and same time.  I was encouraged to report my sighting by one of the presenters at the symposium. My sighting was on a very clear night and with no city lights nearby to dilute the image. I don&#39;t recall the moon location or if it was visible. I have seen many meteors in my life as I have always regularly wathched the Persiods showers and other events, but have never seen a flash, colors and trajectory as I did that night in August 1999. My backrgound is I  have a masters degree and am the Director of a Student Union at a college in Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with this individual on 24MR01 at the Aztec Symposium.

The length of travel of the radian  segment of the event was also about two full moon diameters.the event occurred sometime around 11:15 PM on the 15th of August,99. I do not know the time to the exact minute, but the program I was watching on TV was about half way into the 1st half-hour segment when I went outside to see what our dog was barking for. It was then that I saw the event. Measurement by protractor revealed the event to have been centered about 25-30 degrees above the western horizon in azimuth, and compass measurement revealed its heading to be 320 to 325 degrees magnetic. The total event lasted no more than 4 seconds. Because of the position of some tree branches, I was able to make these measurements to plus or minus 2.5  degrees of accuracy. I am a dentist by profession, and also hold an FAA Airline Pilot Certificate, with over 6,800 hours of flight time. Much of the flight time is night time, and due to various situations I have driven thousands of hours at night, and I have an abiding interest in the night sky; as such I have seen hundreds of meteors. I have never seen one like this one. Though difficult to put into words, this one had a deciedly different character to it. It is almost as if the event took place in slow motion. The width of the streak was much wider compared to its length than any other that I have ever observed, by quite a proportion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Individual has extensive experience in the field of aviation.

It was very dark and I was facing north-northwest, admiring the Milkyway galaxy.  Suddenly the whole earth lit up.  The trees in front of me were bright green.  My natural instinct was to search for the source of the light.  It was coming from over my right  shoulder.  I turned to my right and saw a brownish trail or streak.  The huge bluish white brilliant light was about the size of a full moon.  Instantly, the light went behind some spotty clouds.  (There were gaps between the little clouds.)  Then spikes of radiation flashed off of the bluish white ball.  The spikes spanned from horizon to horizon.  The ball disappeared and the sky and the earth fell dark.  I was stunned remembering the magnitude of the spikes that shot from east to west then fell downward like an umbrella, or like cat&#39;s claws.  They were curved. I am an audiovisual  engineer and electronics technician.  Sound is my profession.  I waited for at least 10 minitues for a sonic boom or some atmospheric disturbance,but nothing happened,  It was silent.  I heard crickets and there was some kind of night bird churping away.  The sound of the night seemed to magnify!  Trying to comprehend the speed and time that this all took place left me in a state of shock for several days.  It must have taken place outside of our atmosphere because there was no sonic boom, etc.  This dramatically multiplies the distance covered in a few split seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and he seems to us to be an excellent witness.

The hostess is a policewoman, and sometimes I tune in to hear the truckers who call in to her; their world is so different from mine, and I like to listen to their thoughts. At about 11:15 or so, she started getting faxes and calls from folks who had seen what your guys tonight saw… calls from Wyoming to Texas to Utah to New Mexico.  I emailed ((name deleted))about it and CC&#39;d Art. I&#39;ll bet if you contact KOA you might be able to get a tape of last Sunday&#39;s show… The name of the hostess is Donna Starr, I believe.

We had just come from getting a soda at 7-11 on the corner of Queen and Geary in Albany.  We turned left down Pacific Blvd., the main drag in town.  We were in the middle lane in front of ((business name deleted))Motors when I spotted a large glowing sphere.  I kept staring at it, all most coming to a complete stop in the middle of the road.  I asked my husband if he saw the same thing I did.  He said &#34;Holy ((dleleted))!  What is that?&#34;  I all most hit another car driving beside me.  They saw me staring at the sky and they looked up at it.  They all most went off the road staring at it too.  We took the next immediate left, which is between a B.P. gas station and an Arco gas station.  We got to the stop sign and sat there for about two minutes watching it trying to decide which direction it was going because we wanted to follow it.  It stopped and hovered for about one minute.  Then it approached us.  So we decided to drive forward to get underneath it.  We cut straight across Santiam Hwy. through an apartment complex.  We then turned left again onto Hill St. heading south, never losing sight of the object.  I flashed my highbeams at it at the encouragement of my husband.  My son was in the back seat saying, &#34;Mommy!  Daddy!  Do you see that!&#34;  As we followed it, we saw a plane flying up quickly from the north heading south towards the obeject that was still just hovering above us.  It quickly darted south and when the plane got to where the sphere appeared to be hovering, it vanished.  It was all most as if it shut the light out.  We sat at the stop light on the corner of Hill St. and Queen Ave. looking at each other.  My mouth was hanging open and I finally asked my husband, &#34;Did we just see what I think we saw?&#34;  He smiled and replied &#34;I think we just saw a definate U.F.O.&#34;  There is no other way to describe it because it was unidentified and it was flying.  The sphere was a glowing orange-amber color.  Sort of like warm candle ligh! t.  We were amazed at the speed it appeared to have.  It was very quick.  It was quiet as well.  No noise.  I think about it now and it&#39;s giving me goose bumps.  I felt compelled to follow the thing.  The feeling was so overwhelming.  My husband was the same way.  I just wanted to get closer to it for some reason.<n>

Sandia National Laboratories observed this object on a fisheye-lens camera which they use to view the entire sky. The video was shown on Albuquerque television. The object was so bright that it saturated the camera; the entire sky turned white.<n>

We were just outside of town and drove up a dirt road that put us into the northwest shadow of Tower Mtn.  We could see the finger shaped rocks that you cannot see from the Dishman-Mica area.  We found a spot and did our business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we were just relaxing on a blanket in a field on a hillside looking up at the stars.  We noticed a small star that would move rapidly in a straight line one direction not very far at all then stop abruptly and change its trajectory.  This went on for a few minutes and we decided to bail, quickly, and drove back to her parent’s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot recall the conversation we had on the drive, I do recall driving fast down that dirt road though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was at work and my closest co-worker, a few years older than me, asked me if I had seen anything strange in the sky.  Our sightings were very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it so clearly.<n>

I would lay down on the picnic table on the patio with a tube pillow under my head,(to keep from getting a kink in my neck) and binoculars on my chest..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the local ABC 11 o&#39;clock news, my husband was already asleep, having gone to bed several hours before, (his illness forces him to get a-lot of sleep) anyway I know I looked at the clock at 11:15 PM when I opened the patio glass sliding doors and went outside...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid on the table for what seemed like about 10 minutes, checking out the stars and planets etc, and then I got up and walked around the patio to get a different perspective of the sky.. all the sudden I looked down the back side of the house (NE SIDE) back of house was facing North, and said out-loud but to myself, &#34;I need to go make sure my bedroom window is closed it might rain&#34;, keep in mind this was August our hottest month of the year, and there was not a chance in Hell of getting any rain..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came into the house and walked down the hall to my bedroom, to go in and check the windows, the door to the room was almost closed so I reached for the door handle to push it open and the door SLAMMED in my face with a loud noise, I thought &#34; it was a draft from the open window&#34; I put my hand on the door to open it and could not turn the knob, I pushed against it, and pulled on it, yelled at it and kicked it, the door was locked, then I remembered that we do not have any room locks on the bedroom doors....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember yelling for my husband who is a light sleeper to come and help me, nothing... then I called him again, again nothing so finally I walked away from the door across the hall and went in and bodily shook him awake and he seemed that he was drugged I explained to him what was happening and finally got up and he too tried to open the bedroom door, pulling and pushing.. finally it opened..and one of the cats slipped into the room and came running out growling with a full bottlebrush tail, I went into the room and I felt a bit of vertigo but that’s all... I looked at my bedroom clock and it was 2:15 AM, it had been over 3 hours since I went outside, but it seemed like only about 20-30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the window and it was closed (no surprise) and then I noticed there was a box on the floor, it had been sitting under the window on the window-seat and it was about 1-2 feet away from the window-seat upside down on the floor, but the contents were not on the floor, nothing was spilled, I am not sure how that was done.. (all that was in the box was ET reports and information)  Finally I got the cats calmed down, husband went back to bed and I shut and locked the patio doors and laid down on the couch, I was barely dozing when my husband yelled from the bedroom... I ran in to see what was the problem and he said &#34;Something is touching me&#34;, I asked him what it was, cats were not in the room, he said &#34;I don&#39;t know but I could hear a buzzing sound and when I closed my eyes I could see blue and red lights moving around the room through the crack in my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said they were not totally closed. He also said &#34;I could not move&#34; I said &#34;Why didn&#39;t you open your eyes?&#34; and I think he thought I had lost my mind, he said he did not want to see them,he lay back down and about 10 minutes later he was in the living room standing by the couch.. I said &#34; what do you want?&#34; he said &#34; I do not want to sleep in there tonight, they keep coming back and touching me&#34;  The next morning except for the episode with the door he didn&#39;t seem to remember any of the happenings.. he had multiple small scoop ( bb size) marks on his arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On several occasions my husband as I said who is a light sleeper did not respond to my calls for help or assistance, and he did not get up in the night and find me missing when I was not there..  I personally believe that is the intention of the Et&#39;s to keep him sleeping when they are busy with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CK 8/1999 ©<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

What are those things!? I&#39;m standind in a field over the beach in Montauk where I had camped for the night. It&#39;s approximately 11:00 PM, I&#39;m tending the fire, after just having finished dinner . Now, I&#39;m staring at two, very large,  golden, circular orbs at low altitude over the water. Like giant &#34;goofballs&#34; over the ocean.  &#34;Heck, I just got into the beer,&#34; I thought--can&#39;t be that. They were the brightest lights I&#39;d ever seen, yet they didn&#39;t really exude much light,  they more like retracted it. No glare, there should&#39;ve been a trail of light five  miles long on the water surface. After five minutes, they kind of flickered out, only to reappear in the same spot ten minutes later. I estimate they stayed on for another ten minutes, then went out for good.  Couldn&#39;t have been giant flares, flares would be fired at a high altitude,  then streak down gradually, and give off alot of glare on water. Later, I found that someone had seen the exact same thing in Montauk, only a couple of months before I did. This can be looked up in the archives section at &lt;http://www.((html deleted))&gt; I also found these orbs reported in a UFO magazine as being seen in Phoenix, AZ, and associated with the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34; The truth is out there somewhere, and I want to believe, because I know what I saw, and I know that it is stranger than fiction...............…<n>

I verified that I checked out a movie on that day recently.  I thought the flash was a helicopter doing a search, which was odd in itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had checked out the movie &#34;You&#39;ve Got Mail&#34; on August 15, and started to watch it around 10-10:30 PM.  I was well into a fourth or half of the movie (around 10-11 PM), when I saw a bright flash through my 2 skylights in my home.  The skylights are facing West. I thought it was a helicopter flying around at night doing a search.  The bright flash startled me that I jumped from my couch.  As I looked through the clear skylights, I could see the clouds very well-defined in the sky.  I then realized that it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter because it does not that the capability to illuminate the sky and I didn&#39;t hear the loud,annoying noise of a helicopter.  After looking through the skylights at the clouds, I ran into my bedroom and tried to wake my husband to tell him what I&#39;ve seen. He was too sleepy to get up and check. I looked out and the night was calm and quiet. I live in a quiet, bedroom community south of Albuquerque, NM (approx. 15 minutes South of Albuquerque).  I&#39;m reporting this now because a week ago, the local AM news station on the radio (770 KKOB) was running &#34;The Best of Art Bell&#34; at midnight, when I heard about the 3 second illumination of the night sky.  At first, I didn&#39;t think anything of it and was just interested. Then they mentioned that this illumination happened around mid-August.  August 17 is my annivesary and I remember I checked out &#34;You&#39;ve Got Mail&#34; a few days prior. For some reason, the date of August 18th stuck in my head as being the<n>
8/15/99 22:30|Jenks|OK|Light|30 seconds|Three satellite-looking-lights moving in triangular formation.|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08662.html|149|ndxe199908| Three satellite-looking-lights moving in triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a meteor watcher since I was a kid, for more than 35 years (I am 42).  In the last few years, it seems that I have seen more satellites than meteors and too often, satellites (i.e. moving points of light in the sky) that just seem to fade in and then fade out.  Probably explainable but still odd.  Lately, it seems that meteors are even more scarce.  That having been said, this is what happened on Sunday night. It was 9:45pm CDT and I had just sat down on my deck which faces south though I was sitting facing SE.  My house sits two miles directly south of Jones/Riverside airport, considered a &#34;small&#34; airport though I believe it gets more takeoffs and landings than Tulsa International, 10 miles to the north.  So I see lots of airplanes.  Again, I had just sat down and looked up over my left shoulder and noticed a &#34;moving point of light&#34; or a MPOL, at my 11 o&#39;clock position or so.  It was like a medium bright star (sky was very clear and somewhat crisp) moving from north to south, but no sooner than I saw it (near the constilation Cygnus) that it began to brighten.  In about 2 seconds it got so bright that it felt like a beam shining directly into my eyes.  For an instant, I thought it was an airplane banking and heading right toward me with its beacon almost blinding me.  But as quickly as it brightened, it started fading and within five seconds or so had disappeared.  I then got my binoculars, feeling that if anything else happened, I would see it up close. (A note:  my binoculars are 10x50 Jason, but have been so abused that I always cover one end and use the left side more like a telescope.  It works, but not sure how that effects the optics.) About 30 minutes later, I saw a MPOL moving from north to south, this time with a strobe.  I saw it naked eye, straight overhead, then with my binocs I saw it had a two second strobe.  I was able to see it for about 10 seconds but I could tell that after each strobe, it was dimmer and dimmer until it just faded out.  This happened twice more in about 15 minutes, with a dim but solid light going N to S and then with another &#34;strober&#34; going W to E.  Seeing four of these MPOL&#39;s in about 30 min. time was really strange to me and my history of viewing the sky. Strange in that they ALL faded away. But about 10:30pm, I saw, again, a medium bright &#34;star&#34; moving slowly from NW to SE, in my 10 or 11 o&#39;clock position, almost going straight down from my perspective.  When I focussed my binocs on this MPOL, I tried to use a couple of stars in my view field to make sure this other one was really moving. Then I noticed that these other two &#34;stars&#34; were also moving.  The three lights,all the same brightness were moving together in the same direction at the same speed. I do not believe that they were physically connected and it wasnt a solid object for I could see stars in between the point star and the two parallel stars that were trailing.  They formed a triangle with legs being about 3 times as long as the distance between the two trailing lights, a thin but long legged triangle shape moving in the direction of the point.  I watched for maybe 5-10 seconds before lowering my binocs to get an overall look at the sky, but I couldn&#39;t see anything odd with my naked eye.  When I raised the binocs again, I could only re-locate the two trailing lights still moving together in the same direction as before.  Although I assume these to be the same two, something seemed different about them, but I am not sure what.  Less than five seconds later, these two lights faded from view, still far from the horizon where I might expect them to fade away. By now my heart was really pumping.  I didn&#39;t know what I would see next.  And I didn&#39;t see anything for over an hour but about 11:45pm, I started seeing meteors.  After my long  meteor drought, even during last weeks shower (I worked graveyard shift so peak night I only got to view during short brks) I saw four meteors in the ESE part of the sky, all in about 10 minutes.  All going more or less to the south. Then at about midnight, I was going to call it a night.  I looked at the patch of sky where the three lights had been (now much further to my west) and saw one last beauty of a meteor, right where they had been. With my binocs, I can barely see, at the same time, the 2nd and 3rd stars in the handle of the Big Dipper.  It was only a little bit easier to get all three moving lights in my field at the same time.  I suppose that would give you an idea of the distance between the point and the two trailing lights.  Again, my binocs are used more like a telescope. I must say again, when I realized what I was seeing, I was on the border of being really scared.  If they had not disappeared so quickly, well, I&#39;m not sure what I would have done. Hope this wasn&#39;t a waste of your time.<n>

We kept our eyes on it the whole time and it never moved from its position.  As we got right underneath the light, it shot off really fast toward the west.  It went from just hovering to rapidly accelorating to very high speeds.  We couldn&#39;t keep up with it so we lost sight of the object.  When we got back on Route 30, there was no light like we had seen just a few minutes before.  There were some airplanes and some stars but no bright,low-lying lights.<n>

We both saw a light traveling through the clouds then two more lights followed, each light about 2 or 3 seconds apart. They were traveling quite fast and were about 800 feet above us.  There was no noise or any change in direction.  We only saw each light for about 3 seconds each.  We only saw the light through the dark clouds in the sky.  I really don&#39;t believe in extraterestrial UFOs, but I know this wasn&#39;t an ordianary experience.<n>

It was a very clear night and the sky was fileld with stars. I noticed this bright light object in the distance which was probably (from my sight) the size of half a penny, maybe a little smaller. It definitly was not a plane. It was bright and heading straight up, it was quite far so the actual speed is unknown, but it must have been moving fast, I pointed the object out to my friends who were also stunned. We were facing north at the time of the incident.

The object was low on the horizon. As I write this now I can hear several loud aircraft in the background out my window. The object had no distinguishable characteristics other than being a ball of light, if I were to guess at the size of the object, I would say that it was probably the size of a large or medium sized helicopter. What caught my attention was the speed and VERY sudden accelerations and changes of trajecory that it made. I have seen many military craft flying at different altitudes and none of them ever approached this level of speed and directional change. At this moment I can see no less than 3 helicopters out my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Since the witness is close to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, he may have been looking to the east.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright blinking light makes high speed &#34;C&#34; shaped manuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the time and date information are guesses. I know that it was in the summer of 99, either july or august, and in the evening about an hour after sundown, which would have made it between 9 and 10 pm. Now keep in mind that my location is close to sevral airports and military bases, but what I, my brother and friend of 18 years saw could be in no way mistaken for an airplane. It first appeared as a bright steady whitish blue light in the sky to the north. It cought my attension because it was much brighter than any star, especially with the glare of the street lights making most lesser stars not visible. My brother and I watched it for about 3 minutes when It began to blink. In all this time it made no noise and remained stationary. It would blink steadily for about thirty seconds before it stopped and returned to steady light. It did this for about 2 minutes before it abruptly shot upward in a C pattern curving to the left and then back to the right as if tracing a C from bottom to top at a very very fast speed then blinked out and was gone.I wish I had a camcorder. It&#39;s not the first time my brother and I have seen oddly acting lights in the sky around here. Most of them have happened between 95 and 2000, but I don&#39;t jump to tell people these things. but would have posted on this forum had I known about it at the time. I would like to also tell some of my other sightings, but I fear that since I have had at least 7 of them in the past 5 years I might be thought of as a hoaxer, but I can assure you I am not, and the things I have seen are not so extrodinary that they don&#39;t at lease in some ways resembe other sightings. My life has been full of strange, and frightening paranormal and extra terrestrial experiences, and of all the thought I have given it, I still have no solid belief as to what&#39;s going on. Ironically the truth is most likely much stranger than speculation.<n>

One night I was taking my garbage out and as I walked out my door I looked up and saw an amazing site. A huge object was very low in the sky, moving east to west, at a tremendous speed but making no noise. There were many different colored lights all around it flashing in a circular pattern. I ran around my building to keep site of it and it was going so fast I could hardly see it within about 10 seconds. I have never seen anything move so fast but what really freaked me out was the fact there was no noise. I just saw the video on Yahoo about the UFO sightings in Stephenville, TX and the deer hunter made the statement about the object being fast and not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to get this off my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

However, we were lucid enough that I would have felt comfortable going out into public without fear.  We were teenagers at the time (ages 19-20),  and I am now a responsible adult (an Air Force veteran and a college graduate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that being said, here&#39;s my account of what happened.  The three of us (I am female, my two friends were male) were standing around in my friend&#39;s driveway talking while I was smoking a cigarette.  The area we lived in was VERY rural.  I will refer the friend who lived on this property as W2 from this point forward.  W2&#39;s home was on a dirt road that ran for approximately ten miles.  The road housed approximately twenty homes, most of the land was used for either corn farming or growing pine trees for a local paper mill.  A river runs paralell to most of the road, the river lies approximately 1.5 miles north of W2&#39;s home which faced north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While talking, I noticed three bright green beams of light that originated to the north, almost directly in front of us.  I would estimate that their origin was somewhere between W2&#39;s house and the river that I discussed previously.  If they were any further north, it couldn&#39;t have been by much.  Also, the area past the river is more populated (relatively speaking), and there is a mountain there.  If the lights had originated in this area, they would have appeared more elevated than they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the lights, and attempted to ignore them for fear that it was some sort of mild hallucination.  However, a few minutes passed and our conversation fell dead silent.  It was at this point that W2 stopped and asked, &#34;Okay, what the hell is that?  Do ya&#39;ll see it?&#34;  At this point, myself and W3 responded that we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we established that all three of us were seeing it, we discussed it for the rest of the duration we were outside (maybe three more minutes, we watched the lights for abotu ten minutes total).  The lights looked like the spotlights that are used at business openings, except there were three of them and they were very bright green.  The middle  light was pointing straight up, and the other two lights flanked the middle light at perfectly matching approximate 30 degree angles.  The lights never moved.  We were spooked at this point, and went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights could have been the powerful lights used by hunters, except I can not imagine one of those lights being that bright from such a distance.  Also, these lights were green and at perfect angles to each other.  Using spotlights to hunt deer is illegal, and I can&#39;t imagine any hunter wanting to draw such attention to his illegal deer hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that the date and time given is approximate.  I know that it was in the late summer of 1999, and I know that it was after dark but before midnight when it happened (we didn&#39;t stay over at my friend&#39;s house past midnight).<n>

Judging by the distance it was from me I would have to guess it was as large as a football field in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my eyes off it for a second because I was driving, when I looked again it had changed shape to a triangle and three bright lights took the place of the amber lights.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to pull over to have a good look at what this was, when there was a bright flash that lit up the tree tops.  When I look at where the object was it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> No there was no sound.  At first I thought I was looking at a giant air plane because the amber lights were outlined in the shape of a commercial jet, but huge.  I have seen other occurrences here also but did not want to report them because they are weird.  Two others to be exact.  Bath shipyards are here in bath where they build destroyers for the navy. Missile destroyers.  I worked at the shipyard at the time of the sightings.<n>

I kept looking, but I ws not seeing anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw an intense orange ball of fire, that appeared to be stationary.  Then it would fade and reappear. Since this occurred over the Barry Goldwater Air Force range, I passed this off as a military flare, or experimental craft.  But then I remember reading that military flares emit a white light.  I didn&#39;t really think much of it, and I am not ready to call it a UFO. but I admit that I did see something that I have not seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous; date is approximate.

The sun was coming down and it didn&#39;t appear to have any lights on but was reflecting sunlight.   It was completely still in the sky. I showed my husband, who was also very confused by the object.  It was like nothing we&#39;ve ever seen before.   I watched the object for several minutes before I saw it move very abruptly and FAST across the sky.  I located the object again and then saw a military plane come up and investigate the object and then the object disappeared very quickly.  This was very close to Pearson Airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very high in the sky so it&#39;s very hard to approximate the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later we were watching a show about UFO&#39;s and saw a video of a UFO in Gulf Breeze, Florida that looked exactly like the object we saw.

SEE DETAILED REPORT<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangular Object - 8-15-1999 At about 5:55 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. CDT my wife Karen and I were driving west bound on US Highway 64 about half way between Memphis, TN, and Bald Knob, AR, or about 75 miles west of Memphis, Tn.  We were very near and just to the east of McCrory, AR, we saw the following: We witnessed a triangular shaped object in the western sky above the town over McCrory.  It was about the size of a man&#39;s thumbnail, if your arm was fully extended.  It was on it&#39;s side (?) as we could see all three points of the triangle at the same time.  It was white not silver in color. The strange part of this sighting is that it was moving (in my opinion) slow but it left a streak or trail behind it - as wide as what it was.  I viewed it for about 10 to 15 seconds, my wife for 5 to 10 seconds - the tail extended from one side of our windshield (passenger side) to almost directly in front of the drive.  It then vanished - not just the object, but the trail as well.  There was no trace of anything. The object was traveling to the south; it was a clear sky.  It was about 15 to 20 degrees above the road or horizon.

It was a clear summer day, not a cloud in the sky.  I saw a bright white or reflective object very high in the sky, I would say 30,000 feet or about the same height as commercial airliners.  What made this object unusual was its size and speed.  Although I couldnt make any detail out of it I could tell it wasnt very big.  Its speed was what i found amazing.  For me the best way to describe it is to be standing behind a missile as it was lauched off a airplane and all you could see was the orange glow of its thrust as it dissapear, it moved that fast.  except this object didnt have a orange glow, no smoke or no contrails.  I watched this object dissapear over the horizon, the hole event only lasted a little over a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We thought at first maybe a bird had hit a power line and was electrictuted.  My husband looked in his rear view mirrow and said he saw a streak then saw alot of smoke.. So we turned the truck around and headed back by this time there was a pretty good size fire.  We looked all around and saw there were no power poles involed or any dead birds around.. Another car pulled up and ask what happened. I breifly told them what we heard and saw. They said they saw something up high and then all of a sudden if fell and they then saw the smoke also.. but he said it didnt look like an object just something in the air.. the sun would of been directly in front of him so maybe this interfiered with what he saw.. this was also about the time of the ending of the metor shower in aug.. I was wonder if it could of been a metor.. My husband walked over to the fire chief and tried to explain to him was we heard and saw but the fire chief just blew him off like he was a kook or something... I dont ever think I will forget that sound or the strange color light I saw... It is still hard to explain.

It was the size of the wing of the plane, about 20 feet.

As it continued our way, but slightly northwest of us, it would travel slowly, periodicaly jolting forward, but never changing altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it traveled from the mountain range, at first from a distance it did look as though it could have been a very large balloon, and was a dark metallic color (like Black Chrome... but not as shiney) but was not round or teardrop , as it got closer it looked a bit like a pyramidic bubble, rotating randomly on no certain axis, and possibly the size of a school bus (this would be at a distance less than a quarter mile north of us, and at the same altitude stated, I know we had to look upward)<n> <n><n> <n><n> as it passed it seamed to pick up speed and headed more northeast, it must have begun moving much faster, because it was out of sight quicker than the time it took to reach our vacinity from the mountains.<n>

It remained as white and square as it first appeared.  I was so shocked that I failed to note the time, direction or even the date of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In seconds, it disappeared behind one of the clouds.  It almost looked as if the could moved in front of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was on the same level as my eyes, so I knew it was nothing close to the ground or the mountains.  I cannot recall whether it was over the mountains, or whether it was north.  My sense tells me that it was over the Olympic mountains, but I just am not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a legal secretary/wordprocessor for many years.

I was in a vast, open field which looked like wheat grass.  Night turned to day, and I could see the clouds and trees.  It was like the morning sunrise.  I could hear the grass swishing in the wind.

Adams area caught everyone&#39;s attention.  It at first appeared to be just a satellite(small and white) and we watched it for about 5 seconds when it began inflating into a perfect sphere of solid brilliant orange light which was at least 3-4 times it&#39;s original size. It continued in the same direction and same speed displaying this absolutely gorgeous brilliant orange light-so bright that it was fire ballish in brilliance. The orange light  was absolutely opaque displaying a well defined crisp spherical shape, the light was extremely concentrated and brilliant. There was no hazy light  or fan out around the object, there was no tail.  It continued to travel as this inflated fireball for 5-10 seconds. It then deflated and returned to it&#39;s original satellite appearance (small and white) for another 5-10 seconds until it faded into the night sky. It did not change speed or direction.<n>

Was a member of a UFO Club for a short time around 1967 called Project Blue Star. I&#39;m ex- military and am familiar with many aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my driveway at 11pm on the night of Aug 14, 1999,  when I first saw two objects at 2 o&#39;clock move from east to west at a high rate of speed almost straight overhead.  Their altitude seemed to be above jets and below satellites. They were offset by a short distance and I could not tell if there were 2 objects or one.  Did not see an outline of a craft that the orbs were attached to.  They were about the size of a quarter at arms length and were perfect circles, they had no fuzzy edges to them.  They had their own light source - yellow/orange. It was like I was watching a cartoon on a huge screen!  I had a small 20x scope with me but I knew that if I tried to find them, they would have disappeared before I could focus in on them, so I observed them with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting lasted about 5 seconds or so and disappeared in the distance (not over the horizon).  They appeared to maneuver around each other slightly as they disappeared. Heard no sound and the weather was warm and clear.  Stayed out until around midnight but saw nothing else except satellites and an occasional plane/jet.  It certainly was not a conventional aircraft.<n>

The object hovered and darted back and forth in an erratic manner.  I watch the sky almost nightly, I knew right away this was no star. After watching this light for more than half an hour it suddenly moved to the south (towards me) until it appeared to be about the size of a nickel at arms length and began to glow very brightly.  At the same time the entire area lit up like daylight, as if someone were taking flash photographs five or six times in succesion. The object itself was so bright I was still seeing red spots the next day.<n>

The other one came later about 1 1/2min later same speed and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were outside trying to see some shooting stars and we saw three satellites this night and all of a sudden we saw two fuzzy looking meteorites, we thought, traveling east to west and one following the other. I did not have the binoculars at the time and when we saw the two I brought the glasses outside and waited to see something.  Then out of the same direction came another fuzzy object and this time I focused the binoculars and it turned out to be a circle with a very slight orange glow. I could completely see the disk. It had no lights, not leaving a trail, no noise just going very fast and they were about 75 to 80 degrees from the horizon.  Looks like the last one was trying to catchup with the other two. They passed almost above us coming from Dallas going west. I will never feel the same anymore.<n>

It was moving slowly and was not a shooting star or the lights on a plane.  It was about 10 times larger than the brightest star in the sky.  It was traveling horizontally and remained in sight about 8 - 10 seconds before it went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on our deck about l0:00 pm leaning back in a lounge chair and looking up at the night sky.  A bright light suddenly apeared directly overhead travelling from the northwest towards the southeast.  It looked just like a bright flash of light that remained in sight much longer than a flash should is the best I can describe it. It was in my sight for about 8 - 10 seconds.  It was moving steadily and not very fast like a shooting star would travel.  It was one large light about the light density and size of 10 times the brightest star in the sky at the time. The distance that it travelled was equal to the distance from my index finger to my thumb held at arms length.  It appeared instantly, moving slowly, and then went out instantly. I live near a small airport and have seen airplanes fly over my house at night so my first thought was that it was a plane. I then realized I had never seen a light on a plane that was that big or that bright, or a light that turned on and then turned off like that.  It was travelling away from the airport and not towards the direction of the airport. I could not hear a plane and can hear the planes that take off and come in to land that pass over my house. We recently had 4th of July fireworks going off around town and it was not like a flare, rocket or fireworks--it did not go up and then down.  It appeared to be high, directly overhead and moved horizontally in a straight line before it disappeared.  It did not disappear from going out of sight into the distance but seemed to just turn off while still directly overhead.<n>

The craft was darting very quickly across I-10 as we approached from the north.  My son was asleep in the back seat and I woke him to look.  The craft at one point got along side of the car and then &#34;shot&#34; at a very high speed parallel to the interstate..as if it was racing the cars.  At least two times, the craft seemed to stop in mid air and then spin, moving in the opposite direction.  I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed to watch but was too stunned to stop.  I saw only one car pulled to the side.  All others were going very slowing on the interstate.  I know what I saw and it was real.  I wish the other poster would contact me by email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Three rotating lime green orbs emitting green light beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we witnessed in Vancouver Washington started with the sighting of the green orbs that appeared to pulse, and or, rotate. Then, approximately 10 minutes later the beams appeared to be connecting to each orb.  I was really surprised to find this other report that occurred the same night so similar to ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was revisiting our old report today from 12 yrs ago to see if anyone had added anything over all the years and there was nothing new on your site , and then googled &#34;ufo sightings august 1999&#34; and found the wisconsin incident.  This is fascinating to me because I´ve never heard of a sighting like ours before, but, these people experienced the same thing, only two hrs. before us, clear across the country.  Also, on August 13th 1999 at 22:15 in Montecello Iowa, someone reported  to your site a green ball streaking across the sky.<n>

Shortly after checking my email, I was turned to watch the movie when I caught a fast moving light passing through the branches of a tree in our front yard when I first took notice.  Thanks to my astronomy class I took in college, I can say that it was at about 75 degrees in the western sky travelling to the west, northwest and dissapeared at around 45 degrees(with of course 90 degrees being straight above my head).  I live in a small town of 3500 people and not far from our downtown area with pleanty of light polution to boot, more than you would think.  This fireball was five times brighter than any meteor I saw during the meteor showers last night that I viewed from my drive way.  And the color was bright, almost a neon green.  Might I also add, it was an incredible sight and I practically kicked myself when I saw it.  I was in awe and disappointment that no one else was around to see it with me. I am a 20 year old college student majoring in film and media studies with a minor in psych and go to the U of Iowa in Iowa City and am home currently on summer break.  I&#39;m moving back to school over this week.  I&#39;m an amatuer, amatuer astronomer wanna be and heard about this site through Art Bell which I am an avid fan.  Just wanted to do my part and report this.  Please excuse my typos due to it being very late.  Thanks.<n>

I wached for approx. one half min hopping it would get to the next stars so I could see if they were covered but we were having a lot of low, fast moving, puffy clouds and it was covered before I could see if it was solid.  I checked DLR and there were no satilites going that direction at that time.<n>

My friend and I were sitting at the edge of the lake when my friend noticed a zig-zagging light rapidly approaching over the tree line.  It zigged its way over to the lake, stopped, and while hovering (silently) just across the bay from us - lit up the lake with what looked like a strong searchlight beam.  It lit up the lake for about 30 seconds and then turned the beam off, hovered, then suddenly took off diagonally skywards at a speed we&#39;d never seen before.  We watched until it disappeared from view. Oddly enough, we then went straight to our tents and slept through the night.  Due to the strong beam, we could not accurately see its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This trip took me up the coast into a very unpopulated wilderness area on the island very unexcessable unless by four wheel drive.  In the night I saw what seemed like a falling star, but intstead of burning out it stopped suddenly in mid flight, pausing it shoot in eratic angles several times before disapearing into the night sky.  I was just wondering if there where any air bases in the Corpus Christi, South Texas area that might have experimental aircraft testing. There isno wayconventional aircraft could have made the manuevers I saw.  I was so amazed by the sight, that I yelled out to all the campers with me to look at what I was seeing.  This was on exactly the night of Aug the 12th.  I am curious if anyone else has reported what I saw and if it is conected to the military, it could have been experimental aircraft or a antimissile testing.<n>

This event was real and I was with my girlfriend at the time and another friend . So the 3 of us were there and we all saw the same thing .. and honestly it was very disturbing. This event was on the banks of lake Michigan right there a few feet down the trail that leads off to the south of the lake front park in Millwaukee Wi. . It has been quite a while since and Im not really sure of the exact date but i think maybe Aug. or Sept 1999 I could ask the other friends of mine and maybe get a more exact date . Anyway I thought I should tell about this because I think we need to know more and maybe this account along with others that come forward will hopefully someday help to prove that these things are real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well here ya go , I just thought one nite it might be fun to go down to the park. I liked to go down by he lake . It was a place I could kinda go and think and anyway we went down there . It was getting dark and I started walking down a trail .. that was really private property and we shouldnt have been down there after dark anyway .. but we were just talking and throwing rocks. thats when I noticed what I thought was a falling star streak across the sky in the east way off far away in the sky . as I saw that I said to the others , &#34; hey check this out look in the sky &#34; and thats when things became very strange.The light Id seen streak across the sky actually stopped and went back in the opposite direction. It was fast like a streak and stopped on a dot then after stopping a second. jolted again back across what Id say whatever 8 inches in the sky from that distance .. and it looked just as bright and as far off as a star..  The original distance that it was is hard for me to try and explain but I say , it was way the hell out there in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So at that point we were all focused on this little light that seemed to zip and stop and zip and stop and as we were watching it , it became obvious that it was coming straight in a line for us .. I mean it was only like a minute from when we first noticed it to where this thing was right up in our faces ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was there hovering like maybe 20 feet above the lake and like as close as if it was the house across the street .. This thing was huge it was like rounded and TOP shaped not a sharp edged upside down triangle but more smooth like an old style Top.. like the spin toy for kids .. but this thing was as big as like a couple of houses .. and there wasnt really a sound ,more like a hum a vibration that you could feel . And all along the top edge were like 5 or so rows of lights and these lights were very bright .Red,blue,yellow, and an eerie white like similar to those high pressure sodium lights, in that they seemed to pulse and surge and there were also lights all over the thing from the top to the bottom that pulsed and so forth .AS I looked at my friends on either side of me and said are you guys seeing this .. we were all just frozen our jaws fucking dropped to the ground .. I couldnt believe it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we stood in awe there for about 2 or 3 minutes and watched this thing and then a very intense sharp light started moving and as it did it was like a beam and the thing shined right into my eyes. and immediatly I cover my face with my hands and thats when I got really scarred . I thought at that point this had begun to get a little bit to close and it sunk in that this might not be all fun and games .. honest I said ok guys fuck this shit I&#39;ve seen enough Im getting the fuck out of here everybody for themselves ..I felt panic for real .. when that light shined on me I felt it was reading my mind and I didnt like it .. so I was looking around for an escape route should I go this way or that way .. we saw a light comming up the trail we came in on .. thats when I said ohh shit they are comming for us .. so as that light comming up the trail got our attention just as we were gonna take off up the side of the banks .Guess what it was ? a police officer .. he&#39;s like &#34;hey you guys &#34; what are doing ... and with his flashlight in our faces we say just out here looking at this UFO .. and he takes the flashlight and shines it out over the lake where all the sudden its pitch black and the thing is gone .. just &#34;poof &#34;gone and says, &#34;what ufo&#34;. Man I dont know what the hell was going on but it seemed ass if he was in on it or something was deffinatly weird about not only the UFO but the cop as well .. anyway after running all our Ids and trying to mess with us about being where we shouldnt be and private property and so forth .. he let us go and we got the hell out of there .. So, thats the story .. this was the real deal and you guys want to know more I would love to tell ya .. I wish I knew what they wanted but I have a strange feeling that they were going to do something bad to me .. I have nightmares about it still .. who knows, It was just a total trip..<n> <n><n> <n><n> well also the 3 of us we just would look at each other and just shake our heads ,, Ive told friends of mine about this and I think they probably say Im crazy .. or just telling a story .. but this was no ((deleted--B.S..)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was sitting in the very last row, right hand side, window seat. We had entered USA airspace, and according to the monitors mounted in the passenger section we were between 11000-12000 feet altitude, descending towards DC. I was looking down, taking in the view (I&#39;ve loved the window seat since a child). There were broken clouds below, perhaps 8000-10000 feet in altitude. I could see water and patches of land between the clouds. Suddenly, below the airplane, appeared a white disk. I was looking right down on it. It was travelling perpendicular to our direction of flight. It was clearly between the plane and the clouds. I would estimate that it was less than 500 feet below my vantage point. It was chalky white and had the appearance of an Alka-seltzer tablet. There were no markings that I could see, but I did notice two dark lines that came in from its outer edge to about a quarter of the way towards its center. The central portion was raised. It was moving very fast and did not appear interested in our plane. It&#39;s difficult to say how large it was, but as I&#39;ve flown hundreds of times and have seen many other aircraft while in the air, I&#39;d have to say that it was no more than fifty feet in diameter, and perhaps less. It was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before. Quite remarkable. No wings, exhaust, windows, markings, or lights. Since my flight was heading SW I&#39;d have to say that it was heading SE, towards open water<n>

Being on a large fishing boat was no new experience for me. The night of my sighting i had fell asleep in the galley at around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock. i awoke because nature was calling and there were two bathrooms in the stern area of the vessel. As i walked out onto the deck i saw a large spherical, glowing shape about 8-10 feet above my head. i took care of my business and went to sleep glancing at the object again to verify that it was real. the strange thing is that the next day there was a large military vessel and it was shooting shells into the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

8/12/99 03:58|Apex (N 35 41 25 W 78 45 01)|NC|Triangle|1aprox 15 seconds|A very large triangular aray of (3) lights seen in the east and moving rapidly north north-west.|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08637.html|219|ndxe199908| A very large triangular aray of (3) lights seen in the east and moving rapidly north north-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend an I were watching the sky for the perceids meteor shower. We were just south of Raleigh, NC. There was a good deal of light pollution but the sky was clear. We were facing east and watching high in the east sky. I noticed an orange light in the sky that at first I thought was an aircraft, but it would have had to be extremely high (I could not distinguish the red/green sides and there was no strobe).  There was also no sound. It struck me that the light was moving very fast for such a height. I made a comment about it. My friend looked and was shocked. She saw a very large triangle. When she stated she saw the triangle I shifted my field of view that had been concentrating on the one point I spotted and realized there were 3 greatly separate points in a triangular shape all moving together and at what seemed to be a very great speed if the lights were as distant as they seemed to be. We both watched the triangle move to the north north-west. I tried to see if it obstructed any stars as it moved, but the light pollution was too great and the visible stars too few, I did not see it pass in front of any visible star until I lost sight of it in the light pollution to the North. The total sighting could not have been more than 15 seconds, more likely it was 10 or less. The triangle shape was irregular, certainly not equilateral. To judge it&#39;s size I compared it to Jupiter and Saturn, which were both visible at this time in the east sky. The longest side of the triangle was about 6/10 to 7/10 the distance between Jupiter and Saturn. The next side was about 4/5 the size of the longest side, while the shortest side was perhaps 1/2 the size of the longest side. It did not move with one of the points in the lead, rather it seemed to sweep across the sky with the shortest side of the triangle in the lead. The corner points did seem rigidly fixed, they did not move relative to each other at all during the observation. My friend and I are both unsure if this was one very large object or simply three lights flying in this pattern. She (very much a UFO skeptic) believes it was one object; without having seen it obstruct a star I&#39;m unsure and more inclined to think it was 3 objects. We both agree that it moved across the sky too quickly to be aircraft at the height that aircraft would have had to be at to look like this (several miles). By itself I expect this report to be pretty unspectacular.  I&#39;m submitting it only because I realize that there may have been other sky watchers at or around the time who also saw it and may have been able to make a better observation. I hope that this report can help back up such an observation. I am not e-mailing any additional information at this time, but would be glad to do so if such were requested. I also do not check the request for a contact or collect call boxes. However, if there are other reports that this report can help collaborate, please contact me via e-mail and I will be glad to provide any information requested. And, of course, if you somehow know what we saw, please let me know.<n>

(sic) They passed directly over my position. (sic)I have observed many satellites passing on the sky being an avid astrnonmer for 20 years,and these lights moved at the speed of a satellite. They were approx. 1.5 degrees apart forming a 90degree triangle with the base in front.I have not been able to find any info on any webaites about 3 satellites in such close orbits together,and I feel sure the lights were most likely in orbit. Approx. 15 minutes later, 2 more lights approx 1.5 degress apart,side-by-side,followed the exact same trajectory as the triangular formation.There were no airplanes nearby, no strobe lights, and no sound.I see someone in Raleigh saw what seems to be the same thing at the same time(approx.), and I have been hunting all this time for an explaination. If anyone else knows anything please email me.Thanks.<n>

Viewed during the Perseid meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While my 10 year old daughter and I were watching the Perseid Meteor Shower on the morning of August 12th, at 0330 hrs, she noticed 3 lights crossing the sky to the north of our location.  I did not see the lights at first, but as they crossed the center line of our view, I saw them.  They were very dimly lit and in a formation of the letter &#34;L&#34; (one light at each point). To describe the visibility and brightness of the light, picture in your mind a flood light seen in the distance on a foggy night.  They were only visible if I squinted. The sky was clear and the stars were brightly visible.  I could not see navigation lights or contrails.  They were fuzzy lights heading in an NW direction at a constant speed.  My daughter became scared and ask if the lights were flying saucers.  I told her they were planes.  I had no answer to give. I am not convinced that there are visitors coming to earth, but who can explain what we saw?<n>

The lights resembled stars or satellites moving, except that there were three moving in a constant triangle shape. There were no sounds and it wasn&#39;t one triangular shaped craft since when they moved across the sky we could see stars appear between the points of light. They moved quickly and they did not blink. The whole sighting took approximately five minutes before we lost view of them.<n>

The objects made no sound, the direction was complete oppisite from the radiant of the meteor shower. I had my wife out by the next 5 minutes.As we talked and watched more meteors, she spoted the same orage thing moving at a very high rate of speed heading south when I caught it also, It looked the same but only as 1, until I looked harder it seemed it could have been 2 very close together, this sighting was only about 5-8 seconds with the speed of the object taking into the city muck again to the right of Jupiter about 15 degrees. THis night was clear, aircraft could be seen flying as normal, a few satellites as normal, and many meteors coming from the radiant. I have been an ametuer astronomer for some 25 yrs, and have never seen anything close to this or ANYTHING moving at that speed, not even when the shuttle lands here does it move that fast, even then the shuttle makes 2 loud bangs even at its slower speed.<n>
8/12/99 02:30|Gold Canyon|AZ|Formation|35 sec.|The objects seen were three points of light in a triangular formation at an extreme altitude which appeared directly overhead and moved|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08721.html|224|ndxe199908| The objects seen were three points of light in a triangular formation at an extreme altitude which appeared directly overhead and moved in tight formation to the northeast at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were having an all night party for the perseid meteor shower when we saw these objects. There were 7 people total but 4 of them left before the event took place. We live just outside the Phoenix metro area near the Superstition Mountains. It is fairly dark at our location and is good for stargazing. I am an amateur astronomer and a professional musician. I very often observe several satellites crossing overhead during the early evening after sunset and have become familiar with their appearance in relation to the stars around them. At approx. 2:30 am I was lying down in a lounge chair looking at the sky directly overhead. My wife and a friend were inside the house. I then saw three points of light appear out of nowhere directly above me at what I believe to be the same altitude as the satellites I regularly observe. The lights were bluish white in color and steady with no flashing or flickering. They were in a precise triangular formation. It is difficult to estimate the size of the formation except to say that they would fit within the shape of a fist held at arms length. When they first appeared they were stationary for a few seconds but then started moving toward the northeast of my location at the same speed as some of the satellites which move very quickly across the sky. The triangle was equilateral in shape, all sides being the same length. After it started to move I immediateley checked to see if it was a solid object or three separate objects. Since I could see stars behind the formation as it moved, I have to assume that they were separate objects. The triangle was pointed in the direction in which it was moving and stayed in tight formation as it moved. About 20 sec. into the event my wife and a friend came back outside and I pointed out the formation to them. They also observed the formation and watched it as is moved to the northeast and disappeared over the horizon which took another 15 sec. or so. In my opinion, the two most significant things about this event were; &gt;first&lt; They appeared out of nowhere as if someone had clicked on a light switch. I have no doubt that this took place because I was looking directly at the position when they appeared. There was nothing there except the stars before they appeared. &gt;second&lt; They moved very quickly across the sky very similar to the satellites which I have observed. My wife thought it could be a formation of military jets in formation. But I have observed jets at high altitude in the past and they definitely do not move as fast as these objects did. After the event happened, I tried posting a report on the Skywatch Int&#39;l discussion page but was unsuccessful due to the fact that I wasn&#39;t officially subscribed. I have since posted this report on the CSETI discussion page of which I am a member. It wasn&#39;t until this morning that I realized that I could report this to NUFORC. I should also like to mention that just prior to the event I was trying out some of the CSETI contact methods. I can&#39;t say for sure whether this initiated the event but thought that it should be mentioned. I am convinced that what I and my wife and friend observed was at the very least unusual and worthy of reporting. - ((name deleted))<n>

We were on the beach looking at the stars in a rustic camp 45 kms from nearest tar road.  Lighthouse about half km away were the only other lights.  We saw what appeared to be a bright star which got brighter than anything else in the sky.  It appeared to move at a rapid speed towards us and a halo of light appeared around it.  It moved rapidly to the right, back to centre, then left, then up and down then moved away and disappeared.  After about 15 seconds it appeared again and moved rapidly to the right, then appeared to flip onto its side and became cigar shaped.  I saw it glow red but the guy with me didn&#39;t see that. It disappeared again at great speed, seemingly away from us and then appeared again.  Finally it moved away.<n>

It began to vary in intensity from bright white to almost invisible in regular three-second intervals until it was no longer visible.  Its intensity was constant until it passed overhead, then began to dim and brighten in regular intervals when it passed through the Milky Way. The entire sighting lasted about 4 minutes. It did not display any changes in path but maintained a straight trajectory throughout our sighting.  It was not a plane, and did not have any blinking lights. It was a clear night.  Meteor showers were also present.  Planes were also flying in the area.  Two other lights were seen that were similar to this one.  All were seen within a 15-20 minute period.  The other two were of short duration. One was seen heading toward Venus from the Big Dipper and then disappeared.  The other one was heading from Venus toward the Big Dipper. It appeared to have its own light and was not reflecting light as far as we could tell.<n>

What was strange was the fact that it was clearly visible in the daylight which could rule out any small comets. This would mean that it was of emmense size with equal brightness as the sun out in space, or was in Earth&#39;s atmosphere above the clouds. It couldn&#39;t have been an aircraft as it was too fast and left too short a trail.<n>

It was of an odd shape, oval, and huge.  It started emitting spurts of electricity/ lightening. There was no thunder at all.  No rain.  Just, this amazing storm cloud that looked like something out of the philadelphia experiment or close encounters.  The lightening shot out in spurts, sideways. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. Then I realized that there was a light show blinking behind the cloud, too. I saw there, mouth open, and in awe, until I finally realized, that blinking was in a pattern. My aunt and I were in agreement, it might sound crazy, but there was no doubt in our mind that it was a mother ship, cloaked. I say this because we pulled over at one point, to watch.  We looked at the clock as we pulled over.  In what we thought was about twenty minutes, we started driving again.  I looked at the clock and realized that it was an hour and twenty minutes. Meanwhile, my husband, in Nevada, has a vision of me on a space ship, with dark eyed aliens getting an exam of sorts on an invisible table where they can move my arms and they just stay, hanging in the air, and my legs, etc. Is that too weird? The light show lasted for about 7 and a half hours. My husband pinpoints his vision at the exact time where we lost an hour. We have had several things happen since this.  When the light show quit, the sky went dark and there was no lightening in the distance. The whole thing just quit, remarkably, after my aunt said, okay, that&#39;s about enough of that.  The whole sky just went black.<n>

It was still dark and I noticed a small jet plane fly by very low...extremely low actually.  It appeared to be a small passenger jet plane.  It made noise as it turned and gained altitude towards the south. After that I saw something just above the tree line but very far away that looked like a star with a red tint.  It was a little brighter than the brightest star in the orion constellation which was to the right of it by about 10 degrees from my vantage point.  Then I saw that the light was bobbing and moving left and right in an irregular fashion. It was changing direction and moving very quickly.  I watch it for about 20 seconds from my window as it moved around above the tree line and then decided to run outside to watch...when I got outside it was gone. I went back inside a looked for it for another 30 minutes from the window but it did not reappear.  I just wanted to report it in case there were other sightings.  It was brief but spooky. It was not moving in a smooth fashion as I&#39;ve seen traditional aircraft move....it moved quickly up and down and left and right. From my perspective it appeared to move only an inch or two in relation to the trees....and if it hadn&#39;t been moving, I&#39;d say it was a star.  If it hadn&#39;t appeared so long, I&#39;d say it was a meteorite.  It did not appear to be a satellite because it changed directions.  The light emited from it was not blinking.<n>

It was a moonless night, although there&#39;s a lot of light pollution here. As we are near Detroit Metro airport, there is a lot of air traffic. We were looking in the northeast. A ball of white light approached from the north. At first we thought nothing of it, figured it was a plane. As it approached the 10 o&#39;clock position above us it suddenly swelled to about 10X its previous diameter. It remained at this expanded size for about 10 seconds, then started to diminish. As it approached the 11 o&#39;clock position (almost directly overhead) it disappeared). The whole time its speed was not extraordinary. What set it apart was a lack of marker lights (no green or red flashers) &amp; there was no sound. We see a lot of plane traffic &amp; this was totally anomalous. It also left a trail, but was moving too slowly to be a meteor from the Perseids. Thought I&#39;d pass it along in case there were other reports of this occurance. It gave us both goose-flesh &amp; jitters for quite a while.<n>

We originally were planning on going to Porcupine Mountain State Park to check out the eclipse, but due to the length of the trip we decided to cut it short and stop in Munising which is located in the upper middle portion of the UP.  We found a good isolated spot in the Hiawatha National Forest to set camp.  The sight was right next to a small lake called Hovey Lake.  On the second night at about 10:30 I went to the lake to see if I could spot any falling meteorites(there was supposed to be meteor showers visible for two weeks during that period).  When I looked into the sky I noticed a flash in the sky so I waited to see if it would do it again.  Sure enough it happened again, but this time I managed to spot its location and called my two friends over.  Of what I observed the flash was coming from this object that would glow very brightly and then fade out.  The object was moving from Northeast to Southwest, but did not maintain a straight path( it reminded me of a tadpole swimming in water).  It looked like a star but every time it would speed up it would start to glow bright orange and expand immensly(like when metal becomes so hot it glows), and would change direction randomly.  This continued &#39;till about 11:00 PM, then it disappeared out of sight.  The next morning at about 4:30 we all woke up and went to a spot that we picked out earlier to see the eclipse.  (Little did we know that from our position on the globe it wasn&#39;t even possible to see the eclipse).  We picked a beach in town along the shore of Lake Superior so we could get a good view of the Sun as it rose over the horizon.  While the three of us were lying there on the beach I noticed the strange object from earlier that night was back in sight and up to its same tricks.  It continued to fly high over Lake Superior when it started to go berzerk!  The object started to zig-zag and do crazy loops as if the pilot didn&#39;t know how to fly the! damn th ing!  This continued for about 5-10 minutes before two more similiar objects came from the same northwesterly direction and continued until they both stopped and formed a triangle with the other one over Lake Superior. The triangle formation that they formed was huge given how high they were. They must have been about 50-60,000 ft. high.  They stayed in that triangle formation for about 30 minutes; it was almost like they were waiting for something cosmic to happen.  Eventually as the Sun rose and the clouds got thicker the three UFO&#39;s begain to fade away.  I was with my friend and his girlfriend, we both are currently enrolled at Central Michigan University and before this event I always considered him a Pessimist or skeptic when it comes to UFO&#39;s.  He changed his tune real quick after this occurance.  Wether it was visitors from space or secret government projects, we couldn&#39;t explain it. WE JUST KNOW WHAT WE SAW.<n>

At first I was not sure what it was they were looking at. Then I too saw the silver sphere shaped object which was motionless. It was at an altitude of that which was much higher than a commercial plane, and so obviously it was only just visible. Fortunately it was a bright clear day and more people began to notice the object. It was too high to be a balloon and the shape suggested that it was of advanced technology. After some twenty minutes, the object suddenly shot upwards and vanished into the upper atmoshere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after the flash, an object of a greenish bluish hue started to move across the sky. It moved at a slow pace, and we did not see where it had started, we believe it just appeared in the night sky. As it was moving, the cylindar shaped object seemed to give off flashes and bolts of some kind. After the flashes from the object it seemed to swoop down, and continue to do this for quite some time. Then the flashing green bolts started again and continued for 10 or 15 minutes. The bolts looked as if there was elictricity or lightning coming off the object. The objects flashing bolts came to an abrubt stop, and the object seemed to split into two. The now two objects started to move at a tremendous speed towards the horizon of the dark ocean. The light the objects were giving off started to fade away, and disappeared into the dark fogged sky. I was traveling with my dad, a lawyer in Los Angeles. My friend peter who works for microsoft.

The evening was rather d|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12305.html|242|ndxe199908| It was approximately 1 a.m. and I was returning from my office in Napa with a friend, heading West on Hwy 121. The evening was rather dark, the moon, if it was &#34;up,&#34; provided no illumination. The sky was clear and starry with good definition to the horizon except for a hint of ground fog settling in the lowest pockets of the valley floor. Suddenly our attention was drawn by an intensely bright, white light that rose abruptly into the low western sky ahead of us just slightly left of center. Both the nature of its sudden and jerky rise, and the intensity of this light source, caused us to watch the object closely, and it appeared to be either stationary or slowly heading towards us at a constant elevation. As we continued driving, we noticed that it was indeed getting closer and that there were in fact two, not one, bright lights. We also noticed that the lights were not white as first thought, but a very strange amber white that projected from the object like piercing &#34;pencil beams&#34; of light. It also soon became clear to us that out paths would soon cross and this object was no airplane or helicopter. We were about one mile west of the Napa Rd. turnoff when we got our first good look at the object and realized that if its course remained the same, it was going to pass directly over us in a matter of moments. Realizing this, I pulled off the road onto the shoulder and looking up out of my open window, watched it do just that. My best guess on its altitude is about 2000 ft and at it was at least 300 ft across (wide) and approximately 250 ft long. It may well have been even larger if I underestimated its altitude. Its shape was very similar to that of a manta ray (which I realize makes this account seem less credible) with its underside dark and muted browns. The underside was also highly detailed, not spherical and aerodynamic, with what may have been low-profile compartments or holds. The aforementioned 2 lights were on the front of the craft, and between them appeared to be a dimly lit area of some possibly transparent material. The 2 lights were still on as it passed overhead and they were quite unlike anything we had everr seen—intensely bright and focused. It also seemed to have some sort of revolving light arrays at the end of each wing that had briefly emanated a flashing red and white pattern (ike a commercial jet) only moments before. There was no visible means of propulsion as the craft passed silently overhead, but both of us could swear that we could &#34;feel&#34; it, like a low resonant vibration. After it passed overhead, I spun the car around in the shoulder area to pursue the craft, but as I did, the craft bolted southeast, displaying &#34;instantaneous&#34; acceleration, and was some 5 miles away before I had reached the paved road surface. As I reached the roadway, it bolted again and was now only faintly visible some 10-15 miles away, and then it was gone.<n>

The craft would apear and disapear as they flew across the sky. In intervals of 10-15 seconds.When I could not see them I could see a rippling of stars where the objects should have been. Much like looking through a heat wave off a summer highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night of the last meteor shower a few months ago. A friend and I were sitting in my back yard staring at the stars. The time was about 12:30Am to 1:00Am. I was sitting there looking around the skys trying yo catch a glimpse of the first meteors. When I saw a ripple out of the corner of my eye. I looked just in time to see three triangled objects in a delta formation. Then they Vanished. I kept watching to see if I was just seeing things. But, A little further south and 10 -15 seconds later the craft reapeared. They were heading south southeast. Towards the jacksonville Airbase. There was no sound. When the craft would vanish I could see a faint rippling of the stars where the craft should have been. They were moving at about 45 miles per hour. They had no lights on them. Didnt see a rotating beaken. No strobes. As far As I know thats against FAA regulations. The stealth aircraft cant fly at 45 miles per hour. Thats the only aircraft that I know of that remotely resembles what I saw. And as far as the cloaking, Well until that night I figured that was something of Star Trek imagination.<n>

We observed the North Star, Big Dipper, etc. and we saw a number of airplanes also pass by.  At approximately 10:00 PM, I noticed what I first thought was a small formation of birds flying overhead.  I told my sons to look; my 15-year son had seen them before I said to look.  He happened to be looking at the spot in the sky where they appeared.  My 8-year-old scoured the sky and then saw them in about 2-3 seconds.  It occurred to me that birds do not glow and that they flap their wings. These objects had what appeared to be fixed stubby wings crossing a relatively short body compared with conventional aircraft.  They were flying at about the height one would think high-flying birds might fly (which I guess is why I at first thought they were birds).  There seemed to be no noise surrounding these objects.  They were flying fast (perhaps twice the speed of the jets that we had seen pass overhead), in perfect formation (diagonally?) three across and emitted a dull but penetrating orange/brown/yellow glow.  Our visual contact lasted about 5 to 15 seconds.  All three of us are absolutely certain we observed this sight. I, the father, am 50 years old in perfect health.  My 15-year old son is going into 9th grade and my 8-year old is going into 3rd grade.  We all have good sight and none of us had ever seen a UFO before.<n>

When we saw it we all were astonished, then after the quick glance we realized it was an aircraft, it had a light on each side of the craft.  It looked to me like the star ship enterprise from star trek.  It was facing us in the sky headed our way, about 1 mile away in the sky (est.)  When the jets got real close to this craft, it disapeared out of thin air and the jets kept flying.  There were no clouds and the craft never made a noise, we listend later to every plane that was even in a further distance and we could here them, but never that craft.  The jets were loud at the time, but we don&#39;t how long that thing was there before we saw it.  We waited for it to appear again but never did.<n>

Based on distance estimate object approximately 10-15 ft in diameter and 6-8 ft in height. Shape was like a wash tub turned upside down or a crown.  Object was not an airplane since it had no wings or landing gear.  Object was not floating like a balloon and there was no wind to propel a balloon at the speed this object was moving.

About 10:10, I was on the phone with a friend and went outside onto the porch, which is 12 ft or so off the ground. In just a few minutes, I saw this triangle shaped pbject moving over the field by the house.  It was about 30 feet away from me, about eye level, due to the bank that drops about 10 ft below the driveway. It was dark in color, black?, and had orangy yellow lights that flashed in a pattern, but not sequentially.  It was moving at approximatley 5 mph, and made no sound.  I told my friend that I had to go, but would call her back when it was gone. At this point, a blue?white light came from the bottom, and that&#39;s all I remembered at the time. 2 hours are unaccounted for, but I have remembered a few things.  One is an odd black box, and I was shown what was inside but am not allowed to remember what it was at this time.  The being that I saw that night is the same one I have been seeing since childhood, and even though he has told me his name, I can&#39;t say it or spell it.  I also reported this incident to MUFON at the time it occurred, but never got a reply.

I asked him what was up and he replied your going to think im hallucinating and asked me to take a look at these silvery objects which he was looking at. When I looked up towards the north sky I&#39;ve seen a multitude of shiny oval objects moving in formations. Now this was a clear day in broad daylight in a Brooklyn New York area so i was amazed. These were true UFO&#39;S  flying at an approximate hight over 25000 feet and in perfect formation. Soon others were flying into the so called formation. The entire time was around 15 to 20 minutes. It was the most spectacular thing i have ever seen. When these object move out it was as if the were sucked into a vacuum, now your see them now you dont. Everyone i told looked at me as if i were nuts but i had another person and he was the one to point these out to me. The thing i find most interesting is the next day I saw a camaflouged highwing army plane possible a Cessna flying a circular pattern the whole day afterwards.I work for Verizon as an otside plant technition and follow aviation as a hobby.

She had gone outside to try to find Saturn with binoculars when she saw the light.  When I got outside,  I saw it almost direcly overhead, slightly South of my house.  It was moving slowly towards the North-West,  and looked like a single,  very bright orange light.  I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was actually several lights.  It looked like it was wedge shaped on the leading edge,  with some more lights behind the wedge,  perhaps a total of 10-12 lights.  I only looked through the binoculars for a second or two and immediately went in to get the camcorder.  Unfortunately,  the recorded image was poor, and I ran out of tape after only about 30 seconds.  I never got to see it again to get more detail,  my last sighting was through the camera.  It appeared to head off about 10-15 miles from the house,  at which time lights started dropping from the object.  It faded from view shortly after that.  The total time it was visible was at most 5 minutes.  Both my wife, and my mother said they could see some structure above the lights when they viewed it in the binoculars.  They said it looked like it was some sort of fabric material,  similar to a balloon.  There was no basket under it, and it never made a sound or the typical glow of a hot air balloon.  None of us thought it could be a hot air balloon,  but maybe some other type of balloon such as a weather balloon.  Altho I don&#39;t know why it would have the lights on it that we all saw or why it would have been launched so late at night.<n>

We went to bed around 9:30pm but did not go to sleep because of the heat.  We noticed what seemed to be a very bright star that was stationary but then it seemed to move a bit so it kept our attention.  Before long there was another point of light moving around the first one, coming closer and then moving away from it.  My boyfriend, S., and I kind of blew it off as airplanes or something since we were not that far from Phoenix but L. continued to watch.  I had closed my eyes when I became aware of a relatively bright light (not really much brighter that if a car was passing by our campsite)at the same time L. started yelling for us to look.  I opened my eyes in time to see an object going over the campground.  It wasn&#39;t that close but you could clearly see it (kind of like if you were on the ground and the GoodYear Blimp was overhead).  I&#39;m not really good at distances so I don&#39;t know how high it was but like I said you could see it clearly.  It looked as if it was glowing from the inside out instead of being illuminated by an outside source.  It almost had a peachy glow to it but it did have some exterior white lights fore and aft.  I am guessing that it was circular in shape but it was like we were seeing it it profile which made it appear more cigar shaped with an extra small dome shape on the top.  It moved rather slowly at first then it just seemed to streak away.  L. told us that it was the second star like object that had moved over us and then disappeared.  When we looked back at where we had originally seen the &#34;stars&#34;, both were gone.<n>

On that particular Saturday mid-afternoon day.  A friend and I decided to take a walk down to Riverbank State Park on 145th Manhattan, NY.  We&#39;ve been there a few times before since he lived and worked at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital a few blocks north from there.  It was our favorite place to hang out and just enjoy the scenery.  From that park you could see over to New Jersey,  The George Washington Bridge, and Downtown and basically up the Hudson River valley as well on a clear day.  My friend and I got to the park and walked all the way down to the south corner of the park next to the basketball courts act... We sat down on the benches right next to the rail facing the Hudson River.  We spoke about work, family, daily normal everyday things, act....<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point during our conversation I stood up and walked next to the rail and leaned against the rail with my back towards the Hudson River.  My friend lay down on the bench and we kept talking until I for some strange reason looked up and noticed 3 or 4 &#34;star-liked&#34; objects just hovering motionless to the east of where i was standing.  I asked my friend to stand up and see something strange up in the sky and so he did.  He told me something around, &#34;Oh what those stars there,&#34; but then he told me &#34;it&#39;s weird we&#39;re not supposed to see stars that bright during the day&#34;. Then I told him that they’re probably satellites or even balloons and we just basically brush it off and kept talking about other stuff. We stood there for a few more hours.  Then around 5:00pm or so we decided to go get something to eat at a nearby McDonalds and basically started walking back north to exit the park.  As we were walking north right beside the river I noticed again for some strange reason what looked like a &#34;Black&#34; dot in the sky. It stood out to me because the sky was completely blue no clouds, haze nothing. This object was hovering motionless near the Manhattan side of the G.W.Bridge precisely on top or near 3 tall buildings used by Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as dorms for medical students or something my friend told me.  He knew since like I said he worked at the hospital in the Administration Dept.  I found it very odd so I ask my friend to walk fast to nearby sight-seeing binoculars that they have in that park to see over to New Jersey, G. W. Bridge act…  At the same time that I was walking I was looking in my jeans pocket for 50 cents to paid in order to use the binoculars and happens to be that I had precisely that 2 quarters so I got to the machine put the money and first located the G.W. Bridge since it was the biggest thing, then located the 3 buildings nearby and then moved the binoculars a little up from the buildings and lord behold there was the “Black! Dot” which wasn’t really a “Black Dot” but a Black Tetrahedro! n Pyramid Object sitting motionless on an angle right on top of one of the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was completely black. It had not markings what so ever, no symbols, letters, windows, and doors I mean nothing. It was just black sort of &#34;gun metal black.&#34; The only thing that had in each bottom corners was plasma-like circular lights. These lights emanated some sort of heat. Sort of like the sun, yes they reminded me of the sun. It was like it had 3 suns in each corner.  The object also didn’t rotate or nothing it was just there motionless.   At that point I was just ecstatic in a euphoric state debating whether I was seeing this or if it was all in my mind.  I quickly turn to my friend which was standing right next to me asking me what was what I was seeing.  Why I was reacting the way I was reacting. I told him you have to see this come so I let him used the binoculars and told him where to look so he did but he couldn’t see find it. I looked with my eyes to see if I saw the black dot but it just vanish as quickly as it appeared.  The rest of the day we just spoke about what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost forgot to mention that prior to seen the triangle I had seen a black helicopter pass us by when we were walking towards the binoculars to see what the black dot was.  This army type helicopter was really low to the river.  I found that very odd.  This particular sighting is just one of many sightings I have had since childhood.<n>

It was flashing &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34; at 4 times a second and was twice as bright as the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 7, 1999 between approximately 10:35 AM to 10:55 AM (PST) I was sitting down outside for awhile in my front yard facing to the North, when something caught my attention in the corner of my eye.  I looked up, at about a 165 degree angle, and spotted what appeared to be a silent white radiant elongated diamond shaped object, it was the size of a number two eraser held at arms length, it looked to be two to three miles away and was slowly coming down.  It was flashing &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34; at 4 times a second and was twice as bright as the sun.  At first I thought it was a piece of aluminum paper, so I watched it because it being as twice as bright as the sun. I continued observing, for it was slowly come down towards me, while it was flashing &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;.  When the object dropped behind the house across the street from me.  I thought if it was a piece of aluminum paper that that would be it, but it was not so.  Because now this object appeared to the right of the house across the street, to me this object appeared to be two or three blocks away.  The object continued moving slowly to the right and up, until it was an inch above the house next door.  At that point, the object stopped and stayed stationary for about one or two minutes, still flashing &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;.  The object then started to move up and to the left away from me, just as slowly as it came down, all the while flashing &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;.  At this point I knew now that this object was not a piece of aluminum paper, but a vehicle of some type.  The object continued to go up higher and higher into the sky, until it was two or three miles away.  It then stopped and stayed stationary, all the while continuing to flash &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;.  A minute or two later I then saw a jetliner coming from the right towards object and when the jetliner came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner pass the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began ! flashing again &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;, again 4 times a second.  A minute or so later another jetliner came from the left towards the object and when the jet later came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner passed the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began flashing again &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34;, again 4 times a second.  The object then continued up and away from me till I no longer could see it.  Total viewing time was about 22 minutes.  The skis were clear and no visible winds.  I live in Westminaster, California and live seven miles away from MacArthur airport and see airport traffic almost every day for the last fourteen years.  I was enlisted in the United State Air Force for five years, stationed on five different bases including one base over seas, been to several air shows and familiar with all kinds of aircraft.<n>

I&#39;m not sure if NASA has anything to do with my sighting, but I thought it might be pertinent information. I consider myself a very level-headed, skeptical person not given to delusions or hallucinations. I have always had an interest in the so-called &#39;paranormal&#39;, but UFO&#39;s were never really a huge interest and my approach to unexplained phenomena is that of an open-minded skeptic, seeking out logical and most probable explainations before launching into metaphysics and talk of aliens or elaborate government conspiracies. At the time of the sighting I had been attending community college for graphic design, and working at a bookstore. I am currently between jobs and college, and plan to attend Flagler College next year to major in psychology. I have no respect for people who tell tall tales just to get attention or for laughs at other people&#39;s expense and at the expense of legitimate investigation of this phenomena, and I have nothing to gain by reporting this other than adding to the body of information you are collecting that might lead to finding similarities and patterns in sightings for better understanding this phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting happened three years ago, in 1999, but it is still burned into my memory, it was so shocking and out of the ordinary, like nothing I&#39;d ever seen or expected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in August, in the early morning (around 2-3 am) I awoke from sleep in the condo I live in with my parents. This wasn&#39;t a usual occurance for me, as I usually sleep soundly through the night...but this of course might not be directly connected to the sighting and just a coincidence. I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and I sat down on the couch for about 5 minutes, sipping the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, whether it was on my own whim or something else that compelled me, I felt that I wanted to step out front. Maybe it was a completely self-willed decision, simply a desire to enjoy the night air, or the more unlikely scenario which has crossed my mind a few times that something/someone else compelled me...I don&#39;t rule that out but I find it the more improbable of the two possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember opening the front door, closing it behind me, and just as I stepped away from the door I heard an extremely loud sound, exactly like or very similar to the whine of a jumbo jet. A split second later I looked up to where the sound originated, and above me was a huge craft which seemed to be flying very low, coming towards me from (I think) the east. Incidentally, it was coming from the direction of the indian river lagoon, across which is Kennedy Space Center. It was so large and that I couldn&#39;t get a proper perspective on its exact proportions relative to how low it was flying. My best estimate is that it was at least one and a half or twice the size of a jumbo jet and only 100 to several hundred feet overhead. It seemed to be going rather slowly at first. It blocked out my entire feild of vision of the night sky and covered the roof of my condo unit which was to the left of me with its shadow. I couldn&#39;t tell what shape it was, it seemed flat on the bottom with lights, which I think were white. I only had about 10 seconds to take it all in, and it galvanized me, I just stood there dumbfounded. As it went over my head, I turned around...and this is the most puzzling thing...it had completely dissapeared!  I have heard that certain UFO&#39;S can dart from place to place with amazing speed and precision, so maybe this is an explaination for the mysterious &#39;dissapearance&#39;. I also cannot rule out the possibility that it was all a hypnogogic hallucination since it had been about 6 minutes since I woke up, but as I said I am not normally given to visual or auditory hallucianations, especially of such a vivid nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident, I was literally shaking, and I went in the house. I expected my mother (not to mention the whole condo complex) to be awake by then since the jet-like noise the craft was making was loud enough to wake everyone within a block or two of me. But my mother, and everyone else it seemed, was either sound asleep or still in their house. I found that very odd, because it would logically follow that whatever it is I saw would have woken people up, it was so loud. One detail I do not recall is whether I felt a vibration or not...for a craft of this size and loudness, if it was following the known laws of physics, it would have shaken the windows and I would have been able to literally feel the vibration in my bones. I was so astounded and shocked in the few moments I encountered it that I simply cannot recall if I detected any vibrations. But I tend to think there wasn&#39;t since if there was, as I said, it would have woke people up, possibly even shattered some windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I debated whether to wake up my mother, and decided not to. I also debated with myself whether to call the police or not, I was curious if anyone else had reported sighting this craft. At the time I thought NASA might be test flying something but it would have had to have been using technology only science fiction writers dream of, and that didn&#39;t seem logical to me. I didn&#39;t report my sighting to the police because I felt kind of absurd about the whole thing, and couldn&#39;t picture myself calling in the wee hours to report a UFO sighting with lights and all, I was afraid they would assume I was a prankster,  and there is really nothing they could do about it anyhow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living so close to the Space Center, I am familliar with the effects of the space shuttle launches, especially when it breaks the sound barrier...our windows shake and you can hear and feel the vibrations. When the shuttle lands here in Florida, one can hear a very loud sonic boom. Of course, this craft was not traveling at any speed great enough to break the sound barrier, and it was flying low, but it should have been equivalant to one or two jumbo jets flying very low overhead, as if they lifted off moments earlier. I am thouroughly puzzled by this and its one of the main reasons I cannot logically rule out that it was a hallucination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there is my report. I swear by all that is sacred to me that this is not a lie or a joke. I respect what this organization is doing to collect information on legitimate UFO Sightings without dismissing us all as cranks and lunatics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since I experienced this sighting I have always been curious if anyone else has had a sighting similar or identical in nature to mine. I&#39;ve heard and read about several types of UFO sightings, but have never come across details of any sightings that completely match mine. Most of the sightings I have heard/read about involving craft of the gigantic size I saw (perhaps it was one of those triangular shapes?) was not accompanied by any loud high-pitched jet noise, but were completely silent. If anyone reading this knows of similar sightings or has experienced one themselves with many or all of the same characteristics, I would be interested in being informed of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.  Time indicated by witness is illogical.  PD))<n>

It was bright orange. It stayed, then left, and they saw it explode far up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my girlfriend saw a UFO. We live in far Northern California, Humboldt County. She was at her sister&#39;s in the yard at 10:30 p.m. They were unloading fruit from the truck. She saw something come from the north. Then it came right over them, rather close like a helicopter. At first she thought it was the police, but then thought that didn&#39;t make sense, because there was no reason for the police to come. But she also noticed there was NO sound. Also, it was bright orange. It stayed over them for awhile, then suddenly turned left and took off. She knew no plane could do that. When it started spinning and took off, she said there were many different colored lights around it. It went to the left and went, but then she said something happened. Suddenly it exploded, and she described the pieces falling like pieces of a falling star. She was very frightened from the experience. She speaks Spanish mostly, but fairly good English. I know her very well, and she and her family are very wonderful and reliable people. Her husband didn&#39;t want her to say anything because he said people would think they were crazy. She and her sister both saw it happen. They know me real well (as I run a very large Neighborhood Watch) and asked me to look into who they could report it to, or if anything like that was reported by anyone else. (Also, she happens to be pregnant, which concerns me, because I study the subject of UFO&#39;s a bit.I am familiar with alien abductions, fetuses, etc. Of course I would not discuss that subject with her. Just want to give you the details.) Anyway, I don&#39;t know who to contact about this. We&#39;d like to find out if there were other reports, but living in a seme-small town, the police department is closed Saturday, and we don&#39;t know anywhere to call. There are more details that you ask for here, but I don&#39;t know the answers. She does. So I&#39;m filling out what I know. Hope to hear from you. I will put you in touch with her. (I will leave a message on your hotline if I find that number on your website, so I have marked the box below, in advance of making the call.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend saw a UFO in the sky at night. It came towards them and stayed above them for awhile. Then it took off, and seemed to explode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The following text is the first report submitted by the same sourcs.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night a girlfriend of mine, saw an unidentified object in the sky. We&#39;ll call her Lucia (she wishes to remain anonymous). Lucia was driving to her sister&#39;s about 10:00 p.m. Her sister lives in a trailer park. When Lucia turned into the driveway of the park, there was a very bright beam of light coming from an object that was located ahead of her (north). It was low in the sky and the beam of light shone at a slight degree just above her. She was startled at the light and the object. So she turned left into the trailer park and parked in front of her sister&#39;s house. She was frightened and honked her horn so her sister would come out. Lucia&#39;s sister, and her sister&#39;s boyfriend came out of the house. At that point, looking to the north, the object no longer had a beam of light coming from it, but it came over the trees and then stayed stationary right over the house. It was very hard for me to determine how large the object appeared to them, as Lucia speaks limited English and her sister only speaks Spanish, however an enterpretor was there. Lucia&#39;s sister said when she came out of the house, it was about 10:15 p.m. The three speculated as to what the object could be. When she first observed it while driving, Lucia thought it was a helicopter, but after seeing it out of the car, it did not appear to be a helicoper. It appeared to be a large orange-like object. Lucia also noted and said to the others that it made no noise. They all agreed it was not an airplane, as it was stationary in the air above them. They were all frightened. Then after about 10-15 minutes, the object started whirling...spinning, and three lights appeared when that happened. The lights were different colors. When that happened the object immediately headed eastbound, but still at a lower altitude. Suddenly, Lucia said they saw what appeared to be an explosion...like two pieces (like falling stars they said), falling down from the object. At that it disappeared. They thought it exploded, which accounted for why they couldn&#39;t see it anymore. They said it did look like an explosion. When they came back into the house, it was about 10:30p.m. The thing I was most concerned with is the fact that Lucia is pregnant. Knowing what I have researched about alien abductions, I am concerned (however, did not tell her that). As we were all talking today about the incident, I asked if anything strange or unusual ever happened to them. Lucia&#39;s sister said there have been many UFO&#39;s seen in Mexico. Lucia&#39;s sister said when she was 14 yrs. old she lived in Colima, Mexico. At about 10:30 p.m. she went outside to use the outhouse. She found herself back in her home at about 3:00 a.m. She didn&#39;t know what had happened to her and mentioned it to her mother. She emphasized to me, while telling me the story, that she was extrememly nervous and upset after the episode of missing time. Anyway, her mother said she was imagining things, that she was crazy, and not to talk about it. Still, later in years, when she was about 3 months pregnant with her child (now 10), she was living in Santa Ana, California, in a house that was not well lit by the sun. One day a very bright light shone through the windows, and she collapsed on the bed. She awoke sometime later, and had some marks on her body. Her husband thought they were &#34;hickeys&#34; from another man. As Lucia said, it was the main reason her sister&#39;s marriage broke up. Today Lucia&#39;s sister she said she was very disturbed about what she saw last night. She said it brought back those memories of what I just stated happened to her. She is very nervous now and wishes she never saw the object, because she is afraid. Her boyfriend would not speak about it. Lucia said he is scared. Lucia and her sister said, that once you see an object like that, you will surely see it again, and they are both afraid.<n>

We had already been there an hour or so. I was looking straight up at a cluster of stars. A couple minutes had passed when finaly I had saw it. It was a white light about as bright as the stars. I saw no shape just a light. Too far away. It was moving in different directions kind of like a fly. I then told my 2 friends to take a look and then pointed in the objects direction. One friend thought it was possibly a satilite untill he watched longer. The weirdest part was the movement it moved in almost a figure eight. If I remember correctly. The I went to get my binoculars to see if I could get a closer look. By the time I got back it was gone. Not sure what you want for backgound info. but:I&#39;m 23/Male lived in Utah all my life. No illnesses. I&#39;m not on any medication or drugs. I work at nights for a film developing company so paying attention to little details is my job. No religion preference...

My husband noticed through our bedroom window, what he first thought was an airplane, but after watching it for a moment, he realized it wasn&#39;t moving.  He then told me to come and look at this object. I also observed what I first thought was an airplane.  This object had white lights, with flashing green and red lights.  We noticed that this object didn&#39;t change its position in the sky, but seemed to be floating in the same place.  We ran and got binoculars and were able to see that this object was triangular in shape with rows of white lights, with red and green lights at the bottom.  We decided to go out in our backyard to see if we could get a better look.  By the time we got outside, the object had moved farther away from us, so we couldn&#39;t make out it&#39;s shape anymore with binoculars-but it was still in the same position in the sky-it just seemed to be farther up or away.  We continued to  look at this object for about 10 more minutes and observed that it continued to move farther and farther away in the sky, so all that could really be seen was the white light. The total time we watched this object was about 20 to 25 minutes.  It was in the sky at a northeast position seemingly above Mt Timpanogos.  Since that first sighting, we have seen the object at least 4 or 5 more nights, in the same location, at the same time of night. We are average white homeowers, taxpaying, law abiding citizens who up to this experience did not believe in UFOs.<n>

We had watched a number of airliners fly over we assumed they were all out fo the twin cities. We had watched a couple of satallites move across the sky. We had also witnessed what seemed to be a short meteor shower with some leaving very brilliant orange trails behind them. At around 11:15pm or so my wife and son had decided to go inside. I remained outdoors for a little longer just hoping to see more of the show. As I sat looking up at the sky looking southward as we had been I noticed some movement from my left. When I turned to focus on it what I saw is very hard to descibe. It seemed like a patch of the sky had a wavy transparent distortion, somewhat oval shaped and moving within itself. It made no sound at all. There were&#39;nt any blinking lights as I recall. It was like looking through a magnifying glass about 8 to 10 inches away from your eye. I only saw it for about 15 to 20 seconds as it moved in a northwest direction at around a 60 degree angle up from the horizon. The sky was very clear. The temp. was about 70 degrees. I&#39;m 41 years old, I work as a Dept.Manager for a local retail store. My family and I have always enjoyed looking at the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. If you or anyone can explain what it was I would be very grateful.<n>

It appeared to be a satellite (of which I have observed hundreds over the years), similar in speed, tracking and intenisity of light (which was steady, non-blinking), until making several sudden, major course changes, which included coming to what appeared to be a complete stop.  There is an all-night service station/convenience store about 100 yards directly west of my location that is brightly lighted all night.  The object was bright enough to be easily seen, even over the lights from the C-store coming from the same general direction.  I observed no strobes, beacons, or sounds coming from the object or its general direction that might identify it as an aircraft. Boise&#39;s Gowen Field is about 8 miles east south-east of my location and there is a lot of military and commercial traffic arriving and departing nearly all day and late into the night.  However, there is seldom anything flying in the area between about midnight and 7:00 a.m.  I am a private pilot with several hundred hours of PIC time logged and recognize how both military and general aviation aircraft are typically lighted. The light given off by the object was silvery-white, not incandescent or florescent, and of the intensity I have observed from satellites over the years.  It diminished only when the object passed behind a thin stratus cloud layer in the west, which was the remnant of some small, localized thunderstorms that had been in the area the previous afternoon and evening.  The object remained visible through the clouds for several seconds.  It made at least 5 course changes of as much as 70 degrees during period of observation, but its overall progress of travel remained generally westerly.  The object faded from view upon passing behind more dense area of cloud layer and was lost.<n>

August 5th, 1999<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 5th of August, 1999, I was lying on my balcony looking up at the stars.  At about 1:30 am an object came into view.  If I hadn&#39;t been looking straight up, I never would have seen it.  It blocked out the stars as it flew overhead, but it was not lit up.  It made absolutely no sound.  I&#39;m not sure just how large it was because I don&#39;t know how high it was flying but I could see it well enough to see detail on it. It was as big as a plane would be if it were flying quite low, as if it were going to land soon. I could tell it was metallic because it was reflecting the lights from the city. It was a perfect triangle with rounded corners. It had a circle on each corner as if they were lights, but as I said it was not lit up when I saw it. There was also a circle directly in the middle of the triangle. I froze when I saw it. I watched it fly from east to west until it was no longer in sight. It did not fly very fast, about the same as an airplane, but it was no airplane I&#39;ve ever seen before. I guess it could have been a secret government craft, but I know it was not like the Stealth or anything like that. It was obvious that it didn&#39;t want to be seen. As soon as it was out of sight, I got up and wrote the exact time and date of what I saw in my diary, and I drew a picture of it. The next day I told my mother what I had seen, and she said she had seen the same object the night before, except when she saw it she said it had a green neon glow around it. I would like to know if anyone else saw what I saw around the same time.<n>

A flash lit up the yard. An intense periodic flash of light occurred about every 5 seconds as it passed overhead. I saw no object, heard no sound, and there were no green or red lights. I have no idea what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10 PM I went out to the back porch to put back the mat that I had rinsed out earlier in the day. As I carried the mat from the line to the porch I noticed a flash which made the trees and yard apparent - kind of like it does when there is lighting, but it was perfectly clear and I could see the stars. After another flash which I did not see directly happened again I walked around the corner of the house where the porch light wasn&#39;t shining and looked up and waited. I saw about 8 more flashes directly, each flash occurring at about 2 palm widths apart. At first I thought it had to be something in orbit but nothing I&#39;ve seen glints like that. This was an intense flash of light on the landscape. I never thought it was any aircraft since there was no sound or other lights usually seen on wing tips or the tail. Could it have been a lightning bug? I thought no since they usually leave a yellowish trail of light. This was a high intensity flash. I don&#39;t know what I saw. Anybody between Jefferson and Athens see anything like this around 10:05 PM on Wed Aug 4?<n>

He lives in Fargo, ND, and I live in Minneapolis. My car was stalled at my wifes grandmothers house in Wadena, MN. My friend was on his way back home from my house, so I caught a ride with him to go pick the car up. As we were driving in the area of the Camp Ripley military base, we both started to feel very strange, almost like static electricity in the air. then, as we rounded a bend we saw two very bright amber lights appear directly in front of us, aprox. 500-1000 feet off the ground, I would say. One was slightly higher than the other, and both remained in the same spot for about 25 or so miles, until we saw them finally fall very slowly behind the tree line. Also along with the lights were bright blueish/green flashes, that appered somewhat like lightning, but were eminating from the ground, just to the east of Hwy. 10. Many other very strange, but somewhat hard to explain things also occured from that time on that night, but I don&#39;t know if they are related or not.<n>

I remmber thinking  it must be a plane or helicopter possibly because of one place i travel past, i must be careful about how i explain the exact spot in which i got a very good look at this object which blended into the night sky it did have a shape but i cannot really say what it was,The lights which where large but did not give off any beam from them only a soft  white glow.thier is as i mentioned about the location a military base ,this base is considerted top seret it is built into a mountain and is very active,sorry but that is all i can give as far as exact location,the only objects ever seen flying at any given time of the day is a black helicopter which is a partrol chopper. but most of the time only in the daylight hours is it seen.i stopped my car after i determined that this object was indeed moveing  and that it had decended to a height that it was hoovering,or floating over the trees i could still not make out a spacific shape  it was possibly a dark color 3 lights like a triangle i later thought of the triangle shape because that is the shape the lights where in. Since i am very familiar with the area i pulled  off the road onto a small road turned off my car and got out i stood thier looking at this thing for about 5 minutes all that time i had a ringing type sound in my ears it was like a low flat ringing i noticed it right as stopped my vehicle thier was no sound of a motor or propeller noise only this ringing type  noise ,it went away after i pulled back out onto the road i was worried that the military would be comeing this area is very well guarded thier is said to ! have cameras set up everywhere monitoring the base  everyone that goes by this place. I started driveing down the road i looked into my rear door mirror and i could still see the lights it was as if the object was just sitting thier in the sky. I continued to drive i did&#39;nt want to be late for work but i was by then very curiouse as to what it was i observed was it a new type plane? One thing i do know this base does&#39;nt deal with planes or building them . I never told anyone about that night,i wanted to but around here storys of ufo&#39;s aliens  it is looked at as crazy talk,but i know what i saw that night and i wished i had a camera because i would have used it but all i have is a clear memory that i still think of to this day. Allso 2 days after this event i got extremly sick and weak i consulted my doctor which he told me he did&#39;nt know what made me sick all he could do was tell me to drink water,and get rest the following day i felt much better,did i get sick from some type exposer to something that night ? Probably not,but it crossed my mind. Allso 1 week after this event i recieved 6 phone calls only who ever it was would not talk they would stay on long enough for me to say hello then hang up i have never gotten calls  of this type ever and allso my phone number is private that just added more to think about from that particular night. thank you for reading this and allso for giveing me a chance to tell this,it has in a small way released many many years of preasure because i did want to tell someone,but fear of ridicule can be be very strong in makeing a right decision.Ever since that night i have not watched the sky as i use .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was dish shaped object, and did not appear to have lights on it, just somewhat of a white glow in the clear sky.  We watched it go as far south as we could see.  It was a very clear night and the object was very easy to see. This could not have been a plane as it was traveling too fast ....and we do not believe it was a satelite as it was lower than any satelite we have seen and there was no reflection like you see with satelites.

It remained static for about a minute and a half and then moved side ways, smoothly and steadily for approx. 15 secs leaving a slight trail, gradually becoming dimmer before apparently disappearing.

Turned away, looked again-object was gone.  Then appeared again moving East at high rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting into my car when I heard the sound of a low flying airplane. I looked up to see a single engine plane trailing a banner.  This plane was traveling out of the South to the North, and traveled directly over my head.  I looked away from the plane, unlocked by car, and then looked back up to the plane which was now turning West.  I also noticed another plane flying at an altitude higher than the first and traveling out of the Nortwest traveling Southeast, their paths intersecting momentarily.  At this time I noticed the object at an altitude between the two planes, at an approx. 30 degree angle behind the first plane and almost directly below the second.  I looked back toward the first plane which was now traveling directly West to try and read the banner it was trailing.  Thinking when I first noticed the object it was a reflection, I looked back toward it, the second plane having now traveled out of view.  The object was still in the same spot that I first noticed it or very close to it, and it appeared to be hovering but moving slightly to the West.  I looked away again, trying to process what I was seeing, and then again looked up.  The object was gone from the spot I had last seen it.  I gazed the skies to the West and as I was turning my gaze to the East, the object appeared coming out of the West going directly East, moving at a very high rate of speed and out of my view.  This object while traveling at such a rate of speed made no sound and produced no contrails. I know of no conventional aircraft capable of such speed and able to move off its original spot in one direction, then change direction, and then accelerate to the speed at which I saw it traveling, in the time that it took for this object to do so, and in the small area of space/sky I was able to see. This occurred on a sunny day, with some clouds in the sky.  However, the clouds were the big, puffy &#34;cotten ball&#34; type, not the thin, wispy type.<n>

At first, they were flashed at eye level (from where the cars were parked, by the edge of the cliff). The first time, the flashes lasted about 15 secs (and a very strange type of humming/vibration noise was heard/felt when the beams of light were first displayed). The second time, the beams lasted longer. The humming/vibration was only heard/felt when the beams of light were displayed. In other words, when the lights were not beaming, no noise or vibrations were felt/seen. Then, about 2 minutes later, the beams came from directly above, like if the object was directly above us. When it was in front of us, we could not clearly make out the shape of it...the closest object would be a deformed shaped egg. When it was above us, the beams of light, lite up the whole parking area. Before any of this took place, there was no noticeable air traffic in the area. Helicopters are fairly easy to distinguish...and I can honestly say that it was not a helicpoter or anything close to it. There was a total of about 5 or 6 cars in the lot where this took place. The area, generally, is a lookout/makeout point....so it was not odd that there were this many people out at 2:00 in the morning.<n>

An occasional flash seemed focused (towards me) rather than the non-focused variety usually seen.  The plane seemed to be passing a faint star which then moved in relation to other stars.  Simultaneously, there was a blue flash in the east that lighted up the whole horizon.  I do not believe any of the events were connected, but they may tie to a time line.  I doused my flashlight and watched the N traveling object until it disappeared over the N horizon.  It became more indistinct as it traveled N due to the lights from White Rock, B.C.  It moved rapidly in a zig-zag fashion for a brief period (2-3 seconds) then straightened out in a northerly route.  Could have been a polar route satellite except for the deviations in path.<n>

Coming out of a trail that opened onto the dirt road that leads back to paved roads, we saw the object.  It was about 3 feet across, and had a light on each hemisphere.  Each light moved independently of the other.  When we first spotted the object it was using it&#39;s lights to investigate a nearby field.  It was hovering about 1 - 2 feet above the tree line.  It was also making the strangest humming/whizzing sound.  It then swept it&#39;s lights over us (still in the truck), and then started to move towards us.  At that point we bolted for the main road.  I personally (as the passanger) watched it either dissappear or move too fast to be seen.  As we fled the scene, I looked back to see that it had reappeared higher up in the sky, and in cloud cover that was not there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We could not determine how far this light was, except that from our position it appeared to be above Monterey, or possibly beyond it, over the water.  As we drove on, this light appeared to expand into an oval shape.  It did not appear to move, or moved very slowly (keeping in mind that we were driving towards it).  The oval light began to fade, leaving a concentrated pinpoint of light, which then disappeared altogether.

I called out to my companion who was just getting in the car with her back turned to the object. She turned to look but the object had disappeared. I called a local Seattle radio station to report the sighting and to ask if anyone else had reported it as well. They told me that no one else had reported it.

I then observed a blinking red light traveling across the sky from west to east. I assumed it was a plane but soon realized that it was moving much too fast. The object only blinked two or three times (perhaps once per second) and was gone.  I could clearly make out the speed and trajectory as extremely fast and straight line.  I would guess the elevation to be 5-10K and there was no sound at all. I had apro 90 deg view of sky with trees on both horizons.  The entire sighting lasted maybe two or three seconds.  It was particularly interesting given the two objects in the sky at the same time.  My wife ask me if could have been a satelite and I only had to point to the one going over and compare.  I tried to get her attention to see the fast moving object but it was gone before she could get a look.  It did not appear to be a meteor as I could clearly distinguish a strobing light.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> slow moving object burning and dropping pieces of burning material<n> <n><n> <n><n> My apologies for submitting this form twice but the first date I gave was wrong. It was a little over a year ago, in 1999, not 2000. sorry I&#39;ve never thought of this as a UFO experience but I&#39;m watching a UFO-sightings show on the Travel Channel and one of the things that people in the show had video taped in Florida is the exact thing that I saw from my backyard. I had borrowed a night vision scope from a friend and I was playing with it in my backyard just after the sun had set. I often look at the night-time sky and I live right under the approach path of Ontario airport. Looking north/north-west over my rooftop I saw a sputtering light which looked like something burning fiercely, like magnesium, but not as bright. It was moving too slowly (in my opinion) to be a jetliner, and it wasn&#39;t losing any altitude. When I saw it I wasn&#39;t looking throught the night-vision scope but the magnitude diminished quickly and I began using the scope which had magnification as well as light-amp. Through the scope I could see the sputtering light very well and before it stopped I saw at least two to three small flare-type objects fall from it.  This is when I realized that the main thing was moving very slowly, like a blimp or something.  The &#34;flares&#34; would vanish within a couple of seconds and were not nearly as bright as the main light, and shortly after they dropped from the main part the  whole thing sort of faded away until nothing was visible through the scope or without the scope. I kept looking for something in that direction for 30-45 minutes and saw nothing.and at no time did I see any structure attatched to any of the lights. All of this, in my estimation, was taking place at about 2000 feet in altitude and I think about 20-30 miles away, possibly over the high desert to the northwest of Wrightwood.  I must say however that my ability to estimate values, distances, and altitudes has never been great. I expected to see something in the paper the next day about a airplane/military accident or even on the news shows that night, but nothing ever came of it. So, there it is, I hope this helps.  I would be more than happy to attempt to submit a mor! e detail ed report if you like. I&#39;m only sorry I didn&#39;t think more of it when it happened, and I could draw from a fresh memory. Thanks. By the way, I was reading some of the local reports and there is one in Fontana about 10 years ago- a red light 300-500 feet up- stationary, as rain clouds passed by it didnt move...yadda yadda.. Myself and a buddy saw a bunch of people out of their cars in slight rain and looking up, so we stopped and saw that red light.  But quite frankly think it was a light attatched to a kite or something.. but who knows.<n>

A silvery &#34;cigar&#34; rose vertically out of the huge canyon to the north of the Bear Valley Ski Resort parking lot off Highway 4 about 20 miles west of the state line. The &#34;cigar&#34; was inclined about 65 degrees like /, but rose nearly straight up, maybe 80 degrees. The direction it rose was SE to SSE and it&#39;s path was probably an arc. It rose to a spot near overhead in about 3 seconds &amp; I then lost site of it. The UFO object was probably a disk seen from the side (cigar shape) of about 20&#39; to 30&#39; feet. When I first observed it, I was looking through my good quality binoculars and actually tracked it for a second or so. I then picked it up again when it was overhead without the glasses. About 20 minutes later I heard a small prop plane travel through the canyon bottom from east to west but I didn&#39;t see it.<n>

The skies were clear except for the wispy clouds under the contrail. At 17:35, I was scanning the skies for more contrails and pointed my binoculars almost straight up towards the east -- directly over The Colony. I could not believe what I was seeing! There were 15-20 silver spheres spread out across the sky reflecting the sun to my back! The spheres would disappear and reappear moving slowly into different patterns. I would guess these were at least at an altitude of 20-30,000 feet but that is very hard to tell. I could not make them out without binoculars. These soon disappeared and I noticed a larger white craft hovering overhead a little to my east. I focused my binoculars and watched this object for quite a while overhead then continued watching it as it slowly moved toward the area of the contrail to the northeast. It was white, reflecting the sun and appeared to have a red glow emanating from behind it at times. It then hovered again near a wisp of &#34;contrail cloud&#34; and soon after was joined one at a time by 5 spheres. These spheres (maybe 1/8 the size of the craft) slowly moved around the craft -- with very smooth and graceful moves -- as the craft moved toward the northwest. At this point they were about 6-8 miles away I would estimate and traveling slowly at about 20,000 feet. Suddenly more objects appeared around the larger craft a few at a time until there were at least 9-15 in various formations above it and to its sides. They all went out of view or disappeared at 18:35. Within 5 minutes, two large military helicopters flew overhead flying from the northeast-- the general direction of the objects. I have seen objects before around here hovering over the lake or apparently observing or interacting with contrails -- but these were no more than 2 at a time! I have never seen anything like this before!! If anyone else saw these, please write up a report! This is tr! uly a momentous discovery...that so many of these things are above us. Look up with binoculars during the day and at night to see these high altitude objects. This has been a truly mind-shifting experience!<n>

It came into view without having traversed the sky. It was stationary against a clear blue sky. At arms length it would have measured one inch long by 3/16 inches high. It was solid grey with visible highlights and shadows. A band of whitish light started movng  from the right end  along it&#39;s length to the left end, when it reached the left end it started over on the right side. The band of light repeated this several times and then the object  suddenly faded -there were no clouds, no mist to obscure it&#39;s view. The object still sat stationary and the band of light was still pulsing along it&#39;s length, the only change was that the object no longer exhibited visible hightlights and shadows, it had a fuzzy out of focus appearance.

Peach or amber glow was like setting sun on moon.  Speed faster than jet.  Steady speed and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First picked up object with field glasses.  Peach glow, blunt cigar shape, not a football.  If this is a ufo, it may be a disc if seen overhead.  As to size, distance and altitude if object is say 1000 ft long, it was 300 feet fat, about 3000 ft altitude and moving at over 600 mph.  There were no unusual  maneuvers.  Lost sight of object in trees as it seemingly moved South above I-5 corridor. After sighting, my wife called hotline<n>

We live on a high ridge between the Sea-Tac airport and Boeing Field, and are used to seeing all types of aircraft at all hours of the day and night. This thing was not like anything I&#39;ve ever seen! I ran back in the house and grabbed my binoculars. My husband joined me in the yard where we watched it appear in the gaps between the trees, until it grew so small it disappeared. I estimate it followed I-5 southbound. The total elapsed time from first spotting it until it disappeared covered several minutes.<n>

Me, my brother and my sister were there with her four kids. We noticed a cigar shaped objecy flying across the sky. It looked like a very bright shiney metal, silver color like aluminum foil color. It had a pewter colored ring around the very center and it was a fat ring. It appeared to be wrapped all around the object.&lt;like a ring would look on a finger&gt; It moved across the sky at a tremendously fast pace, faster than any aircraft I have ever witnessed before. It did not have any skylines behind it and it did not make any sound. It was high up, but it was like it was just there...no lights, no engine sounds, no smoke trails or anything. Just there. It flew into clouds and then it was gone. It didn&#39;t tke a long time for the whole event to occur, 30 seconds or so and it was over. My sister told me afterwards that she and my brother had witnessed it at an earlier date. We were all very freaked out about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness meant 3:00 p.m., since children probably would not be swimming and 0300 hrs..  We have changed the time here.  PD))<n>

I watched for approx 15 minutes as they continued to appear and disappear.<n>

I rolled down my window to see if a reflection was causing this appearance and rubbed my eyes a couple of times and the object was not a blimp or aircraft and I was VERY amazed!  I kept looking back up at it as I was driving and it just sat there in mid air.  After watching it and telling myself this is amazing it suddenly shot off into the atmosphere with incredible speed. I swear I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) age 53<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was situated around 1 mile east of my location over or near the county landfill. At first i thought it was a helicopter as i saw it out of the corner of my eye. I emediatly stopped my car and got out and looked directly at it. At this point i could only see part of it. I got back in the car screaming at my partner to wake up and look at this thing. We backed up spinning wheels to see it again. I could tell that it was NOT A HELICOPTER. It was easily bigger than any aircraft that i have ever seen. It had two distinct lines running around the edges with large lights or windows running between the lines. it had a tarnished silver color to it and appeared to glow It made no sound as it moved north behind the trees.The trees didnt move as the craft moved toward them.The air was completely still.You could here traffic coming north on rt.220.After determining that this thing could defenitely here me and knowing that it could see me, i left the county alltogether at a high rate of speed and didnt look back.<n>

(Initially I thought it was a shooting star except it wasn&#39;t moving.) Then from the star shape a bright red beam appeared.(It looked about an inch long and seemed to head north and up.) At the other end of this another white flash of light appeared then the entire object faded out. The whole event lasted at most 3 seconds.<n>
