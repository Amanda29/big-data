The size and shape of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10pm. I was camping of sorts on my balcony do to relitives visiting. While I was looking at the moon I saw a very large object. I just saw the bottom at first as it passed over the apartment building I was living in. I didn&#39;t know what I was looking at. The first thing I thought as I started to see more and more of the bottom of the craft, is that it was a blimp (having never seen a blimp). I noticed no sound because I could still hear crickets and palmento bugs cherping. The wasn&#39;t but maybe 100 feet off the top of the building. Once I saw the entire bottom of the craft it was huge. A massive rectangle in shape, I would say the size of a football field. That is 50 yards in width and 100 yards in length. It was close enough to see that the craft was made of what appeared to be metal. It had semetrical design that&#39;s to say I could see long flat &#34;beams&#34; (like I beams used in construction) they kind of criscrossed over the objects&#39; undersurface meeting in a triangel pattern. In each triangle had it&#39;s own semitery a circular indentation and a receded light that was not very visible a sort of green in color. As it passed completely overhead and I could see the end of the object I was looking for the balloon part of the blimp and it wasn&#39;t there, it wasn&#39;t until that moment that I realized it wasn&#39;t a blimp. The object was thin at Max. 4 feet in depth. That was when I ran inside screaming there is a UFO outside! I was met with &#34;ya right&#34;. By the time I got someone to come outside with me it had moved off so all me and my cousen could see the rear edge of the craft. She said &#34;where is the UFO&#34; I said &#34;it&#39;s right there&#34; (pointing at the object as it was moving away) And she said &#34;no it&#39;s not&#34; I replied &#34;Do you see something right there?&#34; she says &#34;ya&#34; I replied &#34;That is a UFO&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

That is my best guess due to the fact that the reason my mother and I were looking skyward that evening was due to the fact that a newly found comet was supposed to be in the vacinity of Earth and observable with the naked eye. (the year could have been 07/22/86) I can imagine based upon what we saw that NUMEROUS other witnesses are available to report this one.  So here are the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 5:pm news Channel 32, the ABC affiliate at the time in Louisville Ky., reported that a new comet would be passing within eyeshot of the earth later that evening within a specific constellation which I cannot recall.  I have been a amateur astronomer since I was in 4th grade and possess a number of telescopes.  I became excited about the comet news and later that evening forced my mother and sister to join me up on our second floor roof deck with a clear view of most of the mid-west sky.  After locating the constellation, possibly Orion, which was directly overhead, after looking for several minutes I was dissappointed in NOT being able to see any comet at all.  This was bizarre to me as the newscast was very specific and I thought my knowledge of the sky was reasonably good.  My sister quickly lost interest and was looking down at her feet (something she regrets to this day) when the following occurred...in precisely the spot in the constellation where we believed the comet would be visible, my mother and I saw a spectacular METEOR whiz directly through the spot where the comet was supposed to be.  I immediately reacted with a shout of excitement &#34;DID you SEE THAT!&#34; just as mom reacted with &#34;WOW!&#34;  I have seen literally over 500 meteors in my lifetime and what happened next defies all knowledge of meteor behavior...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment the meteor&#39;s bright white light dissipated, I assumed it was just pure luck that we happened to see it instead of a much slower if not stationary comet within the same region.  But as this though instantly crossed my mind. a second meteor appeared with the same intensity and duration only this time it was exactly on line with the first meteor but farther toward the horizon...in the direction of Downtown Louisville about 9-miles to the West.  My mother also saw this second one.  The second burned out immediately and then a THIRD meteor made its appearrance also on the same line as the first two!  It then burned out and yet a FOURTH meteor followed on the same line now nearly at the sky&#39;s west horizon.  This was an absolutely silent event which lasted roughtly 6-seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was over I was speechless, as was my mom...but I mamaged a &#34;...did you see that?&#34; her response &#34;yes.&#34; and THEN I  went NUTS with excitement!  It was clearly not a meteor as meteors do not switch on and off, and the on&#39;s and off&#39;s were in equal lengths/times.  Judging by the speed and duration of the event, the object had to be moving a AMAZING SPEED to go from a point directly overhead to the west horizon in only 6-seconds at that altitude.  And finally, I have seen satellites, and the shuttle, orbiting the earth in the past...and they were practically stationary compared to this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that we are talking about an event over a decade ago, but perhaps this description corroborated other reports you may have received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you care to discuss this further call me at 310-((number and name deleted)) =)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

As i got to the window I looked out above the houses across the street from me and noticed a strange object moving very slowly across the sky. It was circular or disk shaped and did not rotate or anythinglike that. There were three lights on the bottom of the craft one was orange one yellow and one red basically froming a triangle on the bottom. My window was wide open and it made no sound whatsoever. It slowly moved up and overhead and then i noticed something strange because at first I thought it might just be a helicopter. But it started shining a light up and into the clouds creating a circluar yellow white light above it in the clouds. I have thought about this alot since then and am pretty sure helicopters shine their lights down not up into the sky. As the craft passed over the top of my house I ran down stairs to tell my parents what i was seeing, but theycould have cared less. I then ran bck upstairs and into one of the rooms on the back of the house and could still see the craft moving overhead still making no sound and stiil shining the light up into the clouds.  After another minute it flew out of my view. I still don&#39;t know what i saw. I know it was not a plane or helicopter, but totally unlike anything i had seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first we thought it was some kind of advertising.  It was hard to determine the shape of the object as all we could see were uneven lighting around the edges of it.  It flew east and then south.  We followed it and it started to hover.  It was quite high in the sky.  It appeared that it turned over on its side and we saw four small lights in the shape of a square with a faint circle joining all the lights.  While in the sky a plane came from the north and circled the object.  It then flew back north from where it came.  All of the sudden the object was gone.<n>

7/16/88 01:15|Malibu|CA|Other|>15 Min|UFO in Malibu Canyon|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61750.html|10|ndxe198807| UFO in Malibu Canyon<n> <n><n> It was summertime, and we were typical teenagers in love.  My girlfriend and I decided to go to Zuma Beach in California just north of Malibu late one evening. She had a recent model Pontiac ((type deleted)).  She borrowed the car from her step mother for the evening.  She had a curfew and we decided we should start heading back from the beach toward home in the West San Fernando Valley. We left Zuma at a quarter to 1:00AM. She drove and we took PCH (Highway 1) for approx. a few minutes to Malibu Canyon Rd. Turned onto Malibu Cyn towards the 101 freeway and the SFV. There was no one around that intersection prior to turning onto Malibu Canyon. I noticed that there were no other cars on the road behind us or in front of us at that moment, and I had a clear view as we began to crest the first part of Malibu Canyon Rd from the ocean for about a mile ahead as we began to twist and turn on the sinuous canyon road ahead. It was a clear evening. Excellent visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We past by the Hughes Research Lab where they test satellites for aerospace. No noticeable activity that evening. Sometimes the huge box that camo colored would be open and they would have something they would be testing. Not this night though. We had a cassette tape playing in the stereo, it was the kind of tape player that would change sides automatically. The event began as we neared the tunnel. I looked out the passenger seat window to my right into the darkness of the canyon and I felt like I saw something out of the corner of my eye only to be staring into darkness. The Canyon is wide to my right and the cliff is a 500-700 foot drop off.  My feeling was that there was something there though which made no sense to me at the time. I shrugged it off quickly and let her concentrate of driving the car. I didn&#39;t want to alert her to something that was only a feeling. We went through the tunnel, and emerged from the other side. That is when I began to notice a “brightness” from behind our car develop, as if there was someone behind us who was going to need to pass us soon since they were coming at a good rate of speed. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was upset that someone would want to race pass her this late at night. It was a weeknight and nobody usually would be on this road on a weeknight anyway. Maybe someone racing someone in the canyon..  The light grew to the point where she squinted her eyes, and flipped the mirror. I remember the bright reflection across her eyes at this point from the rear view mirror was still a very bright reflection across her face and she had to then move her head to avoid being blinded from that point on. The light was from behind the our car, it did not “flood the compartment”, but what the light touched it appeared almost perfectly while, perhaps like a sodium light or probably a flash from a camera except a constant incredible blinding brightness. She began to accelerate. The mood changed quickly from being upset to being worried that some jerk was trying to ! run us o ff the road or chase us through the canyon. That is when I turned around to give this jerk the universal hand signal to back off. As I turned around to look at the person driving, I had to squint  as if I was looking at the sun when I turned around. I thought I saw something that looked a large station wagon, except the lights went all the horizontally across the grill of the car following us. They were square and they were not quite like lights with light bulbs that cars have. They were more like flood lamps for a football stadium. They were slightly larger. I turned around quickly as to not be blinded by the light. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was becoming panicked. I told her to go as fast as possible. She got the car up to 75-85MPH  and back down on the turns.. I rememebr the tires were screaming on the turns.. Even the slightest straightaway she would bring it back up to around 80.  I turned around again, and the light had not changed distance to our car. It had remained approx less than 10 feet off of her rear bumper. It was impossible to shake them. The second time I turned around, I did not see a station wagon. I saw a grill of lights. There was no glare from a chrome bumper like you would find on a station wagon. The light would burn like if you were sitting in front of a TV set too close for too long, like a very powerful tanning booth on full blast. My girlfriend was starting to under compensate her steering, and I told her take her foot off the gas. She refused and she was screaming at this point. I put hand on her leg and told her to use the whole road, both lanes. Anyone in front of us would see the light and have to pull over. The next thing that happened was very strange. The light was gone. It simply ended. I turned around, saw that it was gone. I looked really hard to see if it had turned off, or if there was a shadow under the street lights.. and there was nothing. It was completely gone. My girlfriend was shaking. I told her to pull the car over to the side of the road. S! he refus ed. She didn&#39;t speak a word for the rest of the trip. I tried my best to tell her everything was alright, and that it was gone, whatever it was.  I flipped her rear view mirror visor back down. I kept an eye on her for the rest of the drive back into town. She was different, and I was very worried at this point about something and I didn&#39;t know what it was. Something was wrong. For the rest of the drive I just let  her drive the car, and she drove straight back to her parents house in Tarzana, way at the top of Vanalden, south of the Ventura Blvd. The drive felt odd, yet very calm and relaxed. Like waking after a nightmare after you are done being frightened half to death.. She parked, and sat there for a minute before turning the engine off. I noticed two things at this point as she just sat there almost in shock. The tape player had stopped playing the tape. The tape was completely done on one side as I ejected it. It didn&#39;t flip or changed sides automatically.. I put the tape back in, and it changed to the other side automatically that it normally would have. I then ejected it and put it in my pocket. I looked at the clock. It took a full ten seconds to wrap my brain around what it said. It said 1:12AM.  My mind went back to Zuma and it was 15 minutes to 1:00AM. We entered the Canyon at at least 12:55, and somehow we traveled all that way to her house in &lt; 13-15 minutes, which is impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her about it the next day, and she vaguely remembered it. After summer she went home, out of state,  where her real family was living. We had lost contact with each other. I wrote her but she never wrote me back.. I came up to visit her a couple of months later, and she wouldn&#39;t talk to me the whole time. I only would talk with her brother who was also a good friend of mine. We didn&#39;t have a nasty breakup. There was no reason for her acting this way, that I would have been aware of. I tried to think back to whatever it could have been... I asked her brother to ask her about the incident in the canyon, and if that was the reason, because that was the only thing bad that ever happened. She told him she didn&#39;t remember anything happening in Malibu Canyon. He said it was like she blocked out the entire summertime we spent together out of her mind. I was horribly heartbroken by this, and I returned home to LA. This incident happened in 88&#39;. Years later when I grew into adulthood I had a few nice cars.. Eventually I got a sport car. I still try to attempt to beat that record time I did in the canyon. The fastest I can make it from PCH and Malibu Canyon to the the valley is 22 minutes. That is hauling and screaming the tires the whole way, not just part of the way.  I even got a ticket for it once by the Malibu Sheriff in all my years of reliving that drive... My only speeding ticket in my life. ha..<n> <n><n> <n><n> She eventually grew up to be a burn patient specialist and married someone from her church. I have heard about stories of people who had lost time. Somehow I gained time or “froze” time going through the canyon in that car that night that I still can not explain why to the best of all my ability. For a while I thought I wanted to attribute what happened to the Hughes Research Lab that is located inside that canyon, the only facility. I don&#39;t know why, just my own intuition. I can&#39;t say I saw a UFO. I never saw it leave the ground. I never saw anything land from above. I felt like there was something just prior to entering the tunnel and it would have been floating approx 500+ feet above the canyon gully next to the road we were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.Perhaps what followed us could have been the Sheriff or some kid in a V8 muscle car. I didn&#39;t hear it make any noise above the sound of the Pontiac&#39;s V6 motor. Whatever it was was not car in my opinion. I did not have KC headlights. They were larger and square and not incandescence lights. They were the most perfectly while lights I have ever seen in my whole life, and they wrapped around the entire front of whatever you want to call it.. I just call it the “grill” of the front of whatever it was. A rectangle entirely made up many large rectangular lights. Approx 16 of them. That part bothers me. I haven&#39;t found anything that has that kind of light configuration on any type of vehicle ever. It could  have been a practical joke, maybe some teenagers were waiting for someone like us to be coming thought he canyon late on a weeknight. Whatever followed us that night, came up fast, and stayed perfectly on the bumper of the Pontiac and stayed perfectly behind us on ever turn, and matched our speed perfectly for at least 10-15 heartracing minutes.. As soon as we saw the lights of the city ahead then it was gone like someone turning off a switch. It didn&#39;t have tires that screamed. I am still very bothered by what happened. I have waited until now to post this hoping somehow after all these years I would have some way of explaining it, after all my research, and I do not. I will admit that I&#39;m a huge fan of Sci-fi books. And I&#39;m a big nerd into systems engineering and that is what I do for a living. I&#39;m a big nerd today. There is some missing time I&#39;m dealing with still. I&#39;m no longer bothered by what happened. It happens so long ago now. I actually enjoy driving that same road at night sometimes, hoping whatever it was would return. Kinda. Sorta. Maybe not.  I have seen some strange lights over the Hughes Labs.. I have told just a few close friends this story. My only witness, my girlfriend can not recall this happening. Her brother remembers my conversation with him about asking her, but that is all. I&#39;m le! ft alone with this memory today.. I wanted to share it here in case someone else has had a similar incident in Malibu Canyon or frozen time.  That&#39;s all I have. Thank you. You may edit this to however you wish for brevity but I wanted to put as much detail as I can still remember and feeling for the moment and also with my own conclusion. I&#39;m a UCSC grad, and I own my own company and have a house in Venice Beach, California.<n>

My dad opens the front door and yells &#34;LOOK!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well my bro and I run outside and my dad is in the middle of the yard staring at the sky.  We look up and there is this round object flying extremely low and what seemed slow...so low its scary..but yet we dont say a word to each other nor do we run away...we can&#39;t help but just stand there in awe and stare as this object is about to fly over our heads...its the size of a house and it has small white round lights around the perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not making a sound and its about 10pm so no one is outside yelling or making a commotion..matter of fact, if you werent looking in the sky it would have flown right over your head without you ever knowing. It flew directly over our head and now that im older i can say that it was probably about 300ft. above us...it cleared some power lines but was so low i remember thinking to my self &#34;its gonna hit the power lines&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also flew what i would consider slow...about 30mph. I know SOMEONE else HAD to have seen it around the area as we live in a residential neighborhood in the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didnt have a camcorder or camera back then and i know that now thats the first thing i would grab if i ever saw it again.  I remember telling everyone but back then no one seemed to care so i just kinda buried the memories and it was begining to feel like i dreamt that night because i dont talk to my dad anymore and my bro never brought it up but my wife asked me if i ever thought i&#39;d seen a ufo so i asked my bro if he remembered that night and he confirms my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His account is exactly the same except he says he remembers shortly afterwards black helicopters were flying around the area because my dad pointed them out (he was a helicopter mechanic back then).  My bro is 3 years younger so i guess i would have been about 10 or 11 and he was! 7 or 8 when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yeah...i know the object was round because when it flew over us, you could see this massive round black silouette in the dark sky and the perimeter lights were not beams but rather dull yellow white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF ANYONE REMEMBERS SEEING SOMETHING SIMILAR PLEASE POST! this occured in the 80&#39;s on the west side of corpus christi near prescott and gollihar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was the period just before it gets dark and my brother said look at this! I looked up and saw what looked like normal spotlights, there were 5 in a horizontal line. I thought nothing of it. I went back to fishing. He said hey look at this thing! I looked again, and now the lights were changing form- they went from a line to a 7 shape, to an L shape then to a cross type shape. I then began to pay attention to this. We couldnt see anything else at this point. The lights were above the treeline approx. 300 yards away.  It was a clear night, stars out, moon shining. All of a sudden, there was no sky above us. It was black. We could both feel what we can only describe as the field that exists between opposing magnets. It was weird. The craft then turned and some sky became visible again and at that point we could see the shape of this thing. It was like a 55 gallon drum that was cut lenghtwise and laid flat. This thing was huge. Like a city block huge. It made no noise, and aside from the &#34;spotlights&#34; we saw initially, it had no lights. We were scared beyond words. This thing was directly above our heads for what seemed like forever. It eventually just moved up and away at a very slow rate of speed and ascent. We left immediately after that, when we got home we told our family about it and called the Redding police to see if anyone else had seen or reported this. We declined to leave our names because we did not want to be associated with this in any way. Take this for what its worth- both of us saw what we saw, and to this day, I cannot stop looking at the sky. I am compelled to looking upward all the time. That image will stay with me until I pass. It was extremely frightening and definitely not of this world whatever it was.<n>

Went into the backyard about 2am,noticed something moving in my neighbors backyard.at first i thought it was my neighbor looking over the fence but it was too late to be likely so i walked over to the fence.i saw a black sphere about 2 -3 feet  across with the look of a polished aluminumfive ft. from me.when i walked towards it it started to go down behind the fence,like i had supprised it! It moved like it was on a hydraulic lift.slow but a very steady speed not floating at all,but looking like it was very heavey.I could still see the sphere through the slits in the fence,and I held my breath .I always wanted to see a ufo.but this really scared me.not because i thought there were aliens inside,but because I&#39;ve never seen something that looked so heavy defy gravity.after a minuet(seemed like 10)the sphere started to rise again at a very steady slow speed again, untill it was in plain sight again ,and then untill it was behind the dense brush of a tree that was next to it.I ran inside and locked the doors and didnt sleep till sunrise.the next day i told all my friends and my mom.my mom didn&#39;t believe me .but the day after i told her we were watching the news and saw a story we couldn&#39;t believe.some people surveying land in orange county filmed exactly the same sphere I saw . there were 5 houses on the screen and the sphere went from house to house in hops going a bout 100 ft in the air upto speeds that were clocked at 300 mph.the film was actually made a week before but it didn&#39;t make it to the news until after it had been verified by the airforce as&#34;what the camera actually saw&#34;(no video trickery)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This happened aproximately 8 times.  We were too frightened to move.  It was a clear night with no clouds. This was no aircraft that I have ever seen.  the object was oval in shape, with a solid, yellowish radiance.

Mother and I were driving back from Ok. I saw a set of lights in front of me that I thought were vehicles crossing over I-40 on a bridge heading south.  It looked like a large white cross shape with the long stem of the cross going first, it was followed by 2 smaller red shaped crosses.  We were approaching at an upward slant since were climbing the hill outside corona, but when we got to the top we realized there was not a bridge over I-40 there.  As we reached the crest and started down we could see the lights heading south along a ridge line till they went out of sight.  As we got closer to the town of Corona, we passed by a vehicle stopped along side west I-40 and a man standing outside his car{looked like a VW wagon} looking down south watching the lights.  A whilr later we caught a program that was showing pictures of a ufo in Belgium and it was what we saw that night, We both agreed to what we saw that night.  I am not for sure the exact date or year-but it was close to that time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

To the left, something caught my eye, and as I was looking, this bright orange sphere as big as the sun descending behind two small hills in the southeast, within 45 seconds, before I had time to realize what I was seeing, or at least to make sense of it, it disappeared.

We were roasting marshmallows with the grandkids on the beach one night, and the subject of UFO&#39;s came up.  My daughter re-capped an incident that I had long since forgotten about, mostly because at that time I was skeptical and didn’t have time to think of such things as UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened about 19 years ago, but I think is worth passing on.  It involved my daughter (16 at the time) and her mother, the location was near Monroe Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quote:  &#34;Mom picked me up at the Dairy Queen, where I was working part time during the summer months before school started. It was dusk at the time, we drove up the woods creek road towards home.  As we drove along we saw a bright light ahead and as we neared it and saw what a strange thing we were looking at, Mom pulled our car to a stop, lowered the windows and shut the motor off. We gazed in amazement at what we saw, it was a football shaped craft with several lights from front to back. It was hovering over a dairy farm field, perhaps a hundred feet off the ground, I would guess it was about 30 feet in length. It made no sound at all, we had our windows down and our motor was shut off. After just a few minutes it started moving slowly up the valley (north). Mom started the car and we stayed along with it for about a mile, it then turned to the left (west), increased in speed and shot out of sight like a bullet.&#34; End of quote..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter is and has always been a responsible person, you can take what she says to the bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself filed a report a few years back on strange lights observed by my hunting partners and I near Coulee Dam Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

As we took the left at the flashing light towards Rome (I apologize about not remembering the route number) I noticed a small orange light high in the sky, I told my friend sitting in the front seat to check out the moon and we both kind of blew it off.  As I continued driving the orange ball increased in size and continued to decend to no more than 3 feet above the road surface 300 yards in front of us.  The shape of the object was spherical, but there were no defining edges to it. It was brightly illuminated in a deep orange color, the light from the object reflected off of the road as well as the farmhouse it was in front of.  The object&#39;s diameter was easily 50&#39; as it was larger than the two story farmhouse.  At this point we were 300 yards and closing the object rotated 90 degrees on the Z axis and it appeard to be two balls of the same size at that point.  This is when the girls in the back seat saw it and started screaming, which caused me to panic.  I spun the car around and headed back toward Sylvan Beach as fast as I could go.  I attempted to look back and see if it was still there, but my car had louvers on the back window and I could not see the object behind me.  My friend in the front seat looked out of his window and said that it was following us.  I gunned the car and we parked under a bridge that leads to the park in Sylvan Beach.  We looked around and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we calmed down we discussed what we saw.  This was not a hallucination, we were not under the influence of alchahol or any drugs.  This was a long time ago and I can recall it as if it just happened and I have 4 other witnesses that would testify under oath.  I thought that this should somehow be recorded in case anybody else had seen somthing like this that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in the area most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  Being that this was close to Rome NY where Griffiss Air Force Base (A SAC base) there must have been some kind of radar signature.  In any event, the object was guided as it had a controlled decent, a hover and then following us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sky was very clear and cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object dwindled into the distance and faded to a speck and was gone in 3-4 sec.  Acceleration was multiple high G.

As I never filed a sighting report when my incident happened, I was encouraged to file one now although my sighting is now twenty four years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:00 AM on a Saturday in July of 1988, I decided to travel home to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a long weekend from Las Cruces, New Mexico where I was attending New Mexico State University.  Having always been a night owl and very used to not going to bed until three or four in the morning, I decided to head for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive from Las Cruces to Albuquerque is about 230 miles traveling North on Interstate 25 and takes approximately three hours.  I was a little past two thirds of the way, North of Socorro, New Mexico, when I happened to notice bright flashing or blinking lights way off to the East and traveling South.  As I continued to drive, I could see that the lights began slowly moving from the East toward the West in my direction.  I thought that the lights were perhaps a large military aircraft that was banking to the right as Kirtland AFB was only about fifty miles North of my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, it was about 2:30 AM.  There was no South-bound traffic on Interstate 25 and only one vehicle behind me about a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes, the blinking lights were very bright and very low, perhaps 1000 feet.  It was not long before they were only about ¼ of a mile ahead of me and beginning to cross over Interstate 25.  At this time I pulled my car over to the shoulder and got out of the car to watch the object.  Within a minute, the vehicle traveling behind me also pulled off to the side of the road to watch the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was almost beyond belief.  The object stopped its traveling motion and hovered motionless.  It was pitch black and appeared to have a triangular shape.  This was evident because it exhibited bright, flashing lights with each light flashing in unison very quickly.  The shape of the flashing lights was suggestive of a triangle.  Suddenly, all of the flashing lights went out and a round, bright hole appeared in the center of the shape.  A small luminescent ball appeared to drop from the center hole where it slowly moved off and away from the triangle shape.  It then appeared to flash away and was gone.  The light in the center of the triangle shape dimmed and the flashing lights started again.  The triangle object then began to continue to move off to the West and then South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman from the other car and I were at a complete loss for words.  In fact, we were both overcome with an urge to get to a populated area as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, we did not exchange any contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted from Denver, CO – June 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

His bark was the bark as if he didn&#39;t want to leave the porch but wanted to summon someone in the family.  I went to investigate. Initially I saw nothing.  Then a rectangular craft flew by very slowly. The craft was divided into thirds.  Each third lit up sequentially with a red light.  The object made  no noise whatsover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to the above information there is more to add that is very interesting.  One week later a friend of mine from high school, telephoned me in a panicked state.  Apparently he had seen the same object in the city of Sierra Madre, while on a night hike into Bailey Canyon.  He had stopped to tie his shoe lace while the others continued on the hike.  He stated that the object appeared to lose control and looked as though it were going to crash into the property of Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  This is a Catholic retreat center run by the Passionist Fathers. The thing that through us for a loop about this is this.... My friend who had witnessed this event, a week after I had, had gone to the whole life expo in Pasadena,Ca. of that year.  He left the convention being &#34;paranoid&#34; of ufo&#39;s and aliens.  I was a &#34;doubting Thomas&#34;.  I suggested that he go and see a psychiatrist.  Nothing more was said about the ufo subject untill the sightings that we  had It was that we had conversed, and realized that we had seen the same craft at two different places and times that there must be connection.  It was almost like as if some intelligence did something to get my dog to bark that night, to get me out of bed to investigate so that I would see this craft. Like I said...I never went to the whole life expo....but It was like as if some intellegent being heard me tell my friend Tony that I thought he was a quack.  And to make it even more believable to us it revealed itself to us...that well we never had many people believe our story except one of the priests at the retreat center with whom we were friends with.I didn&#39;t think it necessary to record the dates of the sightings, I didn&#39;t anyone  would believe us. So there you are.  I am a firm believer after having this experience with the object and I feel  ....almost on a psychic level that we are on the verge of something....a revealing of some sort...I cant  really describe it, but we are on the verge of something.<n>
7/1/88 22:00|Sarnia/Blue Point area (Canada)|MO|Light|30 minutes|White light followed our car as we drove home from Sarnia to Blue Point|6/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75726.html|27|ndxe198807| White light followed our car as we drove home from Sarnia to Blue Point<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 88 - my mother and I were returning to our house in Blue Point from a night of Bingo in Sarnia.  It was late, dark, and we were driving north east on Highway 7, when I noticed a white circular light in the distance.  At first I didn&#39;t think any of it. We were in the country, it was white and rather small, so I just thought  a light on the side of a barn, off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued driving, the light never fell behind our car, which seemed really odd to me.  If it was a light, we would have eventually passed it and it would have went out of sight, but instead, it continued to keep pace with us.  It was then that I asked my mom if she saw the light and she said yes and had been watching it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive was about 20 minutes and the road was fairly windy, and the entire time, the light continued to travel the same path as we did.  It also seemed to bigger, which I assumed meant it was getting closer to our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got close to our house, we turned left into our neighborhood.  It was then that the light came even closer to our car, then moved ahead of us about a block down the street and hovered. It was very low in the sky, almost to the top of the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, we are both scared.  We drove down towards it, and made another left onto my street. Our house was two houses on the left.  We pulled into our driveway and my mom ran inside the house to get my dad.  It was at that point, the light suddenly went from white to several bright flashing colors, yellow, white, red, blue...  When my dad stepped outside, the light suddenly shot off at great speed, in a straight line, over our house and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer of 1988 is approximate.

It was a very brilliant sunny day. The giant aircraft was seen floating over the Davis-Monthan AFB, but maybe to the west, near the Tucson Airport. It was very large. My guess is that it was about 2 city blocks long. It was dark gray or black. There were no markings on it (and no lights , since it was daylight). It hovered for a few minutes, very silently, and &#34;tipped&#34; it&#39;s wing slightly, so I saw the dimension of its size.It suddenly disappearred, as if it was never there.  It was not a civilian aircraft, or any USAF jet, since I&#39;m familiar with all those due to living in the area. This craft was gigantic. this is no hoax, and I only report it now due to much embarrassment when I tried to tell others about it many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lenses where powerful enough to read a license plate from the shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening he &#34;borrowed&#34; a tape from his job and showed my wife and myself along with his wife a satellite launching from the shuttle.  As the launching took place, we could see the earth behind the launching and between the shuttle and the earth we saw at least 3 triangular shapes which glowed brightly flying extremely fast from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These unknown crafts had a dark line from the point of the triangle to the middle and then to the other points of the triangle. The UFO&#39;s then flew north and stopped and appeared to be observing the satellite launch.  The stopped and sat in place for a couple of minutes and then sped off in formation at an extremely fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of weeks later I asked my relative if I could see the tape again and he stated that it was a &#34;top secret&#34; tape and was taken by the government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several weeks after that I again asked him about the tape and he stated,  &#34;What tape?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have mentioned this to him several times since then and he denies the tapes existence.  But my wife and I both know what he show us and what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His wife stated that he got into trouble at his job for removing the tape from his job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Police Officer and my wife is a Professional college administrator.

7/1/88 13:00|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|10 minutes|One extremely large, dark gray triangular shaped object with no lights or markings on it over Tucson, AZ. (1988)|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20979.html|30|ndxe198807| One extremely large, dark gray triangular shaped object with no lights or markings on it over Tucson, AZ. (1988)<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south on Craycroft from Broadway Blvd toward the Tucson airport, I noticed a triangular shaped object in the sky. It was so large I couldn&#39;t quite believe what I saw, but kept driving unsafely, until I was another mile south. I was at an intersection near Ajo Way when this object seemed just as large as before. I stopped in the right lane of that intersection and a woman in a vehicle to my left seemed to see the object in the sky also, and we made eye contact. We both stopped and I pulled over to the shoulder. The object was a gigantic triangular shaped form. It was very dark gray in color with no lights or printing/insignias on it. This was a very brilliant day, with no clouds, so this object was clearly visible, and it was not a &#34;mirage&#34; or a cloud. I stayed parked at the roadside fore at least 3 minutes watching this object hover motionless over the Tucson International Airport and the Davis/Monthan Air Force Base area. It did &#34;hover motionless&#34; for that time, because I became very hot and thirsty, and also stunned at this sight. I can&#39;t recall anyone else stopping to view it, except that one woman I made eye contact with. She was gone. The large gray object &#34;dipped&#34; its wing, so I could see a dimension of how large it really was. It was like a city block long. Very suddenly, it disappearred. I was thinking I had a dream or a day-dream, but I know certainly I didn&#39;t. I was very sobor and I don&#39;t do any drugs, so I was very afraid to tell anyone about this. I told one person, but he said that I saw a new US &#34;secret bomber&#34;. Nope. This object had a very definite triangular shape, made no sound, stood still in the sky for too long and would certainly have made great news, if reported to the authorities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/1/88 13:00|Baker|CA|Light|3 minutes|Ball of light (3' wide) paces car on right side of freeway, then bolts 90 degrees to horizon at unbelievable speed|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92924.html|31|ndxe198807| Ball of light (3&#39; wide) paces car on right side of freeway, then bolts 90 degrees to horizon at unbelievable speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have a UFO encounter myself in broad daylight out driving between San Bernardino and Las Vegas, somewhere on the ways to Baker, CA I would guess around 1988.  I was out there driving all alone when I saw a light over to my right not that far away from my car over the desert landscape.  I thought it was strange and wondered what it was.  I assumed it was a spotlight from some crop duster airplane or something.  But the weird thing was that this light pretty much paced my car and flew along side my car at about 65 MPH for a full minute or so.  I kept wondering what it was, and was trying to keep my eye on the road and also on the light to try to figure out what it was.  After about a minute, the light seemed to have enough of pacing my car, and it bolted 90 degrees away from my car flew incredibly fast over the desert landscape and flew over the horizon in about two or three seconds, way faster than any commercial plane or jet could travel.  Was this a spaceship containing aliens?  It didn’t seem too big to me.  It kind of seemed like a ball of light.  It was hard to guage the size of the craft (if it was a craft), but I would guess the diameter was no more than six feet tall or wide.  It seemed more like a ball o! f light maybe three feet wide to me.  How fast was it going to get from my car to the horizon and over the san on the horizon?  It’s ahrd to say, but it was fast enough for me to say, “Whoa!”.  At the time, I thought that the light was probably part of some military aircraft experiments the US Army was doing tests on in the desert.  But  if it weren’t a military vehicle, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that this might have been an alien spacecraft.  As far as I know, nothing on earth could travel that fast.  Also, there was no engine sound, no sonic boom, just silence.  Pretty cool, huh?  It definitely shook me up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Who would I tell and what would they think?  That I’m weird or for the most part why? Why would I want to tell, After finally seeing the Peter Jennings report on  UFO’s I decided that maybe I should say something. I’ve read so many other stories on UFO’s and Alien sightings, but I have never read anything even similar to what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1988, my then husband and our children set out to a Law Enforcement track meet in Show Low, Az.  My husband was a deputy and was on the track team.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the meet, we rented a room at a local 2 story Motel our room was upstairs and sort of in the middle of the bldg.  The door to the room faced west, as you entered the room the 2 queen sized beds headboards were on the north side of the room and on the south side of the room facing north were the dresser and television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening we were all in bed and asleep by midnight, my three children slept on the bed that was closest to the door and my husband and I slept on the bed next to them with	 me being on the west side of the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in those early hours I awoke to see two large size Alien Men walk through the wall coming from the room just south of ours, they walked through the wall, through the dresser and the television and as they approached the feet of our bed, they stopped and looked at me, by this time I was totally paralyzed and terrified,  I could not scream move or alert my husband in anyway, I feared for our lives and especially my children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these being’s stood there watching me and my family, I could see that both had to be at least 6’5 or taller, they were very muscular but yet very lean no body fat, both were wearing body armor, I noticed their color, one was a bluish gray and the other was a redish gray color.   But these two also had a face like a horse, there mouth and nose came out just like a horse or a dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the one that was redish gray, he looked at me and mentally told me “ its ok were just passing through, after which time I think I passed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if anything happened to us that evening, for what ever reason it took years for me to remember that night, or maybe I blocked it out, I don’t know, but I do know what I seen. I never told my husband or children of the incident, and as I type this I wonder am I doing the right thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Navajo<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We went outside-my mom, dad, and myself.  We lived in the country.  Up in the field from our house was what looked like a ball of fire-or like the sun had fallen into the field.  There was so much light that it looked like daylight in the field.  My parents are huge skeptics-but they couldn&#39;t explain this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget it as long as I live. NOTHING in this world looks like what we saw.  We never spoke about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there may have been one other time I saw something-but I&#39;m less certain about this event.  I was driving Hwy 65 in Missouri toward Springfield, Missouri.  In the sky was a white light that would dart around really fast.  Apparently, I&#39;m not the only one that saw this because people were actually pulling over on the side of the road to look at the sky-the people driving slowed down to like 10 mph.  It was just a bright white light that would dark around-I don&#39;t know if this was something else or what.  This would have been in the Summer of 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

7/1/88 00:00|North Pole|AK|Unknown|1 hour 20 min|Flash of light and loss of time|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62508.html|35|ndxe198807| Flash of light and loss of time<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work on a long, dark stretch of hiway from Fairbanks Alaska to Eielson AFB.  About halfway home, there was a bright flash all around me.  Almost like a flash of a huge camera going off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after the flash, everything in my car started to die slowly.  The lights went out, the radio stopped working and eventually the car died completely.  My first thought was a battery problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember was the car starting up again on it&#39;s own and everything working as before.  I drove on home, (there were no cell phones back then), thinking it had only been a few seconds.  I was completely shocked when I arrived at our house in military housing to find out that I had lost an hour and 20 minutes.  I have absolutely no memory of what happened during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since that incident, I have had many medical issues and severe back problems.  Doctors always ask me if I&#39;ve had an injury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I have been married 32 years and have seen many UFO&#39;s in our travels across the US.  The largest one was in Wasilla, Alaska, somewhere around 1993/1994.  It was about the length of 3 football fields.  Several cars were stopped along the road watching it and it was reported in the paper the next day.  Even state troopers reported seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that sighting, my husband began having vivid dreams.  We found out about 5 years ago that my husbands blood type changed.  He&#39;d been typed in High School and throughout his Military Career as type O+.  He had a physical 5 years ago and was typed A+.  The doctors thought there was a mistake and sent him to the hospital to be re-typed.  Although all his previous records showed O+, he is now A+ as confirmed by three seperate doctors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a firm belief in UFO&#39;s and watch every show on television about them.  The dreams, for mly husband still continue.  Mine have stopped for now, but we still see many UFO&#39;s, some just lights and some we can see the entire body of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t reported any of this before because of fear of reprisal<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
