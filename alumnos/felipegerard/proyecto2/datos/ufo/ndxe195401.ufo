It had to be a UFO, as there isn&#39;t anything else that could travel that swiftly.  The side to side movements were very abrupt and fast---no arcs, just straight lines,  I was on the beach and it was dark so it was very hard to tell how far out over the water this was taking place....maybe 2 miles?? The night was clear--no clouds, no fog, and stars were evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/1/54 22:00|Souix City|IA|Circle|30 seconds|1954 Radar sighting, Air Force base in Iowa - 50000 - 80000 feet 1,200 - 1,800 miles per hour.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43491.html|2|ndxe195401| 1954 Radar sighting, Air Force base in Iowa - 50000 - 80000 feet 1,200 - 1,800 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a story my dad told my brother and I in 1975, about a year before he died. He joined the Air Force in 1950 after 2 years at the University of Minnesota and spent some time in Korea as a jet mechanic and then came stateside and was stationed at Souix City Iowa, were he was trained as a radar technition. One night in 1954 the whole base went on alert suddenly and they were told there was an unknown object coming from the north. They got a radar reading that it was at 50000-80000 feet and traveling in excess of 1,200 mph (I recall him saying 1,800 mph but my brother said 1,200 so we&#39;ll go with that). It went off the screen to the south, and everybody in the room was told to forget it even happened. He never told us or anybody else about that before, but my mom confirmed today that he told her about it the next day (he was on the overnight shift). Anybody who has or had a father who was a Korean war or WWII vet, knows what kind of men they were, he didn&#39;t tell us this story lightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: The witness indicates that the date of the event in 1954 is approximate, and we have invited him to attempt to establish a more accurate date.  We have corresponded with this witness, and he seems quite credible to us.  This is one of two sightings he may report, the other being in 1975.  PD))<n>
1/1/54 01:00|Lakeland|FL|Disk|most of the night|Unusual experience in Florida in 1954|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41192.html|3|ndxe195401| Unusual experience in Florida in 1954<n> <n><n> <n><n> At aprox 1am in 1954 I was awakened by a light shining through the window directed at me. This was 10 miles out in the country, closest neighbor half a bile. I went to the window and the light followed me where I saw a disk hovering above the ground about 20ft. It had lights around the bottom in I believe warm colors. I watched for over an hour looking for some kind of beings and did not see any. The light became more intense and that is the last thing I remember until waking on the floor by the window at daybreak. I was 14 at the time and related the story to my dad at the time and we went down to the area where I said I had seen the craft and we found the usually wet swampy ground to have become hardened like pottery in a roundish shape similar to the size of the craft. After that time I watched for the craft again and never saw anything like it but I began to feel differently and more attached to my own life (could have just been the age at the time?) Anyway I have listened to you on CtoC many times and thought of reporting but just got around to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several years later in Calif when I was returning to my apartment about midnight I saw a similar craft crusing along about 500/600 feet above but it had a short tube up to a small ball on top of it from the dish like craft, same lights beneath. At the time I was a student pilot and called the Lond Beach tower and the Lakewood sherrifs office and they had nothing. After crusing along at altitude it took off upward and outward in seconds out of sight!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

He was a radar operator at Brunswick Navy Air Station from 1954-58.  The guys that were on watch called everyone over.  They said we have been watching this for a few minutes.  And it wasn&#39;t declared so they tracked it.  It went level for quite a distance then it flew off the radar.  The radar at the time went across for a distence.  The other Doppler {The best at the time} went from up to down.  Up it maxed out at 150K. He said they watched the aircraft move across and then it went staight up and up, right off the radar.  I asked him it it could have been a missile he said they didn&#39;t have any at the time?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
