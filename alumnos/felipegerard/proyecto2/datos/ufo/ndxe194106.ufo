I awoke to a shiny glowing old looking little person standing next to my bed. It made a clinking noise and I quickly ran into my parents room and told them what happen. They said I had abad dream and I spent the rest of the night in their bed. This was 1941 we had no tv and no movies about little silver men. This encounter is still clear in my mind. The creature did not have big eyes like most depictions and I don&#39;t remember any ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

And that I think is the most amazing thing. I was a little boy about age 5 &amp; playing with ant hills in the dirt road (it was dead-end here) when I looked to the West &amp; saw coming toward me a round silver like disk about 500 to 1000 feet above Hamlin Lake. It yhen stopped &amp; reversed course and went toward Manistee, Mi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
