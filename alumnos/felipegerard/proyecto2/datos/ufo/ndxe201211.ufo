As always I looked up at the sky to look at the star;(I looked north, I google map myself to be sure which direction I was looking)  I seen a bright blue light in the sky I t was very odd and caught my eye immediately. At first I thought it was a helicopter. This is very common because I live close to a army base. As I continued to watch this blue light it did very odd things. First this blue light moved up into the sky then took a shape turn to the right very slowly, then it started to come back down to were I couldn&#39;t see it because the house in front of me blocked my view.  This light reappeared as it moved back in to my view.  Then the weirdest thing happened, the blue light begun to fade and disappear, shortly it reappeared but it was not blue anymore it was shinning red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then hovered for a few minutes and did this sequence again, the red faded tell I couldn&#39;t see it! and reappeared blue.  This was very odd so I ran inside to get my camera phone so I could film this.  Getting my camera phone was my biggest mistake it didn&#39;t take me but 30 seconds to get phone and run back outside and it gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could of got this on film and hope I was not the only one that saw this tonight.<n>

Looked into the sky to see 2 Red Dots in a diagonal form that seemed to keep the same distance apart.  Moved relatively slowly.  About 10min later vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have taken a photo but did not have a camera at the time.<n>

Over the theater came a very bright white light, it then turned orangish red. 2 more bright white oddly shaped lights appeared to the left of the first one. a couple minutes later 2 more white lights appeared- this whole time I was taking pictures of the lights with my I phone. The lights almost appeared in the shape of a Nike swoosh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before. all the lights started flying towards Neenah- although they seemed very close at first , there was no noise associated with the lights.  A couple of other girls that came into work about ten minutes after me saw them too.<n>
11/30/12 21:00|Union City|CA|Light|10 minutes|3 BEAUTIFUL ORANGE ORBS FLY PLAYFULLY IN THE DISTANCE FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE MOTHERSHIP TAKES THEM IN.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95181.html|4|ndxe201211| 3 BEAUTIFUL ORANGE ORBS FLY PLAYFULLY IN THE DISTANCE FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE MOTHERSHIP TAKES THEM IN<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had completed unpacking on the first night in our new house, I went out to the rear patio on the eastside of our home to relax and make a cell-phone call to a close friend.  As I was waiting for them to pick up my call, a group of three orange lights flying south and some distance away caught my attention.  When my friend picked up my call I told him immediately what I was seeing as I joked by saying it was probably some college kids sending off some dry-cleaner bags with candles lit up inside and then we laughed as I turned away from their appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we chatted for a few minutes, I was surprised to see the orange lights still flying about in the distance since it seemed like five or ten minutes had passed since I first noticed them.  So I focused my eyes more acutely on them again to see what I could detect about their nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I found very striking about them was the pureness of their orange color, which was stunning to see.  My friend and I also began speculating about what they could be due to their high strangeness as they flew over the south end of the Bay Area at an altitude of maybe 5k feet, though from my vantage point it was difficult to tell this for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As odd sightings in the sky go, and I sure have had my share of them in my 60 years, this was particularly curious to me because it was so obvious as the three orange orbs seemed to play whimsically together as they flew further and further into the distance before disappearing into a cloud formation and then they suddenly blinked out. I laughed as I mentioned to my friend on the phone that they must have flown inside their mother ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believing others must have also seen what I saw flying over this very large metro area, I naturally assumed there would be a number of reports on the late news to let me know what it was I had observed.  However, as I perused through a number of local news reports later I was surprised that not one thing was mentioned about the orange orbs, which was almost more shocking to me then witnessing them as I had earlier.  I guess the media has been told by SOMEBODY…DO NOT cover such mass sighting events unless you have specific proof of what it was everyone saw in order to prevent mass panic among the public at large. Pffft!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fortunately, I heard Peter D. on C2C about two weeks later and he mentioned then that there were numerous sightings of orange orbs witnessed across the US and elsewhere in the world, which also made me pause as his descriptions of them grabbed my attention, particularly the one in Castle Rock, WA, seen by an airline pilot.  Oddly, the pilots description was almost the same as what I had seen, though my sighting was at a far greater distance by order of magnitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on what I have become aware of regarding such bizarre phenomena in our strange little world, it is only my opinion today that such widespread and multiple sightings of essentially the same thing being reported (and many others unreported too) suggests that this is a conditioning procedure that will eventually allow people everywhere to become comfortable with them as an everyday, ho-hum, occurrence.  Once their presence is generally accepted as a mystery that isn’t really hurting anyone, my guess is that our first encounter with intelligent life from another world is forthcoming.  Soon.  And, I suspect the reason for this is because our civilization has become to large and complex for us to manage and it may erupt into a full-on global thermo-nuclear war that will kill everyone in its aftermath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, such a scenario of our untimely and unwelcome demise may not be acceptable to a group of aliens who have invested their time and resources into an effort to cultivate a civilization, ours’, (emulating God?  Perhaps, or acting as an agent of the Divine) that is now on the verge of joining theirs’ to one degree or another and for whatever reason they may have for such an undertaking over a twenty-six thousand year time span. After all, whom among us can say for sure where we all began?  Can you?  Or do you simply believe what others believed thousands of years ago when their interpretations of reality may have been much less precise than ours’ today and also influenced heavily by strange superstitions.  If so, I truly hope that works out for you as your closed minds and hearts implode when the truth comes out later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nuff said…<n>

Today, is the first day we got outside quick enough to see it.  This was a triangular jet-propelled air craft with two orange lights at the points in the back and one orange light in the front.  It seemed to hover for a moment and then jet off.  It was VERY close to our house.  It sounded like it was on the roof!  It appeared to be a dull silver color that blended in with the night sky.  It was flying way too low for an aircraft of this size and moved way too fast.  There was only one, and it is ALWAYS going in the same flight path.  There are NO airports in this area, especially for a jet!  My mom has seen bright lights in this same area 10 years ago, and she had never told anyone until I shared my experiences.  There is definitely some activity going on in this area!<n>

It then slowed to a stop and began to ascend at a 45 degree angle to the south.  Ran in to get a video camera, and while the camera was starting up it slowly dimmed and vanished before we could capture it on film.  It made no sound.  Helicopter seen shortly afterwards in the area.<n>

It was partly cloudy but this part of the sky was completely clear.   At first I thought it may be Mars because of how much red was in the object but then I noticed it was moving very slowly to the west.  Because of the color and slow movement it caught my attention. Next I thought it may be an airplane far off in the distance but I dismissed that quickly.  I did not think it was an airplane because it did not have any flashing warning lights on it and it was more of a solid red object with maybe a lighter whitish outline.  Also, the object seemed to be moving very slow in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not take my eye off of it because I could tell it was something I have never seen before.  I saw this object moving very slowly in the sky and it seemed to be far off in the sky (I thought it was a star or planet at first).  I saw this object moving in a straight line for about 60-90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object seemed to lose the red color and began to look more white/clear and looked to change direction and travel towards the north.  Once the object started to lose the red color and change direction the object completely disappeared into the sky within 2-3 seconds.  Once the object changed color and disappeared into the sky so quickly, I knew I saw something special/amazing/ unexplainable.  I stayed outside for another 5 minutes looking in the same direction in the sky to see if it reappeared &amp; it never did.  I took out my smart phone with the compass app and it was at about 46 degrees North in the sky.<n>

The first sight was an extremely bright light fairly low in the sky.  I was trying to determine if it could be a star or an airplane, but the light was way too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached my destination in a mile and turned into the driveway.  By that time, I could tell the light was moving closer, it was nearly overhead.  It was quiet and fairly low.  When it was overhead it appeared to be a diamond with the huge &#34;headlight&#34; on the leading corner.  The underneath had at least four lights in a square pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have some depth and appeared to have &#34;windows&#34; with lights inside.  If there was any noise it was somewhat of a whoosh, definitely not an airplane or helicopter sound.  I did not get out of my car until it had gone past.  I did not watch it very long after it went past; I just wanted to get in the house.<n>
11/30/12 18:00|Kill Devil Hills|NC|Triangle|5 minutes|Large wedge shaped UFO.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95072.html|9|ndxe201211| Large wedge shaped UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 year old man, Professional Land Surveyor, and I have a 9 year old son who was with me during the incident.  Also, with me was a 45 year old male friend who is a construction worker.  We live on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, next to where the Wright Brothers first flew.   We all basically agree with the following account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us were getting on our bicycles to ride to a cook out a few blocks away in our neighborhood.  It was 6pm November 30th, 2012 Friday night.  It had been dark for about 45 minutes.  We rode down the street a few hundred feet, heading basically north, when some red lights caught my eye through the live oak trees.  Seconds later, an aircraft emerged from behind the tree line.  It was a black or charcoal gray craft.  Estimated 200 feet long tip of the triangle to its base, 100 ft wide at its base and 15ft tall.  Flying virtually silently about 300 ft off of the ground and traveling in a seemingly straight line about 15-25 mph.   It flew very slow and quiet for a craft of this size.  I have seen Stealth Bombers and Stealth fighters, it was at least as big as the bomber, probably bigger, but not shaped the same and much more quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were rows of red lights lining the bottom of the craft on either side from the tip to the base, but not along the base of the traingle shape.  No lights went on and off like FAA planes.  All lights were red, some pulsated seemingly randomly but stayed relatively dim compared to the lights on the points of the triangle and never went out or &#34;blinked.&#34;  The lights at the points of the triangle seemed to be the brightest lights.  The craft flew almost directly over our heads, just west of us, so we had to crane our necks to look up at it because was so close.  We watched it &#34;slide&#34; slowly past us and continue in its northerly direction until we lost sight of the lights behind the trees and houses north of us.  As it passed our position, a low humming rumble noise could be heard, but it was by no means loud like a jet or propeller.  It was not a blimp.  We would have been able to see the blimp above the craft because it was so low.  Also the blimp would have had to been li! ke 1000 feet long to lift the structure we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not convinced this is not some semi-secret military operation, as we have Oceana Naval Air Station near us to the north.  However, they are obviously not concerned about people seeing the craft flying the way it flew over the fairly densely populated area here on that night last week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true account, it happened.  What we saw is real, whatever it is.  I am not a UFO enthusiast, I am a hard facts guy.   We saw what we saw, and whatever it was is a reality.<n>

No, I don&#39;t think I am losing it, but for the past years a number of women appear around me and have even spoken to me at various locations.  They are unusually strong in appearance with deep blue eyes and in some cases are driving black cars or SUV&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These entitites appear to be plainly dressed, but have an air of confidence, what i would consider military bearing.  In several cases they park near of next to my car, go into the business I have either just left or am entering, and then exit, get back into their cars and hurriedly drive away without doing any shopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only writing this to see if anyone else is having this or similar experiences.  This started a few months after I moved into this area.  It wasn&#39;t happening anywhere else I ever lived.  Somewhat disconcerting and makes me wonder if THEY are checking out people who are sensitive to anomalous aerial phenomena.  I have been seeing strange craft since September 1988, which were recorded on this website!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I now believe they walk among us and are the The Visitors others have met and written about.  I also believe they are shape-shifters just as their craft are!

The sky was clear, moonlit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the aircraft was descending approximately 60 miles east of Tucson, approximately at or below 18,000 ft. I observed several light objects in the sky. (location approximately Mount Graham near Safford AZ).  I first noticed the brightly lit object when it was joined by a second object same size and color light, I first thought it was a plane turning in the sky and was very curious because of the proximity of the second object, then one of the lights turned off and then on again and that is when I knew this was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately a third, fourth, fifth and sixth light the light appeared in the sky, not all in a straight line but somewhat aligned horizontally. I would estimate within a mile separation of each other end to end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot and engineer, I have much experience identifying aircraft at night, this was absolutely not an aircraft light or flares dropped by military planes.  In fact, the amber color objects did not appear to move and were higher than our plane, I know this because they were well above the horizon (higher in the sky) I would estimate above 20,000 ft.  The objects were not moving, but turning on and off in short duration like someone flipped a switch.  I only saw all 6 lights on at the same time once, after that it was down to 2 or 3, then only 1 on and off (5 to 15 second duration)over a period of 3 or 4 minutes.  I was able to call attention to the person sitting next to me and that person also saw the last 1 illuminate and disappear in the sky over the wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They looked  really big.  So I then pulled out onto route 112 and parallel to the road, directly above me was the HUGE chevron-shaped aircraft.  I feel as though it must’ve been flying way too low to be a plane and way too slow.  It is a full moon tonight so I could see the actual colors of the vehicle.  It was a dark variation of blacks, blues and purples, and the lights were huge like I guessed- white and blue.  They looked like large round stage spotlights like at a concert.  It was like something out of a movie or comic.  The front was the chevron -shape, but the back had three rounded points coming out of the back.  Kind of like if you flipped it upside-down it’d look like the head of  a tulip. Also a few months ago in the same area, but on route 138 I saw two L-shaped crafts flying one after the other.  They had blue and yellow lights. 4 each- al! ternating along the L. I feel crazy.  Haha.  These flew very fast and a bit higher than the giant one I saw tonight.

The area of movement was described as 12&#39;x12&#39;.  The opservation was made at a point almost directly under the spheres. The event occured in our front yard 50&#39; from the house.  The objects were still present when the wittnesses retreated to the house in fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the exact time and date as noted I recieved a cell phone call from my wife;  She described the above phenomenon.  I instructed her to terminate the call and use her cell phone camera. Two images were recorded;  One motion and one still.  During the siting my wife went into the house to get my 13 year old daughter to wittness.  My wife stated the 4 spheres followed her as she walked down our driveway.  The next day I interviewed my wife and learned the following:  The objects produced no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were brightly aluminated and nearly perfect vivid spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no beam of light or reflection of light from the ground or adjacent structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following  day at approximately 10 AM a late model SUV blue in color stopped in front of our house.  The occupant, a caucasian male approximately 60 years of age  took several pictures of the area.  The location is on a private, easement dead end dirt road.  The person did see me observing. The weather was heavy rain and wind.  None of the adjacent houses which are on 1 to 3 acre lots are for sale or in default.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The images were taken from an Apple I Phone and will be sent via my e mail address to ufocntr@nwlink.com<n>

Given the time of year, it was pitch black, but also rush hour so there were hundreds of cars passing below this craft.  The craft was hovering to the right of I-495 about 100 yards off from the side of the highway with an estimated altitude of 200 yards.  Below was a small residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An accident had been reported a few exits up so at first I assumed it was a news helicopter.  However as we got closer I noticed that the object was too large to be any helicopter that I know of, and because it was stationary, it couldn&#39;t have been an aircraft, especially that close to a major highway and residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had 5 lights; 4 white and 1 red on the underbelly. I&#39;ve seen plenty of shows about UFO&#39;s and I&#39;ve never seen anyone describe a 4 point kite shaped UFO (the short side of the triangle was slightly v-shaped, creating the 4th point).  It appeared to be about 150-200 feet in length with 3 lights at, what I can only assume, was the tail end and 1 white light at the front tip.  The lights didn&#39;t strike me as overly bright, nor did they seem to have any offensive or defensive purposes.  They were very similar to the lights you&#39;d see on the tips of aircraft wings. I don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated, internal communications professional.  I consider myself to be extremely observant and well informed.<n>

I don&#39;t know if it was a ufo because I never saw the incredibly high speed of the black dot ufo across the south to north horizon while I was on way to the West on Okeechobee Blvd and Military Trail.  I would say, the length of the flying dot across the sky was more than 2 yards (2 meters).  I wondered if the West Palm Beach Airport Tower did detect its flight or not.   I blinked several times as if I had something wrong with my eyes but the black dot (0.01 cm [1/16 inch] diameter)  still speedily flew straight.  I had thought it was a black bird flying but it was not because it was the very high attitude.  I did not see the bird&#39;s wings flapping at all.   Only the tiny black dot flew in the clear blue sky.  I could not keep my car idle when the traffic light changed to green because of the long line of cars behin! d me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it a normal black round UFO existing in other places???

I remember the time perfectly because I was cramming hard to get work done before the clock struck twelve.  I had just finished saving some documents and uploaded them to my work&#39;s server at exactly 11:57.  Then I cheered for making the deadline and immediately headed outside to smell the fresh ocean air and relieve some stress. I had just lit my cigarette when I heard a dog suddenly barking very loudly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned the boardwalk with my eyes until I located the dog, and then saw its owner was struggling hard to control the animal because it was going ballistic!  The dog was facing and barking wildly towards the sky, so naturally I looked in the same direction, and that&#39;s when I saw a green swirly motion in the darkness.  Like a ball of green fire, it rotated very fast in circles like a neon snake...then faded into complete blackness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought is was a firework, but I&#39;ve never seen fireworks take on the perfect form of an illuminated green snake.  The spiraling effect was too perfect to be a firework.  So then I thought well maybe it was a projection of a computer graphic of some sort, but where could someone project something so bright in this area?  I don&#39;t know of any projectors that could be aimed so high to create such a bold hologram-like picture...unless it was military or NASA.  And though I caught the spectacle at its tail end, I know that fireworks wouldn&#39;t be shot off now so close to winter, and so close to Boston airport.  There are tons of planes constantly landing and taking off in this area.  What I saw scared and alarmed animals.  If it was a normal flying aircraft,any dog in the area would be so conditioned to seeing and hearing them.  However, this dog was clearly threatened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the dog sensed a negative stranger and was acting protective over its owner.  So I focused my attention in the beginning to the boardwalk (in front of th! e walker, behind, around)...before looking UP.  It was such a w! eird sig ht.  My partner came outside to see what the barking was all about because apparently all the dogs in the building next us also went ballistic.  I showed him traces of the spiral circles in the sky and told him what I saw, yet the remnants had quickly evaporated like a cheap perfume.  We ruled out all &amp;quot;sane&amp;quot; possibilities.  The dogs going crazy also confirmed something was not normal.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in my life. It sort of reminded me of those chinese dragons that spin around and around.  This was similar, yet the green fire moved like a snake and looked exactly like one....almost as if it was chasing its own tail.  This goes down in my memory book forever.  I&#39;m a very educated person with no mental issues whatsoever.  I&#39;m not going to look at a grape and try to convince you it is an orange.  I am only telling you what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was as least as bright as the almost full moon.  It was so bright it lit the ground up and I could see the shadows of the trees move as it moved over our house.  It only last a second or two almost like a shooting star but it was much much larger and brighter.  I thought maybe it was a meteor but I never saw or heard it impact the ground.<n>

Never seeing a UFO before this is a first for me.  I went outside last night at 11:30pm.  The moon was very bright and as I looked up to see it I noticed something very large off to the N.W. of the moon.  Approximately about 1 oclock.  It was circuliar in shape with a yellowish glow around it.  Their were lights on the outside of the glow all around the object.  Blueish in color to me.  Wondering what in the world was I looking at I thought perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I watched and it appeared to be slowly drifting away from the moon but hovering.  The outside lights seemed to be flickering.  I was wondering if it was a space shuttle or satelite.  As I watched it I noticed the outside lights seemed to be moving and changing the shape of the object and it appeared to be getting trianglular in shape when I noticed something shot away from the body of the object.  Then the lights slowly went back into a circu! lar shape around the object.  I went inside woke up my significent other to show her to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things. She thought perhaps it may have been a planet with the sun shinning on the backside of it giving it a glowing appearance.  I was so convinced I was looking at an object in the sky that I called 911 and reported it.  911 transfered me to the Sherriffs department here in Lane County and I reported to them what I was witnessing as we spoke!  I was still watching the object.  By this time it had drifted a bit further away from the moon and down around 5 oclock.  The Sherriffs office said they would document the report.  After hanging up and still watching the object I went in and grabbed my Kodak with a 12 power zoom lens. I was careful to keep the moon out of the picture because of the brightness and began to shoot a few pictures.  The object was so high in the sky that on the photos it just appears as a very bright light.  I watched the object change shape! very slowly but always returning back to the circuliar object! .  After 30 minutes of watching the object I returned to my house.  I could&#39;nt help but believe that maybe it was a planet with the sun shinning on the back side of it making it appear to glow BUT that didn&#39;t explain the lights around the outside of the glowing and moving on the left side with what appeared to be another object leaving from within the body of the object then the lights going back around the circuliar object.  As I stated I&#39;ve never seen a UFO in the past however this was something significent and I didn&#39;t imigine what I saw.  I hope I explained what I witnessed in enough detail for you to understand, and I did report it to the Sherriffs office who claims they would document the incident.  I am curious if anyone else has reported this sighting.  If so please contact me.  I also would like to know if anyone has seen an object that has done such a movement as I witnessed.  At times it did seem to get larger in size and I remember thinking to myself is this thing moving! lower causing it to get larger in size?  I wish I could describe more detail for you but honestly don&#39;t know what I saw.  I am convinced that it was some sort of a craft though and not a star.  What-I&#39;m not sure.<n>

It was snowing and the cloud cover was low.  They were not in the clouds but under the clouds. I got very nervous because a group of us was outside at the same time last year and saw 9 similar objects flying across the sky.  The objects moved very slowly and seemed to dim then get brighter, then dim again.  As they passed the neighbor&#39;s house, 1 of the lights disappeared. the other kept moving very slowly.  There was no sound coming from the orbs.  An airplane crossed over about 5 minutes after the occurrence which gave off a sound.  As I was watching, i grabbed my iphone and took a few pictures.  There was some weird effects on a couple of pictures that I can only attribute to the snow falling.  At least 3 of the pictures clearly show the objects.  The objects were heading 313 degrees NW according to my iphone compass.<n>

I go to the back door and look and I see a bright Orange light like planet Mars in color, but brighter, I thought at first it looked like a satellite but moving much slower than one,   Also I notice there was a hazy sky and the object appeared lower than the hazy clouds. And there was a full moon.  I call my wife and say check out this light in the sky, she looks out and says what the hell is that, I don&#39;t know I grab my binoculars, I have two pairs my good pair is 25x100 I use for astronomy.  Even in the binocs I cant see any detail, just a Orange light, no flashing lights, no outline of a typical aircraft at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too think it passed directly overhead of my home, with the engine noise I know it wasn&#39;t a satellite and with no flashing lights it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter.  We live on a hill and watched it for almost ten minutes, slow moving, steady heading south in a straight line, then when it was a good two miles away it turned red my wife yelled to me did you see it just change color I said yes,. I can&#39;t believe we are watching this thing. We watched it for about 10 min before it disappeard off the horizon. We can see about 6 miles with our hilltop view.  I thought maybe its a drone of some kind so the next day I reported it to the police and they said they have no drones in the county so they tell me to report it to the FAA. I called and they say they don&#39;t know of any drones operating in Missouri at all. I don&#39;t know if they are telling the truth or not. All we know it wasn&#39;t any normal aircraft we have ever seen.<n>

We are in our late 30s (me) and mid 40&#39;s (him) and have 2 children (both were sleeping).  After what we saw last night, I have to tell someone.   We were sitting outside in our yard.  My husband was facing me, so his back was to the outside and I was sitting so that all I could see was him and our yard.   All of the sudden a large glowing ball rose up from the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have had a shocked look on my face because my husband asked me what was wrong, and I told him to turn around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was big, it looked close (but not too close to be scary), and it was an organish - yellow color.  It looked as if it was glowing. It also looked like it was being propelled by a flame.  The oddest thing is that it made NO NOISE - that&#39;s what actually got my husband spooked, he kept saying over and over that something that big and close would have to make some type of noise.  It continued to rise, slowly, from the south and as it rose in the sky, it did get smaller.  It was a cloudy night and both my husband and I were shocked we could see it as clearly as we could.  It started to head north, and it disappeared into the sky the higher it got.  It moved pretty slowly the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did video it on our iPhone, but it&#39;s not good footage, nothing that could be used.  All you see is a small dot and you hear my husband and I discussing how strange it looks and that it makes no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m so curious to know if anyone else saw it.  We leave near a major freeway, in a pretty populated city - someone else must have seen this!<n>

We were facing east when we saw a large, bright, orange light.  The light was stationary and did not change size, shape, or color.  There was no sound associated with its presence.  The coloration was similar to that of a street lamp but more intense.  The light was bright enough that it emitted rays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was overcast so we were able to tell that the object was under the clouds. There was a full moon so the sky was illuminated, but we were not able to see an object that could be emitting the light.  In relation to the moon the object was far down and to the left.  If the moon were the center of a clock face the object would have been located at the &#34;7:30&#34; position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was located approximately halfway between the moon and the tree line. The object was stationary for a long enough period of time for us to notice it, stare it at it, discuss its oddity, and photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one minute the light vanished leaving no trace of its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a nineteen year-old female with one year of college completed at the University of West Georgia.

My girlfriend and I were on the way to purchase a few tickets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled into the local gas station parking lot and through the sun roof a brilliant light was shining, almost floating in our direction. We both saw it and I commented to how it was flying very low.  It was not a plane as we saw planes, indicated by blinking lights, flying in the back ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After parking, instead of rushing to buy lotto tickets, I was curious and wanted to see if I could hear the motor flying the mysteriously bright light.  I  could hear nothing, and I&#39;ve been known to have keen ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were just looking at it when I noticed Venus next to the moon.  I know it was Venus because i used a star map app to find out.  As I focused on Venus, with the app, my girlfriend looked away from the shining object. An instant later the brilliant shining light was gone.  I wanted to put the object in the app but no suck luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were also out of luck when it came to winning the lottery.  Maybe next time we&#39;ll get a video and the money.<n>

I went out to stop her from barking when I noticed a cloud bank in the western sky that was bright.  I went to the front yard to see what was making it bright.  I observed a cloud bank very thick and motion less.  Jt was like a cloud bank we get when a thunderstorm develops only there was no lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into the house and checked several weather radar sights of this area.  None of them showed any cloud banks, they were all clear - nothing!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finding this quite odd due to thickness Iwent back out to look at this bank of clouds.  Again, to my astonishment this bank of clouds completely dissapaited except for a few small straglers.<n>

11/27/12 20:10|Port Jervis|NY|Triangle|3 minutes|Two glowing red/orange triangular objects.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94864.html|59|ndxe201211| Two glowing red/orange triangular objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving (North/West) on Pike Street.  Light traffic.  Well lit – businesses and street lamps.  Weather was cold and cloudy but there was a clearing in the night sky – by the time I arrived home (appx. 7 mins. After sighting, it had clouded up again).  I saw two objects very high in the sky.  What caught my eye was the brightness and the color.  I pulled over to get a better look through my moon roof.  What I saw was inexplicable in terms of anything else I’ve ever seen in the sky.   Both objects appeared identical although one was either much smaller of much higher up – appearing less than half the size of the other.  They were pretty much dead overhead and I had to crane my neck to watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer (larger) was the one I got a pretty good look at.  It appeared to be triangular in shape with softened – almost blurry, slightly rounded edges.  The objects stayed lit the entire time I watched and there was no blinking at all.  There seemed to be a little bit of variation, however, much like a candle flame if it could be encapsulated into a triangle shape.  It appeared to be lit from within with no individual light sources that I could see.  Actually very pretty – glowing red with a lighter orangey-red/yellow on the edges.  The objects seemed to be about 70% red with the lighter color at 30% divided between the three sides.  In addition, there seemed to be an oblong shape that bisected the triangle lengthwise.  It appeared to be lighter in color – similar to, but a little lighter than the orangey-red yellow of the edges.  This gave me the impression of being somehow more substantial than the rest of the object.  This was not visible on the smaller (further away! ?) object likely because of the lack of detail at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of size, I had the impression that these were large objects seen at a great distance rather than small objects seen closer.  If I were to hold a dime up at arms length, the larger object would have approximated the size of the dime.  If anything, somewhat smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the objects, they were perfectly still.  Just “hanging” there.  At some point, the larger object began a trajectory in the South/Southwest direction at a very slow speed.  This prompted me to move my car because it had moved to a point behind a tree.  While driving to the corner, I frantically looked around to see if there were any other witnesses but I didn’t see any pedestrians and traffic was moving normally.  It was at this point, I looked again and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound that I could discern – just normal traffic noises.   At first, I thought this might be an airplane on fire but the entire plane would have had to be engulfed and it would have had to remain stationary in the air while it burned.  This while an identical airplane also burned at a higher altitude.  So, I don’t think it was that!  Also, flames would have motion associated to them and this just glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But at around 1930 on tuesday night I pulled up to an intersection and witnessed a what appeared to be a plane flying very low, by the way it was a rainy night with very low cloud cover, it was a triangular shaped object with a white light on the back end and a dim greenish blue light in the middle.  When I saw it I figured that it was a plane on approach but as I watched it seemed flying too fast for a safe landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the green light I thought it was a landing light and I waited for a blinking strobe which is a requirement for all airplanes but witnessed none.  I brought it to the attention of my grandmother in the passenger seat and as the time she looked up and saw it accelerated hard right and went behind a house.  I stepped on the pedal to get to the top of a hill and see it again but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very used to seeing low flying planes and helis but this was unlike I have ever seen.<n>

I was driving in the dark around curves and as I leaned forward to sneeze I looked up and through the wind shield I saw sparkling fire projectile out of a craft almost like it was making fun of my sneezing motion or like &#34;vomiting&#34; sparks in the sky.  I thought it may be fireworks of some kind, but didn&#39;t see a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued down the road a few miles when I saw it off this time to the right up in the sky but this time there were two objects in the sky. they were like pinwheels in the sky. flying off sparks and spinning. this time was 18:45 and I pulled over to try to get pictures I wasn&#39;t parked very well and was concerned so I didn&#39;t stay very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I struggled with my cell phone, but as soon as I got it out to record the craft disappeared.  It was a golden color.  Disappointed I got back in my vehicle with my son, and we continued on our way. I noted the name of a creek on the highway called field creek.  We didn&#39;t see the craft again until we reached Thayer Missouri, where I noticed the off to the right side of town again.  Myself and My son pulled over to the side of the road and watched as the fireballs/crafts danced around each other like a yin/yang then once again when I got my phone out to record they disappeared.  My son noticed that their were very small dots in the sky which blinked on and off, remained perfectly aligned vertically and moved quickly from one side of the sky to the other blinking on and off much like pac-man dots.  They avoided going directly over the town but instead made sure to go over rural areas.  That last time we saw them was at 19:11.  I finally got around to doing this report as it was very bu! sy during the holidays and things have calmed down.<n>

I hurried out, looking to the East/ slightly South with two grandchildren, aged 10 and 9.  We all saw three red lights in a line at first.  I would guess that the object was quarter of a mile at most away and very low to the treeline far past our neighbor&#39;s rooftop.  We have standard, rambler style homes, and this &#39;craft&#39;, at that distance, was at least half the length of their house.  It appeared to be moving about 45 degrees off the horizon (Can&#39;t see the horizon due to trees in the area, so this is a guess) and coasted smooth and silent, no jerky movements. Also, there were shimmerings of red lights that would appear along the &#39;edge&#39; that faced me, though these were hard to see. The lights pulsed repeatedly, but they looked nothing like anti-collison lights on the aircaft we have seen thousands of times in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or two, the lights took on a triangular shape that was huge. It seemed to pivot, and turn while slowly lifting the front edge as if it was a single large craft, or if it were several flying in unison, the back ones lifted up.  At any rate, the entire group of lights slipped to the South East and apparently down into the Auburn Valley area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to record the sighting, but since it was dark, the video from my cellphone doesn&#39;t show much. In between the very excited yelling of myself and the elder grandchild, there is a noticable silence.  Any aircraft that we have seen would have shaken the house at such a low altitude and proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a report on the MUFON site that almost exactly mirrors ours, case # 44199 from Kent that happened two hous after ours and to the North and East of us.  My son submitted his report last night after we saw it, and the MUFON site had not yet been contacted by the people in Kent that also saw it. It helps to know someone else witnessed this interesting sighting.<n>

Ten minutes later I decided to go back outside to see if I could see anymore lights.  I looked in the same area to the West and once again, the lights appeared but this time the first light appeared in the South then four more appeared to the right in an upward stair-step pattern; each light would fade as another appeared.  This second sighting lasted maybe 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on that night, my wife and I drove West about 3 miles to see if we could see anymore activity but we didn’t see any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This isn’t the first time we’ve seen these orange lights.

It had continued that way for the duration of our sighting, and was moving much slower than a commercial plane.  At first I thought it was simply a plane, but multiple things stuck out to me about it.  There were three dark red lights, with gaps in between to make the entire thing too wide to be a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Length-wise the entire craft appeared to be as long as my hand, about a half mile away.  The lights were all moving in the same direction, same angle. From my perspective though they didn&#39;t shift at first. I had gotten a few other people and when they came out the lights had formed a triangle,  What really concerned me was how reflective it appeared to be. The lights had appeared to reflect across the entire length of it.  The lights shimmered and gleamed across like oil on plastic, or something similar to a camouflage pattern.<n>

It was completely and absolutely stationary.  It was stationary for about five seconds and then suddenly, it flew due west at an extremely high rate of speed.

It was so different where I remember thinking, &#34;What in the hell is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It floated or hovered, moving slowly. It looked like it was coming toward me, kind of floating amongst the trees. I could not tell if it was high in the sky, or actually between the trees. There was no sound.  It had me totally mesmerized, where I could not take my eyes off it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the uncanny feeling that it was looking at me, coming toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it headed westward and faded out of sight.

The sun had just set when we saw the first ball of light. We saw 7 total ufos total but not all at once. They stayed in one place and kind of looked like stars. The first one we saw headed south west increasing in speed but then dimmed away.  The second came from the east heading west, it started off as what looked like a star but then started moving but not very fast, as it was moving another one came from the west crossed paths with the 2nd one and then blinked 2 times then split into 2 balls of light and kept going.  The 4th one we saw looked like a star but then got really bright.  Then it started moving down ward towards earth getting brighter.  It had whisker like light coming off the sides, the way something fall to earth would look but it then dimand Down and merged with a star andnever moved.  The whole time there was alot of holiday traffic in the sky which helped us ! know with out a doubt. The what we saw were not planes!  About ten min.  Past since we saw the 4th one when the 5th one appeared.  This one was directly over head I looked like it split from something and then flew south. Then the craziest one came the 6th one.  As if came in from the south going north it would blink but not in a pattern just randomly but when it did blink other stars would blink as it would go past. The 7th came from the north and headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Off in the distance, to the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw an *extremely* brilliant seemingly stationary object in the sky.  Distance unknown.  It was white, incredibly bright, and pulsed or twinkled...not unlike a bright light through a lens, or a distant twinkling star...except this thing was huge compared to what a star or planet looks like, and many magnitudes brighter...and it was still mostly daylight out.  I cannot emphasize enough the brightness of this object.  It was akin to Venus at its brightest on a clear night in the country, only it appeared so much larger than Venus ever does.  Without being able to gauge the distance, I have no idea as to its actual size.  It could have been anywhere from a mile away to several dozen miles away, but from my point of view it was about half the size of a dime held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the spot I always use to turn around, so I can park facing north, I stopped and watched the object for maybe 2 more minutes.  At no time, did it move or change intensity.  Even though it seemed way too bright, I kind of expected it to just be an airplane coming up over the horizon, directly at me, and that after a few moments the perspective would change and the light would look different.  I then realized I was sitting parked in the middle of the road, so I proceeded to turn around as usual, all the while keeping an eye on the object either directly or through a mirror.  When parked, now facing north, I continued to watch the still stationary object in my driver’s side mirror for up to another 30 seconds or so.  I then got out to take a better look, and in the time it takes me to open my door, the object apparently had vanished.  I did not directly witness it vanish, but I had only taken my eye off of it for a split second.  If it had been an airplane, comin! g up over the horizon, making it appear stationary, then I still would have been able to see the plane itself after the perspective of the light changed.  But there was nothing in the sky there.  Nothing coming or going...left or right, away or towards.  I also did not hear any airplanes or helicopters.  I continued to watch that spot and surrounding areas for several more minutes and did not see anything at all in the sky, anomalous objects or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a gentleman waiting at a bus stop about 50+ feet away.  We noticed each other looking southward, but being shy I did not go over and speak with him.

I saw a light in the sky to the north that looked like a star, but it was much too low in the sky to be one.  It was not moving, so I knew it couldn&#39;t be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the light grew larger and larger; the color was yellow/orange. It sparkled like a star but was equivalent in size to hundreds of stars put together.  It was the brightness of an explosion or firework, but there were no offshoots of light that fell downwards.  The light remained at its maximum size for approximately 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In its place was a dark rounded shape that began to move.  It was difficult to make out the exact shape against the dark night sky.  There were no lights on the top, sides or rear of the shape - only a multitude of small lights on the front of white, yellow and orange that alternated in a random pattern as the shape proceeded forward and down in a vertical east to west direction.  The speed of the object was about twice the speed of a descending airplane and it quickly disappeared behind a distant skyscraper.<n>

Diffirence was there was no sound and it was gone in a split second all i saw was the trail from the heat that is created at high altitudes.

On saturday night(11/24) we were back in our unit at the resort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been out on the balcony shooting some video of the beach and enjoyimg the cold evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At appro. 22:00 hrs., I was getting cold and my video recorder was out of battery.  I proceeded to go in our room.I opened the door and backed my wheelchair into the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I was in the room still sitting in my wheelchair with the balcony door open I had turned my head to the side talking to my friend.  When I turned my head back to look out to the balcony,thats when I seen one reddish/orange colored sphere.My first thought was someone is shooting fireworks.  I quickly decided,no sparks, no hissing,not fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be traveling west to east, moving at a steady speed.  Looked like it had one red light in the center of it and a halow or glow from the center light surrounding it.  It appeared not to be real far from the coastline.(appr.100yds.)  I would say the height could not have been no more than (75-100 ft.) for the fact I was backed up in the room (3rd. floor)ten feet or so from the balcony,still in my chair.  There was no sound what so ever that I could hear coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hollowed to my friend to get the camcorder and come look at this.  I grabbed the camcorder hit the power on and it done nothing.Figuring the battery was gone, grabbed my cell phone, Took a quick picture while hitting the power button again on the camcorder.  I seen the camcorder powering up, so I quickly closed my cell (forgetting to save the picture) trying to get some video as I seen the glow was fading as it looked to be going out in the gulf.End result, no picture, no video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know for sure if it made a rt.turn while moving from west to east to head out in the gulf,or maybe it traveled more from northwest to southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like this before.  I estimate from first sighting, to watching it fade away, as it headed out sea, was (30-45) seconds.<n>

While driving over the bridge that crosses over 384 on route 85/Bolton center road, we noticed a white, glowing penny sized orb to our left, which would have probably placed it nearly above the highway.  This object hovered and made no noise that we know of.  We noticed it only because it was in our line of sight, and seemed too big to be a star - though otherwise this is what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After crossing the bridge, curiosity made two of us look back, at which point the orb seemed to shrink to nearly a pinpoint, which we realized meant that it had ascended upwards.  No sooner had I (the driver and writer of this report) turned my head forward again to watch the road, a second object was observed by all of us directly ahead/in front of us, no more than a mile away.  This object was also a glowing white orb, but basketball sized. It descended below the treeline pretty much on route 85 itself!  We drove along route 85 to see if we could find it, but to no avail.  I would be VERY interested if anyone knows of any military operations going on in this area on this date.  If not, then I cannot explain what we saw. NOTE: Airplanes do frequently fly to bradley airport in the area we saw these orbs, and we saw such a one at this very time.  The orbs were clearly different than the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the four observers, one is a licensed funeral director/embalmer with 2 degrees:  one in applied science, and one in liberal arts.  The other three are all high school graduates.  One is a case manager at a homeless shelter.  One is a teacher&#39;s aid working on a degree in education.  The last is unemployed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the four have vision problems or any sort of hallucination-causing mental illness, nor were any of the four on drugs.<n>

I left my phone in my car so I went back outside to get it.  Not sure why I looked up but when I did.  I saw this object with  lights  hovering in place and then going far into the distance.  I stared at it for awhile as it continued to go into the distance.  I then called  a friend of mine to come ouside that lives with me to see if she could see the same as what I was seeing and she did.  As we were looking at the 1st one.  Another came from the left side and then directly in front of us and hovered again as the other did and continued in the distance with the same lights.  The lights were red, white and green and it appeared to have a long shape from left to right or thats how it appeared.  It was dark already so all I saw was the shape of the lights in a line.  The lights were in a line but from right to left like maybe 5 or 6 lights that faced us. We stared for awhile to make sure it was not a helicopter or plane and it was! not.  The objects appeared between my house and a neighbors house.  No other objects or lights in sight except for the 2 objects we saw.  The objects did not make any noises. Nor did they dart or zip away.  No wobbling. Just flew the same as a plane or helicopter would but was not either one.  What made it different was that they it hovered in place and moved slowly like they wanted us to see them.  I heard no plane sounds nor the sound of the helicopter wings when a helicopter is staying in place.  Nothing could be heard.  This was my sighting.Not sure what it was but it was  no plane or helicpter or jet I have ever seen.  I live close by to Ellington Airforce base and Hobby airport and I am use to seeing planes,jets and helicopters that is not what it was that night.  I went in as the last one was going into the distance.  Went inside to call another witness to come outside withing sec or a min.  When we came out it was gone.<n>

Not sure if the first one I saw was the first in the series.  This continued for about 20 min, 1 after another rising, at some instances 2 or 3 rising at once.  The first one 1 saw I believed to be Betelguese as the color was extremely similar although they seemed much brighter. Even brighter than the star would be on a crystal clear day.  Perhaps as bright as Jupiter would appear as they came from behind the mountains.  They were moving in an imperfect arc from the mountains south-east of the Salt Lake Valley turning west then possibly either toward south or upwards in altitude.  They also caught the attention of at least 5 of my neighbors so I am sure there are many other reports to be heard and seen throughout the southeast valley and hopefully pictures and video.  They were moving about the speed of regular aircraft and even passed at least 2 actual airplanes (as noted by the normal light colors of aircraft).  As they reached about perfectly south of my current location they gradually seemed to fade away from either light direction or distance.  I was able to point out other high flying airplanes at the time.  They seem to be very similar to the orange orbs seen in the June-July series of orange orbs worldwide.  However they are questionable because of the near-airplane speed they seemed to maintain, with the exception of one orb that stopped after raising from behind the mountain as 2 other passed it before it continued on its was.  The distance between the orbs was fairly equal but did vary as just noted, and the arc of the flight path was slightly varied between each orb.<n>

But I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the redwoods like I usually do.  I was spacing out while my dog roamed around sniffing.  I noticed a weird whistle? Which at 2 AM in the woods where I live is very unusual.  So I tensed and was getting to call my dog back in fear that there was some crazy person (we&#39;ve had drifters show up on the property before) lurking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that it sounded like a whistle mixed in with some kind of radio station.  I know this is weird but I thought it sounded like rock music and a human whistle combined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then just looked up.  I don&#39;t know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And there was a plane. Not that unusual and I was about to look away to go inside away from the sound. But then the sound stopped.  And the plane started moving weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going in a circle.  And so I thought it might be a helicopter as they&#39;ve been known to make runs looking for illegal weed farms up here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it wasn&#39;t.  And I don&#39;t know how to describe the pattern of flight, but it was not a helicopter. It went sort of wobbly.  Then to the side.  Then to the other side. Making a sort of exaggerated oval pattern.  But it was still moving forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is going to sound insane, but I feel like it noticed me watching it because it stopped its weird flying and just hovered for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a second smaller one off in the distance- also flying towards my general direction.  And a sense of fear hit me that I have never felt before.  I have been attacked on the subway, and I didn&#39;t feel fear as strongly as this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I screamed for the dog and ran inside.  I woke my husband and he went outside to smoke a cigarette. I followed him out there and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After he made fun of me I decided to type this while this was fresh in my mind and submit it to whatever sites for logging this sort of thing I could find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it is did not seem friendly, or I was too scared and that shut down my thinking.  But, and this is the simplest way I can put it so I will just repeat it: it did not seem friendly.<n>

We could see Equinox mountain not far in the distance and lights on the mountain (houses).  A bright orange light appeared about halfway down the mountain and slowly rose up.  It continued up over the horizon and then went to the right and faded.  Sometimes the speed was slow and hard to distinguish from the houses, other times it was very noticeable. I saw 1 or 2 more lights shortly after.  The next night we went to one of the best views in town and could see the whole mountain.  Again, we saw the lights.  We returned to this view the following night and saw 2 of the lights, moving noticeably faster.  Had to leave town the next day to return to college.

After feeding her I walked over to her water trough to clean out the debris.  I’m hearing a lot of birds chirping overhead so I look up and notice a very long fairly thick flock of birds flying from the NE to west, south. Very big long line, I keep looking straight up to see what kind of birds they were. Looked like a couple different small species.  I kept watching for what seemed like around 10 minutes.  The end of the flock was flying further to the north curving south.  That is when I saw the craft. Much larger than the birds, it was cylindrical, about 3 times larger around and a little bit longer than a large jet at a similar altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that there was a lack of a wing profile, that’s when it got more of my attention. It was moving slightly faster than a large jet at a similar altitude.  I noticed a lack of any contrail, no signs of exhaust or smoke and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started to shimmer, (the sh! immer seemed to be divided down the center by a dark equal sized line), under the whole vehicle sort of like a sun reflection but most definitely a glowing shimmering red, orange light. Then I heard a deep quick thud, almost a pop, and it was gone. The impression I got was that it cloaked. The last part was like watching special effects in a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t see any clouds and I had an unobstructed view.<n>

They seem more prevalent than in years past but have been chalking it up to personal exposure to more open skies as summertime was spent kayaking several CT lakes/rivers and new commute toWindsor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Friday afternoon around 3:30 pm,  traveling E on DayHill Road to stop for coffee, viewed 5 plane trails and 2 active planes in the clear blue sky.  As I stopped at a red light, I observed one plane traveling nearly vertical on the left side of the moon.  The 2nd active plane trailing captured my eye as it was so high and juxtaposed to the daytime-visible moon; it actually trailed directly in front of the moon.  The former photographer in me longed for an SLR camera to capture it.  As I watched it traveling left to right over the moon,  to it’s right was a white spot in the sky that made me look longer.  The spot seemed to just hang in the air, like a hot air balloon but no possible hot air balloon would (could) be so high.  It did not appear to be traveling like a plane would through the sky, but just hanging there.  And as quickly as I noticed it, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up at the sky and noticed that it was very clear and there were a lot of stars.  I was in the driveway facing the east, looking up at the area of the sky not too far above the horizon.  My eyes scanned over two bright stars and I noticed 4 small white lights-like a dim cluster- between the stars.  I scanned over it quickly and in the split seconds after my eyes passed over the 4 small lights it registered in my mind that the cluster appeared to be moving and that it must be a plane since I was looking towards New York City and there was always air traffic above Warwick(I don&#39;t live there, I was visiting there).  Those thoughts took place in about 1 or 2 seconds as I returned my focus to the 4 lights.  The lights were moving in unison as part of a single object. Initially they appeared to be a square but they rotated slightly as they moved over my head across the sky so as to look more like a diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment I focused my eyes on the lights they moved quickly, ‘out’ from between the two bright stars-headed west, directly over my head at such an astonishing speed and in a way that reminded me of a water bug sliding/skimming across water.  The 4 lights increased their speed as they sped up across the sky and moved mostly in a straight line but ‘slid’ a bit off the straight line course so there were slight curves in its course and that is what made me think of a water bug.  As it moved it dawned on me that no aircraft I know of could accelerate with such speed and at the point I was thinking that, it accelerated more and simply disappeared-blip, gone!  That entire sighting lasted no more than 10 or 15 seconds from the point when I looked up, noticed the moving lights and then watched them zip over my head and vanish.  My eyes were trained on them the whole time they moved and my head followed them easily as they went overhead.  The lights moved in unison and fluidly, like it was sliding rather than flying.  I also had the sense that the thing ‘reacted’ to me seeing it, like it had been &#39;spotted,&#34; largely because it happened so fast and it zipped away the moment that I focused my eyes on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so fast and I stood out there for a few minutes considering what just happened and wondering if my eyes had played a trick on me. I focused on other objects to see if anything atmospheric (cold night air on my eyeballs making them water?) might make them ‘appear’ to move.  It did not happen with any other object. I looked around for other moving objects and I saw a jet and noticed that its lights were not at all like what I had seen.  I went inside and told my family and then went on-line to investigate what the stars were where I first noticed the object.  They were two bright stars that make up the center portion of Orion.<n>

It seemed unusual because it was low and behind a tree (but very visible) on the next property. It appeared as horizontal shape (with a slight arc or curve) which led me to believe that it was disk shaped. It appeared too large or wide and too low, making it so unusual.  There were lights and they did appear to flash, but there was no sound, which I found weird because it seems so close.  This object appeared to hover, while the lights flashed, then just seemed to disappear from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitate to say this for some reason, but in 1976 in Tucson, AZ., I also observed an object, at fairly close range and it just occurred to me that the lights and the shape were/ are exactly the same for both.

We got in the car and headed to the other side of town for a better view but by the time we got across town we saw nothing.  There was no sound but these lights were quite far away.<n>

I was able to partially capture part of the sighting on my camera phone. However, the quality isn&#39;t that great due to the fact it was night time, but I have it nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cool night. No clouds whatsoever were in the sky; no fog, haze or other atmospheric conditions. The time was approximately 2100 hrs., and total duration of the sighting lasted around five to seven minutes. It was traveling from the north-northeast to south-southwest direction.  The object itself was a bright orange fireball-like “sphere.”   I first noticed the object as we were pulling into the driveway of our house. There was only one object and it was completely silent.  Elevation of the object was hard to determine but it was VERY low.  If I had to hazard a guess I would estimate it to only be several hundred feet in the air. It glided at a consistent speed neither speeding up or slowing down on its course. There was a smooth, constant, almost coasting type of quality to its speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was anxious to report it to someone, but I had no idea who.  I was listening to Coast to Coast tonight (12/08/12) and one of the news segment guests mentioned ufocenter.com and how there have been a lot of these same sightings of “fireballs” last month.  I jumped on the computer and visited your site and composed this report now.  I&#39;m just glad to finally have some place to report what I saw.  I also checked out some previous reports and noticed another sighting here in Winter Haven describing a fireball as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me personally if you need more info or have any other questions, as I will more than happy to answer them.<n>

Other were lined up in a straight line, then there was these small ones  that were red lined up in a v.   We did not see just two this was a large amount of them huddled together.  There is no possible way these were planes, too bright, too fast, to huddled together also the shap of them was too round, some would even move fast then stand still.  Stars also would not do this. So what it is then?   We saw lights, some fast moving bright lights and formation.  I have never witness anything like this in my life, have lived here for 9+ years know the usual plane sightings whats normal.  That wasn&#39;t, my daughter was the one who orginally grabbed me with her telescope told me something is not right I need to look at this.<n>

It was a cloudy night, and I could see the difference of density as the light moved through them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the thin sections, the light didn&#39;t seem to emit any glare. It was as if I was looking into a source of light, rather than the having the light shine outward.  The movement was fluid and sporadic, unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds of unearthly flight, it came to a hover.  I witnessed the light dim until it was barely in sight, then return to its original brilliance. It did this three or four more times, and then vanished. The event matched many encounters I&#39;ve read about prior to witnessing one with my own eyes. Truly amazing.<n>

I live on the north side of Lakeland, Fl near I-4 and those object were floating in the sky from direction of Orlando towards Tampa, following the path of the interstate I-4.  They were following one another in a line, some went across the whole sky, some disappeared/faded away.  They were maybe twice the size of the stars in the sky, but had an orange warm glow, unlike the bright silver yellow star lighte.  There was no noise, they moved quite fast across the sky, but apperead to be floating or gliding at the same time.   We saw 8-10 of them.  My 4 year old son called them &amp;quot;orange moving stars&amp;quot;, pretty good description actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. There is MacDill AFB in Tampa, and those were floating exactly in that direction(checked it later  with my smart phone compass).  However, those did not look like and airplane or helicopter or a blimp.<n>

But, it was not falling; it was sloooowly gliding – far too slowly and far too large to even be a plane. There also were not any blinking lights, as a plane would have at night; it was just one huge, solid red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off to the side of the road to watch it, still trying to figure out what I was observing. I was in an area where there is no cell phone service, so I could not call anyone. I decided to turn around and find someone else to see it. I pulled down a road and could still see the bright red light. And, then, it just vanished. I thought maybe it had disappeared into the clouds but would reemerge but, instead, it just disappeared instantly and I did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this the government up to something?

Bigger than any star or planet, it moved slowly from south to north for about 1 min., paused, and changed direction heading east.  At this point all rays disappeared, and it dissipated and slowly disappeared.<n>

He yelled for us to look up into the sky at these strange lights.  My family and i went to the front of my house and looked up where we saw 3 bright orb like orange lights high in the sky.  They were very bright, 5-10x&#39;s brighter then all the surrounding stars At first they were all hovering in the same spot and did not move for about a minute.  They were not making any noise whatsoever and we all hushed up to listen to see if we could hear engines.  It was an absolutely clear night not a cloud in the sky. 1 of the 3 lights started to slowly rise up and continued to do so for about 15-20 seconds until it go so high up it started to flicker then vanish.  This object seemed to go straight up into the atmosphere right into space itself.  As soon as the first had vanished the Second light started to rise and did the exact same thing, becoming extremely high up and flickered then vanished.  The third light rose as the second vanished and just like the first two, flickered and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 8 of us Talked the rest of the night about the possibility&#39;s of what we all had just witnessed.  We came to the conclusion that it was NOT meteors, planes, helicopters, Chines lanterns or any other form of air craft we have ever seen. No one could come up with a reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness&#39;s included- Me my Parents, Grand parents, Aunt and Uncle, and little Brother.<n>

I looked outside to see if all the power on the street was out and it was.  I looked up into the sky and saw over Jakes Lane three red and gold orbs (about the size of my pinky finger if I held it up).  I thought maybe they were fireworks as the light was so vivid.  Each orb had red and gold and the gold seemed to be swirling back into the red; the light of the orbs seemed &#39;heavy&#39; or &#39;thick&#39; and was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three orbs stayed in a triangle formation as they moved over N Shelmore Blvd.  There was no sound being made by them and there was a plane in the sky flying the other way.  I don&#39;t know if it was one craft that was triangular or three separate craft that stayed in formation.  I was able to call my husband back and eventually reached him.  While on the phone, I ran into the road and took a picture.  The craft seemed to slow and stop near the Square in I&#39;on and then moved on.  Then the power came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call the power company and they said a circuit breaker flipped and that caused the outage.<n>

I exited my car and my friend stayed in.  Immediatley I pulled my phone for video.  The first orb was fading in the distance by then.  A second orb rose over the trees and asccended over the ridge.  And as it fadded, another apearred due east of us and lifted from the base of the mountain, ascending about 5000 feet as it cleared the sw ridge of Lone peak and took off SE towards Heaber or Mt Timpanogoos.  The pattern repeated, one took off out of sight, another would start up from the mtn base.  the last one was red and appeared before its predacessor took off out of sight.  About 50 cars passed us, one pulled over to watch and question us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was very calm,  95% clarity, less than .25 mph from north and cooling rapidly.  Objects assenended appx. 5000ft verticle and 3 miles distance before accelerating away in less than 2 minutes.   Objects were very luminous,  apearing to light up snow on the mtn as they passed over (500 ft above).  We heard no sound from them.  They apeared to bounce and shimmer and change direction some as they assended.  Possibly spinning cuboids on an axis?  Brassy orange with purple blue shard/fingers of  light flashing offand forming an aparent auroa.  They did not apear to come from the exact same. Location, but started from w/in 1/4 mile of each other and followed simmillar but not exact path/speed. The last was very red, brighter and moved faster than the orange ones.  My friend saw them as humanoid in form and concures with my observation otherwise.  The objects were appx 1 mile from my location when they lifted from the toe of the mtn.<n>
11/22/12 19:15|East Goshen|PA|Formation|2 minutes|7-8 orange red lights in formation|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94773.html|155|ndxe201211| 7-8 orange red lights in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> While leaving house on Nov 22, 2012, about 7:15 PM I casually was noticing the moon and a planet I believe was Jupiter in a SSE direction (I&#39;m an astronomy buff so this is a normal thing for me to do). The atmosphere was clear, with no haze, and it was cloudless. When I got in my car I decided to have a quick smoke before leaving. I happened to glance back in the previously stated direction and was surprised to see 4 orange red lights, near the position of the Moon-Jupiter position, in what looked like a quadrilateral type formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the objects appeared to be moving from SSE to NNW direction at a modest speed. The spatial orientation of the lights appeared to change as it moved. As I got out of the car for a closer look it seemed to change to a more &#39;kite&#39; like orientation with several (3 or 4) new lights of the same color trailing behind like a tail behind the &#39;kite&#39;. I got back in my car with the idea to get to a drive to a closer vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I backed up and started forward I tried to locate the formation again through my car window while driving, but could not find it, it appeared to be gone. Total observation time was about 2-2.5 minutes. There was no sound associated with these objects. They were about the same brightness as Jupiter, which was quite bright at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated, I&#39;ve spent some time observing the night skies as an astonomy buff. I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like this before. I can tell you what I think it was not;<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was not stars, any planet, or meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was not satellites passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I don&#39;t believe it was part of any fireworks display (not like any I&#39;ve seen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I don&#39;t believe they were airplanes, or helicopters or ballons (not like any I&#39;ve seen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One possibility I was thinking of was that they might be flares, of the type that military planes drop as part of their defensive apparatus. But I think that flares dropped by planes are white, while these were of an orange red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also thinking of a sub-orbital scientific package launched by rocket from Wallops Island, Va, (base), as I know from experience, depending on the scientific package, these can put on a show in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried checked the Wallops launch schedule and was not able to find a record of any launches on Nov 22.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I watched them for about fifteen to twenty second, then came back into house and grabbed my camera.  I was only able to get four photos of the last one before it was gone.  The lights came from the north, circle a few times and then headed west.  They were orange in color. They were not blinking and there was no sound.  They were fairly fast moving at times and appeared to slow down a few time.  The last one had a well define dim circle of orange light emitting from the side of it a couple of times that looked like almost like a spot light.<n>

We ran out front to look at it more.  It then stopped and went back towards the backyard and kept going off towards the north and just faded away. I t was not moving fast just cruising almost.  No noise, no other lights besides the orange/yellow brightness of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12 people all leaving Thanksgiving Dinner witnessed this. I was able to get one picture.<n>

I had just arrived home and took my dogs into my yard. It was dark by that hour, and there was a bright half moon (more or less).  I happened to look up at the moon and noticed an unusual light in the sky, directly above me (about 90 degrees from ground).  Had I not been looking straight up, I probably would not have noticed it.  There was no sound whatsoever.  My dogs did not seem to notice anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perfectly round, a bright red circle with yellow in the middle, about the size of, maybe, ten stars.  I thought it looked like a cheese wheel--that was the best thing I could think of.  But it was two concentric colors--an outer red ring and a small yellow center, though there was no border nor &amp;quot;dithering&amp;quot; between the colors.  It stayed fixed in the sky for a few minutes. It did not move up, down, left, right, near or far. In my mind I ran through the possibilities--I believe in UFOs but I&#39;m scientific.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a plane.  Not a helicopter.  Not a satellite, space station, meteor, comet, weather balloon.  I thought that the only scientific thing I could think of would be a nova or supernova--something that had exploded in space and hangs in a fixed position.  It was in one spot long enough that, after observing for a couple of minutes, I ran back into my house and called a friend--the only one I knew for sure would be around.  I asked him to get outside to check it out. It took him about a minute or two (it had already been in the sky for a few mins) and right at that point, it surprisingly started moving,  towards the north/northwest. It did not seem to get higher or lower and didn&#39;t move like a plane or copter. At that point, it disappeared! Not because it moved out of site, but it just went dark. There was no cloud cover in the sky. My friend never did see it as he got out there just a few seconds too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Investigator does not need to contact to me, but do feel free to be in touch, if you&#39;d like.]<n>

They were moving at a rapid pace, from east to north, beginning low in the horizon and then moving upward quickly and begin to move more slowly.  They reached a very high point in the sky, and then just stopped moving and hung motionless.  The lights dimmed and disappeared after 20 seconds, first the highest one, and then the other two lights.  There were no sounds emitted, there were not fire sparks or tail.  The time elapsed from when I first saw the lights to the time the last one disappeared was approximately 1 minute 30 seconds.  The night was very clear, there were no clouds.  Wind was minimal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to wonder what I just saw, I witnessed another red glowing light coming from the horizon out of the east on almost the same trajectory as the first lights I had seen.  The light was traveling quickly in a horizontal trajectory, and then began to move upward and slow its pace.  Then a second red light appeared, as well as a third with similar trajectory.  These lights also traveled quickly horizontally and then began to move upward toward the first light that was hanging motionless in the sky in practically the same position that the first set of lights were sighted.  The second and third lights began to slow as they ascended, and then hung motionless in the sky.  Again, there were no sounds emitted, there were no fire sparks or tail to any of these lights.  They appeared to dim and disappear after a minute.  This second sighting of lights occurred approximately 2 minutes after the first set of lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance of these lights from the ground were quite far away.  The lights were very red, very bright, although their altitude appeared to be that of a high flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was much  lower than an airplane which caught our attention.   It moved swiftly but slow enough to get a good look at it.  My husband describes it acting like a jet engine as it looked like someone may have been &amp;quot;accelerating&amp;quot; and the red colored fireball would intensify in color and then return to its original red fireball appearance.  It kept doing this (accelerating type of activity) without making any noise.   There was nothing else in the sky around it .. just this one fireball.   We watched it move northeast until it went out of our line of sight.   I kept checking the websites to see if anyone else in the downriver area had this same experience and have not seen any reports to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was travelling slowly, horizontally....   But then it paused and shot straight up until it looked like a really distant star.  It was still red, but then it began an erratic zigzag pattern.   Suddenly it began to glow brighter and it seemed to diffuse.   The image became bigger and redder and began to slowly descend, becoming more and more diffused, and, therefore, larger.    It actually looked like it had fallen to earth.  Like something that had silently exploded and fallen to earth like confetti.   It was simply beyond belief.<n>

It was very dark. I rounded a corner and about a half mile due West in the Sky was a clear cluster of bright lights? Probably 4 or 5 lights. I slammed on the brakes and stared at it through the front window.  I have never seen anything like this before. I knew if I kept going I would head right for it.  I could just see it now and then through the trees and when I headed West through the switchbacks.  As I came out of the trees I looked East and there it was about a mile East? It was still dark and I grabbed my Binoculars that were in the front seat. Swarovski EL 10x40mm. I looked at it and could clearly see 6 distinct bright lights in a perfect Diamond shape. I could not make out a shape other than the VERY bright lights in a perfect Diamond shape. I thought I had my Cannon with a telephoto lens in the back seat and turned to grab it. It wasn’t there I left it at home.  I had a Canon point and shoot and quickly d! ug it out of my backpack that was in the back seat. I rolled down the window, shut off the truck and took a couple pics. I then got out to try and get the camera steadier on the rear bed of the truck.  As I was rounding the rear of the truck I looked to the West and could see the original cluster of lights that I had seen on the way up the road. I took a couple pics of it also. Both craft were about the same elevation (3000ft)and about 1 ½ miles apart. I thought I could get a close picture through my binoculars.(digi scope) so I got back in the truck and looked at the one East of me through the binoculars(about a mile) and I could now only see one light. The sun was starting to come up and I was going to wait and get a picture of the craft with the sun on it. The light of the craft slowly faded and then there was nothing. I started the truck and quickly headed for the one higher on the Mountain to my West I got to where I could see it and the same thing. The light slowly fad! ed and it was gone. Both of them never moved the whole time I ! was ther e and I never heard a sound.<n>

Nothing like a shooting star or meteor shower and many times faster and brighter a plane.  Too fast to be noticed unless looking up in that direction by chance...<n>

Looked like green,yellow and red blinking back and forth on one craft.   Stationary at one low level in the sky.  Looked at it for maybe two minutes, (craft @ 2miles away) went over to my porch for less than a minute, went back into the yard and saw the craft about 6 houses away not with blinking lights but now with 5 - bright headlights (like on a car but spaced) seemed to be coming straight for me, no noise from craft, I became afraid and stepped under my porch, walked to the other side of my porch and saw a triangle shaped craft (somewhat like a stealth bomber), flat black, no lights anywhere under the craft, no moon in the sky so it blended into the sky very well.  Looked to be @ 200 ft in the sky, now all lights off, maybe the size of my two story home, I could barely hear the noise from the eng! ine,sounded more like rushing air than a gas powered engine.   I was able to see that is was real because it seemed to be flying at a very slow speed, @ 20 mph. I lost sight of it as it went west through the neighborhood.<n>

I was very disturbed by this sighting- it wasn&#39;t anything of human form.

Distant buildings had obscured its initial approach and final departure but its straight-line path was unmistakable and significant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its duration was at least 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noteworthy: Neither white spotlights nor red &amp; green running lights were evident, and no sound was could be associated with it — it’s a dense, active city where I was when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was my second sighting of possibly same or similar craft in perhaps 3 days (at possibly 22:50 EST on perhaps 11/19/12), it seems it could be a recurring phenomenon.  I had no other impression of it other than it was manmade and quite peculiar.  The quite bizarre part is that the flame would have had to be upside down since the flame was never obscured and appeared to project downward the entire time.  I would liken it to an upside down barbeque grill with lighter fluid freshly lit.  It was bright and clear even as it approached the south-eastern horizon.<n>

Flying height was similar to small aircraft, appearing to be about 1 mile horizontally and 1 mile vertically from our viewpoint.  No flashing lights or strobes were seen.  No other colored lights were seen except for the white and red.  Object was moving from East to West horizontally.  It never appeared to be floating or moving upwards or downwards.  No noise was heard from the object.  One or two small aircraft were also flying in the sky at the time and this object did not compare to the small aircraft lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once noticed, we watched the object for about 30-60 seconds and then the lights completely shut off or object disappeared in thin air.

The first group of two linear arranged, the next group of 3 approx 4 min. later were in a staggered vertical alignment, at a higher altitude.  Approx. 2 min. later a single fireball passed.  No idea what I witnessed.<n>

He pointed to orange lights in the sky.  There were three lights in a triangular shape and maybe two lights on the side.  The lights were moving all together and the formation was pretty large in size.  It was hard to see through the trees but we saw it clear enough.  The lights were moving North West and disappeared completely.  We also seen at an airplane flying towards the lights.  After we no longer seen the lights, we saw a helicopter flying towards the area as well.  I tried to video tape the lights with my cell phone but could not capture the lights.  I do still have the recording though.<n>
11/21/12 20:00|St. Francis|WI|Triangle|2 minutes|Huge 2+ Mile Perfect Triangle of Lights Over Lake Michigan; Next to Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, WI 21 Nov 21.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94760.html|188|ndxe201211| Huge 2+ Mile Perfect Triangle of Lights Over Lake Michigan; Next to Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, WI 21 Nov 21.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2000 hrs, Wed evening 21 Nov 2012, I was going northbound on Pennsylvania/Nicholson, and when I pased Ramsey Ave in Cudahy.  This street is the main street next to Billy Mitchell Field Airport, on the east side of airport.  I looked eastward, over Lake Michigan, and I seen 4 bright lights, in a Triangle form.  There was 1 airplane in front, with it&#39;s lights blinking, and right on it&#39;s right wing, there was a huge triangle of 3 lights that was a perfect triangle and huge.  The airplane was on the runway path to land from Lake Michigan westbound.  It was about 5 miles out and the triangle was easily huge; and I&#39;d say 2+ miles apart from each corner light.  When I first seen it, I was going northbound and the lights were going on a north-east direction, and about 1 minute later, when I next seen it thru a field, the lights turned west bound; into the landing runway east/west.  I slowed and passed the airport, and did not see the airplane with the blink! ing lights land, but as I looked at the triange of lights, it hovered, then lowered towards the water, and I lost sight of it.  I thought it was a line of planes waiting in line to land, but it was not, and the triangle just stayed the exact same.  As I turned west, I lost sight of it.  Please ask for the Mitchell Field airport radar reports for about 8pm that evening, and look directly east of the airport.  Then look directly east at the edge of Lake Michigan waters, and then look south east...  It seems it came in on a direction from the south east going to the north west, then went directly west, as the airplane was directly in line with the runway...  That is were the craft hovered, and lowered down towards the horizon and water, when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was huge and possible larger then 2 mile from point to point light.  I only seen the point of lights on the corners and did not see any lights or craft, but it was 100% solid as the triangle turned directions and decended...  Any aircraft, the lights would not have all turned as one huge piece...  I was in the USAF for more then 10 years, and honestly, never ever in my life seen anything so huge.  I seen the blimp, and even flew on a C10 to the Gulf and let me tell you, this wasn&#39;t anything that small.  Thank you.  I wish I would have had a camera, but my cheap phone can not take pictures...   No joke and this will stay with me forever...<n>

At first we thought they were satellite but soon discovered they would stop then turn direction and speed of at an astronomical rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are also what looks like larger ones that are triangle shaped with lights at each corner. They move for the most part North to South then back South to North, pausing for a moment before continuing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend set up his son&#39;s small telescope the other night yet they are still to far away to see clearly.  With that said, it&#39;s almost like the larger ones are &#39; clocted &#39;.   It&#39;s not possible to make out a definite shape due to the clouds and on a clear night they are not around.<n>

Iv been seeing these lights (UFOs) since 6-25-2012 since then iv been going out every night to watch the sky&#39;s and almost every nights i see at least one and i have at least 15 different videos of these events.  I seen way more than what iv got on video.IV had them stop and hover right over top of me just a little higher than tree top and still no sound what so ever i have had them shine their light at me after shining my spot light at them this happened several different times.  Iv also seen them stop on a dime and either make a right or left and even shoot straight up in to the black sky and gone in a flash.Iv seen what looked like to giant headlights drop out of the sky from no where as it came closer and closer the lights would go out and then about ten min or so i would start seeing what looks like a single points of lights flying around.I know of at least 15 different people that have seen these lights.  I know this all this sounds crazy and hard to believe but it&#39;s i can barley believe it my self something is going on !<n>

I looked too, the two of us stood there trying to determine what these reasonably even spaced, traveling rather slowly fireball looking objects were.  I suggested perhaps they were some sort of helicopter but the guy next to me pointed out wouldn&#39;t we hear them?  Because they were a distance close enough that you would expect to hear some sort of sound.  They proceeded as if they were following each other. Neither one of us could determine what type of known flying object they could be. Seemed within the possibility of what a human could invent, but seemed odd and not like anything I had ever seen.<n>

I live in springfield, but this thing is far away so it looks like its in the direction of Palmer or Munson.   The first time I saw it it was coming towards Springfield from the Palmer direction.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was going really fast and the lights of the craft were very bright with one green flashing light, not like a blinking light, it was flashing quickly and the angle of the craft was upwards not like the way a plane would ascend.  I thought wow that must be some new spy plane or something that the Gov designed, but it was really fast.  There was a plane flying on the eastern side of my window and it was so much slower than this plane. I saw it for about six seconds ascending and then it disapeared out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time was a few days ago. It was the same bright white lights with a flashing green light, but this time it was just hovering.  I w! atched it thinking maybe it was a blimp or a star and my eyes were playing tricks so I kept blinking to make sure I was seeing correctly.  The craft moved slightly left then right then went into a 90 degree angle but did not ascend.  Then a little white light broke off from the craft and moved around a little in a circular motion then went back to the craft.  Eventually I just stopped watching because I don&#39;t have a camera right now and I started to just think it was a tower or a star or a blimp.  I figured if I saw it the next day it was something that had always been there. But the next day it wasn&#39;t there.  Then tonight The thing was to the right of my window flashing brightly still towards Palmer and hovering.  It moved to the left and up and stayed there for a while. My husband yelled at me to go to bed and that I&#39;m crazy but now its gone so I don&#39;t know where it went. Once I get a camera for christmas and if the thing comes back I am going to find out what exactly tha! t thing is because it is nothing like I have ever seen.  I lik! e to wat ch stars and have seen different types of planes because we live near a military airbase, but this thing is in the opposite direction of the base and it definitley wasn&#39;t a conventional plane or craft.  I don&#39;t even think a blimp could maneuver like this thing did but I don&#39;t know. All I know is I hope other people have seen this thing because it is weird.<n>

I could not tell any shape from where I stood, cigar type or rectangle would fit but I could not see any definition to say for sure.  The light just hung in the air and became larger (longer) until then seeming to reverse and get smaller (shorter).  I supposed it changed shape because it was turning but cannot say for sure.  What I do know is it was silent, and really really BIG! If I had to guess I would say the length of a football field.   Bright orange as if it were a sunset, but not circle shaped like the sun.  Someone else has had to have seen this at 12:30 at night.<n>

It appeared, a few lights went off, came back on, then all went off simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to get my mail at around 19:00 or 19:05. As I was turning around to walk back across the street and up my driveway, I noticed a line of lights to the north of my location.  My street is on a hill, so it is easy to see far away to the north.  As you look north during the daytime, you&#39;d see a mountain in the direction of the UFO.  However, the UFO was above the mountain, so it couldn&#39;t have been on the side of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I was staring at it and it looked like it was right over the city of Escondido.  The shape was a slanted line of orange lights; the right side was the side that was slanted up.  It was fairly small, so I couldn&#39;t resolve the lights with my naked eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at it for a few minutes, all of the lights went off except for a few on the very left side.  I ran to grab my binoculars (they are 15x70), and when I returned, I saw three small, close together lights through my binoculars. I ran back to my house to get a tripod! because my hands were shaky, and when I returned, all the lights were back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw eight small, orange lights almost in a straight line, except the lights on the sides were curled up, as if the lights were on a saucer.  I couldn&#39;t discern a craft; I only saw the lights. I stared at it until all the lights went off simultaneously. They just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the whole time I watched the lights, none of them moved; they all stayed in the same place relative to each other and relative to the ground. I watched them until about 19:15, which was when they disappeared.<n>

The light itself appeared to be moving in a wavy pattern as it was circling in a round pattern, as if the circle pattern was perhaps on a disc shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for two hours off and on, my husband and my neighbor saw it as well. Neither one of us could find an explanation it was not a airplane or helicopter, it was not a strobe light as there was no beam leading up to it.  It was literally by itself in the sky and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<n>

As I step out of the vehicle and proceed to close the door , i begin to bring my head up into view of the sky over  the top of my house .

I don&#39;t know if its a UFO or a natural reaction of some sort of chemicals and other components in the sky .  But i have never witnessed anything like that in my life , and after researching it online .  I have came to the conclusion that what i saw has no definate explination , but definately is a common occurence .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am extremely scared and paranoid . I hope they are not here to hurt anyone .  I am confused about the situation and i hope some day we can get a peaceful answer to this .<n>

I continued to watch  as i turned off the highway and down the dirt road that leads to my mothers .  As i rounded a curve  i soon lost sight of the object behind some trees.  As i pulled into the yard at my mothers I shut the car off and looked off in the direction that i had last seen the object. Suddenly i saw the object again, approaching very rapidly over the tree line and across the field from our other neighbors house.  This time it was lit up bright  white, frightened i ran into the house and to the back door to see if i could see it fly by, but it had disappeared. I loaded my child into the car and we drove off down the driveway i spotted the object yet again, this time it was due south hovering over towards the highway.  It was lit up the ! same strange orange/whitish color again. As we drove around the curve in the road and approached a stop sign, i sat there for a minute and watched it and could clearly make out three orange circular lights beneath it in the shape of a triangle. I watched it slowly drift across the road and back out over a field before it turned all its lights off and disappeared<n>

I called my husband outside and he watched it too as it got brighter and closer towards us.  He noted that it didn&#39;t look very high and not that far away from us.  Almost right above the airplane beacon that is in the fields behind our house.    It eventually lost its glow and faded out.   It is hazy outside tonight but we can see some stars but are hazy.  I saw another glow of light in the trees and ran and got my phone and took video.  By than another ball of light rose from the trees and rose in the sky, but not as close as the first one.  They eventually faded away.

I was on the phone with my husband also.  I was looking ahead at a church building across the ways and a BRIGHT red and blue light was falling from the sky in which looked like the empty lot next to it.  Once I receieved my items I drove in the direction of the light.  I could see nothing.  One block down on the opposite side of the street I see the light going back up!  I hurriedly found a place to park and am telling my husband what I am witnessing.  He tells me that he witnessed something similar a week ago today on his evening drive home.  I park in an empty lot and watch the sky.  I could see the craft of some sort that was reflecting light moving slowly into the distance.  It stopped, almost motionless with no lights on for about a minute.  Then moved to the west slowly getting brighter the further away and smaller it got. It then turned and headed back into the direction of town.  I then noticed at least 3 smaller ones all moving in the same pattern but in different locations/depths of the sky. They were not always lit up, they would go completely black but still reflected light a bit so I could see them.  I have never before witnessed anything of this sort.<n>

Was going over a bridge over the rail road tracks and Sighted a Single light a few hundred feet above my car.  First i thought it was beacon light on transmitter tower and realized it was solid orange and not the tower light.  As i got to the top of the bridge I looked back forward and Saw 3 more. orange brightly glowing spheres.  Weather was extremely foggy and could only see a few hundred feet in any direction.  This is a 2 lane road i was on and couldnt jsut stop.  I slowed to about 15 miles and hour and was leaning forward to look up at them thru the windshield.  I had already past the first. the other 3 were in view. lasted 20 seconds at most.  But they were 2-3 ft round spheres glowing a bright but defined and non-flickering orange light.  At first i wanted to believe they were chinese lanters.  But they were smooth round, and orange no flickering. they were moving east-south east fairly slowly.  It was a calm foggy light.  Once i got home &amp;lt;approx 2 minutes later&amp;gt; I decided to go look for them again. I drove around the area for 10-15 minutes stopping and looking all the way to the interstate and did not see them again.<n>

Then it disappeared again!<n>

It was right on top of this house.  I continued cooking, but realized that it persisted and seemed to be hovering above my house.  I opened the kitchen door to the garage and could see flashes of white light in the alley coming through spaces on the overhead door.  I assumed it was our local police helicopter circling in search of a suspect.  This is not unusual.  This is a ranch style house and the path the craft was flying meant it flew slowly over the length of the house.  The rumbling lasted so long that I went to the deck in the backyard and noticed a large object which was apparently triangular in shape because there were pulsing red lights at each of its 3 corners.  I didn&#39;t have my glasses on and am near sighted, but I could determine that the object was slowly moving northward and was crossing a busy east/west street heading towards Portland. I had time to run and get my glasses.  Then I observed a car, headed eastward had pulled over and was watching this thing cross over the street.  The craft was likely following the path of the river which is to our west.  I watched in disbelief because although it was dusk, it was only dinner time and this thing flew right over a densely populated neighborhood with lots of people still out.<n>

We noticed a white tear dropped object that appeared to be falling gradually at a 10 degree angle traveling south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and I used my 15x binoculars to get a closer look.  The object appeared to have a core dark in color with an almost white cloudy sheath around it tear dropped shaped with a short tail. We continued to watch it as we traveled down the Hoyt Rd. and stopped again as we thought it could be a Jet aircraft with an after burner but knowing jets have a very long trail this object did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats when we noticed that many jets not shore what kind (possibly military)where approaching the objects vicinity from many directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to lose sight of the object and continued south to Rt. 1.  We topped the hill coming out of Monticello headed south an pulled over along side the road.  That is when we still noticed aircraft flying in the vicinity and the object began to slowly spiral down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be as close as you would normaly see a jet flying over and the long white trail they leave behind but this object was much larger and easier to see with a short tail almost like a tadpole but left no trail in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed that there were two more objects further off in the distance same shape and same color with jet aircraft near by.  I wish I could say how far these objects were from us but the distance would be very great but still visible with out optics.  Not shore but I have seen many comets and falling stars but this was nothing like that.  Hope someone else in the state has seen this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this on 11/20/12 because it happend again this evening in the southern sky at around 15:00.

I wasn&#39;t wearing my sunglasses, but instead my driving glasses.  The sky was clear when I noted 3 very small objects leaving small -what appeared to be-jet streams behind them.  What really caught my attention was they were almost like &#34;hanging&#34; midair and very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then each would move in a different direction, doing loops and turns. I first thought it may be an air show somewhere in the distance.  I was driving west on Route 22, and continued watching when it looked like a larger jet was coming from my left toward the objects and then lost sight of them.  It was very interesting,  I described them as tear drops simply because they were so tiny and left the trail when they maneuvered in the shape of a small tear.<n>

The UFO was seen for about 3 seconds with the bright lights visible and after that about 3 seconds it turned off the lights and while proceeding to travel in the same direction at the same speed. I could then still see a slight visual of the aircraft for about 2 more seconds.  Then that&#39;s when i no longer saw the aircraft.<n>
11/19/12 11:50|Saugerties/Kingston|NY|Disk|7 seconds|Rocking, slow moving disk high in sky visible due to reflected sunlight|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94636.html|222|ndxe201211| Rocking, slow moving disk high in sky visible due to reflected sunlight<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling south on the New York State Thruway between exits 20 (Saugerties) and 19 (Kingston).  The sun was quite bright overhead - not visible to me.  Ahead of me were high flying clouds approaching from the south (they then totally dispersed, on the trip back they were nowhere to be seen.)  These were, again, HIGH flying clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going 62 miles per hour (I know this because I watch my speedometer carefully and the car in front of me was a bit slower than usual).  I had reached (approximately) the mid-way point (mile marker 96-95) between Saugerties and Kingston exits which are eight miles from one another.  I’m unsure the exact direction since the road has many wide curves but it was the southbound lane (two lane thruway, I was in the right hand lane).  It was approximately 11:50 AM (I checked the car clock a couple of minutes later at 11:54).  I noticed a very bright, gleaming object reflecting sunlight.  It appeared in the sky immediately to my left in front of me (impossible to know how high it was.)  It was not low flying, it had no wings or rotors, and if it were at a cruising altitude of a commercial airliner, it would have been huge.  It flew much higher than a small plane could or any helicopter, it was not a dirigible or anything easily identifiable.  As directed, if I had to compare i! ts size to that of the sun (mid-day) it appeared flatter top and bottom, and perhaps 3/4 as wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It drifted &#34;slowly&#34; (in an easy manner) more toward the center of my windshield (this all took place in 7 to 10 seconds), stopped, rocked two times (like a plane rocking its wings) and slowly and smoothly went back to the original position.  It was metallic (which caused the sun to reflect off it as I stated) and shaped rather like a disc (saucer).  The road then curved widely and treed area came between me and that portion of the sky for several seconds (perhaps another eight) before I could get a glimpse of that piece of the sky again (which was extremely identifiable because of the formation of high flying clouds in an otherwise crystal blue sky).  The object was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached my destination and parked, it so happened that the formation of clouds was directly in my line of vision.  I was able, standing still, to see that they were quite high.  A commercial jetliner was climbing to cruising altitude (I am 40 miles from both Albany and Newburgh airports, so planes climbing are commonly seen).  The plane appeared to be almost at cruising altitude and was quite high.  It entered the cloud structures and I lost sight of it.  I believe that the object I saw while driving also got &#34;lost&#34; into the cloud structure which explains why it was suddenly no longer visible (as the plane was suddenly no longer visible).  This suggests to me that the object I saw was flying as high as, or close to, the altitude of the commercial jetliner (since the same formation of clouds provided cover for both, once entered).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting aspect was the &#34;rocking,&#34; a lazy but precise maneuver, before it went back toward the direction where I had first seen it.  It was oval, as I said, rather like ( ) but with brackets top/bottom and very bright due to reflected sunlight.  It was obviously under control (the rocking indicates that to me) and was being deliberately maneuvered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))<n>

Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it’s NYC I’ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn’t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I’m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don’t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren’t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion’s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion’s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn’t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the “f” word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I’ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I’m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn’t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn’t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.<n>

There was an orangish glow in the lower part of the object, making it look like a flying lantern. The sighting lasted for less than a minute, until the object faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not have any sort of resemblance to an aircraft. There were no flashing lights. It did have some resemblance to a hot air balloon, however, it seemed to be moving faster than a hot air balloon. It also seemed a bit too small for a hot air balloon. Also, the way it faded out of view was mysterious.<n>

It was coming down toward the ground in a teardrop shape and was creating its own light.  The tail coming off the object did not move or change form but stayed the same until it reached above the neighborhood.  Was creating the brightest white light ever.  So bright it was like staring at the sun.  Could not have been a plane or balloon as this was so close that i could make out every detail of the object and it was definatly not man made.<n>

But it was extremely bright and went on for a few minuets finally I looked out of the window and over the treeline was a huge anti riot armoured  tank like   Vehicle but kind of translucent it was following the train line (that&#39;s among the tree line) but it was definitely hovering off the ground it was covered in seemingly random lights it was about 16 foot high and about the size of 4 carriages long.  It was moving very slow I attempted to work out what lies inside the translucent Walsh but it was kind of shimmering it gave off a low pitch whirling noise kind of like large  jet engines eventually it moved out of vision of my window but the noise remanned at the same volume for a while until it suddenly went silent .it definitely wasn&#39;t a train unless they&#39;ve developed huge armoured floating trains made out of shimmering water and rando! m  flashing yellow lights.<n>

The object moved sideways very slowly in a Northwest direction.  It seemed to be gliding the way a balloon would glide.  Then all six white lights got very bright (like high-beams on a car)  and a little red light appeared from the south and approached the object.  The red light seemed to &#39;dock&#39; inside of the bottom white light on the right hand column.  The object went back to low-beams just before the red light docked and it continued in a northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size:  fold a dollar bill in half and hold it at arms length in front of you.   That&#39;s how big it appeared to be in the sky.  (very big)  Was about 30 degrees off horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration: about 3 to 5 minutes before it disappeared behind the trees.

I was on the back porch of my home looking to the north,north east , away from the moon which was approximately 180 degrees the other direction and below the tree line. This is my largest view of the night sky as i am mostly surrounded by very tall trees.  I was sitting facing this direction and noticed 2 bright reddish orange lights emerging over the tree line at 30 degrees off compass north, which is my horizon and the lowest tree line in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared about an inch apart from my point of view moving from what appeared to be an East to West bearing.  The lights were bright but not as bright as Jupiter which was off to my right which i see regularly and is often the brightest object in the sky other than the moon.  The sky was completely clear, and i could see stars on the tree line/ horizon in the background, as well as a few passing/blinking planes in the same approximate area as for comparison. I am very familiar with the air traffic around this area and am very familiar with the the flight paths over this area as it seems to be a relatively high traffic area for planes.  However this was nothing like anything i have seen for myself before.  The 2 lights we diverging and disappeared in about 10-15 seconds.  They seemed to be ascending horizontally rather than any sort of decent, as possibly a flare would have, and were moving at a steady rate.   The relation to each other was about 12 o’clock and 5 o! ’clock top to bottom, as if a plane was on an extremely high banking maneuver, although the lights seemed much too far apart and to quickly moving to be one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly determined that these lights were not connected because they seemed to be drifting apart from one another while holding their bearing of East to West while moving at their own independent rates of speed.  When i stood up out of curiosity and took about 3 steps forward, about 10-15 sec later, 3-4 more of the same objects appeared as the 2 before over the same spot heading in the same direction.  My house is situated on a hill and i immediately went up the hill to gain a better perspective and as i did a total of 6-7 lights appeared moving in this similar direction.  I grabbed my iPhone and began recording what i could.  It was completely dark so i didn&#39;t know if they would show up or not, but despite the neighbor’s patio light glaring against the camera i managed to capture s few of the lights.  Unfortunately i stopped recording on accident when i starting moving up the stairs to the top of the hill, so when i got to the top i started another recording.   Although ! you can make out some of the lights in the video it really does no justice to the sighting as i was filming on a phone at night and had a bad glare.  I happen to be a videographer/ video editor and hesitate to post the footage due to its poor quality even though some of the lights are visible in the video it is certainly not a definitive piece of evidence in any way as to what these lights were or really even their bright reddish orange color. Mostly it will serve as documentation to myself that it actually happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With in about a minute all of the lights disappeared in front of me, not in any kind of sequence and although they were flying in some sort of formation relative to one another,  there was no recognizable pattern.  These lights were not blinking but had some sort of vague pulsing regularity that never stopped until they disappeared.  There was also no noise whatsoever before the sighting, during or after.  I stayed for about 20 min examining the sky for any further explanation but had no further sightings.<n>

It was cloudy out, so it struck me as sort of odd that the one single star shown so brightly. I experienced a psychedelic flashback while staring at the &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; and walking, where I was trapped walking in place(the road beneath me was moving, and a fence I was walking by was still panning past me), and the star seemed to be the only object that was normal within that period, which seemed like eternity.  Terrified, the thought of the star being a UFO and inducing my trip occurred to me and I was able to come out of that state. I&#39;d been observing the star for a good 4 minutes. After, I&#39;d walked past a tree that had blocked my view of the object, and once passed the obstacle, the star was gone.  I looked around the sky a bit and found it slowly hovering to the north of me, the size of an aspirin at arms length, with the orange streetlight glow dimmed and a green and red light added to it in a triangle formation. I watched as it slowly flew over head for a good 01:10-15(minute:second) until it faded into some clouds. I continued looking for it, and noticed it reappear in the distance 2:10 later, half the size, moving at the same speed for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the period of the craft moving, there was a sound similar to an airplane, only it seemed to be coming from the ground. The object was too slow to be an airplane, and had a sort of hazy greenish glowing ring around it.<n>

The light was a bit like a rectangle, i assumed it was a helicopter.  After watching for a couple of minutes I got up and went out on my balcony to look at it.  I noticed another light accompanying the large bright light that looked like a very colorful Christmas tree.  Both were moving in a way that did not make sense to me.  I asked my wife to look at them and she could not figure it out ether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out side to the lakefront and began to watch the lights moving around at, I would guess 1000 feet above the lake.  Over the next ten minutes the lights moved 5 miles away towards Huron to the west.  I started looking up in the sky and saw around 50 to 100 of the Christmas tree light all over the sky.  I then went and got a neighbor who has lived on the lakefront for about 30 years.  He came outside and i pointed the lights out to him.  we were looking at 2 of the lights that were in line with each other, one over the other.  Trying to figure out what they were, guessing maybe airplanes that the lights were blurred from some kind of atmospheric condition. The sky’s over lake Erie can do some weird things.  That is when the lower light which i would guess was 5 miles off the shoreline, shot strait up and to our perspective left the atmosphere.  Or at least went out of site.  Over the next hour or so the lights started to disappear.  By ten o’clock I could not see anym! ore of them.  We have no idea what we were watching.  We both agreed we have never seen anything like it.  My wife and daughter as well as my neighbors wife witnessed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I came almost directly overhead maybe 800 to 1000 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was an airplane on fire as it was moving toward local airport.  As it came overhead you could see that there was no structure on fire but just this huge ball of fire moving silently through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went on to the south it appeared to veer to the right moving westward and continued until it went out of sight over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing cast an immense glow and you could see the flames jumping and flickering.  You would expect to hear something as you would with any other craft passing overhead but it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-wife who is an RN witnessed this also.  She spotted it first.  I am a college graduate and am mostly skeptical of any UFO reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was truly unexplainable.<n>

Our attention was on this triangle shaped object that we failed to notice the hovering, identical craft right above it.  We only saw this long enough for us to get on the exit and it disappeared.<n>

We looked to the east and a few miles away we seen fireballs hovering, lining up in formations (triangles, straight lines), changing shape, and moving. We watched more and more appear out of nowhere.  A bright light would start to form into something bigger and bigger, red and orangish.  It would stand still then slowly move to the east. Every object basically did the same thing, line up, hover, and then proceed to the east, one after another.  They would move east, we lost them behind trees, and then just fade away into the sky as if they were planes in a distance with no navigation lights.  Every move they made seemed to be for a reason. After about 20 minutes of watching we decided to call the local Police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An officer pulled up to us and watched for about 10 minutes and made comments such as, &#34;That&#39;s weird,&#34; and &#34;Maybe were under attack.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer pulled off in hopes of getting closer to the objec! ts.  We watched for another 20 minutes before the last one just sat there. We left in frusteration because we knew we would never find the real truth.  It became frusterating watching objects so close to you and where your loved ones live and having no control as to what can happen next.<n>
11/18/12 17:00|Worth|IL|Changing|45 minutes|Fireballs turning into plane like objects.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94614.html|254|ndxe201211| Fireballs turning into plane like objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé and I were walking around on 116th and Harlem Ave and noticed 3 bright red/orange lights in the eastern sky, twice the size of large stars, in a triangle form, they slowly started moving away, got smaller, as small as a plane in the sky, then turned into what looked like planes because they had small flashing white and red lights, exactly how planes do in the sky, and flew Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then smaller lights started appearing out of no where, and within 5 minutes went for smaller orange/red lights into these large lights hovering and would slowly move then stop and hover some more all while turning brighter and brighter and larger, almost like they were going to burst.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting extremely bright and large they would then get smaller and smaller and eventually turn into small plane lighting objects and fly northeast.  There were as many as 4-6 in the sky as once and when they changed and flew away more would come out of nowhere and repeat the cycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re very active sky watchers and this was something we&#39;ve never seen before so we called a non emergency number in Worth IL, and reported the sight to have possibly have someone else come and see them.  A police officer was able to come by, he didn&#39;t get out of the car but said he noticed them as he was turning into the lot we were in. His first thought was Chinese lanterns, however, I&#39;ve seen lanterns before but there was no way they were lanterns because of the distance they were incomparions to the brightness, as well as the way they were flying, stopping and changing shape.  He finally just said he doesn&#39;t know then, and said it was weird, and that he was going to drive closer to the area.  After about 50 mins no more appearing and we left.  They made no sound, and the strangest part was how they turned into what one might think are airplanes in the sky after being so larger and bright, almost like fireballs in the sky, but turning into planes and flying away, and the only! reason I keep saying plane like object is because of the way ! they loo ked like when they got small and flew away, they had a small red blinking light like planes do with a constant small white light.<n>

The home faces almost due north.  Weather unusually cool and dry for the Houston area, very little wind, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what at first I thoght was a bunch of balloons floating toward me.  Movement was from approximately N/NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see several colors: blue/green, yellow, reddish orange, all on the upper side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer overhead I realized that the object was much larger than I originally thought because a twin engine airplane flew at considerable distance below it (flying east to west).  No airports are nearby that I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached around 13:30 elevation above me, three very bright lights in a perfect triangle appeared on the bottom.  I then began to doubt that it was a bunch of balloons.  For the lights to to be reflections, the surfaces would have to have been mirror-polished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a good digital camera in my car parked across the street (unfortunately the macro lens was installed at the time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the car; because the object was moving slowly I wasn&#39;t in a big hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got close to the car, I looked up and saw that the object was making a sharp turn to the N/NW and moving very rapidly.  The bright lights below were still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed the camera as quickly as I could, but the object was already almost out of sight and disappearing above the rooftops of 2-story homes across the street.  I snapped 4 photos, but I can&#39;t see anything in them.  The focus was on manual, we had been taking photos of the grandkids.<n>

She pulled out of her parking spot and we drove down the street about a block. We were facing north at a stop sign.  I saw from the corner of my right eye a light flying north as well. It was moving at an incredible speed.  Way too fast to have been an airplane.  At first i thought it was a comet but it started turn on and off (would disappear and reappear, it did this 2 times) and was mint/pine green in color. I say it for about 1-3 seconds before it flew out into the distance.<n>

I sat outside in my car for a little while just watching it for about 15 minutes.  My husband came outside wondering what I was doing and he was amazed he had never seen anything like that either.  A few minutes later I got a phone call from my niece who lives about ten minutes away asking me if I saw a strange light outside towards the south over the mountain, she was doing some homework for her astronomy class in college.  We were seeing the same thing, she got off the phone to call her professor to see if he was seeing the same thing and I did not hear back from her.  But she said it was roughly 30 degrees to the southwest of Jupiter and roughly 50 degrees south south west away from Sirus whatever that means.  I took a video of the strange light in the sky.  It was changing colors, pale blue, white, orange, green a! nd red and it was flashing in and out.  There was no sound.<n>

We drove into the parking lot and I waited while she ran inside. Looking straight east I noticed the planet Jupiter bright in the eastern sky.  It was a clear night and cool. Just a little to the Northeast of Jupiter I noticed a small flashing light that just looked funny.  So I grabbed a pair of my binoculars that I keep in my van to get a better look.  Through the binocs I saw a huge white light with a red blue light on surrounding the bottom.  I thought it might be a prism effect of the binoculars when my wife came out of the building and asked what I was looking at. I pointed the light out.  She was looking with her naked eye and I through the binocs when suddenly the object split in half.  My wife commented, &amp;quot;did you just see the light split! &amp;quot;?  She saw with her naked eye.  The object moved quickly apart, with the brighter part moving away from the red blue lighted half.  We watched for a few more minutes and then headed home keeping the separated object in view.  When we got home we quickly looked east again with binoculars just in time to see the object merge back together. Amazing sight to be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess the object was huge and at a great distance because of lack of detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a closing thought, later that morning when I picked up my son from work at 6 AM Sunday morning, the object was gone and have not seen it in the sky since.<n>

The lights were red and orange in color and brighter than any star in the sky.  The sky was clear and the stars were visible and the lights I saw were not stars or Chinese lanterns.  The lights were arranged forming a round x, five for each curved line, then more lights, four that I was able to spot.  I probably missed a few because I was trying to record it with a cell phone camera that did not capture a thing.  The four lights seemed to launch from below and join the moving x, then all the lights that were forming the curved x disappeared. After that, only three were left that just moved upward north and vanished into the sky.  This beautiful occurrence lasted only 5 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area’s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can’t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.  The rising objects then joined the other objects before they also vanished.  By about 2305 hrs, all of the objects were gone.<n>

You can clearly see blue, red, and a white color, Very bright and still in the same vicinity after two and a half hours.

As we arrived at my home the orbs seem to come closer to my backyard, still glowing, still the same distance apart. I ran inside, grabbed my camera, ran into the back yard (literally 10 seconds) and they were gone, simply vanished, no where to be seen in the vast sky above, no where! I can not wait to see them again, I will be ready for you, whoever you are :)<n>

11/17/12 20:30|Oswego|IL|Oval|20-30 seconds|4 silent orange balls of light flying across field of view chasing each other at decent rate of speed and quite low above Oswego, IL.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94583.html|268|ndxe201211| 4 silent orange balls of light flying across field of view chasing each other at decent rate of speed and quite low above Oswego, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived home in Aurora, IL with my wife, mother-in-law and two girls right about 8:30 pm. It was already dark outside being that it was mid-November. We had groceries in the car that we had to unload them before my wife was to take her mother home in Naperville, IL.  So we all got out of the car, the girls went inside followed by the rest of us carrying the groceries. I came back outside by myself to get the rest of the groceries. As I walked down to the car that was parked in the middle of the driveway, I noticed an orange ball of light with blurry edges come to view on my left moving south to north in a perfectly straight line. It was moving at a pretty good speed and awfully low which is why I stayed fixated on it!  All of a sudden, a second identical ball of light showed up right behind it! By then, the first ball of light was right in front of me, but disappeared behind my neighbor’s house that was also in front of me. I then turned by attention to the 2nd ball of light that was following the first and I watched it as it began to move in front of me….Just as I stayed transfixed on it, I noticed yet another ball of light pop up behind it that looked just like the first two and chasing the second ball of light. It was then that I knew that these were not planes! All I can say was that they were bright orange balls of light chasing one another. I then instantly realized that these were not planes! Planes simply do not behave like this; they do not chase each other in this manner or fly so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran into the house through the garage and I frantically told my wife, who was in the kitchen, to come with me and to make it fast because I had to show her something before they disappeared. She was actually pretty startled by my sense of excitement. She came running out and I pointed out the two lights. By then, the 2nd ball of light had just began to peek out again from being out of view due to my neighbor’s house all while the 3rd ball of light was just about to be covered by my neighbor’s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we both then noticed that an identical 4th ball of light appeared flying in the same manner, path and height as the other 3 balls of lights that preceded it. All 4 objects looked identical, flew in the same speed and height all while following each other and were very low. They were so low that they should have made some noise, but they were perfectly silent. They made no sound whatsoever. They all appeared to by flying along US-30 which would put them over in Oswego, IL air space which is the direction I was facing. As all of the objects peeked out from behind my neighbor’s home, they changed their direction all heading west towards Oswego at which time they simply disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were left dumbfounded by what we just witnessed. After the last light disappeared, we simply got the rest of the groceries and came back into the house. I was left intrigued by the whole experience and I began to look over the internet for any mentions of the same from other people in the area. Though I did not find any mentions of today’s sightings from other area people, I did stumble upon several internet sites, including this site, referencing similar/recent sightings of the same orange lights in Oswego, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just before we reached the Hooksett Toll Booth, I saw some very thin flashes of light in the sky ahead of us, occuring every couple of seconds. I passed I off as being light reflecting on wires. I moved my head to try to get a better view when the next one flashed and my husband asked, “Did you see that, too?”  I told him I had seen several and told him it was just car lights reflecting on the wires and he pointed out to me that there were no wires on that part of the highway. When we saw one more, I leaned forward and looked upward, through the windshield. What I saw was a triangular shape with a distinct circle on each “corner” (three circles in all). There was no light emitting from under the craft and it blended in with the night sky (almost appearing transparent).  It moved very quickly in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out on the porch to smoke, and two glowing orbs caught my immediate attention. They were coming over the tree-line from the south-east, and heading northwest. They were traveling too slow to be a plane, too fast to be a blimp , and there was virtually no noise to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the little bit of video I captured ( I ran into the house for my phone when I realized I might be seeing a UFO ), you can hear a regular plane flying over our heads about a mile away. These orbs came over the treeline, maybe 300 feet over our heads and travelled close in proximity and in unisone. As the orbs flew off, they were joined by two more, and seemed to line up on top of each other, forming a triangle. They then continued in their westerly direction until I could no longer view them.<n>

They all seemed to be slowly drifting downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 to 30 seconds they went behind the tree line and were not visable after that. The time was about 6:30 pm dst.  At no time did thet make any eratic movements but drift downward with the one in the lead peeling off kind of swooping down towards the ground, (I saw 2 or three do this swooping motion before they went behind the tree line.)  I did not have a cb radio to ask if anyone else saw this but it was plain to see for anyone driving through the area.  I googled &#34;lights in the sky over columbia, MO 11/17/12,&#34; and sure enough there is a you tube video of the last few seconds of what I saw.<n>

I looked to where she was pointing and at a glance what I saw did appear to be stars of constellations.  As I continued to look at these lights I noticed that they appeared to be moving.  The lights were not maintaining the pattern they were in when I first looked at them.  They also seemed to be much closer in distance than what most stars look like.  I looked around in different directions and noticed that there were not any actual stars out yet.  These lights were the only lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at our destination and got out of the car for a better view.  The lights appeared to be moving in a north/northwest direction.  They looked as if they were flashing red and white.  At first, when we first saw the lights, there were about 20 to 30 lights.  When we were out of the car there were only about 10 to 15.  As we were watching the remaining lights, the lights were moving and would just disappear.  Two more individual lights appeared in my peripheral vision, coming out from the south over some trees.  These lights did not make it as far across my view point before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights observed while outside of the car seemed to be as close in distance as a local airplane might be if flying through the sky.  Definitely within the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  Thought these might be related to the meteor shower that was being reported to be taking place, but there were no streaks or tails and they were not moving very fast.  Tried to get a photo taken with camera phone.  Zoomed in to 4x zoom.  The image at that zoom level was a fuzzy red dot and that dot was about a quarter of an inch wide.

Traveling at a constant and steady speed, many of them broke off into groups and continued to travel in separate directions until just disappearing without a trace.  For a brief moment, they appeared stationary but as they became more visible it was obvious that they were traveling at a considerable speed.  Way faster than a helicopter, but it made absolutely no sound.  It was clearly in sight and would have made sound if it were a familiar object but remained silent and clearly visible until disappearing one by one.  Some appeared to be very close to each other, almost touching but moved uniformly and at a steady speed.  Appearing in different groups and formation, the bright orange lights stretched across the sky traveling some in the same direction and some in different directions all traveling from the Northeast.  All of them gradually disappeared heading Southwest checked the local weather immediately after and visibility was 10 miles 46 degrees wind northeast 4 mph (groundlevel).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness also called our Hotline, and added that the lights were not blinking.

I have seen others report this incident and was glad to see that my wife and I were not the only ones to witness this event.<n>

They started out just above the tree line continuing up directly above.  They seemed to be square and in a geometric pattern. After pulling over in a parking lot we noticed that they seemed to be moving slowly moving all at the same speed, they were not blinking and remained the entire duration (about 3-5min) of the citing and they made no sound.  Some clumped together and they one by one disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky and after contacting the federal aviation agency there was clarity of 10 miles.  They were moving from north west to south west and the wind was moving in the opposite direction.<n>

I ran outside, and we saw a swarm of bright-colored objects floating noiselessly very low to the ground.  We live in Stafford, Virginia, near the Quantico Marine Corps Base, so we thought at first that it might be a group of helicopters, but there was no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We estimate there were more than 10 and less than 20 of these floating objects. They had bright red and white lights and moved quickly from northeast to southwest.  I could not get a good sense of whether they were sphere-like or boomerang in shape, but they seemed to cluster together and move effortlessly.  Some appeared to hover and loop back, while others kept floating at a quick pace across the sky above power line level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before seen anything like this nor have I reported any such incident. As quickly as they crossed the sky, they seemed to vanish.<n>

This plane took off from Logan Airport, about 1 mile away, and was traveling west to east.  As I continued my walk an orange ball appeared about a quarter of a mile in front of me.  I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere but it stopped and hovered and then a second ball joined it.  I called two friends in the area and they saw them also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two balls came in from the  north and hovered at about 400 and 500 feet above a hill on which the Winthrop water tower is located.  After about 40 seconds the orbs disappeared. The bottom orb disappeared first.  They both appeared to turn west and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a report on a local website of a person who saw two similar orbs at 19:30 on the same night.  They reported that the balls travelled towards Logan Airport and then disappeared.<n>

It faded into the distance, perhaps two minutes from coming into view until it disappeared to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later as we approached other pedestrians(3 young men) we asked if they had seen it. &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;  Pointing up to where it had come from, we saw another on roughly the same path.

11/17/12 18:10|Hampton Borough|NJ|Fireball|15 minutes|Bright, glowing reddish-orange fireballs in the evening sky.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94597.html|286|ndxe201211| Bright, glowing reddish-orange fireballs in the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night, November 17, 2012, between 6:10 – 6:25pm (EST) my wife and I saw about 20 large, bright, glowing reddish-orange spheres (or “fireballs”) in the evening sky, over a period of approx. 15 minutes from our front porch in Hampton Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  The sky was perfectly clear, with low humidity (the Dew Point was about 25 degrees F) and the temperature was 38 degrees F.  There was a bright, waxing crescent moon to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I initially stepped out onto my front porch, to let my dogs out, I noticed two pairs of large, very bright reddish-orange glowing lights that were roughly spherical and could be described as “fireballs” that seemed to “float” in the sky, although they were clearly moving slowly in a straight line from the east-southeast to the northwest.  As the first pair got closer, they appeared to get a little bigger, until they were about double their initial size.  As they got directly overhead, they appeared to gradually fade, until they eventually disappeared, somewhat like a light dimmer.  Over the next 15 minutes, my wife and I saw another 15, or so, identical “fireballs” rise over the treetops of the mountain to our east-southeast, always travelling in pairs, in groups approximately 30 to 60 seconds apart, and always emanating from the same spot on the eastern horizon.  They all travelled in the same straight line, toward the northwest, seeming to “float” in the sky, but! making slow progress to a position directly overhead in a leisurely span of time of about 45 seconds to 1 minute, before they all gradually faded away over a span of about 10 seconds.  Since the mountain is about 1 mile from our house, and it took the “fireballs” about 1 minute to get directly overhead, I would estimate they were travelling at about 60 miles per hour.  They seemed to be fairly low in the sky, and I would estimate their altitude to be about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above us.  Their reddish-orange glow was constant – that is to say they did not “blink” like the lights on a plane or helicopter. There was no tail or flames – just a steady glow.  The way they seemed to “float”, or “hover”, seemed somewhat like a helicopter, and the way they arose over the horizon, always in pairs and seemly in a type of intentional formation, seemed to both my wife and I reminiscent of the helicopter scene in the movie “Apocalypse Now”. These &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot; made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes from my initial sighting, I decided to call 911, to find out if other people in our area had noticed and reported these mysterious glowing lights.  The 911 operator said no one else had called, and suggested they might be a meteor shower (which they were not; meteors move much faster, are much smaller and burn white hot, not glowing reddish-orange, like a fireplace ember).  She connected me with the New Jersey State Police Barracks, who dispatched a Trooper to our house.  By the time the Trooper arrived (about 15 minutes later, around 6:35 pm), the glowing lights has vanished.  He was very nice, but said no one else had reported seeing the lights.  My wife and I would be very much interested in knowing if anybody else reported seeing these glowing lights on the evening of Nov. 17th – they were the most unusual things either of us have ever seen and we would like to know an explanation for them.  My wife is a Registered Nurse and I am a Civil Engineer and! Geologist, and we have an intense curiosity to understand natural phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In perspective, approximately 1-2 inches above this aircraft was a brilliant white light, shape unknown, with no trailing plume, which the light became even brighter than before, then completely disappeared. I believe this was too close to be another airplane.  Also, if it was an airplane, it would not have disappeared. It did not have a trail of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the front passenger in the car, and was telling the driver, my sister, to look at the object, and why it did not have a plume, when it completely disappeared.  She was driving and did not see it.  We were traveling to UT Medical Center with 2 grandchildren to see my new grandchild.  I have never seen a UFO before. I am 55 years old, have been a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, and have lived in Anderson County most all of my life.<n>

We were looking out of the kitchen window towards  the south, kind of out over Newark airport. We saw three orange glows in the sky.  At first, I thought it must be the sun or moon, but they were clearly distinct shapes and they were moving kind of toward the left and downward until they finally disappeared behind the houses in the distance.  I would say they were not some kind of optical illusion, nor did they appear to be some kind of reflection caused by the sun.  They were definitely not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then did some looking around online to see if anyone else had reported any similar sightings, and we found that there have been many reports in the last few years (one in my home town in Huntingdon, England) and others more locally.  Finally, we came across this website and decided to add our voice to the many others who say they have seen something.  I wouldn&#39;t like to say it was definitely something from outer space! Big claims require big evidence (or something like that) as someone once said. But they were definitely UFOs.<n>

In the Eastern sky I saw an Orange light, not a plane.  Light was not blinking, but maybe flickering a bit similar to fireball.  Light was too big to be from a plane, completely silent!  It wasn&#39;t going too fast. It was circular.  Not too far behind was a second one. I followed with my eyes to the West till I couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  Then trailing behind was the 3rd one.  I took a short video with my phone of the last one but it didn&#39;t come out too clear.  I live in Southeastern MA.<n>

At first I thought they were small passenger planes from the local airfield, but didn&#39;t see any wings. They glinted in the sun, the same bare-metal color and reflection as a WWII Mustang fighter plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was that they were party balloons flying thorugh the air. But as I got closer they appeared to be too big - about 10 feet in diameter. After passing over Congress Ave they continued on then turned south and kept going parallel with the street behind me. They disappeared behind the trees, and I turned around at Hypoluxo Blvd to go back south and try to catch them on my camera, but never saw them again. They were in view for perhaps 30 seconds, starkly visible against the bright blue sky and cumulous clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be about 200-300 years away at the beginning, and maybe 50-75 yards up. They kept their formation the whole time, one higher and ahead of the other. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was directly in front of the other or not. I was in the car in traffic and heard no sound from the spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We both were looking south up at Jupiter, when my eyes focused in on a group of reddish stars, one star in particular caught my eye because it slowly started to pull away from the other (it was stationary I focused and recognized it&#39;s position) My first thought was that I found an orbiting satellite because it started out as slow as an orbiting satellite and seemed to follow a smooth almost floating path to the south west for what seemed like an inch in the sky. The object then seemed to skip almost as it gained speed and turned north gaining altitude and continuing north for about a foot in the sky. It then made a long smooth curve like maneuver towards north east and then east following the horizon and up behind cloud coverage and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment I saw what I thought was a satellite I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she confirmed that she saw it also as it began to speed up. We then both watched in amazement and it took off. We both saw a obviously red circle that seemed to be able to control speed, altitude, and direction. She mentioned that she thought it might have had a cloudy faded orb surrounding it also. The object seemed to be going faster than anything we have ever seen before while following a very strange smooth flight plan. No other lights were visible on it and the sky was brightly lit, it was almost spooky how bright the sky was. We also recognized 7 meteors that entered the atmosphere and disappeared just like they always do. We are confused and excited about what we saw and are wondering if this is normal or has anyone else experienced this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was foggy but there was a crystal clear sky above.  Lots of stars visible.  But also, above the eastern horizon, above the tree line (25-45 degrees above the horizon I’d guess) was three bright orange/gold lights, like fireballs perhaps or like the golden glow of  burning bits from a firework that fall to the ground at the 4th of July.  They were, of course, in a triangle formation being three of them but they were configured in a way that appeared as if they were attached to a monstrous jet plane.  The lights were brighter than any star in the sky and bigger too.  It did not appear to be moving much at first but looked as if it were perhaps coming at us.  My husband joined me at the window to see.  It turned,  all three lights in formation, to the north as if it were a jet banking to land and began to head in that direction.  I ran outside to see if I could hear anything but t! here was no sound and by the time I got out there it was fading and I watched the last light trail off to the north until it disappeared/burned out.  There was no noticeable flickering, barely a wavering of the light but it faded to a darker gold/brown before disappearing completely as a coal extinguishing slowly.  All of the movement was very slow, no sharp turns or sudden acceleration.  We thought first of the leonid meteor shower and hoped it was related but neither of us had seen any meteor behave in such a way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At least 7 of them, but not all at once.   At they rose higher in the sky, they became smaller, until we realized they were losing their brightness as they were moving farther away.   At one point, they stopped in the same spot in the sky (we actually have an airplane beacon behind our house out in the field).  They all eventually went in different directions in the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky in the distance and at one point, it looked like the plane and object came very close.    My husband saw them first after taking the dog outside and than called us out to look.   My 14 year old son and my 11 year old daughter were also witnesses.   Lasted for approximately 5 minutes or so.  I would imagine that we weren&#39;t the only ones to see the objects.  Buffalo International airport is only about 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I sat on my porch, looking at the stars, when I noticed a blinking star. I looked closely and it was blinking red and blue, very bright in color. Then I noticed that it was moving all over the sky, right, left, up, down. I ran inside to get a blanket, and ran back out and it was still there. It would get closer at times, and it would occasionally stop and hover. I could see that it could be a spear shape, with the light in the center and coming from the center there were long lines, as if connecting on the outer rim. I wasn&#39;t sure what I was seeing, and kept watching it for an hour, going around the sky, getting closer then further away. When I did get to see it, it looked like some sort of craft, honestly. I don&#39;t know how to describe it. It was dark and I could only see so much. I did see a plane fly by and pass by it. I waited for somet! hing to happen, but it continued for an hour before I decided I was freezing and had to go inside. All I know is that I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed it was moving from left to right, but then it went down (I guess you could say south) which immediately I thought was incredibly odd, because I&#39;ve seen satellites and they just don&#39;t move like that. I then noticed 3 other lights around it, which were not as bright, but moving all over in all directions around the brighter one. I ran inside to grab my co-worker (who absolutely does not believe in UFOs by the way) to show her and I said to her &amp;quot;you need to see this and tell me I&#39;m not crazy!&amp;quot; She walked outside and looked up and watched for about ten seconds, then ran back inside and said she couldn&#39;t watch because it was freaking her out- I stayed outside and she kept yelling at me to come inside but I couldn&#39;t stop staring up at these crazy moving light! s for about ten minutes. Our shift was then over and she said &amp;quot;hurry up let&#39;s get out of here, stop looking up!&amp;quot; We left work together but they were still in the sky when we made our way from work... I am definitely freaked out by whatever it is we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first one was a few days ago (can’t remember the exact day, but around November  11 or 12).  I was hanging laundry on our 2nd floor balcony at around 10 in the evening and saw a single orange light slowly moving above me.  It didn’t make a sound and it slowly vanished in the clouds towards the north.  I called my husband to check it out but we didn’t make a fuss out it thinking it was just a flare or a Chinese lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was yesterday at about 7 in the evening, November 16.  It was also a single bright orange orb flying soundlessly,  this time going straight to the east.  It again vanished in the clouds.  I immediately thought it was an airplane of some sort because it’s impossible for me to experience 2 UFO sightings in a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third one was late in the evening of the same day, November 16 at exactly 10.30.  My family was going on a road trip and was about to load ourselves in the car when I saw the orange orb again going to the east.  I told my husband it must be an airplane because I saw one earlier.  My daughter and I were already in the car when my husband yelled it wasn’t an airplane and when I looked there were around 10-15 orbs flying towards the east.  The first group of orbs was flying in a wide triangular shape.  The second group formed a line.  They all headed in one direction and vanished in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was already late and nobody saw it aside from us.  My husband made a shout out in his social network to check if other people saw the lights but nobody claimed to have seen them.  It didn’t look like a flare to us because it was flying on a straight path and it didn’t look like Chinese Lanterns either because they formed a triangle and it looked like it was in control of it’s direction and vanished in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got it on video using a mobile phone.<n>

The two other objects appeared to hover, then move in a quick zig zag pattern.  These two objects appeared to have red, blue and green lights that appeared to pulsate.  Definitely was not a helicopter, commercial airliner or satellite.  Viewed these objects for approximately one hour.

They were moving slower than planes would move and in a very unusual manner, snaking left and right and crossing back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one had a solid goldish colored light that would stay on the entire time, as well as a trail that looked like a comets trails.  Almost like a giant sparkler had been lit and was flying through the sky.  The sparkling trail would come on for roughly 10 seconds and then go out on each one.  This happened for about 2 minutes as the objects continued to fly south until both the solid gold light and the sparkling trail of each of the two extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the entire incident we could see a helicopter a few miles away to the north which appeared to be following the objects, and continued to follow them south until all 3 craft were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent all night trying to think of what the objects might be as well as search the internet and it appears others saw similar craft, but within the last week.<n>

I think there were lights all the way around it but they already went out.  And I almost hit a car because I was so focused on it.

As I was driving past LC my daughter got all excited.  She said she just say a big bright light out over the ocean.  As we passed Mussel Shouls she screamed there it is! I turned and saw a bright orange and red ball of fire circling what looked like a blacked out moon hanging just above the Santa Cruz Island.  It was so bright I could see the outline of the mountains on the island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled to the side of the freeway just before Seacliff and got out of the car.

It was clear and cool.  It was dark.  My 13-year old son had just come to join me in the backyard hot tub.  I was looking at him and talking as he stepped down into the tub.  As he sat down, he exposed the sky above him and I saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was at a 25 degree elevation to me, about 1 - 3 miles away, as I looked SSE.  The UFO was headed due south.  It appeared to be right over the Las Vegas (McCarran) airport.  It was about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length.  It was white, and shaped like a full-bodied arrow on a street sign.  The stem of the arrow was only as long as the arrow head was wide.  It produced a brief white tail behind itself, the full height of the arrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was going dangerously fast if it was over the airport.  It moved at 3 to 6 times the speed of the airliners I constantly see in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 20 seconds.  I stammered for my son to look, so he observed the flight for 10 seconds.  As it flew south, my view was soon going to be blocked by my second story roof line.  Just as I was about to lose my line of sight, the UFO just vanished out of sight in an instant.  I heard no unusual noises that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped driving for a little while to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved and a beam of light came down from it into a field and trees and we hurried up and went around a bend to get a better look. When we got around the bend I saw it shoot off and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only lasted for about 7 seconds max and we kept looking into the sky for it but we did not see anything even remotely like it in the sky anymore.<n>

This is the first time I’ve experienced this, so I didn’t think to take any pictures.  It was a large, diamond shaped bright light in the sky.  It was pretty high up, but we were on Jacksonville Road in Homer City, PA, and its wide open fields for miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first spotted it, we just thought it was the North Star, but as we kept looking at it, it got larger and brighter. It also shot a very bright light into a field, and also on the tree tops.  It wasn’t moving at all at first, but as we kept driving it started moving away from us.  That’s when we drove a little faster around this bend, to find it completely vanished out of the sky.  We looked for it the whole way home, but we never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time we first spotted it, to the time it disappeared, it was only about 7-8 seconds.  I’ve never seen anything like that before and my friend and I would really like to figure out what we have just seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>
11/16/12 18:14|Greenville|PA|Unknown||Red/orange lights seen for about 4 minutes in Western Pennsylvania|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94526.html|316|ndxe201211| Red/orange lights seen for about 4 minutes in Western Pennsylvania<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half an hour ago, I was taking the dog out and looked at the west sky and noticed 2 bright orange/red dots about less than 2 inches away from each other ( if I were to stretch my hand and measure with my fingers, that is the distance I would get ).  The one on the top was slightly to the right in relation to the one on the bottom. They looked bright and big (size of Jupiter or slightly bigger) with a deep color of orange/red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they began to move from left to right slowly, I tried to get a better view through the branches of the trees in my yard which were partially blocking the view. I was curious to find out if they were planets but once they began to move I thought it could be a plane. But then, 2 planes one on top of the other didn’t make much of a sense to me. So I called my husband to come outside and look at these lights. He came out and looked but was too concern on stepping on dog poop outside. It is cold tonight in the 40’s. So he came inside and didn’t want to bother being cold. I was still curious to find out what it was as the 2 lights continued to move from left to right. All of a sudden I see then 3 lights. If I were to connect the dots they would form a triangle in the sky about 4 inches apart from each dot. The color of the dots were exactly the same color as the other 2 lights. As this happened, I ran inside to call a friend of mine so she could go out and look at the west sky ! to see if she could see the same lights. The 3 lights began to move from left to right and instead of 3 dots I could only see 2 kind of horizontal lights from each other moving again from right to left (west to southwest). It seemed like the lights would move and stop.  The one far left kept going while the one on the right stopped and dimmed to no light at all.  I moved my position down the driveway toward the south so I could keep an unobstructed view of these 2 objects.  The light on the right continues to move slowly and more dimmed but I still could see it. All of a sudden the light that had dimmed before came back on with a white brightness just like a flood light shinning down and immediately dimmed to no light again.  It seemed like this light had appeared for 2 seconds disappearing again completely.  It was very cold and since I had no jacket, I just noticed the light from the left continue to move southwest and getting dimmer and dimmer.  After I called the center to re! port this sighting, I went up to my husband’s room to ask if h! e did or did not see any light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me all he saw was one red light.<n>

It was extremely large (making venus look small in the sky) it moved in a rather fast clip across the sky toward the west and eventually changed directions and headed south, we lost track of it after that due to the tree line.  It had no sound at all and seemed to pulse, like an ember from a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time we have seen this exact same thing.

It was still dark, stars were out.   Out of the corner of my eye I caught movement and a light.  I looked up and some type of craft was passing in front of my line of sight.  It was a dark half-circle shape I believe and had an orange glow behind it across the entire back of the object.  The orange glow tailed out behind for a short distance and there seemed to be occasional sparks within the glow.    The object continued past moving to the southwest, maintaining a constant altitude which was fairly low in the sky.  Neither one of us heard any sound coming from the craft.  It seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed but was easy to follow across the sky until we lost it over the hill.  My friend’s initial thought was that it was a meteor, but I didn’t get that feeling at all.  It was maintaining a constant altitude and seemed to be banking slightly to the! Southwest.<n>

It was glowing orange in a cresent shape the size of my fist..void/dark behind the cresent shape then coming back together forming a orange trail. At first I thought it was an airplane with a bad engine. Then I thought it could be a very large asteroid. However it moved across the sky without desending,completely silent, taking about 2-3 minutes to cross the sky... horizon to horizon.<n>

The sky was mostly clear and many stars were visible, despite the bright lights of the city below. Listening quietly to a talk radio show while my husband drove, I gazed out the passenger side window of the car, not looking at anything specific, just mindlessly observing our surroundings. I then noticed ahead of us and slightly to the right of the highway a particularly bright object in the sky. Though, as I stated, many stars were visible, at a certain point they became drowned out by the lights of civilization. The object that I saw was well below this line. It was also significantly brighter and larger than any of the stars I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still staring curiously at the object, I asked my husband, “What is that?” and pointed to it. He responded that he had noticed it as well and was wondering the same thing. Upon more focused observation, I could discern that it was triangular in shape, and had red lights surrounding its yellow-orange center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be in a fixed position hovering over the earth, but as we drove towards its general direction, we seemed to be getting closer to it.  I watched it for about 10 more minutes from the car window, and it continued to stay in the same place. We parked in a parking lot to watch it without the car moving. Then suddenly it seemed to jump back into space slightly. I saw the movement and then noticed that it was smaller and dimmer, as if it had retreated. From then on it continued to stay in its new position, hovering without movement. I took several photos with my cellphone camera, and though not the greatest quality, in one of them you can clearly see its shape and the red lights around the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say I know for sure what it was. I just know that I saw something out of the ordinary and I have photos to prove it.<n>

At around 4AM, we witnessed an orange, elongated (it was longer than it was wide) object/light moving at an incredible rate of speed.  It was mostly fire orange in color but at the front/tip, it seemed a lighter orange or possibly whitish orange.  It seemed like a fast moving plane on fire when I first viewed it; but at closer glance realized it was not anything like that.  The object was to our West moving North to South at a constant speed and altitude.  There was no noise at all.   We had been seeing shooting stars all night and this object was nowhere near that kind of speed (buzzing across the entire skyline in 2 seconds).  However, it was moving fast enough that we were only able to view it for about 12 seconds before it was far enough away we could no longer see it.<n>

No, this was solid, and plain as day a UFO, could not have been anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 9-11 to report it...  I told the people i worked with i saw it (As soon as i got back to work at the restaurant,  worked nights) and i even asked a couple people on the street if they saw it.  9-11, the people on the street - no one saw or heard anything.  i felt like it was just me..<n> <n><n> <n><n> but,  A couple days later one person i told about it said that she saw someone else talking about it on facebook..  that made me feel a little better.  now recently, about 8 months later it&#39;s still on my mind,  so i looked up on this website UFO&#39;s seen in WV... and i saw the following posted:  &#34;5/30/13 23:30	Charleston	WV	Triangle	10 seconds	Blue Triangle over WV.	7/3/13&#34;  Now i know for sure i&#39;m not the only one.....  There&#39;s a blue, triangular UFO flying around, and it&#39;s as if the person flying it is able to turn it&#39;s light on and off..  because again, after seeing it for about 5 seconds, moving fast pace,  it just disappeared in the nights sky..<n>

There had been substantial contrail spraying about 4 PM over the West Hills and the front of the cloud bank had reached the Vancouver area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentally noted that and continued home to Portland, three miles from the airport.  As I stood in my parking lot, three F-15 fighters were scrambled from Kulis AFB on afterburner.  They formed up and flew over my head at pattern altitude, then headed towards the Vancouver mall.  My view was blocked by a building.  My friend that lives by the Vancouver mall reported seeing a large flash and heard a loud sonic boom about 9 pm.<n>

The backyard is about a half acre deep to a fence line which adjoins to a cow pasture.   It is about 50 - 75 feet before the tree line begins in the cow pasture.  Not a bird as it had no wings and was utterly silent.  It did not lose any altitude and was so dimly lit that it disappeared as soon as it passed over.  It seemed to have a very fine, thin trail at least 25+ ft that also dissolved into thin air.  Very eerie experience. I have never seen anything that substantial in size fly in such a straight pattern so quietly in the dark.<n>

Starting around dusk multiple sphere shaped objects moved into my neighborhood at the level just above the houses. It was clear and still those nights so these objects were clear,close, and unmistakable.  There was no wind so it was also completely silent early am as human activities slowed so all was audible. Also at 5:24 am on the 16th one cigar shaped object slowly drifted over causing another  witness  phone to freeze on this exact minute.	  These round orb like objects were glowing in a pulsating manor alternating red,blue. They more so drifted in slowly from the west in groups of anywhere from five to two and sometimes single. A group would move from west to east a certain distance then stop just hovering sometimes switching spots with each other in the group in a playful manor.  Then the next group would move to a different spot in the sky but would stop also at the same place the others stopped . After several groups did this over hours some groups continued on east going so far then stopping waiting for the next group ect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several stayed visible from my yard over the entirety of both nights.  Some were higher up than others looking more like stars yet making groups and playfully changing places with eachother in the group or seemingly playing tag moving nearer each other then backing up.  Some single orbs would slowly drift across the sky ten or twenty feet then stopping, or moving up and down.  Some were seen to &amp;quot;power up&amp;quot; getting increasingly bright till 5 times brighter than the moon then zooming straight up and to the right and would vanish.  Some groups would move into formations of triangles and once one triangle formation moved slowly to meet another triangle connecting to form two triangles that were a  mirror image of each other but one next to the other touching at one corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time they were closest to me i was watching in the yard with a friend. It was about five am on the 16th, clear sky and no wind or traffic. It was about 45 degrees outside or so.  Many orbs were lower to the ground seeming to be just above  the level of my garage and maybe ten feet ahead of us.  They would slowly move individually from west to east stopping randomly to hover. When they moved it resembeld how jellyfish move when they swim.  A light came from underneath as they went up in the jellyfish like movement.  The orb part was glowing in a pulsating manor red,blue.  They made no sound.  (A constant jet like sound remained in the distance the entirety of both nights)   At one point one seemed to move over right above my friends head maybe twenty feet up.  I noticed a feeling of overwhelming anxiety which was odd as at this point I has acclaimated to the situation at hand.  At 5:24 from the east moving west came a very large silver cigar shaped object  that also moved silently across the sky up as high as my two story house.  It moved at a steady pace slower than a plane but almost as fast. It had no wings or tail.  It seemed to be made of a seamless metal and a dim light was emitted as exhaust from the rear. It always kept an even altitude.  It just kept heading west till out of sight.  I was called in the am by my friend who awoke to find her cell phone was frozen at that exact time.  She had to remove the battery to get any response from the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the summer I had noticed some single orbs moving in funny ways and odd glowing stars as well as the constant jet like noise on many occasions so now i am always looking up.

The sky was pretty black/clear.  I’ve never seen anything like it before. I drove back over to the area where we witnessed it and it was not there, nor did it reappear.  I don’t know if there is any type of aircraft that could possibly have that configuration of neon blue lighting.  If you were to outline the lighting it would form a perfect rectangle.  It could also have been 4 separate hovering UFO’s, but they were spaced too perfect, all 4 lights were equally spaced apart from each other.  There was no sound.<n>

It was lower than the cloud that was directly over head also. It is hard to guess at the size and speed with nothing to compare it to but I think it was twice or maybe three times the size of a jumbo jet and it was moving very fast.  I decided as I saw it coming to not try to use my phone cam or run to get a cam, I decided to observe the best I could and it passed so close that I got a really good look at it.  The flickering of the orange light seemed to appear as a distortion of some kind, not fire, and I could see a structure inside. I could not see the structure well but I very well saw straight lines of a structure, a few straight lines parallel to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perfectly round as it appeared round coming towards me, above me, and leaving me. I can only guess, but I think the flickering is a time or space distortion and perhaps that is its propulsion system. It made absolutely no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were lined up too close and moving too slow to be incoming airplanes, they almost seemed to be hovering very low above downtown Vancouver, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached our freeway on ramp,the biggest craft went over the top of us and was literally less than 100 yards directly south of the Driver side window, we were able to watch as it passed over the front/ top of us and lowered almost to ground level.  It was very big triangle shaped, as it lowered it seemed to be slowly rotating, so we saw the underside of it.  It was grey, metallic looking almost liquid.    The light configuration was strange, there were several very bright lights that seemed to run along the bottom with brighter bigger lights on the corners of the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other similar objects in the sky immediately in front of us, we were on the freeway and had to turn and head north and the sky is not visible from where we are in Vancouver.<n>

We were outside and noticed movement in the sky, at least 15 orbs of light were going in and out of the clouds &#34;playing.&#34;  It&#39;s an amazing sight!  We thought at first they may be a spot light of some sort but the orbs did not make routine movements they flitted here and there in all different directions and moving around each other.  Unfortunately our video camera was not with us, I would love to share this with everyone.<n>

I saw what I thought was  a bright star on the horizon as the morning sky was still dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the star became larger and I realized that I was looking at a spot light coming towards me.  It was right above the tree line.  Then it was hovering above my neighbor&#39;s house as I drove by slowly.  I could see colored lights in a cluster at the top and white lights at three corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I thought it was a helicopter but there was NO SOUND and the trees were not moving.  It scared me so I hit the gas and took off down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the end of the road I looked back and saw a large glowing red orb on the ground in the woods.  I called back to my husband at home and told him there had been a plane crash.

But it was not a helicopter and planes do not hover.  Neither are silent.<n>

This oval bright light was moving within a set of parrallel clouds in the south.  There was no other lights source eminating from any other direction of the ground or the sky.  That morning the sky was clear and calm. i was facing south the direction to Matamoros, Mexico.  It was a radiant light enough to penetrate the set of white clouds that was their.

I wanted to call someone and tell someone about it but for fear of being called crazy.  The good thing is that he can testify to the event as well.

Since oct 19th or so during haileys comets dust trails..(shooting stars).  I happened to be able (along with many others i&#39;m sure) to witness that event.  So since then i&#39;ve been tuned in more to whats above us...so I started bringing out the ole telescope, pad, pen &amp; digital video camera....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The setting of which my &#34;claim&#34; took place is a balcony on the top (3rd) floor...On any clear night you&#39;ll see the moon &amp; stars with no problem....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve also taken in the consideration of that this location is near a amry/airforce base which has plenty of air traffic along with the normal planes you see as well.., also took in consideration of the fact that the Leonid meteor shower is roughly from nov 13-21 peaking around the 19th/20th I reckon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened was, I was out on the balcony with my camera &amp; notepad same as almost every night checking out the stars as usual ..Then I see what appears to be a star but it dissapears a second later it flashed again but in a different spot this went on for almost a minute then I grabbed my HDcamcorder...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which took a few seconds to focus on the sky but, I see no &amp;quot;blink&amp;quot; Bout 17 seconds into the video I look down at the porch (balcony floor) to make sure the camera was working ok. As I aim back towards the sky It flashes again  multiple times..I lost sight with the camera bout 23 seconds later...it finally blinked, then it was higher blinked again even higher ..as I back against the railing around the balcony watching this &#34;ufo&#34; I see it&#39;s very high now .(normally in this area the military planes are very low)  It continued this same pattern across the sky..then vanished......The pattern of this &#34;ufo&#34;..which appeared to be in guise of a star..moved in directions unlike any thing i have ever seen when i re-watch the footage it sends chills....in a good but eerie way....I waited exactly a month to report this...(except to some people I know)  Its a sad day dec_14th due to the conn. school shooting ..was weird to me is its a month later from this &#39;thing &amp;quot; I saw......<n> <n><n> <n><n> So hopefully I&#39;m able to send the footage your way or who evers...&amp; hopefully it gets analyzed..so I know something...Because I truly believe it was other worldly..either way ..I just want the piece of mind.…<n>

I was headed east when I noticed what appeared to be a very low flying airplane in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is McGhee Tyson airport about 8 miles to the southwest, so I didn&#39;t, at that moment, think it was out of the ordinary, except for the altitude it was at.  For the next 45 seconds I had a clear view of this craft. I kept waiting for it to pull away and gain altitude, but as I got closer, I realized that I was gaining on it.  I slowed down as I got closer and realized that it was hovering about what appeared to be 400 feet above the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had two white lights on either side of what I first thought were the wings, with a red light blinking in the center.  As I got closer and closer, now only going maybe 20 miles an hour I had a totally clear view of this craft.  As I drove under it, only then was I able to see that it had an oval or rounded shape to the underside of it.  I really wanted to pull over, get out and observe this craft, but I was just a little freaked by the whole experience.  As I drove away I kept looking in my rear view mirror, but never saw the lights or craft again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to think that it was a plane or helicopter, as it was hovering, but I know of no plane that can do that and I&#39;ve seen too many &#39;copters and it made no noise that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact location was on Westland Drive right across from A.L. Lotts Elementary school.<n>
11/14/12 22:00|England|AR|Triangle|5-7 minutes|Large black, triangular shaped aircraft with many bright white lights hovering over rural area along Hwy 161.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94473.html|358|ndxe201211| Large black, triangular shaped aircraft with many bright white lights hovering over rural area along Hwy 161.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the back door to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and noticed a large bright set of white lights with red and green lights hovering beyond a tree break about a half mile from the house. This sparked my attention because I saw the same bright lights around the same day of the week and time of night last week.  I watched it hover for a long time and thought it could have been a helicopter because of how it was hovering and how low it was.  I stepped outside to see if I could hear it because if it was a helicopter, you would have definitely been able to hear it because it was so close.  I can make the helicopter sound comparison because of an aerial search conducted recently for an escaped convict from a local prison in which helicopters were used to search in our area.  The aircraft didn’t sound anything like the helicopter I heard several weeks ago and as a matter of fact, didn’t have a sound at all until it was flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, the aircraft began slowly moving closer and eventually flew directly over our house and was so low I could see it was a triangle shaped aircraft with lots of bright white lights and a green and red light.  If the aircraft had been a plane, you would have definitely been able to hear it as it was so low and so close but I couldn’t hear anything but what sounded like a plane that was flying at a high altitude, miles and miles above.  Once it flew over, I didn’t see anything else but will be looking from now on for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a middle class working mother of one who works in a physician’s office and is educated.  I don’t use drugs and was not under the influence of medication or alcohol at the time of the sighting.  I have seen this object twice now and can’t deny what I saw was not like any aircraft I have ever seen even at all the airshows I went to as a child.<n>

The lights &#34;disappeared&#34; on the southern end of the object, and &#34;appeared&#34; on the northern end of the object.  With each single light, it appeared to rotate in a clockwise rotation, held steady in the sky, and did not hear any sound.  There did not appear to be any other aircraft in the surrounding area in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reading Utah reports, the report submitted for 08/15/2012 @ 07:30 in Tooele reads exactly also like what I witnessed.

We are stopped and we are just staring at it and it&#39;s so big and bright and not moving.  There is no way it could be a plane.  So we are looking at it trying to figure out what it is and then all of a sudden the little lights behind the big ball of fire just turn off one by one and then it just disappears.   We tried to search for what we saw in the sky but we couldnt find it again.  It was so big I want to know if anyone else saw what we saw or can explain it.<n>

I first noticed the string of approximately 8 rectangular objects in a line traveling northbound towards the Salt Lake City Airport just faster than a plane would have traveled on approach, which still appeared slow.  Together they formed a line approximately 2 - 3 times the length of an airplane in the sky, and as thick as two airplanes stacked on top of each other. They appeared to be a little bit higher in the sky than the approaching planes.  The objects were very close to each other, but had a distinctly dividing black line between each light.  Each rectangular object shined dimly in red light.  I alerted my friend and asked &amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot;.  He noticed it and we both watched it travel from south to north for about 10 - 15 seconds.  Then, the first in the line went out followed closely by the second then the third a! ll the way back to the end of the line.  The manner in which they turned off made the string appear to dissolve away.<n>

It was alternating this shape with the saucer-like with a couple or three bright lights.  It was not windy, so it was not an airplane on a stall position.  I observed it for about 5 minutes outside.

I saw lights in a triangle shape three with red blinking and two green/blue in the same area as the red.  It moved very slowly Westward.  The droning was constant and very loud.

I walk there pretty much everyday of the week, usually within 18:00 and 24:00 and I walk about 3.8 km.  Today, I decided to have my walk right after dinner, so I left home at about 19:10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about a third of the way I look up ( meaning above the horizon line ) straight ahead of me and I noticed between a street lamp post and wires crossing the street a circular bright light ( very bright, like a powerfull del light ) the object remained motionless for less than half a second and then moved left at a speed that no aircraft nor anything else could reach and vanished completely not to be seen again, there was no sound emitted and i could make out any shape other than the round light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a skeptic of the stories of flying saucers and green almond eyed aliens seen in movies, but what I saw here is no mistaking, unexplainable.

Nov 14th at approximately 6:45 PM I witnessed some unusual lights in the sky.  I assumed they were stars that were very bright and very low.  They were awesome I noticed it was a clear evening with small patches of fog.  Where it was clear it was very clear.  There were about half a dozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was odd, this time of year, but never assumed it to be anything other than stars, that were low in the sky and very bright.  That was until I read in the newspaper on Nov 16th, that people who were closer to them, saw what they think were strange lights.  This makes more sense now, as the “stars” I saw were more orange in color than yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite sure of my time since I received a cell phone call a few minutes later. So I cannot say what it is I saw, only that I do confirm there were orange lights in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a solid white/orb flying pass at low altitudes coming from northwest to southeast very casually then disappeared.  This ufo was passing the skies like if it was in a hurry but moving casually and smooth.  I knew it wasnt a plane or balloon because it was just a white solid glowing object moving pretty quickly without making any type of noise.  I was amazed to see something like this again because this wasn&#39;t the first time i see this object passing by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are a couple links to my sighting. the raw footage is:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/JIHgMiYQRJc<n> <n><n> <n><n> Analyzed pics are:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4974201795555.2186283.1314614467&amp;type=1&amp;l=bfafbcc4ea<n>

Looking back along the side our house and and through part of a neighbor&#39;s tree in the back which had few leaves on it, we both noticed two roundish, perfectly-fixed, large orange/amber lights in the sky. The lights were in a southerly direction behind our house, and positioned at about a 45 degree angle, a good distance apart.  They looked nothing like airplanes and were (4-5x) bigger than stars, almost the size of the street lights we have on the poles here but more orange.  The light from the objects were not surrounded by a container as were the street lights. It was purer and steadier.  NO pulsing or twinkling of any type was noticed.  Their size, color and smooth output made them highly unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were so peculiar, as I stopped the car I immediately jumped out and ran to the back of the house to try to get a better look.  I got to the left-side of our swing set and could see the highest light, but the lower light  to the right was partially blocked by an evergreen tree in another neighbor&#39;s yard behind us.  I moved around to the other side of the swing set to see them better.  I had the impression the two lights may have drifted _very_ slightly to the right, but observed they had kept that same, exact 45 degree angle and distance apart, as though they were connected together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that time, a plane flew underneath what I was watching. I could see the plane and its blinking lights clearly.  It in no-way resembled the orange lights.  Nothing on it was even close to the same color or size, and the lights I was watching appeared further away than that plane.  Additionally, those lights were _much_ larger than anything flashing on the plane or any of the stars in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that the lights disappeared and my wife and I went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out a minute later to take another look, walked around the outside of the house, but they were still gone.<n>

I have never seen anything like it and it totally freaked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to get a picture with a cell phone but could not get a clear one since we were driving. I know we were not the only ones who saw it, tons of cars on the road.  My 35 year old son and I were coming from his doctor appointment headed towards KFC for dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know we are both sane but as I said before it freaked me out and I wonder what they were, there were so many of them.   At first I thought maybe something entering our world and burning out before hitting the ground like a meteorite or space junk.<n>

I left Woodbridge NJ at 5:10 pm and headed south.    Just past exit 98 (Allenwood/Belmar/Pt Pleasant/Wall) exit I saw what appeared to be a plane in the distance.   As it came closer, I saw it had a bright white light and a royal blue light.  It flew right over my car, triangular in shape, silent.   It was closer than any plane could fly to the road.   It was slow, then as it came over towards my car I could see the lights underneath glowing in a rainbow sequence.   It was definitely a triangle.  Never saw anyting like this before.  I was driving so I was not able to take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People drivng were stepping on their brakes so I can not be the only person who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden, my boyfriend tells me to look up; I do and see an almost meteorite object drifting quickly through the sky.  The object was traveling just as fast as a meteorite, only it lasted much to long, and was almost zooming by.  The object it&#39;s self seemed to be round in appearance, and was darker than the dusk sky.  My boyfriend says there were red bits peeling off and trailing behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later, there was a numerous amount of planes circling the area, almost as if searching for the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a strong believer in the paranormal, although my boyfriend is much more logical.  Even he can&#39;t come up with a logical explanation, and, although hesitantly, agreed it was a UFO.<n>

They had an orange glow and were organized as to how they maved across the sky. It took 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  We were at a festival that night and everyone that saw this was amazed.  There were thousands of people at the fair and with all the confusion of a fair people may have missed it but I&#39;m pretty sure lots of the people saw this and just don&#39;t know how to report it.<n>

I then looked toward the North and almost directly above me and seen a very bright light shining through the clouds and moving very slowly to the East in a direct flight path.  While viewing this object it also seemed to elluminate a small portion of the cloud making an aura around it.  This told me that if it was not in the cloud it was very close to the top of the cloud close enough to make the object to appear larger.  The approximate time was 5:45 a.m. because I did not have my watch on or my phone with me and when I came back inside the time was 5:48 on my phone.  I had to have viewed this object for a little over 2 minutes until I could no longer see it.  This was not an airplane because the light remained visible from viewing the front as it came toward my location and remained bright as it p! assed my location then dimmed out from thickness of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My phone is currently not active this month but available through email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And at around 5:00 am I rolled over on the couch to see if the sun was up yet. I opened the blinds, and it was still very dark, that’s when I noticed a stationary red pulsating light over the neighbor’s apartment.  I continued to watch the light for about 2-3 minutes it would flash 9 times red then 1 time white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the light I noticed another red light seemingly to come from nowhere fly directly underneath the original red light.  I continued to watch the lights for about another minute, that’s when the second light to arrive shot off to my left over my roof, and out of sight.  I knew at that time that this was not a helicopter.  However I was still not sure of what I was seeing, the original red light was still there so I went outside on my doorstep to see if I could hear anything.  There was no sound.  It was completely still in the sky very bright, and very silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside and continued to watch the fla! shing light 9 red 1 white.  For some stupid reason I became a little anxious, I thought to myself, what if this thing is watching me watching it.  I have heard of UFO sightings being questionable, explainable, and somewhat brief.  I have never been a believer, nor have I ever had an interest in UFO’s or alien’s, until now.  I do not know what I saw, but I know what I saw and I do not believe it was anything man made.  I watched this UFO for a solid 8 minutes before it literally shot off to my right in the opposite direction as the second UFO, over the neighbors apartment and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I paced back and fourth in my apartment trying to make sense of what I had witnessed trying to compare memories of what I have seen prior to in the sky.  Nothing matched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a frequent flyer between here and the U.K  I know what planes look like at night time from the ground and in the air, I have seen many helicopters in the sky, this was neither of them.  I went onto the internet and searched what I had seen and to my surprise there are many similar sightings thank god, because for a minute there I started to doubt myself, but to deny myself what I had seen would just be a lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I witnessed on 11/14/2012 at 5 am and I feel very privileged, even if my friends and family don’t believe me, I do not care.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I however on the other hand am now a believer, and I truly hope that this wont be my last sighting because the unexplainable is truly awesome!<n>

We then head back towards home after and we see blinking white lights in the sky, and they then stopped blinking and it&#39;s just a bright star looking objects moving in a pattern in the same direction we saw many many more that did the exact same thing.

Above the building and off in the distance I saw a large object flying overhead.  All I could make out was seven lights forming a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving a little slower than the airplanes that I am accustomed to seeing.  The object moved in complete silence.  I followed the object through the sky until the parking lot lights made it impossible to see the object anymore.  The whole encounter lasted about one minute<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving in the building and discussing this with other employees I learned I was not the only one who saw something strange.  A co worker of mine said he saw what looked like two shooting stars chasing each other.   Another said he could here jets flying overhead but saw nothing.<n>

I saw a triangle silently moving across the tree line above my house.  Three white lights on each corner were continuously lit up with a pulsing red light directly in the middle of the 3 white lights. I have an iphone video of the event but only star light shows with our voices captured in the back ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved east to west then turn slowly toward the south west until I lost sight of it.  A few minutes later what looked like a medical helicopter flew in what looked like the opposite direction of where this silent triangle craft was moving.  The helicopter was visible and very loud unlike the triangle which was silent.<n>

My stepson was with me carrying one of the garbage bags.  We walked to the disposal bin and looked across the sky - to the east, we see 3 bright lights in a broken line - they hover in the sky for about 10 minutes.  My stepson filmed these first lights with his mobile phone.  As they faded, I ran back to the apartment to get my camera.  When I came back there two of the lights remained, after about a couple of minutes another light appeared again with them, this time together they all formed a huge triangle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both myself and my stepson filmed this.  After about 10 minutes filming the lights faded out and you could make them out faintly as they moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both me and my stepson then ran back indoors to grab our coats, and warm clothes, and I got my tripod.  We went back out.  We waited until about 10 pm when one light appeared, it hovered in place for quite a while, then a second light appeared, and after that a third, again forming the same triangle formation as before.  It was amazing to see, they stayed like that for about 10 mins, and we both captured it on film again.  The lights were more of an orange light.  Then as one of the lights faded out, I saw a very bright white light to the far right of the remaining two.  Also on film.  Then after a short while that started to moved away.  The lights then all gradually faded out and moved westwards. We sat outside until 10:30pm but no more appeared so we went back indoors as it was bitterly cold.  The distance of them is hard to say, but Dyes Inlet is between where we are and where these lights are appearing, so they could be above the body of water, or above the properties on the other side of the inlet.  We see these lights often and still have no idea what they could be.  We see lots of planes, but they look very different.  There is no sound that we can hear.  We are going to go out tonight! to see if anything appears again.<n>

We have lived  within close proximity to an airport for over 25+ years and are very familiar with planes ascending and descending regularly.   We know the color lights, the sounds and the approximate height of planes within our town.  My first initial reaction was-why are those 3 plane flying so closely together?  And then it was brought to my attention that they weren&#39;t planes &amp; that&#39;s when I noticed the color of the lights, the shape &amp; the distance.  The night was clear with no visible clouds.  Minimal stars were observed.<n>

My first thought was, They, a satellite!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved over the tree line and after crossing a side street it decelerated very rapidly.

I called attention to it because it looked as if a plane were on fire in the air but had none of the colored directional lights typically seen on aircraft at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved relatively slowly to the South and the &#34;fire&#34; seemed to grow and then get smaller while flying through the air (just like a fire would in a fireplace).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not make out any kind of shape for the flying object, but there was definitely fire.  We heard no sound accompanying this craft. After about 30 seconds, the object seemed to disappear or just fly out of sight.

At times the lights would form loose triangles, then slowly move from side to side, going in and out of brightness.  I got some binoculars and looked at them.  They looked like bright orange lights.  I looked towards Boulder and saw 3 more, they held position for a while then started to move horizontally with the horizon.  I have been at this location for 7 years and am use to watching planes in the sky, and watch the sky quite often.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The lights were not too high from the horizon, 1000ft at the most.  There was a huge amount of air traffic also occurring during this time from the local small airport.  I went inside for a half hour then went back o! ut and they were still doing the same thing.  This all occurred over about 2 hours. I took a video with my phone, but it was very poor quality.<n>

I stopped to watch it and then I saw several more orange balls gliding from the north looking as if they were following each other.  Then several more came so I ran inside for my camera.  I took some pictures but they don’t do what I saw justice.  It looked like someone was tossing these balls into the atmosphere because they just gliding by, not far from the tree tops, and made no noise.  They were beautiful and I stood there in amazement watching them.  I can’t explain what they are but I know what I saw.  They were following each other sometimes just one and sometimes in a group of three.

I watched it through my 10x50 wide angle binoculars and could not see any flashing colored lights like commercial aircraft have.  The sighting lasted about 60-70 seconds and never deviated from it’s course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third time I’ve seen this in the last three years from my back yard. Always the same description, position, heading and speed. (On one other occasion, that my 9 year old daughter pointed out to me from our back yard, the object looked like a blueish-green light circulating counter clockwise, like it was in a circular flourescent bulb, at the same position, speed and heading as the three bright white orb sightings).  Afterwards I immediately checked the real-time ISS position but it was over Europe so it was not that, also it does not follow a direct straight west to east direction.  It had the brightness and was as large as Jupiter or Venus would appear but only moving much faster.  BTW Washington DC is directly east of me and many military bases are directly west of me, not that this has any known correlation.<n>

It was Orange in color and was very bright, we were in awe of its size and brightness.  As we were looking and trying to determine what it was it started to move very slowly and take a triangle shape with twinkling lights on each point of the triangle, the lights were almost pulsating.  The craft kept moving in a very slow, linear path that looked like it was coming directly towards us.  It passed just to our right and was only 1,500-2,000 feet in the air, as it came closer we quickly determined it wasn&#39;t any airplane or helicopter because it made no sound.  When the craft passed us we noticed 3 more with identicle shapes appear, they were also moving slowly and had the same linear path just spaced further apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the other crafts as they moved closer we noticed one craft that was almost directly infront of us drop a small, light-like object to the ground.  My friend and I were already kinda freaked out about seeing these objects and became almost scared when we saw one drop something to the ground.  These crafts continued their straight, slow paths and when they passed they just sorta disappeared.  We drive for another 5-10 minutes before arriving at our destination, when we arrived we continued to look in the eastern sky where these crafts were coming from and ended up seeing three more that went right over our heads.  We got very good looks at the ones that went right over our heads, they were definitely large black triangles with lights on each point and a few lights in the middle and along the edges.  They were moving very slow and had no sound until they were just past us, then we heard a very light propulsion-like engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these objects basically just appeared and were all uniform in size, shape, and color, but their lights differed in slight color and patterns of the pulsations.  My friend and I are just a couple regular, football loving, family guys and neither one of us have ever seen anything that compares to what we saw this night.  After seeing these objects we tried to come up with logical explanations as to what these things were and we came up with nothing.  Neither of us are aviation experts, but due to the size, altitude, sound, and light configurations we were both very confident these objects were not planes or helicopters or weather ballons.<n>

It resembles a shape of a cross. The location is roughly above Fraser River.  The area is near YVR airport.  Many aircrafts pass by this neighbourhood at all times.  But nothing like that shape and colour.  I told my kid of 17 years of age to look up.  As we stared at the mysterious bright pink light it suddenly dropped rapidly.  It was falling so quick we thought it would crash.  Then as we looked the light just vanished right in front of our eyes in the thin quiet sky.  The whole sighting was about 20-30 seconds.  Not enough time to grab a phone to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I grabbed the binoculars I seen something that was blinking green...red...orange...then repeats.  I don&#39;t know what that was but then 5 mins later a gold, yellowish ball shot out randomly from the sky and went next to what we thought was a UFO blinking green red and orange...it sat next to it for about 5 seconds then started coming over towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it came over my house I looked through the binoculars...I saw a circular object!   A green light on the front, a red light on the back and one green light on both sides of the object...then we ran to the front to see and it was too far away.  I got a picture but its too small.  My dad and sister thought it was a plane...but before that happened two planes flew over us and I know what a plane looks like.  This was a ball of a bold gold/yellowish light and it was pretty big...  And a plane doesn&#39;t stop in the air...it happen to stop rig! ht by what we thought was already a UFO...then when it took off the gold/yellow light was turned off and green and red lights were seen then.  And I don&#39;t know if those planes I saw were after the object because they were going the opposite direction but the planes came around 2 minutes before the ball of light<n>

I work in the oil field and smoke behind my sleeping quarters and scan the sky.  I first observed the object at about 90 degrees to the horizon, so pretty much straight above my head.. the object generally flew north and then north east..  What is particularly odd about the object is that its flight path is not a straight line the is a wobble to the path back and forth.. think of a rope stretched tight and you flick one end.. the flight path reassembles the osculation of the rope, this can not be a conventional plane .. there is no flashing light just blue to bluish white… looks just like a moving star..  not much wind at ground level.. the object appears to be very high in the sky…<n>

It didn&#39;t appear to move toward the horizon, just simply away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved it passed in front of some stars.  It didn&#39;t block them out but they were not clearly visible either.  Instead the star light seemed disrupted as it passed over them, like looking through moving water.

The light seemed to be about 500 feet away from our house, located behind my neighbor’s house.  They both immediately called my father and me. My dad was on the phone so I went to go look at the light from my brother’s bedroom window.  The light seemed to be stationary at first; however it slowly started moving to the north.  We called my father and he watched it with us for roughly two to three minutes.  The light again started moving a little further north for another minute.  Then it began to rise rather quickly. It seemed to be about 60 to 80 feet in the air.  Then it seemed that the light started to get bigger; however it began moving to the west, towards us.  It traveled extremely fast, crossing about 500 feet in a matter of 10 seconds.  As it traveled it produced an extremely loud humming sound.  As it approached our location the bright light seemed to die out! . It crossed in between mine and my neighbor’s house, so to get a better look I ran to the other bedroom down the hallway.  Once I got to the window I looked and seen that it was some sort of aircraft.  The aircraft seemed to be like a cross, with a triangular front.  It seemed to be about 30 feet long, and 15 feet wide.  The sides of the aircraft seemed to be very straight with a point at the end.  It had two antenna-like lights coming off the front end of it and another antenna-like light at the tail end of it.  The antennas were about 7 feet long with a diamond shape light at the end and the lights all a very bright red. At the front of the aircraft, there seemed to be some sort of headlights.  They were dim, but I was still able to notice them quite easily.  There were no lights on the sides of the craft. As the aircraft passed, the bright light it emitted turned on again.  It seemed to be almost like some sort of searchlight and was located behind the headlights.  As the aircraf! t kept traveling west, it just vanished. Almost like a quick f! ade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do understand that it is a possibility that it could have been airplane of some sort, however there are a few airports only several miles away from where I live so I see many planes flying by all the time and never experienced any behaving in this fashion with such a bright light or moving with so much noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPDATE: at 12:35 am ET, I heard the loud humming noise once again except I wasn’t able to locate the aircraft or where the sound was coming from. The noise lasted for about 35 seconds and seemed to be moving from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother took several photos of the aircraft and a video; however, it’s a small dot in the pictures and video. Although, you can see how bright the light is compared to the light my neighbor has on the side of his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S., the gentleman who answered the phone when I called was extremely rude.<n>

It was moving NNW and appeared to be in between RD Mize and HWY 7 in blue springs.  Saw it out my window, then ran around out on the porch to see if maybe it was just a blackhawk helicopter and it was silent, very large, and low for a jet, if it was it would be comparable to a Jumbo Jet in size.  Shape was vague but cigarish, possibly domed or thicker in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were going really fast flying in a straight line south never changing direction.  They seemed to be racing.  There was no sound of there engines.  I could hear a nearby helicopter but nothing from these 2.  I have never seen anything like it.  The only thing that I can come up with is two stealth bombers flying together.<n>

The following day she called me to know if I had seen anything strange. In my driveway I found a multitude of single line tracks in the gravel of my yard some of which came right up to my house.  We checked with our other neighbors and found that in total 5 households within a 1/2 mile had been &amp;quot;visited&amp;quot; by the same single tracked entity.  I called to find out if someone had surveyed our area recently but there are no human foot prints associated with the straight line tracks we have observed  (Some of these are in soft dirt and snow and there are no associated prints or tread marks within the tracks) which resemble a heavy ball rolling up and down hill.  These tracks are very smooth and some enter very small areas ( between fence posts and under downspouts) and move with precision.  We have pictures and maps of all the tracks we could find.<n>

It had white lights at various points.  When I looked closer, I noticed that it could not be an airplane or a helicopter based on its shape and the locations of the lights.  The craft got closer and lower and I pulled into Ashley Square complex to get a better look and let my son and nephew view the object.   We got out of the vehicle as the object slowed to a stopped momentarily just above the adjacent building.  The object then changed direction and flew north towards the hospital and disappeared.  The object did not make any engine noise, however it did make a slight windy noise as it picked up speed and flew away.  The object appeared to be a diamond or square shape with two levels of lights.<n>

Might have been lights, if so they were not bright, but dimmed down.  No sound. No blinking lights. And moved across the sky in a straight line quite fast and effortless.  Nothing I&#39;d ever seen.

However, there was no noise associated with the lights.  The formation of lights behaved analogously to a flock of birds in the sky.  Initially the formation was extremely tightly packed together near the ocean&#39;s surface.  The lights moved very fluently and had floating like motions in which the lights had the ability to move smoothly in all directions(up, down, right, left, etc.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights began to spread out in a purposeful way with a triangular formation of three lights in the center (near the rear of fleet) remaining close together in that small triangle shape.  The lights were moving outward towards the open pacific ocean from the bay.  The lights that spread the furthest and were closer to the direction towards open ocean disappeared 1st then the rest sequentially disappeared, but almost simultaneously.  The light that was the closest to the oceans surface was the last to disappear but only by a small fraction.<n>

I stopped my vehicle to get better view through tree branches. The object moved at a deliberate pace along a flight path nearly due south.  As it passed overhead, it appeared to be a slowly roiling ball of orange flame, however showed no disturbance from surrounding air, no streaking, no trail, and no discernible noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to observe signs of craft disintegration due to inflight emergency, but no debris or disturbance of flight path was visible.  Duration of the observation was no more than 3 minutes from the appearance at 40 degrees above the N horizon to 30 degrees above S horizon when the object flashed off and on 2-3 times before disappearing from view.  As remarkable as this sight was, the relatively undramatic speed and straight path made the appearance seem relatively mundane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was raised in the approach path of a civil airport and have lived for 18 yrs. within ½ mile of the local airbase , and am quite familiar with the appearance of all manner of civilian, commercial and military craft in nearly all conditions; this one, despite the lackadaisical pace, was unique in my experience.<n>

I thought it was too large to be a 747 and that it wasn&#39;t moving. I had to take the Lansdowne Blvd. exit within about 30 seconds of spotting the object and when I searched again after getting off the exit, I couldn&#39;t see it due to the trees and buildings blocking that area. I was able to grab my camera and take a photo at full zoom. I&#39;m sure with some analysis it can be determined if it is a 747.  The only alternatives I can think of are a blimp or balloon, though in my own mind, I don&#39;t think so.It was gray, shiny and metallic looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyome else saw this, I&#39;d love to know.I&#39;ll look for more posts.<n>

11/10/12 23:45|Creswell|OR|Circle|3-4 minutes|Very bright lights like an airplane, but went dark and saw a round, gray object at a high altitude.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94423.html|473|ndxe201211| Very bright lights like an airplane, but went dark and saw a round, gray object at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object seen on Saturday, November 10, 2012 at approximately 11:45 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had just returned from watching a football game locally.  We pulled up in front of our house. (suburban neighborhood) and I noticed very bright lights to the south.  Since we have a small airport here in town (behind me and on the other side of a freeway to my east) I assumed it was a low flying airplane making an approach to land. I walked my wife to the door and turned to look at the lights again.  I realized that there were no red and green lights as required and the lights seemed brighter than a small plane. So I assumed maybe it was a commercial airliner making its approach into Eugenes regional airport to my northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to stop its forward motion.  I ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars.  When I came out and looked at the object, it almost appeared that instead of what I thought were lights, almost looked like it was on fire.  Flickering but I saw no smoke or vapor trail.  (Maybe the atmosphere causing the lights to appear to be flickering) It was then I realized that the object was not an altitude for a plane making an approach locally, but at what I would estimate to be at least 30,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed jetliners flying over my town at high altitudes with my binoculars, high enough to produce a vapor trail.  And I could see that it was a plane with wings and lights etc…so I felt confident estimating the objects altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights all of a sudden went dark. I pulled the binoculars down straining to catch a glimpse of the craft with the naked eye.  And that’s when I saw a faint, gray object, traveling about the speed of a satellite orbiting earth.  I found it with my binoculars again.  It was at a very high altitude, no lights, no smoke or vapor trail.  Grey, round, not like a ball but like a disk from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object in my binoculars for at least another minute or two as it headed north, and finally disappeared behind some clouds and my roofline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a local news station the next day to ask if anyone else had reported strange lights, but no one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my dad the next morning. He is retired from Boeing and once held his pilots license. I asked him if what I saw could have been a weather balloon, but he said they don’t have lights (especially that bright) and wouldn’t have been traveling at the rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly don’t know what I saw that night, but it was not normal.<n>
11/10/12 23:30|Hamilton|OH|Triangle|~4 minutes|Navy triangle over my house|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94560.html|474|ndxe201211| Navy triangle over my house<n> <n><n> <n><n> my wife and I were sitting on our upper deck and sighted a glowing plasma ball come from the south and flew off in a westerdly direction. after she went to bed I stayed up and was laying on the poorch carpent and begahearing a jet engine sound coming from the south. Standing up and looking over the annex&#39;s roof I saw a flat darkened object coming at me from the direction of our county airport. I thought to myself, &amp;quot;the FFA is going to pull this guy&#39;s licence&amp;quot;. The craft was no more than 100 feet off of the ground heading straight at me. As it got closer I noticed no tail on the craft and sounded as if it only had one jet engine. In front of it were what appeared to be two huge white lights projectinting out in front of it.  As it came closer it began to fly over the other side of the street on which I live and the detail was remarkable.  The craft was triangle shaped and painted in standard navy gloss grey top with creamey white belly. It was absolutely cleane no dirt streaks or oil on it.  What appeared to be a weapons bay was open and ran most of the full length of the craft.  There was no cockpit so was a remotely steered craft.  No markings of any kind could be seen but the weapons bay was lit up and you could see ribbing? and tubes for electrical or hydraulics inside.  The amazing thing was it&#39;s speed it was moving about the speed of a man fast walking.  A standard airfoil would not keep this craft up. Since it was running flat at very low speed the only thing floating it was probably a single gas jet generator pruducing some form of ionized, capacitive lift.  It was about the size of a large single engine private plane up to a private twin.the tail terminated in what appeared to be flaps that were set neutral   and again gave no assist in lift. most likely this is deriviant of the Bifield Brown lifting concept. It continued on in a wright Pat direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It came towards my house from the southwest moving very slowly.  It was as bright as a street light but high up in the sky, though much lower than any airplane.  It had the color of fire and seemed round, though as it got closer it seemed to have two smaller lights on either side of it.  As it got closer to my house, about the time it was over the high school which is a block away, it made a sharp, quick turn to the east and shot off very fast in that direction.  When it was shooting away I noticed that the three lights were one solid object with strobing white lights on the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.

It was around 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I step outside and look up I see many stars and I’m awestruck by how beautiful they were and I’m just gazing at all the night sky trying to find constellations, and as I look behind me I see a bluish glowing light in between the trees and I try to focus more on it and it reacts as if it noticed I had spotted it so it sort of jerked up and made a beeping noise and the twinkling lights on the bottom flashed and it descended into the air and it was a pillar shape about 3 feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment my brother was coming towards me to tell me something and I told him to look up, and at that moment it zipped away 100 feet in about a second. It was impossibly fast, and at the edge of the sky it seemed to flash and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately asked my brother if he had also seen what I had just seen and we were both very confused to what we had just seen.  So we went inside and tried to figure it out but eventually concluded it was an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Tamapais (from a westerly direction).  It was too low to be a plane, so I ran outside to the front yard, and looked up the street towards the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I saw at least 5 more of the same craft, slowly hovering, moving East, over the valley where we live. More appeared over the course of the next 5 minutes.  They were in formation, moving towards us, like they would land soon in the street in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors were also outside observing the lights. They were noiseless, moved always in formation, and in the next 5 minutes, seemed to move South, and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband used binoculars, and said they looked &#34;diamond&#34; in shape, said it was hard to define the shape.

The object appeared yellow orangish as it approached and then yellow white as it moved away. It appeared to not have lights on the outside, but radiate light from inside.  The light wasn&#39;t brilliant, it was just &#34;lit up.&#34;   The object was much higher than the tree line, but lower than a plane.  I thought it was a helicopter at first, but it moved too smoothly (like an airplane).   I was grabbing my coffee mug out of my car before I went to bed, as I saw the object approach,  I ran inside and got my wife.  The object just passed over us as we came outside.   The object disappeared behind tall trees, as it moved North East way from us.<n>

It made no sound, and as it passed, its shape remained the same.  While still visible, the site security guard approached, and we both could not figure out what this object was.  There were no clouds in the sky that night, and we both watched as it seemed to gain altitude at an arming rate until it had faded to nothing.  There were no flashing lights, or nothing at all to indicate that it was any commercial or private aircraft.<n>

My mom, who is a skeptic on such things, stops the car when she sees a low-flying craft right nearby.  It was dark, so we couldn&#39;t see much except for changing, flashing lights.   The lights came from different areas of the craft, and it looked a bit like a trapezoid, but then seemed to change shape.   Getting out of the car, there was a quiet drone unlike anything I&#39;ve heard before.   Soon it started flying away at incredible speed.  That&#39;s the second UFO I see close to my home, and to think so live in a town so small, most maps don&#39;t even recognize it.<n>

They were moving together in a line but it was not a perfectly straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, I do not know if the lights were related, but there was a green falling flash that came out of an empty sky.

After watching it dip and dive and circle around the ! jet it flew directly at the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective it went behind the tree line, i spoke with other people that seen it from a different view and they said that the lights seperated and split off then joined up and flew away at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was gone we seen the jet still searching, then a helicopter could be seen in the distance in the same area with it&#39;s spotlight on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking video but ended up with one snapshot that just shows a streak in the sky.<n>

I saw 2 red/orange circles in the sky moving SSE slowly at the same speed.  It was located to the west of my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife to come out and witness the movement.  There were no sounds that we could hear of.  The lead circle would pulsate slightly and then die off.  Because it was dark, we weren’t sure if it blacked out or was masked by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after, the second blacked out.  My wife went back into the house and I continued to walk the dog around the neighborhood.  Approximately 3 minutes later, I saw a third red/orange circle trailing the same route as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 to 2 minutes, the third blacked out as well.  I saw regular aircraft in the vicinity of these circles.  It was obvious that these red circles did not fit the profile of a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, the movement was unnatural to a regular aircraft. It would shif! t mid-air.  When I got back into the house, my wife researched this to see if anyone else saw this pattern.  On the UFO Reporting Center, the description matched similar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a former Marine Corps Officer with a MBA and my wife has a masters as well.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.  My first assumption was that these might be police unmanned aerial vehicles.

One witness was a Ph.D. biolgy professor, one was an engineer, one was a high school teacher, the other two women were college educated and none were inclined to  make snap judgements concerning the nature of the objects.<n>

Then I saw four flying in a triangle shape with the fourth one in the middle again they seemed to speed up and slow down flying up and down out of formation.  Then I saw ones fling solo one after another a couple of them seemed to disappear and reappear then it was over.  There was a car pulled over with another witness I thought I was the only one.  I told my girlfriend about it. I hope she doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy, my phone was dead I wanted to try and capture it on video.  One thing I noticed about the last one I saw I was on Clark heading toward artesia was it seemed lower and looked like a fire as if it was a flying fire place yet it moved like it was under intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Immediately, I ran to get a witness. Once returning out side the five had moved a little further down the road and then became stationary for a moment and then began to make formations and move about in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as time went on they move further away so I jumped in the truck and followed. While doing so I seen other people pull over looking and getting pics.  I told all of the to go to the NUFORC website and write out a report and then continued to follow.  At one point they were low enough that they were behind trees, almost looked like they may land somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the sighting they came up from the ground one at a time and they even took the same flight path up till you could not see them anymore due to clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main reason I am out there every time is to see this phenomenon and others, ….finally it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESS REPORT  I observed several orange like Spheres rising into the night sky.  There were other orange orbs also in the sky.  I could see them coming from behind the trees.  At one point I counted 6 or 7 orange spheres, they would rise and then disappear in the clouds. 3 made this formation most of the sighting   Other information!!!  Peter on Nov 11 2010 I had another sighting (Wow) which I did get High Res photos of I posted them on a popular web site called Abovetopsecret HERE:   http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread658692/pg1 (scroll down to see images toward the bottom of post)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the Source(FULL) images I would like to share with you and the community please call once you have received this REPORT<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your services to the Web and people all over!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

She was outside for about 3 mins and then she brought something to my attention.  She has a puzzled confused look on her face as she pointed up into the night sky and questioned what are those orange reddish glowing balls.  I then took a good look and came to a conclusion that they weren’t several things.  Such as candles, air planes, dragon fly’s.  I knew that they were something odd.  I had already had my camera with me at the time and I soon then called my parents out to determine what they were.  My dad gazed up into the sky to further examine what they were.  At the time all of this was taking place there was a sudden stop of air traffic.  I live right by an air port so planes are coming in and out at all hours.  I notice that there were only two dots side by side heading towards the clouds going east to west.  During this time I soon began to capture everything on camera because I knew you would ha! ve to see it to believe it.  And then a swarm of 5 or 6 followed it in the same path after it disappeared.  After that 1 more came right along in the same direction I closely examined it through my camera lens and I noticed that the orange light started to dim and right in the center was a orange reddish dot.  I took a closer look of the whole thing and I saw a clear  3D outline of what looked like the whole thing.  The best way I am can describe them is floating orange jelly fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See high-quality video footage on You Tube:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Stunning UFO11-10-12 1830hrs Orlando Fl above my house near OIA&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Size: Each sphere approximately  the size of a dime held out at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Description: At approximately 18:28 Pacific Standard Time on November 10th, 2012, I was driving Southbound on Si Town Road toward my home.  Three bright reddish orange spheres low to the ground initially caught my eye when I was approximately 1200 feet south of SR504 on Si Town Rd.  Seconds after my initial visual acquisition these objects were momentarily obscured by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I re-acquired these objects about two seconds later I now had an unobstructed view of them.  They appeared to be hovering at this point at an altitude of 500 feet or perhaps less above ground level and about 1000 feet horizontally to the southeast of my location.  The ground level at this location is about 700 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects were close enough to my car that I almost stopped my car as I actually feared that they might block the road, but they stayed hovering where they had been the whole time so I continued southbound on Si Town Rd.  They were totally silent.  They did not blink, rotate or change color.  They maintained a constant luminosity until the end of this event.  They were each very bright and each sphere was about as big around as a dime held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was not sure if I was observing one solid triangular craft with lights at each corner, or if I was observing three independent objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned east onto Ness Rd. and approached my house about 45 seconds after initially acquiring these objects they began to maneuver independently of each other, but still over the same location.  At this point they maneuvered into a straight line, equally spaced from each other and began to ascend.  I quickly pulled into my driveway with the car facing basically toward the objects.  At this point they all ascended vertically together with no horizontal travel noted.  One by one each object faded out and disappeared up into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was quite shaken. I ran out of my car and into the house to get my wife.  I grabbed my camera and tried to explain what had just happened to my wife, but there was no longer anything to see.  I called the Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office and Castle Rock City Police Department 15 to 20 minutes after this event to inquire if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They both responded in the negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me add that until retiring I was a commercial pilot and I still hold an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate. I’ve been flying since 1977.   As such I am quite used to identifying and looking at things in the sky.  The objects I observed tonight were NOT aircraft navigation lights, emergency lights, landing lights, helicopters, lighter-than-air craft, weather balloons, flares, Chinese lanterns, meteorological phenomena, satellites, swamp gas, or any other nonsense.  I know how non-aviation people can often misidentify things they see in the sky.  This was not the case tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were real, solid objects and appeared to maneuver under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m still shaking from what I saw more than an hour and a half ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions, and we have exchanged several e-mail messages with him<n>

Above those lines, on the right side of the freeway, I noticed 7 or 8 glowing shapes.  They were reddish-orange and were more of a cube shape than rounded.  They seemed to be bobbing gently up and down.  They were not connected to each other and not in a straight line.  They were only about 50 feet above the top of the power lines.  I thought they were some kind of lantern or glowing balloons but couldn’t make out how they were connected to the ground or to each other because they all seemed to be independent of each other.  Other people were looking at them too….one car had stopped on the side of the road.  I was late for church so I couldn’t stop and study it more.  I did notice that they were stationary enough that I saw them before me and was able to pass them and look back at them when I went by.  I rolled down the c! ar window and there was no noticeable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the back the lights flashed on and off once in awhile, but when it flashed it flashed to a red or to an orange (from the back only) the front always stayed the same looking like a ball of fire. It made no sound and the last pass was unusually close overhead.<n>

I thought their must be no moon tonight.  I opened my curtain to take a look around and saw a flash about as bright as a medium star.  I thought it was an airplane.  I kept watching as as it continues to flash about once every 5 seconds or so, I decided to go downstairs and look from outside and noticed that this flash did not move.  I used to work in the navy and I know what aircraft look like at night and I knew it was not an aircraft.  I thought it might be something else but I have no idea what.  I tried to record on my iPhone but it does not show anything.  Perhaps it could be professionally edited to show this pulsing or flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute of watching from outside it seemed to become more faint and moved away from me into space.  I can&#39;t recall how bright it was initially from my bedroom window, I guess because I had just woke up.  After the thing was gone a quick streak went across the sky like a shooting star.<n>
11/10/12 01:00|Hoquiam|WA|Flash|12-15 minutes|Three huge brillant flashes of light way out past the horizon on the Pacific Ocean|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94432.html|516|ndxe201211| Three huge brillant flashes of light way out past the horizon on the Pacific Ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about 1:00 A.M. on Nov 10, 2012. I had just lay down in bed when a flash of brilliant light, like lightning, lit up the entire sky for a second. I got out of bed and went to my bedroom window overlooking the Port of Grays Harbor area in Hoquiam, WA.  I didn’t see anything but did take notice that there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  I went to the spare bedroom that faces west. There I stood for about 3 minutes looking out for a thunderstorm when another giant flash of light lit up the sky again. This time I could see the brightest area to be west of Ocean Shores, WA, so far out that you could tell the source came from far beyond the horizon.  The flash was so bright it made it like daylight for a second. I continued standing there wondering if this might me lightning from way off the coast. Just like the time lapse between the first two flashes, after another four minutes, there was another flash, just as bright, coming from the exact location, making me think lightning might be the source.  I did notice that it was so bright, I could see the horizon clearly and there were absolutely no thunderstorm tops to be seen out there. I have lived on the coast and seen lightning offshore but the tops of thunderheads are usually visible during lighting and never ever anything this bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted a local news station in Seattle and asked them if they could look at the radar records and determine if thunderstorms were off the coast that early morning but they are not responding of checking this out. I am very sure that if anyone had a security camera’s recording that they would have detected these three brilliant flashes. No other flashes occurred and after observing another 30 minutes, I went to bed.<n>

There was solid cloud cover, and it was raining, as it had been for hours.  Then I saw what I first thought was a star, and figured for a second that there was a break in the clouds.  I quickly realized the light that looked like a star was moving at a steady, fairly brisk speed, heading south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it must be an airliner, as it seemed high enough and fast enough that it couldn’t be a small plane.  It was only a steady white light, looking much like a star.  If it were a plane, I thought it would have the typical flashing lights; this did not.  Then I thought it may be a satellite, but I thought a satellite would be at a much higher altitude, above the cloud cover. Then the object just stopped and stayed stationary.  It didn’t take time to slow,  it was moving then it stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 5 more minutes before getting in out of the rain and heading home.  For the entire time I watched the light, it was clearly visible.  I was not up into the cloud cover at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unable to explain what kind of object would be able to be that high, move that fast, be able to stop that suddenly, then stay perfectly stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The triangles on either side had red/blue/green lights that kind of &#34;chased&#34; and went around quickly.  It seemed very close, almost just above the trees.

I am in Alaska; I drove up a logging road to find a place where I could do some Astrophotography.  I chose a spot where there was very little light pollution and a low tree line and favorable foreground scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After setting up my tripod and camera I chose my composition of the Milky Way galaxy flowing across the sky and into the planet Venus which was bright in the Western Sky.  With my camera positioned in this direction I began taking my series of shots, five sets of 25 second exposure.  While waiting for my intervolometer to cycle through the series of shots I began to look around for a different perspective to shoot next.  This is when I made the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was four lights spread apart like the corners of a box, each light exactly the same distance from each other as you travel clockwise around the box.  I used my fist extended at arm’s reach to measure them and my fist fit perfectly between each of the pairs of stars horizontally and vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What initially caught my eye was that each light was like the beacon of a light house revolving around in a beam.  I could see the beam revolve growing longer as it approached the point of direct opposition from its center to my right then shrinking as it came to the position when it was nearly pointing directly towards me then again growing as it continued to rotate to its right angle on my left and again shrinking until it was a pin point as the light was pointing directly away from me.  Also it was brightest (like a flash) when directly point at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this alone would be odd but add in the fact that as each light beginning in the top right corner made a complete cycle it would go dark and the next in a clockwise direction would begin a cycle commencing at the same point the previous light has stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So you have four lights acting like lighthouse beacons rotating in turn, clockwise in a square formation.  Additionally I observed them for two hours while I continued to take series of photos for my astrophotography practice; while the stars changed position relative to me, due to the revolving of the Earth these four beacons remained geostationary and in the exact formation the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yes I did take multiple photos of these lights I do not have a video and all the shots just show points of light not the beacons my human eyes observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any Idea what I saw, possibly satellites, space station or what?   The time was between 10 and 12pm Alaska Standard Time on November 9th, 2012.<n>

I looked up at the sky and noticed a round orange sphere coming from the Northeast and heading toward the Southwest.  It was flying at a higher altitude than the usual air traffic and it was flying pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead it started flying faster and turned upward and disappeared from view.  My sister and I were both wondering what it was since it did not look like anything that we had ever seen flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came out of the country club a little over an hour later.  I again looked up at the sky and noticed that clouds had moved in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked toward the Northeast I noticed a round orange sphere (again!!) going toward the Southwest.  This time it was flying lower than the previous one that we had seen.  As it was coming towards us another orange sphere came up behind it.  It was probably a few miles behind it but it was following the same trajectory path as the one in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both spheres flew into the clouds and disappeared from our view.<n>

I was distracted by a light in the sky and saw what looked to be an airplane on fire.  After about 30 seconds the fire glow disappeared and it appeared like a normal airplane traveling before I lost sight over the house and trees.   At first I thought it may have been a satellite but did notice there was cloud in the sky and did not see any stars.  The movement was approx. from a NW to SE direction and I would have been looking NE<n>

The objects then changed positions moving up and down...they were silent.  I called my wife and kids outside and they witnessed the event.  The four of us watched them for a few minutes and they traveled off to the distance and suddenly disappeared!<n>

The object, which appeared red to the best of my ability of sight, moved backwards, foward, sideways, then in a zig zag pattern.  Due to recent numerous similar events, I was convinced the object was far from any flight capable object I had ever seen.  When the object changed course west, it stopped near a star and the star began glowing brighter as did the flying object.  The object flew east at incredible speed, immediatly stopped, and flew upwards towards space in a similar fashion as a rocket ship, directly upwards.  As it was on its path towards space , the clouds behind it became thicker and formed behind the object, covering any way to continue viewing it.  Throughout it&#39;s flight patterns, it consistently flew behind clouds near the shining star.  I highly stress to inform this is not the first time I have seen an object mane! uver such bizarre flight patterns and shoot directly into space, seeming to somehow each time influence cloud patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I noticed a plane that flew over them.  When the plane flew over they were still.  When the plane was a good distance away they started moving again.I saw another red or orange streak, it was real fast. I went to call my sister for her to look at them and when I went back to look again I could only find one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched it for about 5 seconds and it moved up real fast and stopped.  It is now almost even with the handle on the little dipper and doing circl! es.  It doesn&#39;t change colors,stays like a white light.<n>

The craft then I could tell was indeed round and was blocking out the stars as it passed heading north to south at a slow speed making no noise and emitting no light but a reflection on the leading edge as it neared the southern edge of town near bens ford wildlife management area it took off at an extreme rate of speed with no sound<n>

Fall from the sky I wouldn&#39;t really say it was falling I guess.this is hard to describe.  It was like a giant green neon tube that shot down towards earth it did not hit earth it disappeared before it could it wasn&#39;t a meteor or nothing because it appeared and disappeared so fast like a blink of an eye the tail end lit up the clouds behind it yet it was like a huge green tube it wasn&#39;t too close to me because I could see antennas blinking red that were closer to me it was more outside of gering towards the wildcat hills and missile bases are out there.  I don&#39;t know what I seen but I got shivers and was totally freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It encompassed the entire sky from horizon to horizon and it faded the same way it appeared but faded from the south horizon to the north horizon. It lit up everything in view like daylight except in a blue tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Anaheim, Ca looking south from Ball/Euclid my girlfriend and I looked up to see a flash of blue flickering light up in the sky.  It was a ball of light about 1000 feet up.  At first we thought lightning or a helicopter, but it pulsated dripping /molten colors of blue, then went to red, white, yellow, orange and purples.  It stopped flashing after approx 2 minutes.  When it stopped it went dark, although still kind of shimmering.  We could see the shape of this sphere like little flecks of &#39;fireflies&#39; barely visible.  We looked around the sky and noticed about 10 other of these spheres lined up in a line right above it looking the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4 minutes, this sphere rose up in the sky above all of these other spheres quickly but not very far (about 2 seconds).  Then another ball off to the right started flashing different colors of blue for about 30 seconds.  All of these spheres remained silent and in-formation.  We watched for about 15! minutes, nothing else was happening but these balls were still in the sky.  We left, they were still present. It&#39;s difficult to say how large or how far away they were, probably 1 to 2 miles away and larger than a hot air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before,  I wish I had a video camera to record it.  Anyone looking up in the sky paying attention would have seen this!<n>

It lasted about 20 to 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it while I was driving and didn&#39;t know what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to check it out.

We were standing on our front porch listening to music, and spotted Flashing lights over the ocean infront of our home.  They could no have been far out to be able to see them infront of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These Flashing lights were red and white, and they were jumping across, back and forth, but these stayed inside one area with a constant pattern of moving together as they flashed. But it may have been one object that had all of these lights flashing, but No Sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late, but The Sky was Clear,and There were no planes around at that time frame, We only saw them for about 10-15 minutes left in a flash and just like they appeared togather, they<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live only 2 miles from the Airport, and when they talke off, we can see about all of them. Our home is on Stilts and two story,  So that puts us up pretty high up. We could see the ocean before they built houses across the lake from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called them to report it, and The Airport give me a number at the FFA. I called  to report it, and was telling him what I saw, and he stopped me.  He said he was going to put me on Speaker phone, and he wanted me to start over.  I told him what my wife and I saw the night before, and many of other different object sightings, out over the Atlantic Ocean,  But they were straight in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen moreo objects that I will add to more of these Description forms.  The man I spoke with told me to type up everything I had told him, and mail it to him, and I told him of other sightings I had seen, and he said to include them and the dates and places of them all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman got back intouch with me, and he said to fill out this form. So because there are more sighting, you will see more listed with my name on them. Thanks,<n>

Subject did not see fireball land however came upon fireball in corn field approximately ½ mile from sky sighting.  Subject stated that it was approximately the size of an ATV and sat burning or glowing. He stated that he pulled over to observe and his vehicle stalled.  When vehicle was able to be started the lights would not work and he drove away hurriedly fearful due to having his infant son in vehicle.  Lights began working as he was driving away.  Upon viewing of the sighting site the next morning by myself nothing was apparent.  However the local authorities were called after the sighting to investigate.<n>

It was about 5 inches to the right of Jupiter.  It was dim and got really bright and then just blinked out in just a matter of a few seconds. It is a cloudless night and the moon is not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only person that I know that observed it because I was walking my dogs, my dogs acted as if they were scared because they all came in within a minute of the sighting which is unusual for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call myself a hobbiest astronomer, I do know where some things in the are in the sky.

It was in the south east sky over the tree tops in my in-laws yard around where the sun rises in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I have been seeing different lights several times since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 12th my husband and our daughter were driving home from my parents house around 10:30PM EST on Rt. 60, and the car just stopped and engine died.  We couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on about 15 seconds later we saw 7 bright lights move across the sky in a V formation, my husband estimated that it was about 1000 feet above us it moved from the north west to the south east and it took about 2 minutes for it to pass over head.  As soon as the lights were gone are car started right up with no problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 13th I was walking to my car after work around 4:30PM and I saw something shiny in the sky, I thought it was just an air plane or something like that but there was no noise.  I looked at it again and realized it wasn&#39;t moving, it was hovering there for a good 30-40 seconds and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 17th I was loading up my car at Wal-Mart in Fayetteville around 10:00PM and I glanced up and it was really really cloudy out and I saw a bright light in the sky that was changing colors from blue, to white, green and red and some purples.  There were some other people around me that noticed it as well and were just watching it, which is another thing that caught my attention. After I finished loading up my car I sat in my car and watched it for about 5 minutes then it was just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight 11/19/12 around 7:00PM I was walking back to my house after a Thirty One party at my neighbor&#39;s house with my neighbor&#39;s daughter who is babysitting for me tonight while I go Christmas shopping tonight and saw the 7 reddish orange lights again.  Next thing I know there were 9 very loud planes flying fast overhead as if they were chasing down whatever the lights were.  ((name deleted)) (my neighbor&#39;s daughter) took off running to my house because she was so scared.  I took off running as well to the house to get inside.<n>

11/8/12 21:45|Canastota|NY|Light|??|Over a few days/weeks, big green flash in sky, 2 orange lights glowing, some odd static electricity.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94264.html|559|ndxe201211| Over a few days/weeks, big green flash in sky,  2 orange lights glowing, some odd static electricity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past few weeks, I have noticed some interesting activity. I was outside at work a few weeks back on our nightly break, when I saw a big green flash behind the clouds. It was very large in the sky. I was so shocked, I could barely express what I had seen.  That seemed to be the most significant thing to me, but I didn&#39;t feel like it was worth writing about until the last few nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way home from work, I drive down a strip of road with fields on both sides. Being fall time, they&#39;re really empty and easy to see across.  For the past few nights, I&#39;ve noticed 2 bright orange balls of light on both the north and south horizons.  Very far out, but still noticeable from my car. The first night I thought they were interesting, and then I saw the same thing the second night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night was very cloudy - couldn&#39;t see a star in the sky. I could however see these orange balls.  They weren&#39;t flashing or moving, just staying very still on the horizons.  Last night was exceptionally clear, and they were clearly visible in the same spots.  They are definitely a whole lot brighter than the rest of the things I could identify in the sky (stars, planes, etc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a possibly related note, I&#39;ve noted a significant increase in the static electricity around here. I got shocked a whole bunch of times last night from doorknobs, in the same place I work every night. I know the time of year probably has something to do with it.  When I woke up this morning, 2 lightbulbs (maybe more?) in my house were dead.  The incandescent kind. Both are bulbs that get a LOT of use in the house, and could have coincidentally died at the same time. I just thought it was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as my (the observer) background goes...not much. I certainly am interested in UFO sightings, but have only ever seen a few times something I couldn&#39;t explain.  These few phenomenon in the past weeks have me puzzled, so I figured I&#39;d say something - maybe other people have seen it too! :]<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>
11/8/12 21:40|Texarkana|TX|Light|2 minutes|Dim blue/grey orb, at low altitude.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94248.html|560|ndxe201211| Dim blue/grey orb, at low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:40 p.m. 11/8/2012 I was home alone watching t.v., my dogs began to bark, and I felt the house rumbling.  As if someone was listening to a loud stereo in front of the house. Instead of a rhythmic thumping, it was more of a constant stub-audible rumble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out front to see what the dogs were barking at and saw nothing in the street, but when I stepped out from under the eaves, I felt heat on my back.  I looked up and at tree top level above the house was a blue/gray glowing sphere.  As soon as I looked up, it took off due east, like it had been shot from a gun.  It got brighter as it picked up speed and about two miles it bounced north west, like a tennis ball hitting a brick wall.  After the bounce it was only visible for a flash and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two noteworthy observations.  First, the sky was overcast with low clouds, and it was well under the cloud cover. Secondly, as it took off from over the house, I could feel a sub-harmonic vibration, in the driveway.  But it never made an audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t much to it, but it was a hair raising couple of minutes.<n>
11/8/12 21:30|Paton|IA|Formation|over a hour|A opening in space that formed a hole from which I could see many flying objects keeping the hole open.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94253.html|561|ndxe201211| A opening in space that formed a hole from which I could see many flying objects keeping the hole open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to feed my cats at around 21:30 and living out in the country I have very few lights so I have a clear view of the sky.  As I bent over to put cat food in the cat’s bowls I saw a streak of light from the corner of my eye as I was beginning to bend over.  I looked up and the first thing I saw was how bright the planet Jupiter was and then I saw another blast of light which pinpointed where the first light I saw had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there in awe with my mouth open because I could not believe what I was seeing.  It was a clear night with a few clouds and a soft breeze blowing and what I saw was a hole in the sky.  It was dark outside but enough light to show that clouds were around this hole but not blocking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside this hole which almost seemed like looking through a tunnel, it was very clear through it almost like it really wasn’t our sky.  It was full of dancing lights that moved around all over the place and once in awhile they moved together in synch.   One more time I saw a blast of light come from something inside this hole that exited and seemed to go into our clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam looked like this:   --------- --   ------   -- -------- -- ------------ -- ------------- -- -----------.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was long and short beams going in a straight line. No sounds were ever heard during all this.  Most of the lights were red and white with a slight amber color on one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed they were working on keeping this hole open and around the outside portion of the hole in what I think were clouds; they seemed to be manipulating the clouds or something into something that would appear alive.  In other words, the outside of the hole along with the inside of the hole seemed like a living entity. It moved very fluently as if looking around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I totally could not believe this and I ran in the house and called my parents to see if they saw anything from where they live 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad said he saw something in the east but I told what I was watching was South East I went to my neighbors across the road and they stepped out and I had to point it out to them where to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both stood there in amazement and couldn’t believe it either how these bright dancing lights moved inside, and how the outer portions of the hole would move as if it were alive. At that moment two packs of coyotes started to howl and my neighbor’s wife went in the house. I came back to my place and called my dad and then I went out to see if the hole was still there. It was, but this time much fainter and fewer lights are in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can handle lights in a tunnel like hole but it bothered me how it was forming shapes that almost seemed humanoid at times.  The best way I can describe it is think of yourself as a tiny ant inside a hollow egg.  Someone comes along and drills a hole in the egg and puts his eye up to the egg to see the ant inside. The ant would see you and see you moving from his perspective outside that hole. That is what it looked like to me.  A giant peephole with something holding this hole open manipulating the area around it and then moving this animated matter in the shape of an animal or human reaching and grabbing things. If the bible is true and they say god will open the heavens and you will see him then I think I just saw a practice run, because I still don’t believe what I saw, but I did, and it’s disturbing on<n>

While in Whiteville, NC, on 701S I witnessed a ball of fire approximately the size of what a hot air balloon would look like a mile away, it appeared to have an engine trail behind it and it appeared to have landed in a field of trees to my left. It was at least a mile ahead of me at the time, I could not get a photo, it was much too fast, within 4-5 seconds it had disappeared into the trees.  I looked up into the sky to see if anything else was coming and there appeared to be hundreds of bright stars in the sky.<n>

I was starting to doze but I awoke at about 9:20 pm because my ears were ringing loudly.  I had an urge to go outside on the balcony and look at the sky.  The water was calm like glass and it was eerily quiet. It was a clear, dark night with Jupiter and stars of Orion’s belt shining brightly to the E.  (Sirius had not yet risen and moonrise was after midnight.)  So I called my friend, B out to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw a sudden flash of bright pinkish-red, dime-size round light SE at about 2 finger widths above and closer than the horizon over the ocean.  The center was the darker pink-red and the perimeter was a red-orange.  I am guessing it was closer than a mile as the visibility was 10 miles at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It blinked out then flashed on and off again.  She kept asking, &#34;What is that?&#34; and I grabbed her arm.  In about 30 seconds it flashed on from a greater distance for about 3 seconds.  Then it blinked off for a second.  Then further away there was another red light that separated into two side by side lights about one finger width apart, then rejoined as one (or one was in front of the other).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another one higher and more towards the SSE.  (At some point my friend went inside for a few seconds to get a coat.  Unfortunately we did not have our cameras at the ready.)  A larger/closer red flash to the SSE stayed on a little longer so I could see a grayish area with the red light in its center, with all outlined in a blackish ring.  One of the red lights traveled SE to ESE parallel to the shoreline.  Then we started seeing small pinpoints of white light (10 or more of them) between that one (to our left) and the others and a little higher altitude.  They blinked on and off but the light from some of them was so bright that we could feel it on our eyes (like tiny flashbulbs).  Some seemed to be getting closer to us.  Some turned red but stayed small.  Two more flashes of red light appeared and rotated or orbited around each other.  Then two small red lights flashed briefly and at differing spacing from each other (as two separate objects).  They stayed lit, rose and headed off to the SSW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out the front door but the height and lighting of the other buildings prevented us from seeing them.  We saw no more of these lights but saw the white, red and green blinking lights of an approaching small plane.  The plane was coming up the beach offshore probably having taken off from the airport at the south end of Myrtle Beach.  We could hear the faint sounds from the plane.  Otherwise, we heard NO sounds other than the gentle wave sound.  At 9:45 pm we came inside and each independently wrote down what we had just experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather Conditions:  43 degrees, clear, dew point 36 degrees, wind W at 8, pressure 30.10 rising, visibility 10 miles.  Location:  33.7424 Latitude, -78.8153 Longitude  Background:  I have never seen UFO&#39;s or UAP&#39;s in the 30 some years I have been living or vacationing on the North or South Carolina beaches.  I have previously reported to MUFON a single bright object that I saw about Feb. 9, 2012 at home in Raleigh, NC.  I am a retired hospital department director with a masters degree in a mental health profession.  I have been researching about both my sightings and found NUFORC.  My friend has agreed to file a separate report for what she experienced.  You may contact me if you wish. Thank you for this service.<n>

When i got home i could still see the light it was even brighter so i went and got Binoculars and my Green Laser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the front lawn and saw what appeared to be three brights together hoovering.  When i pointed the laser in their direction they vanished! i continued to observe the area for several hours after the event but they didnt return<n>

Low speed flight, with a climb then light went away<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my mother driving home from work.  The street we were on is called &amp;quot;Grove Road&amp;quot; I noticed the object to my left.  It looked as if it was flying through clouds. It was very low to the deck, I want to say maybe 400-500 feet.  It was a red color. My first impression of this was a meteor, but, it was flying level. Also I want to add that I thought the windshield of the car was making the object red.  My mom insited we pull over and get out and take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove for  maybe a few more yards before we stopped.  Before we stopped my mom rolled down her window to see if we could hear anything.  Nothing was heard.  The best way to describe the range of the object from us was like at an Airshow.  The object then made a climb and the color began to turn from a dark red to a red with white in it.  It was stationary for a bit, then it continued on its path and the light just went out. I saw no landing light nor FAA lights on the object.<n>

The aircraft was moving perpendicularly to the road.  As it passed over the road the circular light strobed over the whole highway 2-3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then looked up toward the sky we saw a circular aircraft flying at an altitude of about 100-150 feet northbound.  Very hard to describe the light, but it was very bright, when we then discussed it afterward, we both drew the exact same picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light had a very particular shape and pattern to it that was clear to both of us.<n>

They have bright orange lights which go from very bright to non-existent.  They make no sound and either hover in one spot or move across the sky, sometimes slowly and sometimes very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are in the shape of a &#34;V&#34; from what he can tell. He called me November 8, 2012, about 7 PM, and said, &#34;They were back again.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I drove to his house and observed them myself and they what he claimed.

This is when i noticed that in the north west sky there was a bright object.  There was a building obstructing my view so I walked a little quicker to get around it and that is when I saw a huge fire ball type object sitting in sky silently maybe as low as 10 stories up.  It looked like a mini sun that was just hovering there.  The middle of the huge buring object however was black and I noticed it looked like something in the middle of it was moving. When I got a better look it realized that in the middle of this burning ball of light was what appeared to be the shape of a human  only larger than any man that I have ever seen. I noticed the figure appeared to raise it&#39;s arms up then the fire around it started to get bigger and bigger and then it went from a still position to moving slowly away. Then It moved diagonally up and imploded on it&#39;s self! after making an enormous flash of light.<n>

They crossed paths at one point also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began to dull in a colar a tiny bit as we left.  There were absolutely no blinking lights like an aircraft, and they were about at least 4 times bigger than the stars we could see and much much brighter.<n>

We were very alarmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw the lights there were only 2 at first, then another appeared then the 4th appeared.  They were spread out in a diamond shape. When they disappeared they did so in order like 4, 3, and then the last 2 went out at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the whole thing lasted about 15- 30 seconds.  When the lights went out it was as if a door was pulled accross them from left to right and each one went out in this sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe this could have been flares because they appeared and went out in a very orderly way as if it was in a pattern that someone was controlling.<n>

My meditate reaction was that it was a new cell tower or something.  As I continued to stand there I realized that this was no plain or tower.  All I wanted to do is stand there and watch but I pulled out my phone and started taking video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother to come see cause I knew he would never beleive me if I told him what happend. The lights where North West in a funny formation. There was four of them.  Omost in a straight line except the second light was a little lower making what it looked like was a v shape.  The balls of light seemed to be flashing omost but more like flickering. They did not appear to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they one by one disappeared. The one on the far left disappeared first then if was the second and within a couple of seconds they were gone. I wad on the phone with brother when they disappeared. In shock I was looking all ar! ound wondering if the lights were all around. Next thing I know my brother said there back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back around to the area where I say them last and there was nothing. I told him that I didnt see them. Instead of the lights being in the same spot the light were now more west. The lights made a giant triangle in the sky with only three this time. Two were high up level with each other and the third was very low to the ground. they did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had told my brother to come out there with me. So ny this time he was with me.  I called a real good friend that lives in town to step out side and see.  He also saw what me and my brother were looking at. My parents were gone but by the time we got to the house my parents were home.  We told them we say a ufo and they just nodded and said they saw it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad is veteran and was telling me all these laws about plains in formations. And was saying things about how lights ate on plains but long story short he was saying there was no way those were aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what they say he said that the on! e appear ed as if it had landed but from my point it was still barely in the air. The lights in the triangle also disappeared quickly in sink. My parents said the say one move but I never did. I am now a true believer.<n>

I saw 3 extremely bright large twinkling lights in a triangle formation fairly low to the ground hovering over what looked like the Granger, TX area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so unusual that I did not turn down FM 1331 but stayed on Hwy 95 to try and get a closer look at the lights.  They stayed in the tight triangular formation for several minutes &amp; then one instantly disappeared.  The other 2 stayed for a couple of minutes longer &amp; then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still daylight at that point but getting dark.  I then drove home which took me about 10 minutes &amp; when I got settled into the house, my husband &amp; daughter were looking outside towards Granger &amp; the lights just reappeared around 6:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 of the large twinkling bright lights this time that hovered over the Granger, TX area for about 10-15 minutes.  We did capture them on videotape &amp; you can have a copy of what we captured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times, 1 or 2 more lights would appear but for the majority of the time the 2 main lights stayed fairly motionless over the Granger area.  About an hour later helicopters or aircraft were flying very slowly in a circular pattern over where the sighting happened.<n>

However I felt compelled because my sighting was very similiar to another report in Boulder this month.  I was walking my dog at the Howard Hueston dog park last evening when I spotted an object that appeared to be a triangle or chevron shaped object.  It was extremely difficult to see.  It appeared to have deep red tones on the body of the object, it may have also had about 4 very dim lights on the leading edge of the object.  The object was silent and appeared to be gliding in the sky.  The object was heading west, then turned at a 45 degree angle and headed to the north.  I lost sight of the object when it went into tree line.  It is also important to note that this park is very close to Glenwood Dr similiar location to the other Boulder triangle report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It left no trail behind, nor did it make a sound.  It was traveling at speeds that I never witnessed a manned aircraft before, hence it was only in view from my windshield for 5-6 seconds before it was out if sight.  It seemed to have a helicopter shape but was to fast to describe other than the gape of a teardrop.  The color was steady and did not change from the reddish orange light it emitted. It also was not bright but bright enough to catch my eye.<n>

It was so big and bright like it was SUPER close.  But the direction that it traveled was very odd it went in a 45 degree angle across the sky for a few seconds and then disappeared.  It was so strange that for the past week I have not been able to forget about it.<n>

Next, I turned off the highway onto a gravel road that headed west and parked my vehicle.  I turned off the vehicle and all lights I had on.  I exited the vehicle and looked to the north, I could no longer see the orange lights or orbs.  To the south west/ west I could see one orange orb traveling in a southwestward/westward direction.  I would estimate it was approximately 50 to 70 miles from my position and very high in altitude compared to normal flight patterns.  If I was to estimate, I would say it was at 70,000 feet or higher altitude moving at a slow yet constant velocity.  The rate of travel was approximately twice as fast as a normal satalite that you observe traveling in orbit across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a coworker located 20 miles to the southwest of my position and the orb dimmed and disappeared a few seconds later before he could go out to observe it.  The whole event lasted less than two minutes from the time I observed it until the last orb disappeared from the cloudless sky unobstructed by mountains or  any other objects sans the stars.  When I exited my vehicle when it was turned off, there were no sounds.  No rotor noises, prop noises no jet engine turban sounds.  Whatever the orbs were they were silent as I observed them and at no time did I see any navigation strobes or red/green navigation lights.  I have no explanation for what I saw.  I have observed metopes, satellites , military night rocket launches, aerial search and illumination flares and many things but none of these were like what I observed tonight, November 7, 2012 to the north east and south/ southwest of Wasilla, Alaska.<n>

So I&#39;m standing in the patio doorway and I see this “fireball” in the sky.  There is no sound and it is moving slowly at the horizon from NE to SW.  I was in awe!  At one point it was stationary, then it would move SW, then it looked as if it were ascending straight up because the ball of fire got smaller and smaller until it was gone.  The event lasted approximately 3 minutes.<n>

They were orange with almost a red glow to them.  They did not flash or make any sound.  They moved slowly across the sky in the same flight pattern and then turned and headed south.  I ran in the house and had my children come out to see them and then had my neighbours come out as well.  My neighbours only saw the last 3 glowing orange/red lights and these ones were traveling in the formation of a triangle.  After awhile when there seemed to be no more coming, my neighbours went inside their home and my daughter and I walked down the street towards our house.  We then saw one final bright round orange/red light coming across the sky in the same flight path.  We then stood on our driveway talking to my mom on my cell phone staring at the night sky when suddenly a comet (or something similar) shot directly over o! ur heads no higher than 3 stories up.  It had a long tail, was grey and disappeared as it reached over our neighbour’s house.   I turned to my daughter and said, “Did you see that!?” and she responded, “Yes, and I made a wish!”  She thought it looked like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Looked up into the sky to check out the stars.  I observed a huge, boomerang shaped object moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought that it was a formation of birds since the shape was somewhat of a Vee, but with rounded edges.  However, it was dark and birds don’t usually fly in formation, at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible lights on the object.  It moved silently, high above the cirrus clouds which were at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commercial airline traffic was in the air, at much lower altitudes.  These aircraft were dwarfed by the object that we observed. We were amazed at the size of this flying object or formation.  It moved at a very high speed and, within 45 to 60 seconds it could no longer be seen.<n>

I also was able to photograph some of the lights which although having a full moon helped long shutter opening, were needed.   The light first light on mt whitney had disappeared when a few minutes later reappear with a second light and both light moved about the mountain until they reached the base, where they continued out onto the plain in front of the mountain for a few minutes then blink they were  gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity continued thru out the night, with one exception, a light appeared at the base of a small hill located to my left i watched as this ligh! t slowly moved toward hwy 395 then stopped and went off!  I wanted a closer look and moved without lights toward the small hill thinking a trail could be found that would lead me toward the mountain, but i only found a large field which confused me because my view had changed so back to old location was necessary, i was about to move on when i noticed that a light was moving towards my location from the hill slo wly using the trees and brush to hide its movement when it reached the last bush it bent over and rested on one knee then turned toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what i saw the form was wearing a suit or something like that, light in color no other detail was viewed, a helmet was covering the head and was dark but for a copper like color coming from the inside view lens, I tried to use my glasses to see better but the form was not visable until i removed them, at this point my concern for my safety over came my interest to remain any longer so i left or tried to leave but was un! able to locate the exist which i had used to get into the fiel! d, stopp ed from going further i left my vehicle on foot to find the exist it took a few minutes but i found the track i needed getting back on to the trail there was a red blinking light to my right at first i did not notice but once i started to move so did the light when i stopped it did too i tried to creep slowly but this light maintained a safe distance from my vehicle. I finally got the camera out (Nikon D 3000 SLR) and started to shoot these light, there was a full moon that night but long shutter opening was necessary shooting the lights on the mountain was not good but taking the pictures of the red lights came out much better, I am not saying what i saw  i would rather hear what other see, but when i saw the first image on my camera i new it was time to get out of there quickly and that is just what i did! Once i was back on hwy 395 and just passed lone pine something i had not consider happened that red blinking light was now following me this i know because it appeared j! ust to my right and in front of my vehicle using the frontage road, my speed at the time was about 75 mph the light had no trouble keeping up nor did have trouble passing thru a second story building next to a railroad crossing pacing me for the next 60 miles until i stopped near red rock state park and could no loner see the light!<n>

I am retired  Both wife and I are ex-aerospace, and I am a pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 11/7/2012 Time: 6:15-6: 30 PM  Location-Central Nevada Weather-clear stars, starlight night. Dark. No wind. No clouds. No dust in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sightings (flap?): Driving from Bishop, CA to Tonopah, NV:  We approached Coledale Junction. I slowed and made the turn  from Hwy 6 onto Hwy 95.  I then saw a bright white light to my left. It was a craft flying less than 200 knots and in low level flight.  I assumed it was a training jet, or general aviation plane running North on Hwy 95 (towards Reno).  I  estimate that it was 2000 Ft. AGL, or lower. As it came abreast of the car and off into the desert ¼ mile east of the hwy, it turned into an orange glow and then dispersed in a shower of sparks like a meteor and trailed a comet-like tail and then burned up in level flight and was gone.  By the time I alerted my wife-she missed it. It was low and on the driver’s side of the car.  I assumed I saw a meteorite coming in-but was mystified by the slow, level flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we progressed Southbound on Hwy 95 towards Tonopah, I saw an orange circular light around two hand spans high in the windshield above the lights of Tonopah-some 12 miles distant &amp; high above the twinkling lights of Tonopah.  This was perhaps 7 minutes after the first sighting. I called attention to it and My Wife saw it too.  Then another orange glowing &#34;orb&#34; appeared to the right of the first one.  They were both spread out and at the same elevation-the distance of separation was the full width of windshield.  First the left one snapped shut-turned off.  Then the Right one went out. We both watched this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached our turn on Gabbs Pole Line road, these orange lights re-appeared-first the left one, then the right. It seemed they were stationary and in the same location still.  High above Tonopah. They stayed illuminated perhaps 20 seconds, then vanished in the same order.  We both saw these again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are around 70 Miles bee line from Area 51, and 35 Miles from TTR facility on the test range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it!<n>
11/7/12 17:30|Bay Lake|FL|Light|4 minutes|Three brightly glowing objects above sun during sunset + Fireball 2 hours later.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94214.html|608|ndxe201211| Three brightly glowing objects above sun during sunset + Fireball 2 hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after apparent sunset on 11/7/2012 5:20-5:40 I saw an object begin glowing brightly about 6-7 degrees above the horizon, at this point 3 degrees above the sun (was obscured by tree line) the object was about the same angular size as Venus, maybe a little larger.  It was visible over the course of a minute, I first noticed it as a soft glowing object the same shade as the sun during sunset, but it got continuously brighter until I was able to see white light in the center, it quickly faded until it was just at the edge of my vision and then brightened up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the phase where it brightened back up I noticed an identical object five degrees north of it, and 10 degrees above the horizon.  This one had a much shorter life cycle of about 20-30 seconds and did not re-ignite like the first object.  So transfixed was I on the second object that I did not notice what happened to the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes of staring at the horizon trying to detect another I noticed a third object about 25 degrees directly above where the sun set, this one may have been in existence longer but I only saw it for about 5-10 seconds, which was enough time to point it out to a passerby to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  She only noticed the contrail of a plane 10 degrees below object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three were exceptionally bright objects that did not move during the times they were visible (verified constantly with reference points on the Horizon), all presented with an orange glow similar to the surrounding sky during sunset, but they all at their peak brightness had a visible bright white core.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have concluded/believe:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. They were not one object.  Two were visible at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. It is not an airplane, or airplanes.  Angular size of light source, brightness and duration of visibility especially in close proximity to the sun would not exist without apparent motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. They were not a satellite, positioning is too erratic, and they did not move. AND in order to produce a similar orange glow, light would have been reflected from the sun, but the objects were too close to the sun.  The only man-made objects to pass through area between sun and earth during time specified were ISS (ZARYA), Cosmos 2278, Atlas Centaur R/B and Okean-3.  None of which, according to computer program Stellarium 0.11.3, were in proper position or at proper times to be the objects spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind first jumped to supernova, and second to aliens.  Both seem equally improbable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location of viewer during sighting: +28° 25&#39; 6.99&amp;quot;, -81° 34&#39; 49.53&amp;quot; (28.418608, -81.580426)  In addition to these viewings at 7:52 a fireball/shooting star fell in the exact same region of the sky as the position of the aforementioned objects.

After we missed the Orionids, due to rainy/cold conditions, we made it our mission to see the Taurids early morning light show Nov. 4th and 5th.  We are both extreme creatures of habit, so staying up late to seek shooting stars has become our normal routine.  Together, we&#39;ve probably seen over 75 shooting stars in the last 5 days, but what we saw last night was most certainly not like anything either of us has ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 3:15 am PST, my wife pointed at the sky to where she had just seen a bright flash of light between the constellation of Orion and Jupiter.  Being that we are very close to LAX, when I saw the blink of very bright white light a few seconds later, I immediately thought it was an airplane.  However the light did not appear to have any sort of intervaled blinking and it did not move.  It was Bright! Brighter than even Jupiter, which was to the NW of the flash.  Through my binoculars I saw the flash come and go about 4 times.  Each was abrupt, bright, and in the same spot between two very small distant stars. Based on the other celestrial and orbital objects around it, this light appeared to be coming from deep space.  No object or shape could be made out, but it lit up approx. 7 or 8 times within a minute and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve spent the last 24 hrs researching Weather Balloon citings, Iridium Flares, and other logical explanations for what we saw.  None of them have even come so close as to mimick our happenstance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, we&#39;re out here again tonight!  I don&#39;t see this curiousity ceasing ANYtime soon.<n>

The sky was 100% cloudy, with rain from time to time. Stars and the moon were not visible due to the storm clouds covering the area.  As I traveled south a bright colorful light (blue, green mostly) began to flash within the clouds making the surrounding clouds light up with different colors. I thought this very strange and kept watching as suddenly I could clearly make out several round lights begin to take form from within the clouds.  Like the sun shining through thick clouds during the day, theses lights seemed to be the same size, giving the illusion that it was no higher up than a water tower, but I knew from the foggy mist overlapping the lights that the object was higher up. The lights were now solid and the pulsing flash had stopped.  Theses lights were perfectly spaced from one another giving me the idea that they were apart of one solid object. I could not make out the shape d! ue to the object clearly being deep within the clouds above but the lights were so bright that they shined through with no problem.  The object was moving incredible slow about the same speed as you would see a flock of geese travel.  I quickly decided to pull over and try to video tape it with my phone. As I got out the object was moving slowly over me heading west, for as low as it seemed to be the object put off no sound.  The lights were now  brightly white and were round in shape.  As I watched the object travel above, it presented itself to me with a natural flow, like it belonged in the sky.  I began to try and film the object but my phone could not focus on the lights or anything else in the dark.  The object then began to disappear in some thicker clouds and the lights began to fade away until I could not see them anymore. I stood on the side of the road for 30 more seconds and the pulses began to appear again but further in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Lights formed a honey comb shape with another light in the center)    First draft i tried to make honey comb shape but after i sent it the shape then turned into a line. the object was a honey comb, pentagon shape.<n>

Perhaps two lights or three, with colors changing.  Appeared to be on the other side of the Willamette - perhaps far away to the west/northwest.  It swooped down, and to one side, then up, to the other side - graceful slow movement.   Finally, as I was talking to the local news station (KATU-TV)it gradually dropped toward the horizon, at a curving angle until I could not see it anymore behind the trees and tall house to west of our building.  Appeared rather far away, could only make out the movement and the colored lights (no more than 3 clustered together in no discernible shape).<n>

I live only 6 miles from the Kansas City airport so I am accustomed to seeing planes takeoff and land. I looked at it for a time and realized that it was making jerky movements preceded by a green flash. It was a light at high altitude, crescent shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for half an hour and it moved repeatedly, then I sighted two more in the southwest sky. I also witnessed what appeared to be planes with red and white flashing strobes, and I assumed that it was military observation of the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I sighted two more in the southern sky.  After 22:00 the lights from a nearby shopping center were dimmer and I was able to see more right overhead and in the eastern sky.  I became unable to count accurately due to the number of UFOs in the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until last night, November 6, 2012, election night, I have been a skeptic and now I am a believer. I phoned my sister in Syracuse, NY, who is professor emeritus SUNY, during this sighting, since she attends UFO conferences and is a staunch believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She questioned me and was sure that I was in fact witnessing an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked different from stars which appear as a bright light that twinkles sometimes and do not move in the manner of water bugs on surface tension on a body of water like these objects did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the exact duration of the event, because the election coverage was on TV and I went inside to see who was elected. I ceased watching at 22:00 and went back out at 00:30 and they were no longer there. The constellations had changed position, but that was all I saw in the skies by that time.<n>

They were at that time in what looked like an L shape and stayed there for about 30 seconds, before suddenly moving in a SE direction. They looked at this point to be moving very fast, faster than you would normally see airplanes traveling overhead.  As they advanced it became clear that each blinking light was singularly attached to an individual craft.  They stayed in a formation of two lined up, one further out ahead and then two off to each side of the center formation.  There were no additional lights (headlight, wing lights, etc.).  The blinking lights were blinking so fast that it was almost like they were twinkling.  As they passed overhead, we could hear the sound of multiple engines (jet?).<n>

Then they all just sat there for about 2 minutes and then left.  Then in the sky, a few miles to the left, an orb came.  After that orb, another one came right next to it and then in a single line, about 7 in total showed up.  But after the 3rd one came up, the first one slowly began to disappear, and when the 4th came, the second one began to disappear.  This happened slow at first then extremely fast, probably a whole 20 seconds in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This reminds me exactly like the Phoenix Lights<n>

I was turning off Princeton Road taking my daughter&#39;s friend home and this allowed us to park the car.  We got out and watched the lights which appeared round and orange in color.  They were not rapidly moving, but they were in motion.  I did not count but there was near 7 to 10 lights moving in random directions.  I could not tell how far or how big the lights actually were cause I did not any relative distance marker.  We watched near 20 to 30 seconds then the bright balls of light just disappeared.  My daughter compared the sight to an animated movie caused Tangels where Chinese lanterns were set off into the sky.  I don&#39;t know what we saw but it was an event unlike anything I have seen.  I am forty-five yrs age and never give! n UFO sightings much thought only in the movies.  But we saw something that may be can be explained by facts that I don&#39;t know about like Chinese lanterns or bright hot air balloons.

Not much higher in the sky than above the tree line.

They were all the same brightness, evenly spaced, and resembled sodium vapor street lights; they were orange in color.  They were no more than 5 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point. The lights were stationary during the minute or so that we viewed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is an adamant skeptic regarding UFOs.  Nonetheless, she readily admitted these lights looked &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;.  My wife and I both have bachelor&#39;s degrees in physics and we have both studied astronomy at the university level, including considerable observational experience.  Neither of us thought these lights looked &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a private pilot&#39;s license and I am familiar with the location and traffic patterns of all airports in the vicinity of Boulder.  Our line-of-sight to the unknown lights passed near the traffic pattern for the Rocky Mountain Regional Airport (RMRA) (formerly the Jefferson County Airport or &amp;quot;Jeffco&amp;quot;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> However I do not think these were conventional aircraft landing lights because  1) they were distinctly orange and not white;  2)  because normally we do not see landing lights from aircraft in the pattern at RMRA since the downwind leg for runway 29 R&amp;L points *away* from Boulder;  3) because there were *4* of them, all identical, evenly spaced, and they did not change their appearance at all during the minute or so we were observing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally, conventional aircraft landing lights only take on an unusually bright appearance (such as we observed) when they happen to be pointed directly at the observer, a condition that normally happens for only a few seconds when an aircraft is maneuvering in the pattern.  I was unable to imagine any plausible arrangement of conventional aircraft in the landing pattern that would produce the display of lights we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition I should mention that the line-of-sight from us to the unknown lights passed more or less directly over the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility.  The lights (if taken to be similar in brightness to aircraft landing lights) looked as though they were located right over the former nuclear facility.  Although Rocky Flats has not been used for nuclear weapon production in many years, the author is aware that UFOs are often sighted near sensitive military installations, and thus thought that this detail should be included in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was conflicted about whether to file this report or not, since we do have a large amount of conventional air traffic in our area at nearly all times, and therefore it is conceivable that what we saw was an unusual configuration of conventional aircraft.  However I decided to submit this report because I have thought about this sighting a number of times since it happened and I really am at a loss to explain those lights in a conventional manner.  Also, I reasoned that perhaps others saw these lights and may have already reported them, or, if not, perhaps my report will catalyze others into coming forward with corroborating information.  As far as I know there has been no mention in the local media about such lights, but I did not do a thorough search to confirm this.<n>

I assumed at first that it was a plane but was way too shiny and reflective and hovering.  There were some light clouds but the object was far below them.  I tried to determine a shape which I never figured out but it was too compact to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What intrigued me was how shiny it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching it, it just disappeared, no movement what so ever, just gone.<n>

On this day I watched a very loud B-1 bomber head out going NW and out of sight.  I thought it looked peculiar that there were only two very small clouds in the relatively clear low NW skyline.  So I&#39;m looking,and two more small clouds formed from thin air in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After retrieving my binoculars to try and determine the source, I saw no aircraft but one more puff of cloud emerged similar to how shaving cream would come foaming out of a can.  These were not contrails,and if this were exhaust from an aircraft, it would have to be hovering, yet I saw no craft present near them.Just then two of the Thunderbird jet team entered into the air going roughly in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the area of the clouds as the jets went out of sight.Just then I saw a brownish green craft that appeared saucer shaped dart across the sky at sonic speed coming from that vicinity headed SW.Within minutes four! fighter jets emerged from the AFB, flew around near the area of the clouds,then returned to the base.The small clump of clouds that appeared from nowhere stayed as cloud vapor and did not dissapate as smoke might.I watched them slowly drift NW within the relatively calm air current for a half hour.I&#39;ve never seen anything like this cloud birth before, and cannot possibly imagine an explanation for it.<n>

Choppers seemed to remain in the sky for the rest of the night as i saw one driving a few hours later and also heard another when i got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I give an estimate of 900+ feet for the elevation of the craft, and perhaps about the size of a good boat, quit a bit larger than a fighter jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F-18s, MiGs, at night, at day, flying high, low, supersonic, really slow, you name it. I have looked down the barrel an A-10 Warthogs&#39; Gatling gun.  I  have seen b-2 spirits, Stealth fighters, both parked and flying in close detail(although men guarded the F117 nighthawk) i have been in a V-22 Osprey helicopter, hueys, Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, freaking chinooks.  I have been on countless commercial aircraft of all make and size my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was NOT a known aircraft, to be certain. it demonstrated distinctly inhuman traits. if it was human, i conjecture top secret military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that this was certainly a &#39;craft&#39;, and not a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was NOT a meteor or balloon of any type.  It was not ball lightning. it was not an aurora,a moon halo, it was not swamp gas, sun dogs, it was not a lenticular cloud, or any other type of electromagnetic/plasma phenomenon. it was not gary busey eyeing the world dangerously as he travels in his home-made craft powered out of fear and childrens&#39; screams. it was not santa, it was not a satellite, it was not a missile test. as someone who is extensively familiar with both military/civilian aircraft and astronomical phenomenon, all i can say with absolute assurance is this was an unidentified, constructed object exhibiting inhuman traits flying in proximity to aircraft with zero explanation and no other way of seeing it was there (radar?) other than eyesight.<n>

11/5/12 22:20|Tacoma|WA|Light|5 minutes|Single low flying/floating/gliding ORANGE light in sky|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94236.html|644|ndxe201211| single low flying/floating/gliding ORANGE light in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work as usual. This occured between 22:15-22:25 PST. I was driving in a northerly direction, about 14 blocks away from my home when i noticed an orange light. At first glance i assumed it was a plane or aircraft of some kind. Then as I got closer, about 10 blocks away i noticed the light was still there, and it was rather large, not small like a plane light. I then as i was driving, I started watching for it to blink or fade away or turn like most planes in the area do. There were no other lights or aircraft lights or anything in the sky during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the light it was a little to the left of the road i was driving on, during the day there is a large tree at the end of the road where i turn and it was in that area. as I got closer the light had moved to the right side of the road. When I was about 8 blocks from home and still observing this light i decided to pull over to the side of the road because this was simply something i had never seen before. It was a VERY clear ORANGE light. Not flickering or flashing. It was roundish, maybe a little more oval than round, but overall just an VERY orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time i thought it was a paper lantern for 2 reasons: #1 because it was SOOO low to the ground..maybe 200 feet up. Maybe a little higher, it was night time so judging distance was hard but it was a large light (street lamp size) so I assumed it was rather near to the ground..much closer/lower than i&#39;ve ever seen a plane or even a helicopter. and #2 reason was because of the way it was moving. It wasnt moving at a fast speed like i would expect an aircraft or helicopter to move. In fact it&#39;s movement was more of a floating/gliding. However the longer i watched it the more i knew it was not a lantern, because it was a clear light, there was no lantern for a flame or anything to be encased in. It was a clear, orange light that was not flickering like a flame would. It was also very silent, i could not hear it passing by. there were no engines or blades or cars or music or any other type of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So when I pulled over the light floated to the left side of the street again, passing over the road, but i could not see a shape associated with the light, just the light..and it just slowly meandered across the houses and trees to the left of the road, 1-2 blocks over. there are about 2-3 blocks on the left side of the road then there is a cliff going into the Puget Sound.  I watched the light for about 2-3 minutes while i was pulled over.  I would expect a normal aircraft/helicopter would have passed out of my line of sight during 2-3 minutes and would be heading off wherever it was meant to be but after 2-3 minutes i got a little freaked out that I didnt know what this light was so i drove the rest of the way home.  I did not see the light again after i drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background/description:  I am not the kind of person looking for UFOs or strange sightings, i have never tried to see things like that.  I am deeply interested in astronomy and when it&#39;s not raining/cold outside i usually have my telescope out in my backyard looking at the stars/moon, however i have never seen an object that i could not identify.  Other than a few meteors i havent seen anything unusual in the skies during the past month or two here.  I still dont know what i saw except that it was like NOTHING i&#39;ve ever seen and i&#39;ve been looking at the stars all my life.  It wasnt until i described the situation to a pilot friend of mine that i thought it might be a UFO because he told me that there are no orange lights in aviation.  That is how i came across this website and why i decided to share my experience.<n>

It was a clear night.  Next we were looking at the bright stars, and looking at the sky overhead, at approx. 9:52 pm a very fast moving group of lights passed overhead, it was completely silent if it was an object, and it moved very fast, passing overhead in a matter of seconds.  It was V shaped or Chevron shaped, we both thought it was one huge flying object that was absolutely silent, it had what we perceived as four lights on each side.  Of course this could have been several separate lights moving in perfect unison, or a formation, but we perceived it as being a V shaped object.  The lights, four on each side of the V shape, were a soft light, she thought beige, I though beige but with an orange hue.  They were moving so fast, that maybe 10 seconds of good overh! ead viewing time was all we had, maybe less, after moving from an overhead position, as it moved south, it became invisible, that is to say it disappeared very quickly from view after being almost directly overhead.  I would call this a UFO, although I am skeptical and wonder if it isn’t just a military aircraft that I am not familiar with, but it would have to be completely silent, and really huge,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

These lights looked like an airplane making a turn in the sky. What caught our attention was the altitude of said lights.  They were low for the planes we normally see flying over that area.  The center light was almost a blue with the two other lights on either side of it being orange and equally distanced from the center one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four more lights appeared to the left of the three already visible lights.  The way they appeared was one right after the other, almost like the runway marker lights of an airport, one right after the other. As soon as the fourth new light, or seventh total light appeared, all seven went out simultaneously and were not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial three lights were seen over trees, and guessing distance, I would have to guess they were between the area of Highway 176 and Cypress Gardens Rd.  The other four lights that appeared were seen over 17-A.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All seven lights were in a perfect line and spaced equally apart from each other.  The furthest left light was at the highest altitude with the furthest right light being at the lowest altitude.  The best description of the lights were almost flare like without the long falling, strobing, associated with flares.  The lights appeared to never move direction.  It was like a light switch, first they were flipped on in sequence, then they were shut off all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background for this sighting was a clear dark night, with stars clearly visible in the sky.<n>

Bear with me, kind of a long, detailed story:  Flew back from FXE to TPF direct with my student tonight.  All of the Avon Park MOA&#39;s and Restricted areas were active/hot, and we could see about 6 F-16&#39;s (as per Miami center) dog fighting and practicing intercept procedures at 7000&#39; and above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon clearing the MOA and due east of Arcadia, what appeared to be a LED landing light abruptly popped on just above the cloud layer and immediately caught our attention.  It appeared to be about 500ft below us, at our 2 o&#39;clock and figured about 5-7 miles, and looked as if it might be in conflict in a few minutes.  The light then started flashing, presumably because he saw us up ahead crossing and wanted to make his position known.  I turned on our landing and taxi light of the 182 to acknowledge, yet this other aircraft kept turning this light on at odd and random intervals until he went dark for about a minute.  Fed up, I asked the Miami controller for a traffic advisory on the aircraft at our 2 o&#39;clock and about 3-4 miles.  He responded that he didn&#39;t observe any traffic in the area.  A little puzzled, I asked him if he had any primary targets in the area and he told me to standby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A long 15 seconds passed by and the light appeared again!  This time it appeared to now be at our 1 o&#39;clock but the light still pointed at us (?) and then quickly went out again.  The controller came back on and said that he had checked and rechecked his backup systems and assured me that there were NO primary(pure radar return) targets in the area.  Just when he said that, an aircraft behind us a few miles asked where we were, the controller told him, and that pilot reported that he was watching all of this happen AS well!  Then a third aircraft also chimed in and said he too was seeing the strange light and it was moving across the sky rapidly.  Three aircraft in all saw this.  The controller was completely bewildered at this point....needless to say, upon landing, I called up Miami Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked on the phone for 20 minutes to the D-Side of the sector I was in, who turned out to be a supervisor and was training the R-Side.  He too was sufficiently freaked out and confused along with the rest of the guys on &#34;the floor.&#34;   He said that in his 27 years, he had odd occurrences like this every few years and they usually turned out to be flares IN the MOA but never in this location, intermittent, and underneath another aircraft moving laterally.  He thought that it was a UAV (which is of course illegal to operate in the NAS), and that if it was, it could have been much closer to our aircraft than we had thought (that&#39;s always comforting to hear) and it would also explain why it was not on their radar if it was small enough.  I chimed in and figured that it started turning its lights on and off in an effort to avoid us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a flare or laser.  It changed position laterally and maintained its altitude.<n>

Each light traveled about 1.5 miles at an altitude of about 250 ft before it disappeared from view and was replaced by another, aloft from the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through 10x25 Nikon binoculars I watched someone on the opposite beach involved in launching the last two of these lights.  Flashing a 5mW green laser in that direction seemed to have an affect: no further lights arose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately driving around the Milford marina to this opposite shore of the Gulf, I met a group of partiers around a bonfire who admitted to launching several kong ming type paraffin sky lanterns.  Two of these which failed to go aloft were still on the beach for me to examine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MYSTERY SOLVED:  Milford obviously has more than its share of hot-air balloon/sky lantern users in various areas.  These are not necessarily hoaxers, mostly folks just out to have some fun.  The “swarm” of dozens of lights which I reported taking place on 10/13 originated from a sports bar/restaurant – some sort of celebration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Therefore, to save others undue waste of time and effort, I offer… ANATOMY OF A FAUX UFO:  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BRIGHT FLAMING ORB WITH A HAZE AROUND IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF IT APPEARS CIRCULAR, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHANGE INTO A CYLINDER, OR HAVE A CYLINDER ATTACHED TO IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF IT LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE INSIDE A BUBBLE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT IF RESEMBLES A FLARE ATTACHED TO A PARACHUTE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT THE BRIGHT LIGHT FLOATS OR GLIDES SOUNDLESSLY OVERHEAD ONLY TO FLICKER AND/OR SUDDENLY WINK OUT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF IT SEEMS FLAME-LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YELLOW-ORANGE-RED, AND ITS FLAME SEEMS TO BE SWAYING OR WAVERING, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize how unusual these things appear – particularly since I have witnessed some types of them being launched right in front of me, and still could not determine what I was observing after a two month lookout!  However, this is a very popular fad and these things are plentiful, easily available and cheap.  So expect more of them just about everywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truth shall set you free.<n>

I was driving East, just at the peak of a large hill that looks over about 10 miles of land and straight out to the Atlantic Ocean, when the object flew by going South-East.  It was in and out of my broad view all within 1 second - maybe even less. In relation to the airplanes in the sky at that same time, it looked to be higher up in elevation.  As far as it&#39;s size, it was at least 10-15x larger than the light of the airplanes.  It had no &#39;tail&#39;, just a very large, very bright, fast moving blue/green ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just me in the car that night, and there were no other travelers on this hill at the time other than me...  Which makes my story hard to explain to my friends and family.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a meteor, asteroid, airplane, UFO, anything.  All I know is that I have never seen anything like it - online or in person.<n>

I looked to my right, and saw something falling in the sky.  It appeared to be an asteroid or falling object.  It had a rather large tail behind it.  It was a bluish-greenish light, quite bright.  It fell very quickly; I saw it for approximately 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it came to a dead stop in the sky, while simultaneously turning red, as if it were a brake light. The red light appeared to be rather large and oval in shape.  This happened over a fraction of a second, then the object completely disappeared. I am curious to know what it could have been.<n>

It was approx 5:02pm and dusk was approaching.  At first I thought I was seeing an optical illusion, because it looked like there was a tear in the cloud overhead.  Then I thought I was seeing a shooting star or meteor because it most definitely was not a plane, but I realized it wasn&#39;t moving or flickering at all it was constant!  What I saw was to the right about midway up my windshield.  It was bright amber light and stationary.  It was cigar shaped and at a 45 degree angle like this: /  I did a double take, thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me and when I refocused my attention on the sky, I noticed that there were multiple &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; lights...again all stationary and at a constant brilliance, at varying distances.  In addition to the closest one, which was the most noticable, I realized that there were at least 2 more in the same direction (looking toward the Chichester Ave. Exit sign), but further in the distance - like toward Brandywine Creek State park.  The 4th I noticed disctinctly to the left in my range of sight, more toward the direction of the Delaware river.  I could not pull off due to the volume of traffic, but mkept my focus on the objects until they fell out of my range of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see all 4 objects throughh the trees until about the split for 495 south.  Once I got onto 495 South, I could only still see one of the objects.  It had gotten very faint like it had travelled a great distance in an instant.  It was as if it had moved from the direction of the Brandywine Creek State Park more toward the direction of Kennett Square PA, but it could also be a result of the route I was traveling.  I called the hotline at about 5:09 pm, and was instructed to complete this form when I got home.  I have always believed in extraterrestrial life, however, I am extremely logical, and pragmatic.  I have NEVER in my life experienced anything as distinctly concrete as this sighting that would lead me to filing a report, but I very much want to find validation that I&#39;m not the only person that witnessed this event.<n>

It was a good distance away and blocked partially by trees and branches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trying to get a better view I created some shaky video, but I assure you, this object sat completely still.

(I lost the flying off in the viewfinder behind trees and house roofs, so sorry no footage of it.)

They were alternating like police lights, but they were a yellow color.  I did not think this was a ufo.  I thought it was strange, certainly.  But I thought maybe someone was in the courtyard (I live in an apartment complex) walking with a flashlight and that the light from the flashlight was reflecting off of my window frame.  However, the lights then did something I could not explain - they darted across the window within less than a second!  It&#39;s possible that it was not a UFO, but I don&#39;t know what else it could have been.  I&#39;m curious to see if anyone else saw this.<n>

They were good size objects. One moment you could see them clearly and then they just vanished.  After I turned the corner down another street, I looked up in the sky and they re-appeard and for about 5 minutes and slowly moved west and then vanished.  Very strange. I have never seen anything like that before. I could tell they were not planes.<n>

At first I thought it might be the spotlight from Mystic Lake, but I was wrong because it wasn&#39;t a beam of light it was an orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get my roomate to see and he said him and his friend seen the same thing a few nights ago.  Then he looked to the west and hovering just above the neighbors trees was a huge object which my roomate commented was the Mothership and thats exactly what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb itself was a light white greenish color and round the &amp;quot;Mothership&amp;quot; had faded lights all around it and a green hue behind it.  I have never seen anything so spectacular in my life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch for about 10 mins and the orb just kept circling and the &amp;quot;Mothership&amp;quot; just stayed hovering.  I went back out about an hour later and they were both gone---<n>

I live near enough to a major airport, and thought it might have been a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I realized there were no other flashing lights on this orb, it was just a steady color, (and planes generally have flashing indicators on the outside, especially a blue light.)   As I watched it, it seemed to actually gain altitude, since it seemed to get smaller and a little dimmer.  As it was dark, it was unusually bright for city lights, and because it was cloudy and rainy, I knew I wasn&#39;t just watching stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am generally a logical person, but I just have no explanation for this.  It went from SW to NE (towards the mountains) I would have watched it longer, but I lost it behind the heavier clouds.<n>

We were just driving home and it cut across the sky right in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very close to it and our best guess is that it was a very small meteorite.  There was no sound and we couldn&#39;t see where it hit. However, there was a lighter patch of sky, a slight glow, in the direction where the object appeared to originate.

The one in the lower right corner was wavering a little and then one by one they faded out like a flame running out of oxygen.  The sky was black and hazy and only one star (or planet) could be seen through the haze but these were slightly brighter and easily noticed with all the street lights on.  When we came to a stop at the stoplight, there was an electrical wire passing between us and them so it was easy to tell they weren&#39;t moving except for the lower right one.  As they stayed in one spot in the sky as we were driving, like a star, we could tell that they were some distance away, perhaps in the atmosphere?  Apparently, others around town also saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were brighter than stars and all of them glowed orange in color.  After they vanished i heard faint rumbling sounds like thunder for about 30 seconds in the sky.  This was not very high in the sky either....from my view point the lights were maybe 300-500 feet in the air.  I noticed flashing lights from aircraft shorty afterwards flying around and through the area.<n>

You could see the light shimmering in the sky, so to be sure it was not a star I went and got my rifle scope.  After staring at it through the rifle scope I noticed orange lights gaining altitude on the horizon.  These lights then connected into the stationary light.  It then got very bright for a split second as the lights intersected.  The orange lights then began to rise vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then began to start moving towards my direction.  As it was moving I noticed it was in a linnear pattern of four orange lights with a strobing white light flashing beneath it.  As it continued to move I then looked at it through my rifle scope and saw the lights then transform into a triangle of 3 orange lights with a white light on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on its course and as it passed, it made a strange &#34;voooooooooooom&#34; noise in a deep low octave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3-5 minutes pass..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned outside to smoke another cigarette while I called my friend in Georgia, who has seen alot of UFO activity in his area.  While I called him I saw another light similar to the initial strobing light of multiple colors -- begin to rise from the horizon and then after a minute or two  It disapeered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side Note - When I first sited the initial light I ran inside to tell my dad and brother I saw a UFO, and my brother watched as the lights intersected and the orange lights began to fly and change formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw -- multiple UFO anomalies in the sky.  Possibly a plane?   I don&#39;t believe so, aliens are a very real thing in this vast universe.  Keep your eyes on the stars....you will never know when you see one..<n>

I didn&#39;t believe him at first, but as he went on and on about these strange lights I decided to go for a drive and see if I could see them for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured if he was telling the truth they would have probably dissapeared by now though.  Strangely enough as I was pulling up to where he had told me to go I did infact see 5 bright lights lined up in the sky they were too big and bright to be stars and they couldn&#39;t have been any sort of aircraft because they stood completly still. I was in shock, I couldn&#39;t believe I was actually wittnessing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached over to grab my phone to record it then I realized I had forgotten my phone at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed back home to grab my phone.

They were moving at extreme speed and after a second or two started crossing each other&#39;s paths, back and forth.  They looked like dull stars moving across the sky and were definitely not any manmade object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up next to an air force base and their speed was as fast as a shooting star, not any aircraft, and they were changing direction in a flash, zigzagging, which seemed impossible.  There was a definite pattern exact to each other and they were gone in about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing amongst trees so could not follow them for too far.  We are both logic and intelligent people that saw it and I am 100% sure that it was no meteorite or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did look at first that they were entering our atmosphere, similar to shooting stars, but then started moving across the sky, not coming down towards earth.  They were also travelling hundre! ds of times faster than satellites, which we were looking for.  These were something made by someone clearly able to manoeuvre in a very exact manner, only so fast it seemed incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound as they passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting was reported at 19:30 hrs.

So I was working in the backyard today (Sunday, Nov 4th, 2012) and stopped to take a break. This was around noon.  I was looking at the beautiful New Mexcio clear blue sky.  Looking directly north up at the sky at about 50 degrees, a white object appeared out of nowhwere.  It started off slowly and began moving in a straight line directly east towards the Sandia Mountains.  I couldn&#39;t gaug e how big the object was nor how high it was.  It appeared to be pretty high, object was small and appeared white.  As it moved east, it slowly picked up speed and then &amp;quot;whoosh!&amp;quot;, .... it went so fast it was gone in a heartbeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I consider myself a pretty level headed person.  I&#39;m not big on conspiracy theories, contrail chemicals, government cover-ups, or .... UFOs.  But ..... I know what I saw. I live in Paradise Hills was was looking north when I saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Question:  Did anyone else in the Albuquerque area see this?  No .. I wasn&#39;t drinking nor taking drugs.

I was looking east when I noticed a bright orange/red light in the sky.  Upon a second look I noticed two more identical lights.  The lights were aligned like the 3 points of a triangle.  I could not see a solid object between the lights but the way they moved together made me believe they were part of a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were above the tree line and appeared to be very close to me.  I was worried that while I was sitting there the object/lights were going to fly over my house.  They appeared to be much lower than an airplane would fly.  I would estimate that they were approximately 100-200 feet in the air, maybe higher but definitely below the light cloud cover.   I remember thinking that when the object flew over, it was so low that I would be able to see all the detail and that frightened me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were gliding very slowly, not wavering from their position in the triangle and moving in a westerly direction.  The lights were circular in shape and were about 5 times brighter and larger than the brightest/largest star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights for about 10 minutes as they moved west, toward me, then they began to slowly fade until they appeared no brighter or larger than the average star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish, in retrospect, that I had grabbed my camera but I was too scared/in awe to go get it while the event was happening.  After the lights faded I immediately went inside and woke my husband but it was too late, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 30 year old mother of two with a 4 year degree from a reputable university.  I am an admitted skeptic.  I have never witnessed anything like this before.<n>

I actually went outside to star gaze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes as I look straight over my head I see this big object that looked like it was on fire.  It mimiced fire exactly, that&#39;s the only way to describe it.  It had to of been a few thousand feet up but it had to of been huge to look as big as it did that high up.  It was a hard shape to make out because it moved so fast but it could only have been a wide V shape or disc.  I only saw it for a few seconds but I saw it leave a trail like you see in Star Trek, I&#39;m guessing because it was so fast.  Then it disappeared in a blink without a trace and I heard a mini sonic boom after.  There were no planes around and I&#39;ve heard them make sonic boom but none this faint but I know what I heard.<n>

They were red and orange colored and looked like a small flame around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my truck over and got out to get a better look at them.  I did not hear no sound in the sky.  I tried to take pictures of these objects with my camera phone but as I aimed my camera toward the sky all I could get was a black screen.

After hovering for a few moments at a curiously low altitude, it began rapidly flying toward us.  The object grew intensely brighter as it moved closer. It flew directly over us and toward the western horizon.  As it flew over us, we thought we were able to make out a dark, triangle shape craft, but the lights on the craft were so intensely bright, that it was difficult to tell for certain. The bright amber colored light that we had initially seen in the distance  was at its &#34;tail&#34; a smaller red light at it&#39;s &#34;nose,&#34; and two extremely bright, white, flashing strobe like lights on its &#34;wings.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large and flying at an unusually low altitude. It was not silent, but oddly quiet for how low it appeared to be flying. I don&#39;t know that I can even describe what it sounded like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch planes fly over toward the Eastern Iowa Airport on a nightly basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This looked and sounded like no plane I have ever seen.<n>

Off to the right (East) was something in the sky.  It was dark out.  The object was about 5 kilometres away and perhaps a thousand to fifteen hundred feet up (perhaps at 20 degrees rise from the horizon).  There were three bright white lights, each on for about a third of a second.  They took turns turning on in rapid succession.  The object had one pale white light on the whole time, about centered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other airplanes were flying in the area, at least three were preparing to land at Toronto Pearson airport, 30 km to the East (they had their headlights on in the clouds as they approached overhead).  This was NOT an airplane.  It seemed not to travel in any direction.  Two of us saw this.  It then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later it appeared further away, maybe 8km? and at ten degrees to the horizon (just a hair above the faraway trees).  We were driving this whole time, then lost sight of the object. about 2 minutes elapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.  Never have I seen questionable objects in our skies, but three times now it has occurred in the past four weeks!   And this time I was not alone!!<n>

We noticed a very bright red light, seemingly motionless high in the sky to the west.  After watching it for a couple of minutes we noticed it moving very slowly in our direction (moving west to east).  There was no sound and the area around us was quiet except for the waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to get larger as it descended in our direction and at one point we considered moving since it appeared as if it may land on the beach.  As it came closer we noticed it was triangular in shape, red outside with an orange triangular outline in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained out over the water (south of us) as it passed nearly directly in front and above, altitude unclear since we do not know the size of the object.  As it passed it gained altitude, appearing smaller as it rose.  We watched it gain altitude until it disappeared from sight above, and by then to the east. This took about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: from our location, the coastline wraps in a southwest curve with low mountains in our sight line to the west.  The light first appeared descending from high in the sky to the west rather than from over the mountains.<n>

At that time we both noticed a small light moving directly above the highway which appeared to be moving from South to North directly above the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time we stopped at the top of the hill at the intersection of Otlahurst Drive and US Rt 250.  I get out of the car and I see the object moving very slowly in what appeared to be a North to South direction.  It appeared to be moving directly above the Tygart River from this vantage point.  I got my ipone out and shot video of the object for approximately 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the point I got tired of shooting, and then right after I stopped, the object disappeared into the sky or clouds.  It was very cloudy on this evening and it is possible that our view was blocked by the clouds.  It did appear to be very low in the sky.   Possibly 300 feet or less above the ground.  At first we thought it could ha! ve been a helicopter.  But there was absolutely no noise.  Then we thought it could have been a balloon that somebody illuminated somehow.<n>

I noticed orange/yellow pulsating lights ascending from the north/east part of the sky.  First I thought they were the street lights but there were too many of them and they were forming patterns, there were about 12 orange/yellow orbs. They were orange in the middle and yellow around them. They looked like pulsating balls of energy.  I watched them for for five minutes across the street before calling my wife. I told her to go outside and look east but her view from our home was obstructed and too far away.  They formed into two circle patterns and then broke away from each other and then reformed into two circles again.  I watched them for another 5 minutes and came home.  I grabbed the video camera and went back to the store, all but two had left.  I tried to record them but they wouldn&#39;t show up on the camera.  And then a few minutes later they both extinguished.   Also when I arrived back for the second time there was an ambulance and firetruck in the parking lot where I had seen them and the paramedics had loaded someone into the ambulance.  The orbs had been right over where the ambulance and firetruck were and I&#39;m not sure if that was just a coincidence.  My feeling of the objects was just amazement and awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened I posted my sighting on the Mufon website. Well on November 7 I had another experience.  I was at the store the same store where I had first saw these orbs and went to swipe my rewards card and all 4 of the self checkouts simultaneously froze.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it but then about ten minutes later I was at a drive through restaurant and saw one singular orb, the same color and distinction as the previous ones.  I went to ask a group of people if they saw it too, turned around and it was gone.  Now this was bizarre.  When I told my wife she became concerned and told me that the only way to get rid of them is through prayer and she prayed that they will leave me alone.  Haven&#39;t seen anymore, but I am still curious.  I don&#39;t know what the hell they were.  I didn&#39;t follow up with Mufon because it is scary and I don&#39;t want any investigation as to what they are,  I don&#39;t think that I want to know.  Someone said they could be plasma balls controlled by magnetism, but I&#39;m not sure what I believe or who is responsible.<n>

I then wen home to call my father and i felt as though they were hovering over my house although i did not see them..... My phone was rejecting calls to my father which my dad has never nor never wold restrict my calls, there was t! remendous scrambling on the phone.  It rejected my phone call to him about 9 times. then i woudl get phone calls and i would answer and it would be all scrambly. I KNOW FOR A FACT WHATEVER I SEEN WAS DOIGN THIS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did eventually call my dad on that phone and he was no longer rejecting my phone calls. It seemed as though it was something different every time one time it would be rejected and another time it was no longer in service, which my father has an answering machine.  I truly believe  whatever i seen was of a demonic force and was very upset to my testimony of Jesus Christ.  I do know in the book of ezikel there are these objects seen by him as well.  I am not sure if this was demonic or of something of that manner. I know i seen what i saw i always thought ufos were fake.  THEY INDEED ARE NOT.  i believe whatever it is can watch things. this happened after a testimony on facebook and rember about my phone line. whatever they are have the power of technology.<n>

Each light emitted a rolling sound, but not like thunder, more like the sound of a bomb detonation.  There are no known military test sites in this area.   These flashes were also seen at the same time in the same location, the night before (on 11/02/2012.)  However, on the previous night, there was no noticeable noise that accompanied the flashes.  We managed to capture the flashing via cell phone video camera.<n>

As he crossed main st he saw a woman standing beside her car looking at the object and he called and told me to go outside and see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (apparent size of an aspirin) was almost overhead when I went out and it looked like a ring of red pulsing light or red flame with a yellow center.  When it was off to my south over Jordan lake it suddenly turned dim and shrunk, disappeared, then briefly lit up dimly and was gone. It may have gone into clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was preparing to go back inside I saw another one coming from the north.  At this time I called my daughter across town and she and her husband went out side.  My husband was home now and he called my mother outside.  The second object looked the same as the first did going over but just a little past overhead the bright lights went out and we could see a grey glowing circle (Smaller than an asprine) with one small red light at the edge.  The light circled the edge several times then stopped in one place.  The object continued to the SW getting dimmer intil it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were too fast and too steady for a balloon and they made no noise at all.  From my daughter&#39;s house (4 blocks east of me) they saw the second object to their west side-on and it looked like a ball of red flame with a yellow center going horizontally and they lost it behind trees and buildings.  My mother saw the second object as a red light but couldn&#39;t make out the grey circle.  She said she saw a red ball the size of an orange later that night(we went to bed around 10PM and it was after that) out her east facing bedroom window and ran to turn the lights off for a better view but it was gone when she got back to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite objective and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  Please see her illustration on our website.  PD))<n>

I was looking for deer that sometimes graze the grass in the ball field when it cought my eye.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it until it dawned on me it wasn&#39;t moving nor did it have any blinking lights on it.  It was average red brightness but what happened next is why I am somewhat perplexed.  It never moved nor did it change shapes or colors for around 15-25 seconds and then all of the sudden it split into 4 or 5 little balls and the little balls shot off instantly and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 47 and am certain it wasn&#39;t an airplane nor some type of fireworks or floating candle like a Chinese lantern.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.my wife says it wasn&#39;t an airplane either and she was laughing at me when I first told her to look up and see it saying &amp;quot; that&#39;s just an airplane&amp;quot;. It was silent and there was a light northerl! y wind but it was unseasonably warm for that time of year.<n>

There are many wind turbines in this area and we had just finished ascending a relatively steep hill when we saw what we thought was, at first, a shooting star.  However, unlike a shooting star, the light did not dissipate and the tail did not break up rapidly.  Instead, the object (and its long tail) maintained a strong, vibrant white light with what I saw to be brilliant blue undertones.  It appeared to be following a downward trajectory that, in relation to the horizon was angled at approximately 12 degrees.  Its descent toward the outlying areas of Goldendale was extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were surprised to find no mention of this occurrence in today’s local news headlines as we were certain that this object was headed toward the Earth’s surface and would, most likely, make a significant impact.<n>

The shape of UFO is the combination of two hemispheres up and down with a dish between them.  The radius of dish is twice of that of hemisphere.  I guess that it is the typical UFO shape. Its color is bright silver. It seems that they play around there. They flight up and down so easily and in curved path. In addition to that, the smooth and sharp curves are observed in the path of the UFO.  They disappear and appear in the sky.  The speed of UFO is amazing.  Since I saw the flight in the sky, I can compare between the UFO and the airline.  I can tell that the UFO can flight at least several times faster than the airline.  I think there are at least more than 10 UFOs.  The maximum number of UFO in my camera at the same time was 7.  Since there was no cloud in the sky and they were in the high altitude, it was not easy for people to observe it.  I don&#39;t think other people observed them.  I asked one of my friends to see that.  He was taking a nap at the moment.  He missed it.  When I moved to the other place to get a tripod, but I could not observe them for the brightness from the sun.  My apartment has a door to the east.  Because of appropriate shield, I could find them.  They were above me and a little bit in the east.<n>

My boyfriend noticed right around the time I did (and he was driving--that&#39;s how noticeable this object was).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object disappeared, we both turned to each other and said, &#34;Did you just see that?&#34; During the observation, we were both so stunned by what we were seeing that neither of us could speak.

One emitted a &amp;quot;search light&amp;quot; &amp;  they all disappeared in depth int<n> <n><n> <n><n> Marina Del Rey, CA just before 11:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I had just laid down to go to bed.  We have a clear view of flight path for LAX.  Looked out our window and saw two glowing orbs that we thought were helicopters that were approaching, possibly looking for someone in the peninsula area, which is not atypical.  They were not moving very fast, they had an odd glowing red light unlike an airplane or helicopter- the orbs were slowly pulsating rather than blinking and the light was much brighter than any landing gear or anything.  I thought they were possibly far off on the other side of LAX, but an airplane had just taken off and clearly passed behind one of the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third orb appeared and was in line of the other two.  The first orb turned towards the sea, and a fourth appeared in line behind the third.  I thought it was weird that they were so close and yet there was no sound like you would expect to hear from a helicopter, so I jumped up to observe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one, which had turned, was no longer red (perhaps the red was only in front) and proceeded out towards the sea in a straight line until the light simply disappeared into a pinhole size.  It was not like a shooting star, it simply faded like it disappeared in depth.  The fourth orb appeared to be about over the water channel and a light suddenly appeared to illuminate a large area (perhaps over the water) to the east of the orb, BUT there was no light trail emitting  from the orb, there was no visible  &amp;quot;spotlight&amp;quot; on the red orb, and the illumination was pinkish purple.  I watched these orbs turn out to the sea, and one by one they slowly shrank into pinhole size lights before they disappeared.  The orbs never appeared to bank and did not follow any common flight pattern.  I thought perhaps they were small planes, yet a small plane pasted a few minutes later- you could hear the small plane and it did not appear to shrink as the orbs did about ten m! inutes before.  Last night was extremely clear, and all the ai! rplanes in the area were flying in typical patterns, they banked out over long beach as typical and never appeared to shrink and disappear as the orbs had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an unexplainable phenomenon.  I have grown up flying in small planes, including at night time, and these orbs were nothing like airplanes.  They flew low like helicopters but had no sound.  The light they emitted was so bright you could not actually see their shape.  The light that the fourth orb emitted over such a large area should presumably come from a visible spot from the craft- there was no &amp;quot;spotlight&amp;quot;.  These orbs disappeared more quickly and in such an odd fashion that it looked like an optical illusion… The pictures you have posted over the marina with the glowing orbs look like the same ones that were hovering over the Marina last night…..<n>

Wondering about the weather for the next day, I looked up to see if the cloud cover was still solid.  For a moment I saw nothing, then thought I saw a bright star. I quickly realized the “star” was moving at a fairly rapid pace, heading from south to north.   As I watched, I realized there was no break in the clouds – it was solid overcast and still raining lightly.  As I ran through what the object might be, I thought jet plane at first. It was much too fast for a small prop plane or a helicopter, but the speed could have looked like how a low jet might appear.  I don’t think it could have been a plane though, since it was only a solid bright white light – no flashing lights light an aircraft would have.  I thought it must be a satellite, but thought a satellite would be much higher, and above the high cloud cover.  Then, the thing that puzzles me happened. The object had been clearly visible the entire time, and was moving steadily, with no variation in the intensity of the light, or the direction or speed.  Then without slowing, it stopped short and remained stationary.  I stayed and watched for about 5 minutes, and the thing just stayed there, perfectly stationary.<n>

I am white, 55 years old, and retired from the Navy a little over a year ago after 22 years of service. My Top Security Clearance is still active, though I am currently fully retired and not working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently went on an Elk hunting trip with my brother who is 53, in the Boise National Forest.  On the night of November 2nd, we were camped a couple of miles outside of Centerville, Idaho in heavy timber country.  We were sitting around the campfire marveling at how clear a beautiful the stars in the sky were when you are out in the middle of nowhere with no city lights near you to hamper the view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten up to go and get something in the camper on the back of the pickup and was looking at the sky as I walked to the camper.  When I got to the rear of the pickup, on particularly bright star suddenly caught my eye. I can remember being confused when I first saw it and thinking, “what the heck is that”?   The light coming off the thing looked just about the same color as the light coming off all the stars, except that it was substantially brighter than any other star in the sky, including the North Star, and about every 2 seconds it would pulsate to a very bright dark red color.  At first that made me think it must be an airplane, but there was no green light at all and the movements this thing made were impossible for any normal aircraft.  Also, the brightness of the lights seemed to shimmer because of its movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there watching this thing for a couple of minutes and then yelled for my brother (who is a small plane pilot) to come look at this thing.  He came walking over, watched it for a few seconds and said, “What the hell”?  We watched this thing for a good 15 minutes make movements no normal plane of any kind could possibly make and at speeds that are equally impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how far away the thing was from us. If I had to guess, I would say it could be anywhere from 60 to as much as 120 miles maybe.  There was no sound associated with it and it had 3 very definite patterns to its movements which I would describe in the following way.  Picture the little + in the very center of a rifle scope.  This thing seemed to have the very center of that + as the center point around which all of its movements took place.  The first was straight up and down and straight side to side movements along the axis of that cross.  The second was a circular movement all around the outside edge of the +.  The third was the most incredible of all. It would make diagonal movements in both diagonal directions through the center of the +, but when it made this movement is was 3-5 times longer than its straight up and down or side to side movements.  At the distance that thing was from us, those diagonal movements in particular had to represent a distance of mile! s and it would do it in a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure wish I would have had a camcorder with me, but at least I got to see it for myself and for several minutes.  It was pretty extraordinary and exciting!  Feel free to contact me if you would like, but I think I have pretty much covered what we saw!<n>

Sphere appears quite often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I go outside regularly to smoke a cigarette, my wife usually joins me.  Her and I have seen an object East of where we live.  As I try to keep an eye on whatever it is, it moves in uniform.  However, I checked the times of this objects appearance, for it only seems to appear around 11PM to 12AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, this object doesn&#39;t seem to be an airplane, because, it is stationary.  When it does decide to move, it moves like no helicopter I&#39;ve seen.  It moves in a darting motion, for an instant stopping hover. There seems to be no noise but, the object it quite far East of where we are located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have been very interested in aircraft, this object seems to be nothing of this world. But, it has lights that look to sparkle like a stars glowing twinkle.  At a distance, I thought it were to be an aircraft because, it looks like the lights that glow from it could be red and green.  However, what makes me believe this to be no standard aircraft is the way it moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a feeling it could be a military experiment, for it appears at the same time, several nights out of the week.  I have just started documenting sightings because; I see this object quite often. My wife has also witnessed this object, and pointed it out to me.  As I have seen this object before, just never mentioned it to her because, I didn’t want her to think I was a crazy person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance times are: 11 PM-12 AM, East of Burnsville, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object description: The object is a circular shape, like looking at a floating ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Color: Looks like a silver ball, bright swirling illumination (Lights could be; red, green, orange, white).  The object’s color is too difficult to see without a telescope, and or binoculars.  However, object can be seen VERY clearly, to know it’s there.<n>

The condo is on a Georgia island in the Atlantic ocean.  The night sky was clear with the final stage of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was the first to notice a dull orange sphere floating above the condo unit opposite of where we were observing.  It appeared to move and float without a sound.  The sphere seemed to be traveling along the beach, but then made a 90 degree turn and headed out over the ocean, disappearing in the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This same route and sequence was soon repeated by 5 or more other, identical looking dull orange spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was observed for approximately one minute or less.?<n>
11/1/12 22:10|Leighton Buzzard (UK/England)||Sphere|5 minutes|Two seperate fast moving orange spheres observed within 5 mins - Bedfordshire UK|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94131.html|764|ndxe201211| Two seperate fast moving orange spheres observed within 5 mins - Bedfordshire UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst smoking in my back garden (back yard for US readers), looking into the sky I noticed a bright orange light approaching from the SW.  At first I though it was a low flying aircraft. The constant orange glow and absence flashing wing lights triggered my curiosity.  The time it took for the object to track accross the sky was approximately 10 seconds.  What was particularly noticeable was the total lack of noise, it&#39;s dead straight line of flight and identical brightness viewed from front and rear (certainly not aircraft landing lights).  Having witnessed two separate similar events approximately two years ago my hairs on the back of my neck started to tingle.  Within a minute of this sighting I notice an identical orangey light ball approaching from exactly the same point in the sky.  It seemed to be flying exactly on the same track at the same speed.  This time l reached for a pair of binoculars.(8x30 Carl Zeiss).  The binoculars gave me a very clear view of t! he orangey ball.  The ball looked like it was a perfect sphere emitting a constant bright orange glow, there also appeared to be a very slight ultra violet iridescence glow similar to burning meths.  Having witnessed similar events three times now, I am still unsure if these balls are solid or gassious?   The local weather conditions at the time of the above sightings were a crisp cold night with extremely good visability.  Both stars and high flying aircraft were crystal clear to naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time I have seen these strange events they have been traveling at similar altitudes, my guess would be between 500/1000 feet.  My guess as to size would be about 1 to 2 metres or 3 to 6 ft in diameter (I could be completely wrong with these estimates, however it is what my eyes and brain were telling me each time)  The first time I witnessed these red balls (approximately 2yrs ago) I saw 2 balls traveling together in a straight line at a much higher speed in a southerly direction.  Two weeks later l saw a singular ball travelling - in a westerly direction!  I did speak about what I had seen to my wife and friends and decided drop the subject of conversation after feeling like everybody was giving me strange looks and suggesting I drop the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since seeing the red balls in the sky last Thursday night I have done a little internet researching.  It appears these sightings have been going on since WW2. (check Foo Fighters see wikipedia). There also seems to be a significant increase in sightings just recently according to other UFO websites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53 years old with a degree in physics and have good eye sight and questioning mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has certainly got me thinking!  If someone had told me the above story before I had seen it for myself, I would have thought they were barking mad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe I should give up smoking in the garden and stay in doors!<n>

It was coming straight at me but then did an immediate u-turn and slowly went back over the trees.

When above the freeway over between the Tacoma Dome and McKinley Park area there was an object that had made this sharp turn that looked like an equilateral triangle with 3 orange lights at each tip and another red glowing light on the center. what caught my eye was the sharp turn that it made showing the four lights on the bottom of the craft.  I told my Mom about the craft and she told me it was probably the Stealth flying low, as I had told my Mom that I had seen that flying over by McChord Air Force Base years ago.  I explained to her that the this was much bigger than the Stealth and that the shape was wrong and that when I had seen it at night it was per the News Tribune a test flight to see how the plane would react to our rainy weather up here in Tacoma VS California. Of note the I-5 Highway was damp on the road where t! he cars didn&#39;t drive due to rain earlier that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down on the freeway and continued to watch the object as I got closer to the McKinley Park and Tacoma Dome area the object floated over the McKinley Park Hill, and disappeared over the hill.  I thought once I got around the curve to the exit for highway 16 I could see if the flight path was over the freeway going into Joint Base Lewis McChord, the normal flight path for the cargo and jet planes that fly into the base.  In the 3 mins it took to get to the exit there was nothing. No planes in the air, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ended my call to my Mom when I got home a few mins later.  That weekend I asked our MUFON State Director about what color the lights are on a normal aircraft and he told me.  Since then I have been trying to locate any aircraft with lights like that and I cannot find any<n>

I decided to go outside on my balcony to enjoy the stars, since I miss the New Mexico night skies, and also smoke a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the stars, I noticed a circular light, a little bigger than the size of a star in the sky, moving in a straight line above me from the north heading south.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see another circular light, the same size as the first light, coming in from the right (west) perpendicular to the first light.  At first they weren’t moving too fast but as the lights got closer to each other, the speed increased.  It appeared as though they were heading for a collision at this point.  I was sure they were going to hit and cause some sort of explosion but instead they began spinning around each other, making what looked like figure 8s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted only a few seconds before both light! s continued heading south parallel to each other(side by side). As the lights got further away, they began to slowly separate and disappeared into the clouds.<n>

It was about 8pm.  It was completely strange.  To the north, three were floating pretty evenly spaced from one another and a little further south were three more in a slight triangular formation with another below them.  We tried to follow them, but they were disappearing.  We followed one onto a side street and noticed that it was EXTREMELY low to the ground (about 3 electrical poles high).  As soon as we got out of the car, we saw it just fade out.  That was it.  They were not planes, they were not flashing, they were orange-red glowing lights moving and hovering slowly.

It wasn’t fireworks, because they stayed in place.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yardley was on Interstate 95 near Waterville and said the fire-colored orbs could be seen on the Oakland side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;People were pulling off the road to look at them,&#34; he said.  &#34;If my daughter hadn’t been there to witness the same thing, I would not have called. I’ve never reported anything like this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Police and fire officials in Waterville, Winslow and Oakland, as well as the Maine State Police, said they took no reports of balls of light in the night sky, and the National Weather Service reported no unusual weather that could account for the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;A string of lights [in the sky] is a very common UFO report,&#34; Alan Davenport, director of the University of Maine’s Jordan Planetarium, said Friday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some prior UFO reports have proved to be aircraft flying away, he said. They appear to be stationary because they are so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;That is what their taillights would look like,&#34; Davenport said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yardley’s wife, Rita, asked him why he didn’t take a picture of the balls of light with his cellphone, and he said he couldn’t because &#34;I was on the phone.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The National UFO Reporting Center, which has nine postings on its website from Maine for October, has taken reports of orange &#34;fireballs&#34; from all over the world.  There were no postings on the website for Thursday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There also are a couple of YouTube videos posted of people filming orange lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> Yardley said he’s not sure what he and his daughter saw, but he did expect others in the area to file reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I got up this morning and assumed it would be in the newspaper and on TV,&#34; he said.<n>

We had just gotten into the truck, and while rolling up my window I glanced at a bright star or planet to the South-South East giving off shine that I often look up to glance at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a bright star I assumed I hadn&#39;t noticed before just off to the side of this other star, but when I glanced out the passenger side window I noticed it was moving at an incredible speed, I estimate 200mph, in a South Eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, being a veteran birder, picked up his binoculars and glanced, then passed them to me.  What I observed was a small ball of light, pure and shimmering white moving INCREDIBLY fast.  It cleared all the way to the horizon in at least a minute flat.  I&#39;ve seen satellites move before but not at such an accelerated rate.<n>

I was out filming fall colors along the river.  I seen lights in the sky.  I did not pay much attention to the lights thinking they were airplanes or something.  Someones white dog across the river was barking like crazy.  I continued to film. I captured a cone shaped ufo with flames coming from the back.  There was a strange tube like structure in the clouds and objects were going in and out of this tube constantly.  The objects went in then out repeatedly.  The objects going in and out of the tube like structure look dark in color with the exception of a yellow cone shaped object.  I had captured the activity accidently while I was filming fall colors along the river.<n>

Flew between moon and Earth.  Hard to tell size versus proximity. Three horizontal (based on forward flying direction) rows of lights.  Each row approximately the 1.5 to two times the width of a normal aircraft.  May have been a row of 4-5 very dim lights - yellowish in color.  If even lights...could have been illuminated by moon, because once out of range of the moon, I could not see.  Caught moving object while gazing up and took a second for my sight to lock in - was then able to track for about 4 seconds.  Would assume low-flying object due to speed (length of time) at which it traversed my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/1/12 00:00|Merced|CA|Light|~1 Minute|Two bright unidentified flying objects appear in Northern night sky, Southeast bound in Merced, Ca.|11/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94047.html|781|ndxe201211| Two bright unidentified flying objects appear in Northern night sky, Southeast bound in Merced, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two very bright, orange-yellowish, shining lights  appear flying very low, overhead in the Northern night sky heading Southeast bound.  Appearing to be about 4 or 5 times the size of the Northern Star, they fly significantly close underneath all the fog and clouds.  They flew adjacent to each other and were pretty much flying in sync with each other, yet they each seemed to have an individual movement(like two cars driving side by side on a freeway).  Seconds go by then the one on the left starts to fade or flicker out.  Once the left one goes out, the one on the right follows right behind just mere seconds after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there were two objects observed.  They appeared to have no structure, just very bright with an orange and yellow shine like  extremely radiant candle lights or illuminating orbs.  Adjacent and almost in sync but still with an individual movement about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m., while celebrating Halloween.  The weather was completely overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Moon and stars were nowhere to be seen and absolutely in no way, shape, or form, could be seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other observers witnessed the same but were slightly intoxicated due to &#34;the reason for the season.&#34;  I was sober.  I do not drink.<n>
