I had been across the street from my house playing with a friend, and my mother came to take me home for bed.  I always went to bed around 8:00. As we were walking across the street, I saw almost directly over me, and flying over my house (about 10 ft above house), a line of crafts that were copper, and shaped like missiles.  They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes. I asked my mother what they were, and pointed to them, but she could not see anything.  I pointed again, and still she couldn&#39;t see anything, and we went in my house.  I wasn&#39;t thinking at that time about &#34;aliens&#34;--I just knew it was something I had never seen before, was very unusual, and that nobody else seemed to notice.  It wasn&#39;t until years later I would connect it with the possibility of it being extraterrestrial.<n>
10/31/76 18:00|Los Angeles|CA|Oval|5-8 minutes|Ufo over downtown Los Angeles witnessed by  a husband and wife|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26764.html|2|ndxe197610| Ufo over downtown Los Angeles witnessed by  a husband and wife<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the shape of a slightly flattened soap bubble being oval in the horizontal and I assume circular in the vertical perspective. The hull changed color like a soap bubble but the color was the light source instead of a reflection of light.  It appeared to become more transparent when there was more light behind it and more light producing when there was less light behind it.  It made no noise and the inhabitants which I could see as profiles appeared to be human and it wouldn&#39;t really surprise me to find out that it was from earth as in a special air force plane. I could see the platform that the riders were standing on and the instruments appeared to be mostly centrally located except for one or two short panels nearer the outer edge of the ship. It also would not surprise me if there were no other reports of this because even though it occured in downtown L. A. anyone who has seen anything like a flying saucer is rediculed from the outset and not having proof ignored. That was my husband&#39;s report  . He was taking me to work on Figueroa and I spotted it behind a hotel on Olympic &amp; Figueroa. It was on our left and I was able to look into the craft and they were staring back at us. I was on the back of his Honda 450 motorcycle and got a great view.I am willing to be hypnotized to give better details. I gave a report to this site last year but I wanted to share my spouse&#39;s perspective. It was strange to see a UFO downtown but that was years before they developed the land. It was probably 75 or 76. But it was Oct.31st because I was working at 1200 12th st and there was a Halloween party that nite at work Morrie&#39;s Ballroom. It was only about 15-30 feet off the ground. There was 3-4 men that were leaning over what looked like a console at us. I don&#39;t know where they were from but I&#39;ll never know if I don&#39;t submit this form. It&#39;s been a mystery for a little over 25 years and I need to know if anyone has seen a Ufo that reminded them of a soap bubble that they could see through when the sun hit it just! right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occured around sunset going westward.<n>

Large dome-shape|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05613.html|3|ndxe197610| Sighted at the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane on the saturday before Halloween around 10:30 to 11:00pm. Large dome-shaped object with lights on the underneath side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first sighted this object along with two other witnesses after a Halloween party on the saturday night before Halloween 1976. We saw the object over Alder Ave. moving silently and slowing east and then hovering over the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane. It hovered there silently for several minutes befoe moving east again following the path of Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd. The object appeared to be 100ft-200ft in the air. It was a large dome-shaped craft with a dull metalic finish that was visible due to the ambient light. It was flat on the bottom with a large center light and smaller lights rotating around the center light. The smaller lights were moving slowly in a counter-clockwise direction. We reported it to Standiford Field (our local airport) and questioned if anyone else had reported the same. Three years later in July, 1979 I saw the same object in the same area (I lived 2 blocks form the original sighting). On this occasion I was with my neighbor and we ran to Preston Hwy. and once again it hovered for a couple of minutes before moving eastward toward Poplar Level Rd.<n>
10/30/76 16:30|Dallas|TX|Disk|16:40|Somethings out there|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49693.html|4|ndxe197610| The hi-pitches noise is what first alerted me to the disk. My family was watching t.v when the t.v started static and picture problems. The lights started blinking from dim to bright.My dogs were whining and scratching the back door wildly.Keep in mind my German sheperd had been qaurentine twice for biting people riding or walking ddown the alley.As well as a mean standard poodle. I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky. I looked up and saw a huge disk shape houvering above the neighbor hood. It was so huge it could have destroyed at least two blocks if it landed. Now it gets even stranger.It is dark outside the sky is just a shade of dk blue but not quite black. The ship is almost the same color or a shade just lighter from the color of the sky. I&#39;m histerical and run in the room where my dogs are. I grab the phone to call police,my dad anyone because I&#39;m scared but remember I have to go getmy mom and little brother. The sound of the ship is head jolting. I ran to get my mom and brother in the house but they just stair in the sky. I grab my neighbor hand and tell her to run. But could&#39;nt budge her. I ran back to the porch behind the bushes surrounding the porch and look up in ahh. I notice that it is round in shape like a washer that goes on a screw then criss-crossing are bars that connect to the center of the disk which is like a black smoke-glass sphere. It didn&#39;t have windows and I would have to guess maybe that the center was like a smoke glass marble and they were watching us. Anyway, the outer part begin to have lights red,green,yellow,blue four in a row from my angle i could see blinking at the front side and back of the ship. They blinked in a harmony like way. Then as it went higher u in the sky it&#39;s shape seemed to change and the criss-cross bars went in and the disk was smaaler in size and it went up and shot ahead in the sky so fast it was gone. I ran out into the yard where everyone seem to be calm and alert. I was screaming did you see it lets call someone. And mom said calm down it&#39;s time for bed. Pat the neighbor was telling every one good night. I was alarmed that everyone was so calm and non-shalaunt about the situation.The next day my mom the neighbors all of them said they didn&#39;t remember seeing anything last night. But they couldn&#39;t explain why my legs were all scratched up from the dogs running me over in the kitchen and the back door being almost scratched in too from the dogs. I&#39;ve told this story to every one I know and they just look at me like I crazy. And as god is my witness, I&#39;ve been when three of them and together they witnessed again another ufo sighting. Do they keep an eye on you once you spot one of them. I&#39;ve never seen a allien, but I  have seen at least three other ships since I have seen that one at 13. One had three lights and was triangle shape, one just a blue sphere never loosing altitude and traveled in a perfectly straight direction. and yet another like jacks shaped. You know the jacks and ball little girls played as a child. With light on all five ends. They were at close distances and was also a bit over whelming even as I am now a adult. I had the same fear rush threw me as I did as the 13 year old girl who seen the mother of all ships. Nothing has ever come close to the sighting I seen at the house in Dallas,Tx. Whats even stranger is..... Since 1998 I have had a series of dreams.That seem to be messages from alliens. They were very clear and in color that was so bright. Over a two year period I had five that were so real. I have to question if they are related. One thing I am clear on is this. Somethings out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/21/76 21:00|St. George (UT) to Las Vegas (NV)|UT|Light|30 minutes|A Bright red light in the southwestern sky approx. 45 degrees above the horizon.|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05320.html|5|ndxe197610| A Bright red light in the southwestern sky approx. 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving along the highway about 60 mph I noticed this bright red light in the sky I would estimate to be as bright as Jupiter of maybe even brighter. As i drove the object did not seem to move in relation to the background terrain. I must have continued for 15 or twenty minutes before I stoped the car to get out and have a look at this thing. I stoped in the middle of nowhere on this desolate road and stared at this bright red light for few minutes when suddenly it began to slowly move about in the sky. First one direction and then another. I was with a friend and we both were in awe of whatever this was when the most extraordinary thing happened. Five jets began closing in on the object from seemingly out of nowhere. when they came to within about a moons distance from the object it just vanished into nothing. I returned to Las Vegas a few hours later and called Nellis Air Force Base to report the incident. They denied any knowledge of any sighting and said they knew nothing about any planes chasing anything. This I knew to be a lie, as no air force base could possibly be unaware of 5 jets chasing something within 50 to 100 miles of them. I have never been able to explain what this could have been and still have no idea. i<n>

It happened that october of 1976,my friend ((name deleted)) picked me up,I think it was the weekend.We jumped in my truck and drove into town to get a 6 pack, then to a little lake just out of town, it&#39;s called art lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a little side trail of to the right, we drove to the end of it. It was mostly clear, not to cold with just a little snow trying to fall.  A great alaskan night. We were making small talk looking out into the night sky when I noticed the red dot moving accross the sky high up, traveling in a south easterly direction. I pointed it out to randy because the dot seemed to move pretty fast for a high flying Jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched we noticed it getting bigger. We did not see any other lights. It got bigger,I told ((name deleted)) it must be a plain getting ready to land at the local small air strip and wondered why his landing lights where not on.The last thing ((name deleted)) said was that the air port was of to side of us and not in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yes I could clearly see what he was talking about, this red ball was now getting huge, coming directly at us, just above the trees.I dont recall him or I saying anything at that time, just looking out the windshield. It stoped above the trees in front of us, it was awesome, at least 25 or 30 feet accross,it felt strange sitting in the cab of the truck looking out at this big red Ball,I could see like a liquid moving from the right to the left on it&#39;s surface wich gave me the sence that it was round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every thing in front of us was in a red glow but not bright.I remember saying;what the hell is this, randy was silent.I dont know how long we looked at it, then suddenly there was this very loud metalic crashing sound, but not like a car crash, a lot shorter, but load.The red orb was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know we both jumped.The truck was cold, I jumped  out of the truck thinking a tree had fallen on it,but there was nothing.It mast have been snowing because we had 6 or 7 inches of snow, and not a track or sign of what might have made that awfull sound.((name deleted)) started the truck and we got the hell out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to figure out what we just seen, but of course didnt come up with anything other then some ufo or something. Getting back to town we noticed it was late way late going on 2 am I finished my beer, ((name deleted)) drove back to my place,then he went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about  on and off for a while, then he started to clam up about it,then refused to discuss it any further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget that night.I checked the truck the next day the frame and Body was not damaged, I dont know where that load noise came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was a triangle shape with lights all around the outside edges...white lights.  As I approached the Mullica River Bridge I became frightened....I realized how huge it was as I drove under it.  I don&#39;t know how high it was but was lower than any aircraft would travel.  As you know.....this location is very close to the Atlantic City Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a group of helicopters...flying in formation....they seemed to be standing still.  I was driving alone with my 3 small children and I didn&#39;t really want to stop to look but I did......I pulled off to the shoulder of the road and only rolled the window down and looked up...I was afraid to get out.  At that time I could see that it was one huge triangle shaped object......it was not moving....or moving so slow I couldn&#39;t tell...there was absolutely no noise.  It seemed to be pointed in the direction of Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very frightening and no mistaking how big it was....it was a very clear night and easy to see that the object within the lights was solid.  I continued on my way and watched the papers and the news to see if it had been reported.....it wasn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t count the lights on it but there were enough to tell from a distance that it was triangle shaped.  The total experience lasted about a half hour....for me.....it was still there when I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought that I would visit some relatives in Almena, Wisc. and thought I would get there about 9 pm. In actuality I got into town about 1030pm an decided to keep on driving south.It seems to me that I went under a hiway bridge and within 5 mins/5 miles my truck was losing power, lights dimmed, radio lost station, and within 1 min the truck stalled and coasted to a stop. I tried repeatedly to start the vehicle and it was totaly dead, not enough juice for interior lights. I thought we were there for less than an hour . A guy going the other way turnrd around and asked if he could help. He was a wrecker driver just off work at 3 am. Told him the truck was dead. He looked under the hood for a moment and asked me to crank it. It fired right up. I expressed wonder and continued on. To this day I cant explain the trucks failure, or the time discrepency. I would be irate if I had to sit around for 4 hours, yet I felt lucky because I thought the sameritan found us right away. I know it sounds bogus but I am sure of all of these facts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 15-16 yrs old at the time, which would make it fall of 1975 -1976. I believe it was a weekend since I was out late. I had left Sib&#39;s, a place kids hung out and bought candy at,  had spent time plaing pinball, and rode my bike up Jones St. in Eveleth, MN which would be an easternly direction. A couple blocks away I had noticed a red light above the roof tops of the houses across the street which would be too the north. I cannot say how far the light was but it had to have been many miles. I realized it was moving slowly in a back and forth up and down fashion. For a while I rode back and forth on the street and finnally stopped to watch from the corner. If I remember correctly, the street corner was Jones and B Street. As I watched, a green Light emerged from the red and shot off to the east and soon after an orange light appeared and shot to the west. All I could do was sit there and watch it. About five or so minutes later, perhaps less, the lights came back. The green from the west and the orange from the east, not from where they shot to in the first place. The crafts then merged with the red light and the light shot quckly into the sky and disappeared. My experience with these things, ufo&#39;s and such, is emmence but for he most part I have kept it inside. My experiences began long before this and continue to this day even wih my moves to the Twin Cities and eventually to Pittsburgh<n>
10/15/76 19:30|Rochester|NY|Unknown|10 seconds|Flashing red light appeared a foot above my car then sped away at incredible speed.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30789.html|11|ndxe197610| Flashing red light appeared a foot above my car then sped away at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was in college in 1976,I volunteered at a community radio station as a broadcast engineer and was driving to my shift early one evening. It was dark and I had gone approximately 1/2 mile from my house when I saw a flashing red light. Thinking that a local police officer was pulling me over,I checked my mirrors and was surprised to see nothing behind me. The flashing was pulsing on and off at at rate of about 1 Hz,1/2 second on and 1/2 second off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked around to see the light&#39;s point of origin,it was not visible. I saw that the hood of my white car was illuminated in this pulsing red light, and thought it unusual that the light source was directly above me as I was still driving down the road at 35 miles per hour. I needed to get a look at what ever was above me and pulled my head up in front of the steering wheel and looked up through the windshield. When I looked up,I saw a pulsing, translucent circular red light that measured approximately 10 inches in diameter and two inches thick. It seemed to attached to a large,flat surface that was so dark in color that it was barely discerable and did not reflect any of the light. It it difficult to tell how large the &#34;craft&#34; itself was. The light itself was very visible,and measureable since it was only a foot above the roof of my car! As soon as I looked at the light,it instantly accellerated down the road ahead of me at incredible speed and dissapeared over the tree line at the end of the road. I had experimented with lasers in my high school physics lab, and it was quite similar to flicking a laser pointer across the ceiling. The light flashed once and appeared as a streak over a distance of approximately 2 miles to the horizon, then dissapeared. There was no sound,or force felt as it departed from over the roof of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was reported over the air immediatlely upon my arrival at the radio station, but I received no phone calls or feedback other than my fellow engineer who encouraged me to broadcast my sighting. I have never documented my experience until now,but have told many of my freinds. 8/19/2003<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Investigation by air traffic controller .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting I was 26 and my friend was 30 years old . I was a plumbing contractor and my friend was a tile contractor . I was a native of Tulare county and my friend is a former British citizen , living in Tulare county .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were experienced backpackers and were camping and fishing at Eagle Lake above Mineral King Valley . From morning until that evening we could hear an electric pulsating noise coming from a gorge on the south side of Eagle Mountain.  We could tell that  the sound was moving through the area , but we could not see anything .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:30pm that evening , as we were cooking dinner, we heard a much louder pulsating noise coming from Eagle Pass.  We both looked at the Eagle Pass and to our amasement saw a saucer shaped craft with a diameter the size of the opening of the pass,  probably 75-100 ft.  It was the color and skin texture of a grey whale and had 6 - 30&#34; or larger diameter differing colored lights, all spaced evenly across the side of the craft.  The circular, flush mounted lights were all flashing sequencially with all of the color specrtum . We aimed our Magnalite torch and flashed the light on and off with the craft flashing it&#39;s colored lights . We were both frozen with fear that this did not look or behave like anything that we have ever seen . The craft hovered for what seemed like 7 seconds and then reversed it&#39;s travel and disapeared behind the Eagle Pass , eminating it&#39;s pulsating sound for about 45 more minutes . We did not hear or see it again during our duration of our backpacking trip . I have been on this 8,000ft.+ elevation pass many times and it is very dangerous for any flying craft to move across .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a friend at that time who was a senior air traffic controller at Lemoore Naval Air Base . I told him about the sighting event and gave him a map of Eagle Pass with date and time . He was able to access not only the Lemoore Air Base computer , but also Edwards Air Base computer as well , which is on the east side of Mineral King Nation! al Park He said that there was no activity involving civilian , military or experimental aircraft in that area at that time or for that matter that week . He added that the area is off limits for military aircraft becuase of numerous wrecks at that same location . There are too many strong downdrafts with San Joaquin Valley air moving to the east , over Owens Valley . He said that if a military pilot was known to fly there , he would be  suspended from flying . He also said that there is no known earthly aircraft with 36&#34; diameter flashing colored lights and that the craft was not of this world .  He also added that he has alerted the air force numerous times after seeing on radar large ufo crafts . He mentioned that after seeing f-18 air squadrans chase the large craft on the radar at full speed without catching up and then the craft disappears off the radar screen . He is a believer in ufos now . He said that he would speak to the pilots afterwards about the chase and would hear that the ufo was sighted in front of the chase , but they could not keep up , at that rate of speed , and it would finally disappear in front of their eyes . I can provide a detailed map of area .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I looked,  I saw an object hoovering over a train as it was passing by.  The object had 6 or 8 green and blue lights that alternated in a circular pattern on the bottom of the craft.  As we watched the,  the object projected a very blue-white beam of light on to the passing train cars,  it lite up the train as if it were daylight.  By this time,  my girlfriend was really freaking out and asking me to drive away,  I was so amazed all I could do was just stare untill she began hitting me in the arm and telling me to drive.  I drove slowly towards the main road while watching this craft,  my girlfriend screaming at me to drive fast but I was in disbelief.  As we got to the asphalt I turned on my headlights,  I think thats when the object realized we were there.

It moved at a phenomenal speed. It moved from right to left in front of me. The object was a perfect cigar shape, exactly as if you were observing a saucer from an angle. The shape was pure, perfect and unbroken. The object was also a pure brilliant white.  There was absolutely no sound at all.  The weather was a clear still evening. The width of the object was approximately twice that of the moon.  I lost sight of the object as it was obscured by trees to my left.  The object travelled in a perfectly straight trajectory.  I do not believe that a natural phenomenon can produce an object of such a perfect shape and light, which travelled at such a fast speed in such a straight trajectory.  The sighting has utterly convinced me that there is life beyond this planet.<n>

We have a big hill to drive up to get to the house.  As we were driving up the hill, we noticed three huge lights hanging above the trees off to the left of us.  The site distance from us was no more than a couple thousand feet.  The lights hung about 500 feet above the trees.  I was curious about what they were, my friend was frightened and just wanted to get to the house.  When we arrived at the house and looked down the hill the lights were gone.  I did not hear any noises.  They just hung there.  They seemed huge, like the size of a football field.  This still amazes me to this day.  I have no doubt that these things are out here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/6/76 20:30|Smith Mountain Lake (near Gretna and Penhook)|VA|Disk|20 minutes|THE COMPLETE SAUCER STORY:  WHAT WE SAW AND HOW WE SAW 						IT TWICE!  It was the middle of the week. Andy knew what he was|10/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114279.html|17|ndxe197610| It was the middle of the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin knew what he was doing.  On a clear, comfortably cool late September<n> <n><n> afternoon, he&#39;d arranged for all four to meet at my store, at around 5:00 p.m.  Knowing that<n> <n><n> schools were in session and that families that spent summers at Smith Mountain Lake had left until the next spring, we were excited by the prospect of having the lake all to ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were eager for the camaraderie and fun that would follow. In a very real sense, the rest of us trusted him to make that happen.  He had the big car, his dad&#39;s hand-me-down Oldsmobile, a luxury car in every respect.  He also had the key to his dad&#39;s boat, a zippy outboard that had plenty of room for all of us and our usually useless fishing poles.  On similar excursions, we&#39;d used the same gear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that clear, cool late afternoon, we welcomed the chance to feel the fresh lake air as we zoomed through it. But that wasn&#39;t all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin also had the key to his parents&#39; lake house. In fact, the boat was waiting for us at his family&#39;s dock. From the house, the back yard sloped down to the dock; it jutted out about fourteen feet into the small cove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my cousin slowed to turn right onto a black top that would wind down<n> <n><n> to the front of his parents&#39; home, we saw no others cars were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin hurried into the house, turned on the lights, and grabbed the keys to the boat as the rest of us walked down to the waiting topless craft. We took our seats. A minute later, my cousin untied the boat and hopped in; he slipped into the captain&#39;s seat and started the<n> <n><n> outboard. Carefully, without a wake, he guided us out of the quiet cove and onto the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our left, on the western side of the lake, we spotted a few homes; they were no where close to us.  Beyond the bank of the lake, we saw what we knew to be the outskirts of Roanoke, VA, about fifty miles away.  The evening sky was that clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t talk much; the outboard engine made anything less than a scream impossible to hear. But we weren&#39;t on the lake to chat and reminisce. That would come later, after we&#39;d returned the boat to its dock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After fishing, my cousin announced it was time to raid the fridge. As he led us there, he tossed the boat keys into a dish atop a buffet next to what was a casual space that was part dining room and part kitchen. Waiting for us was a table big enough for six.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the other three men wanted to sit and and schmooze about the lake and our fishing and whatever gossip that needed discussing, I wanted to see more of the night sky and the dark, glassy lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They didn&#39;t seem to notice that I reached for the sliding glass door just behind the chair at the head of the table.  It was that close; the door opened onto a small balcony, no bigger than four by seven feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat with my back against the sliding glass door. Now and then, I&#39;d stand.  Behind me were muffled sounds of laughter; I preferred the less noisy evening and its clear black sky. No one seemed to miss me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that peaceful night, the lights of distant Roanoke were easy to see.  In fact, as I scanned the horizon, then looked up at the myriad of stars, I was struck by something I could not explain. That&#39;s why I stared for a while, perhaps eight to ten minutes, at a dot of light that seemed out of place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the lights of Roanoke to compare it, I noticed it didn&#39;t have the same soft radiance. Also, it was much higher than the city&#39;s lights. Looking up at the stars, I saw that it was too low to be a star; it didn&#39;t shine like a star&#39;s light. It was constant, almost like the dot from an off-white laser beam. Puzzled as I was, I wasn&#39;t alarmed.  Indeed, I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it must have been moving, I reasoned.  Otherwise, why did I not see it when I first studied the sky? It had come into view out of nowhere.  At the time, I didn&#39;t know why.  Now I do.  IT WAS MOVING THAT FAST, TOO FAST FOR ME TO SEE IT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I just sat there as I watched and waited. Although it seemed stationery, I believed there was an explanation that I hadn&#39;t discovered.  Not wanting to disturb the other three guys inside, I sat alone, completely focused on the beam. Whatever they were discussing inside couldn&#39;t have been as fascinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As much as I believed that, I couldn&#39;t have and didn&#39;t anticipate what happened next because I had not understood the reason why I noticed it in the first place. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED BEYOND ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN. Well beyond Roanoke, the dot seemed to shake. In less than a second, I saw what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned, in less than a second, it transformed from a mere dot to a dot that moved to a recognizable object.  That object never made a sound.  It never displayed any exhaust; they was no indication of propulsion that blew against the surface of the lake or that stirred the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM ME, I SAW A FLYING SAUCER! IT<n> <n><n> HAD STOPPED INSTANTLY AT A SPOT ABOUT 75 FEET IN THE AIR!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alarms went off inside me; I was absolutely afraid and absolutely amazed at the same time. For a few moments, I could not move. Since there was no place to hide, I just sat still and stared. The spacecraft hovered without a sound and without moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I felt exposed and completely vulnerable, I calmed myself enough to reach behind me and open the sliding glass door.  Without screaming, I insisted that all of the guys come out and take a look. I tried not to sound terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them came to see what I had seen. They were speechless. Probably as fearful as I had been, they didn&#39;t say much. It could have been that they didn&#39;t want to be noticed. Chances are they didn&#39;t want to believe what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched them, I moved to give them more room. My fear subsided. Instead of feeling like I had to hide or make myself unseeable, I felt the crisp night air and I studied the silent but hovering saucer. Curiosity had overtaken my fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF THE FLYING SAUCER<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the shape of the saucer, I wasn&#39;t as surprised as I might have been. It wasn&#39;t a massive, lumbering craft that was gigantic and overwhelming. It didn&#39;t look like a flying city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, it  had a form I recognized, one I had seen many times since having first watched the Flintstones. In the back of my mind, I wondered how it could have been described so accurately IF NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ONE BEFORE!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it seemed to rest just above the treetops, it seemed to be on a surveillance mission. For a few minutes, it seemed to be sitting and it seemed to be watching us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying saucer did look like a saucer with a cup on top of it in the proportion that resembled a coffee cup upside down on its plate. Amazed that it hovered or moved without as much as a whoosh and without any sign of a jet&#39;s propulsion, I studied the top of the cup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was ringed by what appeared to be square windows filled with alternating red and white light. It was clear that some energy source was radiating that bright light. What puzzled me was why one window of light was white and the next red and the next white and so on. I had no idea what that pattern meant unless there was some kind of alternating polarity that controlled and balanced and propelled the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I studied it, I found it remarkable that most drawings I&#39;d seen of flying saucers resembled the one that was visiting us. Because time was so different for those who were able to travel at warp speed, I thought about other sightings. Strange as this may sound, it could be, to the aliens who piloted the space ships, that the Roswell incident had occurred  only seconds or minutes before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind was in overdrive. Guessing at the dimensions, I figured the bottom of the craft, the saucer, perfectly circular, was about 40-50 feet wide. The cup on top appeared to be a little more than half that size; it appeared to be about 15 feet tall.  The entire ship looked to be absolutely symmetrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the sky was so dark, I couldn&#39;t tell the color of the ship.  Although I had assumed it was silvery and metallic, it appeared to be a darker gray.  As we watched the saucer seem to watch us, I didn&#39;t ask anyone about its color.  That didn&#39;t seem important then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about three minutes, it appeared to allow us to study it.  Of course, I wondered whether it was also studying us. If so, I&#39;m sure we looked to be awkward and quite ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that night, as I watched the craft, I also felt very special.  That&#39;s why, when it finally moved, I said &#34;Wow!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left the same way it had come, without any sign of movement. It didn&#39;t shake or rev its engine or send blasts of air that caused it to move.  Rather than any of that, it zipped up, then zagged at a 90 degree angle at a speed that caused it to disappear the same way it had come, in a second, maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By that time, I felt like waving goodbye since I had watched it travel from a great distance to us. Having lost all my fear, I would have thanked its pilots for having made a short visit. Actually, by that time, I felt as if their visit had been too short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the other men went through the sliding glass door to return to their seats at the table, I said something to my cousin that seemed most important.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I wish I&#39;d had a pair of binoculars,&#34; I said. &#34;The saucer was so close that<n> <n><n> I might have been able to look inside its windows.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I knew my cousin&#39;s father was an avid photographer who loved Leica<n> <n><n> cameras, I wondered whether he might have had a pair of Leica quality<n> <n><n> binoculars also. He did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later, he handed them to me.<n> <n><n> Then he closed the sliding glass door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slipped the binoculars&#39; strap over my head and returned to my station on<n> <n><n> the balcony. Although I&#39;d never heard of a flying saucer making a return<n> <n><n> visit, I wasn&#39;t about to leave my perch in case it did. Of course, I didn&#39;t<n> <n><n> tell the others that I was waiting for it to come back. They had opened a<n> <n><n> bag of Nachos and were probably trying to make sense of what they&#39;d just<n> <n><n> seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike the three of them, I felt like a Civil Air Patrol cadet as I scoured<n> <n><n> the sky for signs of now familiar aliens. If I&#39;d been given one wish at that<n> <n><n> moment in time, it would have been that the flying saucer would return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my joyful surprise, less than ten minutes later, it did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SAUCER&#39;S SECOND VISIT!<n> <n><n> With the Zeiss binoculars, I knew I could focus on the craft if it returned.<n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell whether the guys inside thought I was crazy to return to the<n> <n><n> balcony with binoculars. Chances are they were comparing me to a comic book character.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If so, I didn&#39;t care because there was too much to think about. Overwhelmed<n> <n><n> by the first observation, I was sloughing off old ideas and creating new<n> <n><n> ones. What I pondered most was this concern: who could I talk to about what<n> <n><n> I had seen? Who could help me understand?  Who would know how important it<n> <n><n> was? What if I could never explain or understand what had happened?<n> <n><n> <n><n> In other words, the visit was like a gift that, once unwrapped, brought with<n> <n><n> it its own problems. Had cell phones been available then, I could have taken<n> <n><n> a selfie with the flying saucer in the background! But without a picture,<n> <n><n> who would have believed me? Despite all of those troublesome aspects, I did<n> <n><n> want to see the craft again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I waited a little less than ten minutes. No one from the inside bothered<n> <n><n> to check on me; there was no tap on the glass door followed by a wave. There<n> <n><n> was just me and my wishful thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the saucer surprised me by returning, I almost waved hello. No longer<n> <n><n> was I afraid or apprehensive. Immediately, I aimed the binoculars at the<n> <n><n> spacecraft and I saw what I&#39;d wanted to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filling up each lens was one of the saucer&#39;s windows. I saw the light<n> <n><n> streaming out so intensely that it was opaque. I couldn&#39;t see into or<n> <n><n> through the light, not at all. Since it was resting at the exact spot as<n> <n><n> before, I pulled open the sliding glass door and didn&#39;t whisper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;You gotta see this,&#34; I insisted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One by one, they came onto the balcony and looked at the saucer using the<n> <n><n> binoculars. When they finished, they marched back inside; I could tell the<n> <n><n> three men were much quieter than the time before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too. What had made the craft return? Had the alien crew decided I was<n> <n><n> friendly?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did they want to stop and chat? I didn&#39;t know what to expect. For a few<n> <n><n> minutes, I just stared. At the time, I had no idea how rare a sighting we&#39;d<n> <n><n> had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the others went back inside, I took one last look through the<n> <n><n> binoculars; the windows of the cup part of the ship were so clear and so<n> <n><n> close as to seem to be within reach. I put down the Zeiss and its powerful<n> <n><n> lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I knew what was coming, I didn&#39;t want to see it go before I&#39;d make<n> <n><n> some kind of contact. Entertaining the thought that I could communicate with<n> <n><n> the aliens and their craft amused me. Who was I to think I was more to them<n> <n><n> than a minor blip of energy waves on a monitoring screen?<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were the sentient beings; I was just a guy on a tiny balcony dressed in<n> <n><n> jeans and a t-shirt waving at a craft so powerful yet so slight that it may<n> <n><n> have come from a different universe. Awed by that thought, I saluted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds passed. I stood there, no taller than a fragile young pine; I sought<n> <n><n> to memorize the night and its stillness, uninterrupted by the silent<n> <n><n> spacecraft, so much more remarkable than any night I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last time, it zigged and it zagged as if that signature motion was all<n> <n><n> that was required to ramp up its speed to much faster than light. In a split<n> <n><n> second, as it sped away, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time, its departure had been breathtaking; this time, I was<n> <n><n> reminded of a friend leaving or of a western movie where a hero rides off<n> <n><n> toward a distant horizon. Then, as now, I had no idea where it was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All that I knew was that I wasn&#39;t the one to follow. Reluctantly, I returned<n> <n><n> to the group inside. They were ready to leave. I looked back at the balcony,<n> <n><n> then returned returned the binoculars to my cousin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Thanks,&#34; I said. Although I didn&#39;t add that I was thanking him for a night<n> <n><n> I&#39;d never forget, I think he sensed that. For years after that, almost until<n> <n><n> the time he died, we&#39;d reflect on our memories of that night on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Indeed, he was willing to discuss the enormity of our sighting, the profound<n> <n><n> changes it had brought to our perspectives. As we talked the last time, I<n> <n><n> had no idea I&#39;d never again discuss our special night with him. That&#39;s why<n> <n><n> this short book is dedicated to Andy and the memories we shared on Smith<n> <n><n> Mountain Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> REFLECTIONS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A THIRD SIGHTING<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Playful as our drive to Smith Mountain Lake had been, our trip home was quiet<n> <n><n> and uneventful. Although each of us had seen the flying saucer twice, not one<n> <n><n> of us could explain why. Nor did we have a clue as to<n> <n><n> what caused it to meet us at Smith Mountain. Were they attempting to connect<n> <n><n> with or contact us?<n> <n><n> <n><n> But if they&#39;d wanted to talk about an upended cosmology, they could have<n> <n><n> talked to me. At least that&#39;s what I was telling myself. After all, if they<n> <n><n> were smart enough to pilot a craft all the way from wherever they came from,<n> <n><n> they were probably able to analyze and translate our language in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I do remember trying to speak to the craft in order to get the beings in it<n> <n><n> to say hello. But they didn&#39;t respond. Instead, they took off and sped away<n> <n><n> in an instant without saying goodbye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I could be wrong about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their first visit could have been their hello. Their second could have been<n> <n><n> their way of saying goodbye. If so, it&#39;s been one that&#39;s lasted more than 35<n> <n><n> years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that the weather is cooling and children have returned to school, it&#39;s<n> <n><n> time for me to return to the Lake. This time, I&#39;ll go by myself, and I&#39;ll<n> <n><n> take a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In case anyone asks why, I&#39;ll tell them I&#39;m on an adventure. As for the<n> <n><n> camera, I&#39;ll tell them I never know what I might see, the images I don&#39;t<n> <n><n> want to miss...this time.<n>

I was stationed at the base when this event took place. A friend of mine did who was a security police officer. If you can find out the date that the fighters were deployed from the base in N.Y. (Delta Dart aircraft)F-111&#39;s, then you will have a lot better idea of the time frame. They were deployed a couple of days later. According to my friend the craft were seen over the base late at night several times for the previous week before the fighters were deployed. The base commander told the sp&#39;s that it was a helicopter flying in from Canada not a U.F.O... He  said he never heard of one that didn&#39;t make any noise, and that could manuever like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  The &#34;Delta Dart&#34; is the F-106.

((Sentence deleted, at request of source of report.  Describes position of witness.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed aircraft arriving and departing Limestone AFB regularly as this was an active base during the cold war. We had interceptors stationed there and at Bangor International and often these aircraft where deployed to intercept suspicious aircraft that would fly down the Newfoundland and New Brunswick coast off the Eastern seaboard enroute to Cuba. Long range Bear Bombers regularly made the trip and were regularly intercepted and shadowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night I watched and object from the North approach Limestone at a very high rate of speed. When a radar sweep moves around it does so at a constant rate of rotation. During the time it paints a target and the next time a slow object moves but centimeters on the screen a fast one might move several.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moved 10&#39;s of centimeters and just as suddenly topped over Limestone. I watched the object not move for several moments nad then our set did not paint it. Usually that means the object is on the ground and not discernable by radar beam. After a short time maybe 8 to 12 mintes the object reappeared and hovered again. It then made a direct path north and was off the scope in a matter of a few sweeps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember this only as I heard of the &#34;sighting&#34; in the ensuing days. I did not discuss what I saw as at the time what we saw on the Radar set often had National Security implications.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An example of speed we sometimes tracked very high speed targets that could move from one side of our scope to the other in less than 12 sweeps. These aircraft were used for reconnaisance and very fast. We tracked the Concorde on it&#39;s maiden flight when it landed at Bangor International. It took about 25 or more sweeps to cross the scope. The obejct that night departed Limestone and was out of range in less than 5 sweeps. That would give it a velocity in excess of 4,000 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of our Radar signals were sent on to NORAD. They were also often recorded for analysis purposes. Whether this incident was I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tracked objects all the time that seemed faster than what we knew of. This was the only one I recall where a ground sighting coincided with a radar observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that the raw radar imagery was seldom viewed as most systems used the SIF/IFF transponder data. I may have been the only person watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Their was no sound of an engine or propeller. I remember watching until it simply vanished. There may have been a momentary light trail, but my memory is vague on this point.

10/1/76 07:00|Hartville|OH|Disk|2 minutes or less|A disk shaped flying object followed the path of our car just above the telephone lines.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20843.html|22|ndxe197610| A disk shaped flying object followed the path of our car just above the telephone lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were driving down Martindale Rd. between Canton, OH and Kent State University(Kent was our detination)That area at the time was sparsely poulated and was mostly farm land.  I remember looking up and seeing a bright light in the sky and saying to my sister that I did&#39;nt remember that light. (It looked like it could have been the top of a tower but I had&#39;nt recalled seeing a tower.) I don&#39;t know if what we saw next had any relationship to what I saw later. In the next minute or so and when we were a few miles just before rt.43 the encounter began.  A silent flying craft(disk shaped) with lights around the circumference began to follow the path of our car along the road and just above the telephone or electric lines to the left. I was driving and a little nervous.  My sister excitedly told me to stop the car.  But I was scared and refused.  When we arrived at rt.43 we had to stop and choose to turn left or right. As I prepared to turn right the craft went at an angle up and over the wooded area that was directly on the other side of rt.43. and disappeared behind the trees. I don&#39;t know if the object landed but the downward course of the direction it was going suggested that it was going to land.   Then I got brave, and decided to turn at the first side street off of rt.43. We waited briefly to see if it would go up again but it was starting to get dark and I wanted to get back home.  So our encounter with the object ended there.  I have never stopped thinking about the object and when I found this website I was hoping I would find other reports made in that area at the same time.  People tell us we must have seen a helicopter or an illusion etc. but nothing I have ever heard of fits the description of what we saw except for UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous, although the reports seems to us to come from a serious-minded individual.  We do not know if the witness means a morning sighting, or an evening event.  PD))<n>
