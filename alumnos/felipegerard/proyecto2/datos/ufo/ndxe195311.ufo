It was there for approximately three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are looking for a close sighting with lots of witnesses, this is a classic case. I&#39;ve never seen it discussed before. When I was in Preflight for pilot and observer training in 1953 on Lackland AFB, about three weeks before we went home for Xmas leave, about 500 underclassmen and a few upperclassmen were standing at attention for reveille just after 0400 hours. As officer candidates, when we stood at attention we were not even allowed to move our eyeballs (gaze). Suddenly I heard an upperclassman yell: &#34;Underclassmen may gaze.&#34; I looked to my left and directly across the narrow street was a small one bedroom house, perhaps used for some kind of communications. Hovering directly over the house, about ten or twenty feet above it, was a very clear view of what I could only describe as a flying saucer. It was the shape of two saucers placed face to face with a &#34;gondola&#34; type protrusion below. The gondola had lines of light around it, as if it had a series of portholes but was spinning. There was no actual heat or sound, but thinking about it later, there seemed to be a sensation of heat and sound, as if it were just out of the range of our senses. We watched the saucer for a full two or three minutes, it seemed much longer. It was good long uninterrupted look. We had the distinct impression that it was watching us. Suddenly one of the upperclassmen started across the street toward the house, which scared me, and then the saucer moved from that spot to out of sight over the horizon, soundlessly and rapidly. It was probably out of sight in a half second or a second. We could see a blurry line of light while it was passing. When we got back to the barracks, always pressed for time, we had little time to discuss it, but we did briefly discuss it amongst ourselves. By that afternoon or the next day, I&#39;m not sure which, we were told the upperclassmen had reported the incident. They were told that we were mistaken -- that it was not a UFO -- but also that it was to be considered confidential. Therefore, being on a strictly operating honor system, none of us discussed it after that to my knowledge. It would have meant we washed out. And if someone else mentioned it to us and we didn&#39;t report it immediately, it would also have meant we washed out. So I simply formed a habit of not talking about it, and I never told anyone till perhaps thirty  years later. When I was on my way home for Xmas, a man came up to me on the train and asked what the epaulets on my uniform meant. I joked about it meaning I was secret service. He started a conversation with me and eventually began to tell me about the time he&#39;d seen a flying saucer. He kept asking me if I&#39;d ever seen one, and I insisted I hadn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t think much about that till I got back to base after Xmas. Then some of the cadets from our bay in the barracks never showed up after the leave. I can&#39;t remember how many. Maybe two, maybe five out of a bay of 25. Someone said they had washed out on a security violation. Later when five of us were talking, though tiptoeing around without actually ever mentioning the saucer incident, we all remembered being approached by someone who wanted to talk about flying saucers. One said he was approached in a bar by someone who kept asking him if he&#39;d ever seen a UFO. Because I haven&#39;t kept track of anyone from from that class, I&#39;ve never discussed this with any of them. If I could find some of them, I&#39;d really like to talk to them and see if they remember it the way I do. If you wanted to investigate it, it would be easy. It was the J-54 class. Started preflight in 1953, scheduled to graduate 12 months later in 54. Right during the Tony the Tiger program. There was a write up in Look magazine about that class that showed one picture of the whole group about that time. The questions at the bottom of this page are too simplistic for me to answer. For instance, as I mentioned, there was no sound, but there was an impression of sound. There was no real aura or haze, but there was a slight glow because it was somewhat luminous.<n>

SE of)|IN|Disk|2 1/2- 3 min.|On a moonless, star-lit night,  greenish-orange light moves rapidly and silently  about the dark sky while being pursued by a jet.|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32867.html|2|ndxe195311| On a moonless, star-lit night,  greenish-orange light moves rapidly and silently  about the dark sky while being pursued by a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night is absolutely clear, very dark, and moonless. Out in the rural country-- no town lights, farm lights, vehicles--nothing but black sky populated with thousands of stars all a-twinkle. Hearing a piston-engined airliner flying towards the south, I lloked up--almost immediately noticing a greenish-orange or yellowish light meandering along soundlessly, first heading in one direction then another. (quite unlike any conventional aircraft of the time) I know what it is...UFO! Calling my friend, we watch for perhaps half-a-minute what appears to be a seemingly aimless flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, another night traveler arrives on the scene. I hear it, then see its navagation lights. A jet! a millitary plane...has to be, for (at this time--1953) there are no civillian jet-powered aircraft of any kind. At almost the same moment that I see the newcomer, its pilot spots the UFO light, immediately changes course, and makes a bee-line for the thing. Thereafter, what follows is a &#34;cat an&#39; mouse game&#34; of &#34;Catch-Me-if-You-Can&#34; between the light and the plane. The UFO zips ahead, the jet falling behind, then slowing nearly to a stop, the chased allows its pursuer to close. Once the seperation is minimal, away it goes at an unbelievably high speed--sometimes executing angle maneuvers of less than 90 deg. (with little or no slowing) until ready to once again tease the adversary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For its part, the jet is able to make only gentle, sweeping turns; as its prey, in ghostly silence, traces various geometric figures in the night sky. Only the roaring and panting of the military aircraftis heardin its utterly futile attempt to catch the soundless speck as it continues its Will-O-The-Wisp dance. It is quite a show. And, after some two-and-a-half minutes or so, the participants disappear in a southwesterly direction--still engaged in a one-sided midnight game of tag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my opinion that the military plane (was) a Northrop F89 Scorpion, because few (if any) single-seat jet fighters were flown at night on missions such as this. The Scorpion, a twoseat, radar and rocket equipped aircraft, was used in the intercepter roll. And, on this night, it definitely appears that one was trying to catch a &#34;boggy&#34;. There is a possibillity tat the &#34;chase plane&#34; may have been a Lockheed F-94 Starfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness in this case is well known to us, and we consider him to be highly credible.  Please note the proximity of the date above to the dramatic case of Lieutenants Moncla and Brown over Lake Superior on November 24, 1953, described elsewhere on the NUFORC website.  PD))<n>

It was unusually cold.  The wind was strong and from the NW, which is why we were walking backwards against it.  The location was roughly 100 yard west of a used-car lot (which is still there) and perhaps half a mile east of what was then Martini&#39;s diner.  The sky was bright with stars.  I don&#39;t rremember if the moon was visible.  A mile or two away, to our east, a line of treetops was outlined.  A brilliant silvery sphere rose slowly and deliberately up from behind the trees.  It was impossible to judge its size.  Relatively speaking it was about the size of a full moon.  Because the tree line was about one or two miles away, the sphere must have been of considerable real size.  It wobbled slowly upward and in our direction until it was almost directly overhead, then made an abrupt turn to its left.  By this time my friend and I had stopped walking and had begun waving and shouting at it.  It wobbled in the same falling-leaf motion until it disappeared over the horizon to the north.  All together it was in sight for about 9 minutes.  On its approach it covered an arc of about 80 degrees of sky, and about the same distance during its departure.  It was moving against a strong wind, was completely silent, and didn&#39;t change in shape, color, brightness or in any other respect except direction of flight, as far as we could tell.  Neither of us reported the incident.  It was not an ordinary object, not an airplane, balloon, blimp, space debris, satellite, or hoax --at least I can&#39;t imagine how such a hoax could have been perpetrated, or why, in the middle of the night in a deserted area.  It turned my conception of the physical world upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Also, witness indicates location of the sighting was in Deming, NM, but states it occurred in Keansburg, NJ.  We suspect the text of his report is accurate, so we have changed the location to New Jersey in the box filled out by the witness.  We have invited the witness to have the other witness submit a report, as well, if that is possible.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the prompt and flattering reply.  I&#39;m grateful to finally have this sighting somewhere in the archives.  It&#39;s been bothering me for 48 years or so!  I was in high school at the time and didn&#39;t give<n> <n><n> it that much thought, but went on to become a skeptic, psychologist and trained observer.  It&#39;s made the burden of carrying this information that much heavier, since the experience matches up with nothing I&#39;ve learned about the physical world or the mind.  As for my friend, ((name deleted) by name, I&#39;m doubtful that I can find him.  It&#39;s been a long time.  I&#39;ve heard that he spent a few years in prison and had become bald.   I&#39;ll see what I can do about contacting him.  If he&#39;s still alive I doubt that he&#39;s forgotten the incident.  I also know some others who have had sighting and will try to reach them as well.  Thanks again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport:  You can print whatever you like.  I don&#39;t know how much it adds to my credibility as a<n> <n><n> witness in this instance but I have two doctorates, one in cultural anthropology and one in clinical<n> <n><n> psychology, which together would seem to cover a lot of bases where the exotic and the bizarre are<n> <n><n> concerned.  Most of my career has been spent in research.  Of course ((name deleted))  name shouldn&#39;t be included.  (Just after this thing disappeared -- I don&#39;t want to call it an &#34;object&#34; -- he turned to me and said, &#34;Max, if you&#39;d been alone and told me about this later I would have said right away that you were bullshitting me.&#34;  That&#39;s verbatim; this stuff is pretty clearly etched in my brain.)  I just did try to find him, actually, and located someone with his name living in New Jersey.  I sent him an email last night but have had no reply yet.  I&#39;ll let you know if anything else emerges.<n>
11/13/53 20:00|Cicero|IL|Other|2 minutes|Triangular formation passing over head just west of Chicago, Illinois.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60282.html|4|ndxe195311| Triangular formation passing over head just west of Chicago, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On about November 13th, 1953, my mother and I were walking down the street at about 8:00 P.M. in Cicero, Illinois.  Passing over our heads at a great distance up was a formation of seven bright white dots of light in a dark sky.  They were dots, because of the great distance we were seeing them from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving slowly toward the east, which would have taken them right over Chicago, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The seven dots made two three point triangles inside of each other, with the inner triangle have the extra dot on one side.  It took about two minutes for them to pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the formation again a few days later, on about November 16th, 1953 around the same time.  This time, we only saw six bright white dots traveling in the same formation and direction.  Again, it took them about two minutes to pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw anything like it before or after these two times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
