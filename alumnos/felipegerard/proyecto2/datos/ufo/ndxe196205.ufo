5/20/62 23:00|Whitehouse (near)|NJ|Light|20 minutes|Bright light, "electrical sensation" and missing time.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50581.html|2|ndxe196205| Bright light, &#34;electrical sensation&#34; and missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving on Hwy 20 in that area, coming from an evening shift of working at Somerset Hospital as an LPN Nurse....planning to join friends  as it was the weekend  and I had the next day off from work. I was driving for about 15 minutes or so, when I was startled by a very bright light, seemingly behind my vehicle at first, than, above me. I tried to turn to my right to see what the light was...could hardly move my head. I started to feel an &#34;electrical&#34; and/or buzzing feeling in my entire body...my hands and arms especially. I could feel this feeling on the steering wheel as well...and I reached out to touch the dash board...all felt &#34;electrical in nature. I suddenly felt the feeling of motion/rising...car and all...heard a voice telling me that all would be alright. The very last thing I remember is thinking, &#34;Oh yes, now I remember, this has happened before&#34;! I found myself in my car/opposite end of hwy  and several minutes/miles down the road, in the wrong direction. No unusual marks or scars. Was not even upset or fearful, for some odd reason. Continued on to my destination. No sound other then a buzzing/humming sound from the light, was evident. No recollection of beings of any kind. Have had other such experiences throughout my lifetime. I am likely terminally ill  and wish to tell of my many experiences. I can type up a report for you  and send it snail mail, with other data/pics/info, if you like. I  feel like these types of experiences should be documented or reported when possible. There is importance to same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/15/62 21:30|Pittsburg|OK|Changing|20-30 secs.|Large, red light, flanked by smaller red lights that appeared to change shape|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49492.html|3|ndxe196205| Large, red light, flanked by smaller red lights that appeared to change shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a young boy, appx. 10-11 yrs. old at the time of my sighting and living in a small, farming community in SE Oklahoma.  I was an airplane enthusiast and modeler at the time, but UFO&#39;s were not in my vocabulary.  I had never heard the term before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One spring evening, probably late May or early June (appx. 1962-63), I went to bed at 9:00 pm which was my normal routine.  My bed was placed next to my window (which faces west) and, as usual, I would stare out into the night sky prior to falling asleep.  This time, just as I was drifting off to sleep, I saw an unusual object floating in the sky, seemingly just outside my window.  Coming fully awake, I was startled to see a large, circular red light, appx. the size and color of a traffic light as seen from about 100 ft. away, hovering at a height appx. 50-60 ft. above the ground.  On either side of the large light were two smaller red lights, about one-fourth the size of the central light, and angling upwards at about 45 degrees so that the entire object appeared V-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the object for appx. 15 secs. at which point the following occurred; the large, central light dimmed to about half its former luminosity and the four smaller lights winked out completely leaving only the large light visible.  Appx. 2-3 secs. later, the four smaller lights reappeared only this time in a straight line, two above and two below the central light.  The smaller lights were also dimmed this time to match the brightness of the central light.  I continued to watch this arrangement for appx. 15 more secs. before the lights winked out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that my window was open that night and at no time did I ever hear any noise from the craft nor did it change position while in view.  I also remember there being a stiff breeze that evening as evidenced by the rustling of the tall grass in the field directly behind my back yard which would seem to rule out a balloon of some kind.  I also believe that all of the lights correlated to just one object and not that all of the lights were individual objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was about 11 years old, my sister would have been 10, and our friend would have been 9.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were &#34;star gazing,&#34; looking up at the beautiful night sky.  Suddenly, a round dark object with lights all around it (I think they were clear lights, but they might have been colored...I don&#39;t remember) came softly whirring by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to hover over us for a few seconds, and then whirred on into the night.  I don&#39;t remember if it came back or not, it might have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never spoken about this incident before today, but when I watched a fascinating program on Larry King Live/CNN last night I realized that other people have had these same experiences, so now I don&#39;t feel alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5/15/62 21:00|Acoma|NM|Cylinder|30min.|On this date my Mother and cousin and I were traveling west on the interstate40 ,between albuquerque and the lava fields outside acoma.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03487.html|5|ndxe196205| On this date my Mother and cousin and I were traveling west on the interstate40 ,between albuquerque and the lava fields outside acoma. as we were traveling My cousin and I observed a light on the horizone. It appeared stationary but was getting brighter.As time went by the light we realized was moving toward us going east. By this time my Mother also saw it and thought it was a plane  that was going to land on the freeway because of trouble. My Mother pulled the car over to the side of the road stopped the car and turned off the engine. As it got closer instead of one bright light there were 4 and it was almost above us. We got out of the car and there was no noise at all no crash nothing it just disappeared.We also realized that the nearest landing strip was approp.90 miles away. Then the light just shot off in a northerly direction. that was the first of many unexplainable lights I saw in the sky. My family is from Az and as kids and later as young adults we would through a sleeping bag down and fall asleep watching ufos.<n>
