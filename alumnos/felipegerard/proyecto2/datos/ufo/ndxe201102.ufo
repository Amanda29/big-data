I got out of my car and was walking to my back door when I noticed a very bright light just to the northwest of my house.  It was not at the altitude of normal jet traffic, but seemed to be at a level that small aircraft would fly.  What caught my eye was that it wasn’t traveling at the normal speed of an aircraft.  It was moving slower and it was much brighter than what a small plane looks like.  I stared at it and also noticed that it seemed to be wavering back and forth a little as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  I watched it travel for about 2 minutes and thought that as it passed me I’d see a blinking light or something that would indicate it’s just a plane or helicopter, but all of a sudden the bright light just went out and I never saw it again.  I stayed outside for a few more minutes hoping to see it again, but it never appeared.  It was a crystal clear night with ! lots of stars out.  We live in the country and I see things all the time moving across the sky, but this was definitely something different.  Just the sheer size and brightness of the light told me it was not something normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/11 20:00|Ridgecrest|CA|Sphere|10 minutes|THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS.|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80262.html|2|ndxe201102| THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MYSELF AND TWO FRIENDS OBSERVED AN OBJECT COMING FROM THE NORTH TRAVELING AT A SLOW SPEED AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 20000 FT. ONCE I SHOUTED TO ONE FRIEND TO SEE WHAT I WAS SEEING, THE OBJECT CAME ALMOST TO A STOP, CHANGED DIRECTIONS AND HEADED EAST. AS IT TRAVELED EAST, IT SEEMED TO SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN. IT DID THIS FIVE TIMES. AS THAT HAPPENED, FRIEND ONE SHOUTED TO FRIEND TWO TO COME SEE WHAT WE WERE WITNESSING. ONCE SHE CAME OUT, IT CAME ALMOST TO A STOP AGAIN. THEN WE SAW WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY TWO JETS COMING FROM TWO ANGLES TOWARD THE OBJECT. ONE FROM THE WEST AND ONE FROM SOUTHEAST. THE VERY MOMENT WE SAW THE TWO JETS COME INTO VIEW, THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, ITS ORANGE LIGHT FLICKERED ON AND OFF AND SHOT OFF IN THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. STILL IN AMAZEMENT FROM THIS EVENT, MY TWO FRIENDS WENT BACK OUTSIDE AND SAW IT AGAIN. THIS TIME IT APPEARED FROM THE WEST. IT HAD THE S! AME MANNERISMS AS BEFORE WITH THE WAY IT MANEUVERED. ITS LIGHT FLICKERED AGAIN AND LITTERALLY DROPPED FROM THE SKY. AS IT CAME DOWN, IT FLUTTERED AS A PLASTIC GROCERY BAG WOULD. IT THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND A NEIGHBORING HOUSE. WE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE AREA FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. NOTHING REAPPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/11 20:00|Denver (east of; Weld Co.)|CO|Light|30 min|Bright Lights Low in Eastern Denver Skyline|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80286.html|3|ndxe201102| Bright Lights Low in Eastern Denver Skyline<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we saw 2 bright lights low in the sky diagnal to eachother, then the lights moved and went to the opposite diagnal of eachother.  Few minutes later a light just below the 2nd light popped up, and literally popped into the night sky.  Then a 4th light appeared and 5th. They looked to be staggered in the sky way too low to be stars.  There&#39;s no airport strip or lit towers East of Denver in Weld County, so it couldnt have been a plane.  Satallites don&#39;t move like these lights did, they moved around eachother shining bright and fading and then reappearing brighter then ever.  They had to have been there for atleast 20-30 mins, and I watched about of 25 mins of it.  Its was breath taking, I had to call my mom. I&#39;m just looking for a logical explination, I&#39;ve seen these lights in the Eastern sky a few times before, always in the east though, and I&#39;ve NEVER seen 5 of them together this completly blows my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any answers will help.  Thank you<n>

From the corner of my eye, I noticed a flashing or blinking light, so I looked up in that direction and saw what appeared to be lights flashing at either end of a long straight line.  The lights were white. The flashing went from side to side and seemed to travel briefly the length of the rod before flashing from the other end and back.  The lights were small and the object had to be huge, as the distance between the lights was much longer than any wingspan of any plane I&#39;ve seen flying around here.  It was silent and slow moving and I could see no shape of an object between or along the lights.  The object was tilted at a diagonal of about 45 degrees as it traveled away from me in a Northwest direction.  The angle increased a bit as it moved further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The object was emitting a silver and bright blue light I happen to get the binoculars and see the object fly away and saw a disk with a blue energy field around it.  After that 5 mins later I happen to look up and there was another object right over the backyard hovering this one was more of like and orb like object with a reddish energy field around it.  My cousin ran inside got the camera and started to take picture it hovered over for a while then started to fly towards the east passing the palm tree in the back yard. It was amazing this was no plane I see planes everyday this happen from 3 to 3 45 there was no sound at all.  My cousin and I have been seen the orb like object for about 2 months now this was the first time we were able to take a picture.  This happen in California in the city of west Covina.<n>

I  followed it with the binoculars, it then changed direction and I lost sight of it, this was very weird!<n>

I was looking up at the sky when I noticed 2 Con-Trails from a commercial jet that appeared to come from the Northwest and climbing in a Southeasterly direction.  I presumed that it was a flight leaving San Diego Airport, Lindberg Field. During this time my eyes tracked the Con-Trail for maybe 1 or 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was observing the Con-Trail, suddenly another object, very bright and oval in shape, which I did not recognize, i.e. UFO appeared much closer to me than the jet which I had been observing, many miles closer in my estimation, it was coming from the Northeast, flew directly overhead at a great rate of speed and disappeared out of sight going Southwest.  The distance it traveled from first sighting in the Northeast to last sighting in the Southwest was less than 10 seconds.  The UFO was about the size of a Quarter from my vantage point.  I could not estimate it’s altitude and it had no Con-Trail.<n>

On the same street, there was another truck pulled over to watch the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights were moving very slowly, but at different velocities.  After a few minutes, one by one, the lights just ‘went away’.  The eastern most lights faded first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, the lights started fading at the same time an airplane heading over Bozeman, started to approach the airport in Belgrade.  The lights from the airplane were completely different in color and appearance than the lights floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following Monday, I mentioned the ‘occurrence’ to an acquaintance, and she was very surprised to hear what I had to say because her parents and grandparents told her that they had seen 40 or more lights that same night in the same location.<n>

It was Diamond shaped and it had bright red lights on it where it started to get pointy and below at the bottom point that reached to the middle of it. The middle was black  and it had to blinking lights at the points it made no sound and as soon as we parked and got out of the car it started moving away toward the south heading towards the Holy Hill / Daytona area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A cylinder like object just hovering not moving.  The trees are about 1/8th of a mile down the road, and about 40 feet or more tall, big pine trees.  looking at it holding out my arm with a ruler in my hand, like a painter comparing sizes, the object from the trees would appear 5 inches beyond the rulers length.  One customer suggested that it was a ballon stuck to a tree, mind you  If the object was directly above the tree and indeed a ballon, that would be at least a 10 foot string attached to it.  The other objection to it being a ballon, given the storms wind factor, it remained still for 3 - 4 minutes, a l! ittle hard for a ballon in a tree to do.  Another suggestion was that its a hawk, but again size, shape, lack of movement.  The though of a plane or helicopter was phased out of thought as well, the object was under the clouds, and quite visible, no lights, and the shape is far wrong, no noise, and given the weather conditions, i doubt a helicopter would be hovering that long with out even a slight twitch for stability, though its not like air traffic is uncommon, small airport across town, bradley international, 2 air national guard bases, and a air force reserve base all in a 50+ mile radius, we can identify a f-15, f-22, and a-10 just from the sound before we see them, chinook from black hawk, between skirosky and pratt and witney both in the state. After about 4 minutes the object start to move, some what slowly it seemed, downward farther south (judging by the object getting smaller quickly yet moving downward slowly) while retaining shape, which cances out the chance ! of a plane in midturn while approaching Bradley, which often (! mor so a t night with their lights) can seem like its stationary, or 1 single bright light. I want to remain logical on this, and the possiblity that it is something man made, but for the moment given the time, distance, clearity of the object in an unclear sky, and weather, no one that saw it could identify what it is, so by nature it is undentified and in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Valrico, FL USA Photographs and videos taken were shot between 8:37-8:47pm EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned back to my parent’s house after a birthday dinner party just after 8pm. My father stepped out on the rear patio to have a smoke break. Shortly after, he hollered for my husband and brother to come quick and look at this. He exclaimed, “What the hell is that?”  This peaked our interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects appeared to be burning or on fire and made absolutely no noise, no prop wash, no piston engine sound, and no jet wash, no recognizable navigational red and green lights.  They appear to be on some sort of flight path following interstate I-4 West coming out of Tampa’s Gulf area heading east. These objects could clearly be seen breaking the Western Horizon but never met the Eastern Horizon. They seem to head upward &amp; fade out and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting was of a cluster of 3, in a triangular formation; once the last of the 3 faded away, 2 more broke the horizon evenly spaced out, then accompanied by 1 more, totaling 4 in a straight line, fading into outer space, followed by another series of 4.  Following the same flight path and pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When viewed with Binoculars the objects were in the shape of seashells with the bottom illuminated. They had constant luminosity and appeared to be at a uniform altitude and heading. They all seem to gain altitude at the same location as they advance skyward out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, after contacting the sheriff’s office and local news channels only ONE other call was made about this phenomenon. Several reporters were sent images and video but none have responded to date.  Several remarks were made to sort of “lighten” the situation by such individuals.  We also called several family members and friends  that would’ve been in the flight path; however none were able to see these objects, but they should’ve been able to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only one of the 6 witnesses, who was 1st to see the objects has seen a ufo sighting over lake Erie Ohio in the 60s as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it is my opinion  that all persons present are credible witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible &#34;Chinese&#34; lanterns, we suspect.

Bright, fiery orange upside down teardrop, with a more rounded tip, floating from one horizon to another. Slightly glowing and pulsating. Flying below clouds as far as we could tell. Much too slow to be a shooting star or comet, even lacking a tail that either of those would have. Direction of pulsating glow upwards toward and from the larger round part of the teardrop, but, with focus, seemed like it was made up of many small lights, resembling tightly gathered Christmas Tree lights. Path was a straight line, as it seemed. We observed it until out of sight. The witnesses : Heavy Equipment Operator, father, college student, mother. No drug/alcohol use...expecting a child.

I grabbed my IPhone (Can only take pictures) and I took some pictures. The craft was a few miles away, but I still got some shots. There where aircraft passing by the two crafts. After two minutes one of the two lights disappeared. Following, after six minutes, the second one just disappeared. The lights stayed pretty much at the same space for the whole time. I don’t know how long the craft’s have been there before I took notice of them, but the duration in which they where visible for me was 6 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful sunny morning in the early hours.  The sky was blue with no clouds and the sun was not too bright, but, was nice.  I decided to take a couple of pictures of the water and the surrounding area with my digital camera.  We were driving in a convertible with both the top and windows down.  I didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary, until I downloaded the pictures and saw what looks like a small dark circle type disc in the background of the picture.  I had shown my husband the pictures as well, and he said that the first picture may be due to sun exposure, but, that in the second picture, the object had a slightly different shape to it. I checked out the second picture, which was taken about 10 - 20 seconds after the first one, and I did notice that the disc shape was a little different and facing in a different direction than in the first picture. I as! ked my husband if I should report this along with sending the pictures to your organization, and he said that it wouldn&#39;t hurt, and that it would be interesting to hear what you have to say about this as well. There have been several sightings in the Florida Keys in the past years, and some of the possible UFOs were not actually seen by the naked eye until the pictures were actually downloaded.  Most of the time, these pictures, I had noticed and had read, were taken either during sun rise or sun set.  I am going to e-mail the two pictures to you as well.  Thank you so much for taking the time to view them and read my sighting statement.  I honestly believe that I may have captured something on film that could not be seen until I downloaded the pictures, or maybe I didn&#39;t notice the object at the time.  If you do decide that this was an actual UFO sighting, this would be my first one.  Thank you again and I look forward to hopefully hearing from you concerning my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to go out for a smoke, walk over and close her door. As I got outside I made it to the side of the road and changed my mind I then turned around going back to my steps and in the background of my trailer I noticed two rectangle orange lights in the sky just floating there not moving. I looked at it for a second more trying to make out if it was one object or two. As I kept staring for a minute more I got  scared because it wasn’t flying forward or backwards and a red light started flashing. I then got a real shock feeling in my body from getting scared so I flicked my smoke and ran inside. I then went to my back bedroom to see if I could still see it, and it was still there. I then got more scared tried phoning other people to go look but nobody answered. I didn’t want to think I was going crazy, I went outside again 10 minutes later and it was gone.  The lights were low enough to ! make out they were rectangles. I tried to think it was a satellite, but it wasnt moving and once the red light started flashing I knew I didn’t want to witness anymore. I had to take a adivan to calm my nerves I was shaking so bad. Space craft or not I don’t want to witness anything like that again. This is not the first UFO sighting in this community, but the people who witness the other one have a different description.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/26/11 03:30|Travelers Rest|SC|Unknown|1 min.|Four lights hovering above us, following us, then disappearing.|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80346.html|24|ndxe201102| Four lights hovering above us, following us, then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early morning. The sky was clear, the weather calm.  Four of us were riding around trying to find local haunts to do some EVP work at, when we found our selves driving around in the northern area of Greenville County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a back road, and followed it out to try and get back to civilization. We approached an area where the highway intersects with another and decided to make a u-turn. That’s when the incident occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife had been looking out the back window noticing some strange lights behind us. She had mentioned it once or twice. As soon as we were doing the u-turn, she had hollered out “LOOK!” Still maintaining its course, four glowing lights of a dim green-orange color rotating counter-clockwise hovered above us at a low altitude and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was left speechless, and she refuses to believe what she saw.  The other two passengers barely caught a glimpse of the lights.  I saw them out my window the same time as my wife. We keep our eyes to the sky now.  This incident is the closest I have ever seen this type of thing.  I thought I would share this, since I haven’t reported any of my incidents before.  Thank you.<n>

My mom asked, “What is that?” and I responded with my typical response, usually in a joking manner, “It’s a UFO!” My mom said again, more seriously, “No, really. What IS that?” I squinted to get a better look at the object, but the lights were too bright for me to really focus on it. From what I could tell, it looked like a disc shaped object with extremely bright white lights and a greenish light in the center. It was extremely close to the ground, and appeared to not be moving. There are no airports nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about half a mile away from my house when we first spotted it. We turned onto our street and my mother decided to circle the block to see it again. However, when she looked to where it was, it had vanished! I looked outside my window and saw the object zooming across our neighbor’s house!<n>

I looked to my top left and saw what looked to me at that point was a pole with orange lights, then I thought, no, theres no poles with orange lights around here!, so I slowed the car down, and said to james, “What the fuck is that?”,  he saw it too, I said, quick get ya mobile phone and record it!, he tried and it did not get anything,.  As this banter was happening, We saw there was five lights, three fairly close together and two further down to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going for late night shopping at approx. 8 28 pm Australia time, and j came too to check his bank balance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights started to move and started to spread apart.  One of the orange lights fizzled, and could no longer be seen.  I turned around behind me and there was 2 that I focused on.  Initially there was five, and I only saw one fizzle, to then turn behind to see the two in sky.  From the right hand side of kent street facing to the right, I spotted an aeroplane high with the red and blue lights, I am wondering if they saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we thought was strange was that they wernt glowing like shining light, it was more like orange round embers floating really fast. When the one I saw fizzed, it was like when you break up a fire ember on the ground, but in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all. And the orange ‘blobs’/embers were in front of the stars, like closer than the stars, if you get what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened within 5 minute span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this because I have never seen such strange colour and movement in sky before.  I saw on the news today about the discovery spaceship going up, I wonder could it be residue?, or what?, AND has anyone else seen this orange display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will do a photoshop pic to show depth of color and proximity b4 they dissipated.<n>

Then dimmed while moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went out for a smoke around 8 to 8:30 at my friend&#39;s house and noticed a bright white light looking northwest. Figured it was a plane or helicopter but just sat in one spot for about 10 minutes. Saw a plane fly by in between us and the object. Noticed it started changing after 10 minuted with settle light beaming or a haze from the top and bottom of the object. Was thinking it was a planet before it started changing. Two for my friends saw it as well. Less than a minute later the light dimmed slowly and moved very slowly closer to the ground and to the right then went out of sight. I know it wasn&#39;t a plane. There&#39;s airports and Boing near by so I know what a plane looks like and you always see flashing marker lights eventually. I can&#39;t explain what I saw but heard of fireball sightings in our area lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ironically, I was also thinking how cool it would be to see another daytime UFO (I had witnessed 2 prior to this sighting back in 2009).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m standing there gazing up at the sky I immediately noticed a large black bird and while looking at the bird happened to see a white, shiny object right next to it but at a much higher altitude.  Obviously, my attention was then focused on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I believed it was an airplane because we see them often flying in and out of TIA about 25 miles away.  But, as I looked closer, I noticed there were no wings on this craft!  Even at a very high altitude, the wings of planes are easily visible on a clear day, especially when they fly directly overhead as this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> here were only a few small clouds in the sky today so that was not an issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was flying at approx 25,000-30,000 ft yet, it flew slower than normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a white, shiny material (since the sun was reflecting off part of the craft) and flew from east to west, towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was the size of a grain of rice held at arm&#39;s length and the same shape too. It made no noticeable sound. Whenever airplanes fly over us, they are easily heard and recognized as plane. They can be quite loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object when the bus pulled up and my attention drawn away.  When the bus left and my kids and I were walking back up the driveway to our house, I stopped and tried to find it again but, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2009 I saw and reported an identical craft flying from west to east and disappearing into a narrow but very tall, cylindrical shaped cloud.  I should have seen it exit the other side of the cloud if it had maintained the same speed but, the object never came out the other side.<n>

I looked up and saw a ball shaped (round) rotating wingless craft traveling eastward around 60-70 mph at around 1000-1500 ft altitude in a direct line towards Charlotte NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball was rapidly rotating..it was red then black...then it would flash.The flash was really bright..like a camera flash.Then it would repeat over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was nearly vertical over my position and it was absolutely silent.There was a strong 25 to 35 mph wind blowing crossways to the travel of the craft. And it had no effect on its line of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was slightly larger than a Cessna type plane..and traveling far lower than they usually do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the skies regularly. And can easily identify helos both military and civilian/Cessnas/Jets both small and large. I have seen blimps and balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even saw a biplane once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this wasn&#39;t even close to any of these.  And again...it was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had the flash not caught my eye.  I would have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a cloudless bright sunny day...at 3:57 in the afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not use drugs.  And I don&#39;t drink. I am as sober a person as they come.<n>

They increased in brightness and and went directly up.

I then looked out a little window in the restroom and saw a strange triangular shaped flying object.  It made no noise and seemed to hoover.  It moved slowly and I just stared in disbelief. When I realized what was going on I went for my cell phone and went outside to record this only took me a few seconds. When i went outside the object was gone.  The following nights I would go and stare out my window to see if it would pass again, but it didn&#39;t.  I also felt strange during the nights I felt scared and I could&#39;t go to sleep it was unusual.  It felt like someone was watching me, taking me to places.  The memories are very faint, but I do remember feeling strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Triangular shape with three lights at each end, hovered made no noise, moved slow at first but then vanished, only saw one, was a grey color, very low altitude looked like it was about to hit some houses,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was on Hwy 101, which is right along the beach.  At first I thought they were helicopters, but then they were too big, and they had blinking lights around them.  I pulled over to get a better look, but by the time I got out of the car, only one light was left.  Then that light faded and disappeared.  I stood longer and the other light rose up from the horizon and stood still.  That that light slowly disappeared.  Did they go up to space or just fade out?   That is the first time I saw something like this.  Is this a weather phenomenon, or a military thing (Vandenburg AFB is north of here and Pt. Magu Naval Base is just south of here).  If alien, then why do they just disappear and what are they probing?<n>

After dropping to about 20 degrees off of the horizon to the lower right of my window, the object very quickly changed direction and shot off slightly to the right and away and disappeared over the horizon in kind of a bow shaped pattern following the contour of the earth at about 20 to 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the distance to the object was initially several miles from my viewing location, and was 15 to 20 miles away before disappearing over the horizon.  It initially appeared about the size of a golf ball from my vantage point, but was very small when it shot off and away to the right.  Total viewing time was a matter of a few seconds.  My wife was with me, but her back was facing the object when it appeared, and object was out of sight before she could turn to take a look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event occurred the same night as the last launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Center.  I have lived near Naval Air Stations in San Diego, and now Jacksonville, FL, and have observed numerous military aircraft, but have never seen an object like this, and seen it move and change directions so quickly.<n>

It seemed to be slowly gaining altitude and kept going through the light pattern I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m in the house now so I don&#39;t know if it is still out there.

This happened about three or four times.  The last time that we saw the anomaly the orange light to the left of the other two shot out about four more orange lights then they all faded away.

It was a huge v shaped figure with clear lights not blinking but hovering.  It then slowly moved to the right and went off to the distance. I didnot  look low to the ground but big enough to catch your eye.  All of the lights were insink.  I counted least 7 lights.  There was no sound in the sky.  Where I live we often see and hear airplanes but not at that time.  This shape took up most of sky where I was looking.

The lights i seen were brighter than the normal stars in the sky.  After watching for at least one minute the V or triangle shape shifted and slowly moved to my right and dissapeared into the horizon.  All i could see was the bright lights moving insink, all around the lights was complete blackness.  Whatever I saw was big.  Too big to be an airplane, and had no sound.I was pretty cool and scary at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have seen other launches from the roof of my condo complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there I have an unobstructed view.  I am about 60 miles from the base but have no problem seeing the launches.  I set up my telescope and aimed in the general direction of where I have seen launches before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light source over the exact spot of the direction that the base is located.  The light changed colors from red to green to yellow and orange.  I was able to see this light with the naked eye.  I was low on the horizon from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night.  I saw stars a lot higher in the sky and none were no where near the brilliance of the light I saw.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter or a plane but it stayed perfectly still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this craft for no less than 25 minutes (Between 2:05 and 2:30 am PST) while waiting for the launch which did not come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I checked the Vandenberg AFB website to see if they had any info on the launch and right at the top of the website it said, &#39;Breaking news: Taurus XL launch delayed due to technical difficulties. The launch has been rescheduled for 02/24/11 2:09 am PST.  24 hours after the original launch date.<n>

It was low in the sky and unusually bright, much brighter than any airplane lights, flashing and drifting very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my binoculars and while looking at it noticed two things.  It was actually several red and white lights flashing together, very bright and had an L.E.D. quality to the light.  The red and white flashing lights were unnaturally pure and bright.  There was also a small orange, glowing, perfectly round light much dimmer (the color was similar to a setting sun but much smaller.  Just a dot) that seemed to be pulsing in concert with the much brighter red and white lights below it.  It appeared as if the small orange dot was pulsing in communication with the lights below it.  This small orange ball was a separate object judging from the distance above and off to the side of the red/white object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this thru the binoculars for several minutes the red and white lights separated into two distinct objects. One red and one white.  These two objects flew around each other doing what seemed to be impossible maneuvering at an extremely high rate of speed over a very small area.  Almost like two huge laser beam points dancing in concert together.  The red and white objects were traveling so rapidly in close proximity to each other that they appeared at times as one red and one white streak of light &#34;dancing&#34; together creating pretzel like shapes.  The whole time, the orange dot was also observed and kept its relationship to the slow drifting red/white display going on below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this for about 5 minutes the objects slowly drifted below the horizon behind the tree tops. I continued to look in the direction with my binoculars for about an hour but saw nothing else out of the ordinary.  I will definitely be looking in the same direction at the same time tonight to see if it happens again.<n>

I was standing in my back yard facing south looking up at they sky.  I was smoking a cigarette cause I do not smoke in the house.  While looking up in the direction of the stars that make O’ryan ((sic--Orion)), when I was talking to my son showing him the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son then pointed out a light in the sky moving.  He said it looked like an airplane but saw not flashing lights and was way to high. It looked more like a star moving really fast, when I finally noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my wife out and 3 of my children came out too, we all watched it but thought maybe it’s a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the light moving at a very fast speed, it stopped.  The star the sat in one spot for about 45 seconds.  That is when it started moving slowly in a sort of circle motion but did not complete a full circle, and then just shot in the East direction EXTREMELY FAST!!   Stopped and sat for a few, then started moving kind of longitudinally direction, back and forth about 4 times.  Still have not seen any colors or anything, still looked like a star just had life to it.  It would also move in the latitudinal  direction back and forth, but at a faster speed then longitude.  It was at this time of 7:40 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 22 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That I decided to contact someone.  Unfortunately, it was dark and did not have a video device to capture evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star, Sirius.  PD))<n>

As I was walking I noticed a very large shape in the sky, it was masked by the sky itself and the form could be made out only by the way the clouds where hugging around it. The shape never moved but the clouds did. It was large enough for me to question what I was seeing, so I decided to pull out my phone and take a couple of pictures. As I aimed the lens on my phone my vision closed to a black out, like I was fainting. I tried to shake out of it, and it seemed like a quick head rush and continued on my way, snapping other pictures as I went ( not of the sky though) in fact I never even looked back up ( very weird for me). When I got home I realized that I had not even thought about what had happened until almost an hour later. I went through my pictures and a solid chunk of them where not even there, but I vividly r! emember taking them.<n>

It was flying overhead and approaching in my direction.  It flew directly over head.  It was dark but I could make out the shape. Imagine two triangles stuck together at their bases.  At the tip of one triangle, the one leading, streaks of light were seen. Then streaks of light in the center, and again at the tip of the other triangle.  On the side corners of the triangle, on either side, were red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been travelling at a great speed because it got overhead very quickly.  I did not hear very much sound, but there was a sound, but it did not sound like a plane.  It was more quiet than that. Sort of a whooshing sound.<n>

I saw an object floating above the tree line about ½ miles away. There was no sound, no exhaust, no lights &amp; no wings.  I saw no other objects with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had put up my thumb at arms length and gauged the size it was larger than 3 or 4 times the size of my thumb. It was an oval bell shape with a large band around the bottom of it. It was silver or bright grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for about 3 minutes.  I suddenly remembered my cell phone camera and as I looked away to retrieve my phone and looked back up it was gone.  I looked to see if there was anyone else around who may have seen the object but I was the only one on the road.  It did however spook the wildlife I could tell.  The deer were running full speed as well as an owl that flew out of the woods in the area that the object had been.  It is my own personal belief that for what ever reason I felt it had awareness about it, as if it knew I had seen it.  I did not feel threatened in any way, just a sense that I had witnessed something phenomenal.  I feel that it is my duty to report such an unusual occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was one white circle in the middle and 4 or 5 smaller circles around that pulsated into one circle and then out, causing the smaller circles to be around the middle circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they were from a local school or store, we thought there must be a sale at Fred Beans Ford or a local store, but we did not see a location along the way that would confirm that. We also could not see a light that came from the ground.  The lights followed us the entire way home, not getting smaller or appearing to be further away. When we pulled in our driveway they were above our neighbor’s back yard and very visible with no source of light from the ground. The lights were hovering, doing that same in and out motion over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive takes about 25 minutes.  My daughter and I joked that they were Ufos or something not from our planet, however there was a hint of seriousness because we couldn’t attribute the lights to another source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the Oscars there was a movie trailer for a new sci-fi movie and the opening scene had the same exact lights and movement that we saw last week.  That convinced me that what we saw was in fact something else…..<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I do not follow this kind of stuff.

The trajectory of this bright object was straight Southwest to Northeast across the sky.  No sound was heard!  The most amazing part was the size and the brightness.  After about three minutes the UFO had gone clear across the sky and vanished over the horizon.   At the same time there was a aircraft in the North central sky, you could see the directional lights only on this aircraft, so It was one of ours and there was sound.  Then about 15 minutes after the UFO there was a jet that went over with directional lights and you could hear the jet engines.  Well thats it.<n>

I then began to walk toward my vehicle which was parked in my driveway.  I glanced up and notice an air craft flying in a southerly direction at what appeared to be approximately 10 to 12 thousand feet.  As I was watching it fly away I also noticed that there was another craft which was brightly illuminated flying much lower and at a much slower rate of speed.  I then walked away from vehicle to get a better view of the craft.  I don&#39;t know why but as I tried to make a better observation, I noticed that the craft began to turn it&#39;s lights down lower and lower until there was no lights at all, but the craft could still be seen until it dissappeared in the distance.  I could tell that the air craft ahead of this craft was a plane of some sort, but the craft flying much lower appeared to be circular or round and brightly lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why but I somehow had the feeling that the craft knew that it was being observed and turned it lights off.<n>

I had a clear view out of my livingroom window from this vantage point, and saw what I assumed was a reflection of my saucer-shaped livingroom light fixture.  I didn&#39;t pay it much attention until I saw this &#39;reflection&#39; increase in brightness.  It began to project beams of light to the ground, from its perimeter.  After a few seconds, the beams retracted back into the craft and individual lights around the outside of it began to blink out in a circular pattern until nothing was left visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I ran to the window and could see nothing.  The craft was across the street from my house, to the left of a small storage shed at a playground.  There was nothing in this area that could have made any sort of light, muchless a display like what I saw.  I noticed that from where I was sitting, my livingroom light does not reflect in this window at all.. and even if it had, the c! raft was shaped like an upside down shallow bowl, and my light fixture is not turned in this manner.<n>

It appeared to just float in one spot floating sightly up or down.  I used some power lines in the area to gauge it&#39;s movement.  The wind was blowing east and the object appeared to be moving west or not at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My husband and I were on our way home from a casino (Fantasy Resort) when my husband called my attention.  He asked me what object was he seeing and as I looked in front of us (I was looking outside the window on the passenger seat)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light about 5 or 6 in line.  It was so bright and they seemed to appear to be in one line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, when my husband said, what is that a UFO?  I dismissed it and said no maybe a light post (because it reminded me of the lights in the airport.  But as we are approaching the light (it is stationary, bright, whitish-yellow in color) I noticed that it was floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said my God this is not an airplane (the lights are not blinking, it is quiet) I looked for my phone camera to take picture of it, but I forgot to open the window and it flashed back to me, we were driving so fast (65 mph) and my husband does not want to slow down, because the cars behind us were driving fast, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to look up when we passed by this straight light.  At the back of my mind, I said maybe it is just an airplane, so look at the shape, because the light is so bright and you cannot figure it out right away from afar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked-up and it was round and the lights about 5or 6 are underneath the craft.  It happened this afternoon (21February2011) between 6:00 and 6:05 PM (at dusk).  It was right after or before COOK street in Palm Springs/Indio at freeway 10, we were heading west to our home (Buena Park).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things happened so fast and I was not able to take another picture of it, but I was able to see it up close (just underneath the craft)  I am sure that some motorists may have noticed this light/craft.  You cannot miss the bright light ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to share it.  I don’t know if we have military activity in the area, but I have never seen light that bright and a silent craft that is stationary and I have never seen a round craft before. just wondering what it is.<n>

We looked outside and one of the two trees in the backyard looks like something cut the tops off.  All its branches are in a heap! This is so weird!!!<n>

It was a low humming sound accompanied by a repetitive rapping/banging sound.  For lack of a better comparison, it sounded like a Harley-Davidson flying over our house at about 50 miles per hour, and it was much different than the sound of a helicopter as there was a sort of deep, clunking sound at the rate of 5-10 per second.  As the first object passed there was another one that followed a few seconds later, as if one UFO was following closely behind the other.  We had gotten 13 inches of snow that night so vehicles were non-existent.  I woke up immediately thinking UFO as the sounds were so foreign to me and they were traveling over our house in a path perpendicular to the road.  My wife thought it was a snow plow at the time, but woke up realizing the plows hadn&#39;t gone through at all yet, and didn&#39;t until 7:30 AM.  I&#39;m convinced this was a UFO and am curious to learn if anybody el! se heard anything that night, or better yet saw something.<n>

It was the fastest thing I had ever seen in the sky, I usually look up at the night sky and see airplanes and observe their speed, size, distance and other statistics so I can distinctly know what I&#39;m seeing. The object that I saw moved I&#39;d say at least 5 times faster then any commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw the objects for perhaps 7-10 seconds, it was moving quite fast, and at the end of it&#39;s trajectory it looked like it had opened a sort of warp field, and disappeared into it.  The &#34;warp field&#34; was slightly larger than the object, as it opened it looked as if it was webbed or had a certain structure to it like waves.  It was sort of grey in color.  The &#34;warp field&#34; was only there for a split second prior to the object accelerated and disappeared into it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting I then peered across to sky to see if I could see anything else, and caught some small activity around the moon, but I find it ordinary as I usually small orbs darting in and around the moon from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The big mention is the large orb event that I described in the first two paragraphs.<n>

At first, I thought it was 2 Silver metallic balloons, but right away both objects turn on a reddish/orange light located on the middle bottom of the craft.   There was absolutely no sound of jets of any propulsion sounds, this; despite the object being about 1000 ft. in the air.   Both objects flew from the Miami bay in a direction east to west crossing downtown.   The objects flew towards the airport yet the odd thing was their direction was against the air traffic at that moment.  I am wondering if anyone else saw what we saw.<n>

The ufo appeared in the sky  directly east of the store.  It appeared as a glowing fuzzy red ball  about the size of a pencil eraser.  I often see planes coming in from  that direction and altitude.   When they are coming straight at you, they  appear to hover just like the ufo did.  I assumed it was a helicopter.<n>

I started|2/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80186.html|84|ndxe201102| The weather was partially cloudy (few clouds)I was at the parking place located at the east of the Huntington Beach library.  I started walking into the park (it surrounds the Library), I looked up towards the east and I noticed two bright spherical objects almost static, very high in the sky.  They were moving very slowly from East to West.  The two objects remained almost 6 minutes in the same position (straight up where I was).  They made no sound, but they looked like very shining stars(abnormally big).  The sun light was hitting them and probably it was increasing their luminosity or light reflection. As I looked around the objects, I realized that there was a third spherical object. This one was a little bit more towards the west than the other two, but still at relatively close distance from the pair straight above me.  The sunshine was making the view of this third object very difficult.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot tell how high or big they were, but I can tell with certainty that they were higher up then the commercial planes that  constantly fly this aerial corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted for approximately 8 minutes.  The objects quickly fade while moving towards the west, in the sun direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind was blowing contrary to their heading direction. At that time, the prevalent wind was from West (Coast) to East(Mountains).  The whole incident lasted (at least from the time I first saw the objects) from 15:20 to 15:28.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were plenty of people at the park (despite the coldness of the wind), but the person nearest to me, at approximately 20 feet, was a man practicing skate boarding. He barely noticed me contemplating straight up into the sky, but he did not give any importance to my behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Huntington Beach Police Helicopter arrived at approximately 15:27, and I could hear several sirens.  The helicopter was flying around the park very close from the location where I stood looking straight up to the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if there was an accident or not near by, but that is common event (at least in my experience)to have the Helicopter flying over the park.<n>

Only a few seconds long. No major electrical outages in the area<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Girlfriend and I were driving north on Shields and Prospect in Fort Collins, Colorado.  We saw a bright light radiate from the horizon of the sky off to the northwest at around 12:30-12:45.  It was as if something exploded.  The light had to come off from a few miles away, as it appeared to come from the outskirts of the town.  It lit up the sky like lightening but was too uniform, and only lasted 2-3 seconds. It was a translucent white color. The perimeter of the blast was a darker shade of white and more opaque, almost like a lining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my girlfriend and I got to my place, she said it &#34;looked like a bomb went off&#34;. This morning I called the local electric company and asked if there were any major outages. They could not give me a detailed account since it is the weekend, and they work strictly with reporting outages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was connected to an on-call electrician who said he had not heard of any outages.  When I explained what I girlfriend and I had seen, he ! said that that a blast of a high magnitude would have produced such a projection of light.  The only thing in the area that was capable of omitting such a sphere of light was an electrical substation.  The origin of the blast could have been from this substation, but not without frequent power outages as it would affect an electrical grid over square miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend of mine who lives an area that would have theoretically been affected by the blast, as his house is included in the network of the substation. He reported that his power never went out.<n>

The object was glowing fire orange and with a little red dot in the middle. The object was moving west to east at a fairly slow rate of speed and made now sound. The object appeared to be about half a mile south of us and about half a mile high in the sky. The object was moving on a vertical path and seem to be moving at the same rate of speed the whole time. About the last 10 seconds the object stopped glowing the fire orange and just a small red ball remained and moved up at a 45 degree angle and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While my husband was playing with our dog, I looked up at the sky and noticed a bright light behind our house and thought, &#34;That looks odd&#34;, then suddenly it took off.  As it was flying away I was yelling at my husband &#34;Oh my god, are you seeing that?&#34;  He turned around and said, &#34;What?&#34; and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew towards the ground and Southeast into Everett, Wa.  It was a large bright round light and made no noise.  It was extremely fast and it was not a shooting star, nor a standard aircraft.  We live near the small airport in Snohomish, WA, so we see and hear airplanes all the time.  A few minutes after seeing the bright light, a small aircraft flew over and was at a much higher altitude.  I was excited and slightly nervous after seeing this, as it was rather close to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the same day, around 4:30pm in the afternoon we were driving from Bellingham, Wa.  As we were getting into Snohomish, Wa, near the Ebey Slough I noticed an object in the sky.  It was not moving and as I was telling my husband, &#34;Look!  I think there is a UFO in the sky&#34; and it blinked out.  He couldn&#39;t really stare at the sky as he was driving.  There were no clouds in the sky, so I kept looking as we were driving on the road, but saw nothing.. not even an aircraft.  Not sure if they&#39;re both related, but wanted to add this to see if anyone out there saw the same thing I did.<n>

Crafts made no sounds, no tailings, no vapor trail… Crafts appeared to have windows. One craft moved into a cloud and did not come out.  Upon arrival at my home, I asked my wife to look, and she to witnessed a silverly object of the same discription darting across the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It went by so fast that it blew a bottle of water off the table.  It was way to close to be an airplane and it made no noise.   At one point the object made a 90 degree turn in a different direction, almost like it was trying to avoid something.  It appeared to be about the size of a small car.  The lights blinked in some sort of pattern as well.<n>

Repeated almost immediately|2/18/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80113.html|97|ndxe201102| A pair of orange lights moving fast and disappearing.  Repeated almost immediately.  It is 22:50 hrs Friday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my seated position in front of the computer, with the window before me, I often see the lights of a plane overhead, and sometimes the spotlight of a police helicopter.  Tonight, I was suddenly alerted to a very unusual orange light in the sky moving across my vision.  It looked quite near by.  I have a big view and was able to keep the two objects in  my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light was getting smaller so I guessed they were moving either away into the distance, or what appeared more likely, moving up high into the sky until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued and puzzled, I started to write an email to my local residents’ group to ask if anyone else had spotted them, when, suddenly two identical (were they the same ones?) objects appeared in the same position as before and repeated the trajectory of before.  They were coming from ESE, I would guess and disappearing NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in North London N8 9NX   I raced upstairs to my front door to stand on an open walkway so as to see them better, and also to check if they were making a noise.  There were three teenage boys also watching them up there.  They had no other information to add.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked myself if they could be planes, but the light was the wrong colour; it was distinctly orange and flared, rather than being a directed light of a plane spotlight.  Outside I listened hard for an engine noise and could hear none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 65, a woman, have been a social worker and later a photographer.  I am not religious, and like science.  This is an objective account of something that was truly puzzling.<n>
2/18/11 21:00|Tallahassee|FL|Circle|5 minutes|Bright light in the sky in Tallahassee|2/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80157.html|98|ndxe201102| Bright light in the sky in Tallahassee<n> <n><n> <n><n> I play in a band that was in the same parking lot as fuzions off Kerry Forest in Tallahassee Florida where lights in the sky were reported the night of 02-18-11.  While playing I noticed the crowd’s attention was not on us but the sky.  When I looked to see what it was that had captured the audiences attention from the awesome music I saw only one of the lights.  At first I thought it to be a helicopter using a bright light because of the slow hover like flight patterns that were not 100% straight. I watched this light for the entire song I was playing which was about 4 minutes long.  Having only planes and stars as a reference I could guess the altitude of the light to be less than cruising altitude but much higher than landing plane traffic. (My guess 20,000 ft or more)  This light looked as if was burning white and orange yet it was bigger and much brighter than any stars.  The light also had no visible contrail of light like a meteor or flashing starboard or p! ort lights.   If this light was as high as I think the size of this object must have been big, and the way the light was distorted yet still bright further backed my altitude guess.<n>

The objects were coming from the Southwest area.  They were orange and circular, and they were just a little bit bigger than the stars in the sky.   They were also brighter than the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately took out my phone and started recording it.  There was about 10 of us standing in the parking lot watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A police officer was standing on the sidewalk next to us but when we tried to ask her what the lights were she just ignored us, got in her car, and started talking on her radio while looking at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They first appeared on the treeline in a tight group, then they started spreading out and moving in different directions.  They were all going the same speed and the same relative direction, but they were probably at different altitudes because they were spreading out and moving apart.  Some were brighter than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t ! stay to see the whole thing, but on the way home there were a lot of cops on my road.  There were probably about six or seven cars, with about 10-20 people standing around watching them search.  It seemed like they were looking around in the woods but I was trying to pay attention to the road, so I didn&#39;t see much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 16 years old and I attend Chiles High School.  I wouldn&#39;t have contacted your organization unless I was very concerned, and I&#39;m not trying to waste your time.  I&#39;m an honor student with a ((deleted--very high)) GPA and I&#39;m taking a ((art/film) class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video I took was low quality because it was on my phone, but you can cleary see the lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crowd at the frozen yogurt store was made up of two moms with their children, a few old women, and a police officer, along with the other customers in the store.  My friend refused to write a report because he wasn&#39;t paying attention and thought that I was just being paranoid.<n>

I was going to my truck to get my jacket and looked west up in the sky (something I&#39;m always doing I think in this case though I was looking up to see what the weather was like)  It was clear skies for the most part. My gf&#39;s street is has a lot of trees on it so the spot i looked up was really one of the few openings I could see from where my truck was parked.  I could see planes flying off in the distance, but something different caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a bright Orange object in the sky.  I would say a little larger and a little brighter than what a planet looks like in the sky only this was Orange in color.  It seemed pretty far away, i would say at least a few miles.  That&#39;s what stuck out initially. I told my gf to look at it (she is very skeptical about this type of stuff) while I grabbed my jacket quick.  She even made some comments that it didn&#39;t look like a plane or anything (you could see another plane north west of it with marker lights and everything). I stood there for another minute and watched it move.  The orange object made kind of a clockwise circular movement and then at the 6oclock position it started to move in a straight line and then stopped.  We now began to walk west towards Cambie St hoping to get a better vantage point. I was even tripping a few times on the sidewalk as I was glued to the sky. Once we got a better view I stopped because it started to get dimmer.   My view was framed to the left by! a large tree, the bottom by a house, and to the right was a smaller tree.   The orange object was located i would say about a 45o angle of elevation.  As it was fading (slowly) it wasn&#39;t moving it only flickered a few times.  I paid attention to the fact that it wasn&#39;t moving over anything on the horizon.   And then just like that it was gone.  And I went on with my night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was really fast, I only had my cell phone and don&#39;t think it would have showed that well. I think my drawings will better represent what we saw. My gf can verify everything we saw from the movement, it&#39;s brightness, and it fading to nothing while not moving.<n>

We were facing a hill, just chatting before he had to leave for work.  We also talked about aliens, abductions, or just anything that&#39;s fun enough to talk about.  We were discussing 2012, transcendence into space, etc.  Right in front of us, in perfect view, the brightest flash of light I&#39;ve ever seen was in the sky.  My boyfriend looked behind him, thinking it was a police officer or someone flashing a light on us--haha-- and I was fixated on the light.  It was a pretty big circle, with blue/green lights in a perfect circle, with a big light in the middle of it.  It flashed a few times, then all the lights came together and it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night, and definitely was not lightening, but similar.  The lights were the craziest part to me.  It looked like northern lights. Whatever was the in sky was there long enough for me to shout, &#39;What is that?!&#39; &#34;oh my god, aliens? what are those crazy bright lights?!&#34; and then I got out of the car, heart racing, and watched it leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried looking online for reports, twitter updates, etc.  The only thing I got was this  olliepires  Either it&#39;s a UFO or lightening in my backyard<n> <n><n> <n><n> AlexI3eck WTF WAS THAT THING IN THE SKY?!

What puzzeled me was that they were perfect circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures from our upstairs window to show the circles.  This ranch is out in the middle of no where so I’m not sure how to tell when this happened.  I have looked at it all day and can not make sense of it so we decided to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The inner circle is about 30ft in diameter and the outer circle is about 37ft in diameter.  The distance between the two circles is about 7 feet.  The rings are about 2 feet wide and the dirt just looks sorta chewed up.  There are no tread marks on the lines.  There are tread marks around in other areas….the roads on our property are dirt.but this is different.  There is no entrance or exit; it simply looks like two circles, one inside of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what might have caused this.

At first, I thought it was an airplane, however, as it descended and finally came into view, I finally realized it was, in fact, a saucer-shaped UFO, metallic in nature and dark blue to silver in some areas.   The craft was large, a house-size vehicle, and had a half-spherical shape located/connected on its bottom.  The sighting ended when I had to enter the house to take care of my child.  I did not see it again that evening or since.<n>

The object was seen to have 3 lights total ; no strobe or led in a straight line. This was the second time in the past 4 months this object was seen. No outline or shape of a conventional airframe could be seen from the ground. The object passed directly over head, no sound was heard from a prop or rotor or wind resistance. The even lasted no more than 5 minutes. The lights passed overhead and then vanished. Object was completely gone. Weather conditions were clear at a temp of 60 degrees F. Myself and 3 other people witnessed this event just outside of Robersonville, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were perfectly still and located at the top of a ridge above my property at the top of the tree line.  I live in a rural area and there are no power lines up there.  It was around 7:30 PM.  Your time box will not take my time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was directly under what was almost a full moon(full next night).  Each light was approximately the size of say 1/10th of the full moon.  It took a few minutes for them to come into clear focus.  Then they stayed clear.  I came in before they disappeared because it frightened me.  I was on the phone with my Son in Oregon at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the hills of eastern Kentucky.<n>

As I made a turn, there was a car stopped in the middle of the street and the woman in the car had her head hanging out the window talking on her phone also looking up. I then looked up and there were two lights in the sky, they reminded me of what a flare would look like in clouds but they were moving slowly and moving together at a fairly close proximity. They were a flickering yellow orange color with an orb-like appearance but maybe that had something to do with the clouds. I drove on home and lost sight of the lights but when I went in our backyard, there was another light in the sky. My husband also saw this one. It was not in the clouds like the first two. There were plenty of people here trying to figure out what they were looking at. It was close to dusk so possibly a reflection from the sun. Could not tell the altitude but we also saw a plane that appeared to be higher and it was clearly a plane.  These objects were in the clouds that seemed to be lower but like I said, it’s hard to tell when you don’t know what you’re looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work at a high school and my husband is an engineer. The only reason I am reporting it is that it’s not on the news and I know at least 20 people were watching the sky tonight. We have never seen anything like this before…<n>

It was dark and there was a bright full (or nearly full) moon high in the sky.  Our attention was drawn to a bright cluster of amber lights at about 20 degrees elevation southeast of our location towards Lake Havasu City, AZ.  A 2&#34; wide Subaru logo (the one with the stars on it, minus the &#39;ring&#39;) held at arms length, with each &#39;star&#39; randomly turning on and off, would be a very good representation of what we saw.  The lights would come on for no more than a second or two then go off, with no apparent order, duration, or pattern, until the last moment, when they seemed to cycle sequentially from right to left.  This lasted for no more than 10 to 15 seconds, then we could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a period of about 3 or 4 minutes, the light cluster came on again in the same [southeast] location, randomly cycled for about 10 seconds, then was gone.  The lights ! were bright enough that they were not easily defined (similar to a welding arc).  I could not tell if the lights were part of one object or separate.  The cluster appeared stationary in relation to a mountain range in the background which was at least 8 to 10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not normally report something like this, but on 2/15/11 (two days prior) while traveling westbound on I-40 near Seligman, AZ, a different coworker and I observed the same light formation at approximately 2300 hours MT.  This was the same exact amber cluster, but very low in the sky (probably 5 degrees on the horizon), and seemingly farther away to the west towards Kingman, AZ.  It was only seen one time for approximately 10 seconds total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial assumption was a military exercises of some sort, but after the second closer observation, I&#39;m not as sure now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw what looked like a motor shell(comet) racing to earth. It had a tail about 2 ft. I was a good football field and a half away from this.  It came straight down ,slight angle. made little noise, but appear it was gonna hit land.  There are trees there that look to be 80ft or taller.  This thing, the tail got shorter, looked like the middle was circular, I could see it was burning out.  And then it flared out and disappeared.  It vanished at about one-half the height, higher than the trees.  I believe something is in the field.  This thing came close to landing on my apartment.  There was a solar flare like the day before, and I heard satelites were knocked from their orbits.  Could it be a piece of a satelite?  All I know, it feels like a once in a lifetime event.<n>

At first, I thought the lights were a comet as I observed them through a tree line.  After clearing the tree line and getting a closer look in an open sky, it was clear this was not a comet.  The lights consisted of several circles, but not all appeared to be the same size.  Some were larger than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for approximately 10 minutes as the lights hovered, moving up and down, and left and right.  When we went into the house to get a telescope (which took about 5 minutes), and when we came back outside, the lights were gone.  This was not a satellite, airplane or helicopter.  None of these lights flashed repeatedly, or had any sort of routine &#34;beacon&#34; as we usually see with typical aircraft or satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us have ever seen anything like it in the evening sky before!<n>

I walked over and he said that stars strange.  I said why and he said.  It looks like its going straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started laughing at him and then that object kind of flipped over.  It started coming towards us and then the lights kind of dimmed out.  Then you could see the structure of the object.  It was huge. It was shaped like a skateboard from the late 80&#39;s.  It had 1 light (white) in the front middle with three lights in the back kind of triangle.   The three on the back were either two red one white or two white one red<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was tanker truck that flipped his truck within 5 minutes of the sighting.  We didn&#39;t talk to him.  We don&#39;t eve know if he is alive.  I bet he saw the ufo<n>

Weather clear.  Was looking at stars to the south, walked out from under patio, clearly saw stationary light orange circle to the south-east high in the sky (towards vandenburg (not assuming any correlation)) - for 2 seconds, then disappeared.  Thought was interesting, continued looking south-east for 10 minutes with no sightings, then randomly looked east saw orange circle moving slowly northbound (towards San Luis Obispo) high in the sky for 4 seconds then disappeared. Continued looking all over for another 10 minutes, no sightings besides obvious every-day passenger planes every few minutes.  Thought very strange.<n>

One of my kids said look daddy.  Then the other said what is that.  So I looked  up.  That’s when I saw an aircraft  with a bright light following over it.  I say it was around 2pm or so.  It was traveling north to south from the best that I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did manage to take a picture before it got to far away.  I’m not sure of how big the objects were because of how far they were away.   I could see that one was an apparent aircraft because it had wings and a trail of vapor behind it like most commercial planes do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object had no wings or any vapor trail .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is a copywrited photo of what i saw.<n>

Around 12:30am, maybe a little before or a little after this time.  I am not totally sure the clock in my car was screwed up and not set to the correct time.  I was on the phone at the time, talking and just watching the road ahead.  Caught a light out of the corner on my eye but didnt look.  First thought it was a reflection off my lights that lit up my dash.  Then I quickly thought to myself, the reflection would be orange if it were and the light was not.  So I quickly looked up in the sky at an angle on my left side.  I instently froze.  I could not speak and slammed on my brakes, stopping dead in the middle of the road to watch.  It was a bright white light, the purest white light I have ever seen and a smaller, but still huge greenish light infront that quickly faded gone in a matter on seconds.  The bright white light was left, it appeared to be a longated, cigar shaped light.  And in less then a minute it had gone from my left hand side to my r! ight.  Moving fast as it quickly disappeared over the hills.  I have seen plently of planes, helicoppters and even army planes in my life.  This was nothing I had ever seen.  It appeared to low due to the size of the lights but still higher in the sky then the hills it disappeared over.  I heard no sound.  It moved way too quickly to be a plane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend I was on the phone with, who I told and described everything to said he emailed the Benwood police department asking if there had been any reports and has yet to get a reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was immediately noticed that Jupiter looked odd.  It looks much brighter than normal, and had a long red tail as the bottom point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for a few minutes, the looked around to notice that all the stars appears to look extremely cross shaped, with a  distinct red tail at the bottom.  There were several aircraft in the area, flying that didn&#39;t appear to have these characteristics.  Clouds rolled in shortly after.  I am assuming this was some sort of atmospheric condition that is causing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t able to find any info, by searching on the internet.  So i figured i would post here.<n>

Turning my direction to the sighting, I saw 3 to 5 lights show up just to the right of the big dipper.   The lights were small and I thought at first that it must be skydivers, but then the lights just went out and there was nothing in the sky behind them.   When I started to see the lights come on I noticed a shape starting to come into focus just to the left of the first lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was approximately the shape of a human eye with a shiny silver glow over the top and bottom of the eye formation (somewhat like eye liner) and seemed fairly large to me.  The shape was fully lighted in an outline shape and the center was somewhat void of color except for three yellowish-white circles spaced evenly and horizontal across the center of what would be the pupil area.  This sighting lasted approximately 30 to 45 seconds when the lights just disappeared.  As with the other lights I saw the lights of the shape just went out and there was nothing but sky left.  The shape never moved and it was as if someone had turned on the lights then turned them off again.  This object looked as if it was about a little less than a mile away and if I had put up my hand to try to cover it up, in a horizontal manner, it would have extended beyond my palm.  It appeared just to the left, and above, of a rock hill just up-river from my location.  Also in reference to the big ! dipper I could only see three stars of the big dipper formation when the shape appeared, but then saw the whole formation after it blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear with a three-quarter moon and fairly bright.  There was a small light cloud to the right of the big dipper but it was very wispy looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total of the experience took place within about a minute or so after seeing the first lights to the end of seeing the shape just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It first appeared to be a plane then it made a sharp turn and started heading south.  It was moving in almost a zigzaging motion. Then a military plane flew overhead.  The UFO took another sharp turn and started to head west. The plane did not follow.  The object went behind trees and i lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That was my first assumption but i looked for blinking or any other light that may be a airplane and we saw nothing of the sort.  We counted over 20 different flashes of the bright orange lights.<n>

Within a second, I saw approximately 7-8 more stationary red &#34;asterisks.&#34;  They were formed in an arc and hovered over a mountain in the distance.   As one appeared on the left side of the arc, one disappeared, or kind of faded, on the right side.  This appearing and disappearing continued for several seconds.

2/15/11 01:00|Port Rowan (Canada)|ON|Sphere|all night|Multi colored objects seen regularly by many witnesses.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings of "twinkling" stars?  PD))|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80909.html|137|ndxe201102| Multi colored objects seen regularly by many witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family, neighbors, and i have been seeing UFO&#39;s hover around our neighborhood every night for over two months now. On nights when the sky is clear we see them every night.  I have taken many video&#39;s and several people in the area are seeing them on a regular basis as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family had our first sighting two years ago and we noticed one or two of the objects very far up in the sky from time to time since.  The past two months they are coming on a regular basis.  They show up as soon as it is dark and remain until dawn when we actually watch them glide across the sky and leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen all shapes ans sizes.  There are round balls of different colors.  Some have red, white, green and blue lights while some are one solid color such as orange or white.  There are also triangle shaped objects that have three lights on the bottom and looking up at them from below the lights look like they form a happy face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are red and white ones that fly above the tree tops and they flash like strobe lights.  These ones also stop in one spot for quite some time and sometimes turn their lights off.  We have also seen one of these objects eject a smaller object out of it as it glided across the sky.  The smaller object went down into the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other night there was a large red light flashing in the trees behind our house. It looked like it was low enough that it might be landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many times when the lighted balls were above the tree tops there were many tiny little white lights in the trees below.  The little white lights were still and remained there for hours. It looked like someone had thrown little white christmas lights in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did contact some investigators and they are visiting my home on and off to keep up on what is happening here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I welcome anyone to come here and see these objects.  This is not a hoax.  I am not very comfortable at all having these things surrounding my home each night. I want them to leave.  I know they are there but i also want to make one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a bible thumper by no means but i do believe in God.  It does say in the bible that God will allow evil to do as it pleases in the world to try and trick us.  God wants to see who will turn their belief from him to something else and who will remain faithful to him.  I believe these objects are the works of evil and trying to trick us. Just think about how many people believe aliens created us now because of the frequent sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not asking you to take my word for it.  I am simply asking you to check into what i am saying.  Please don&#39;t put all of your faith and belief in these objects.  I know you are seeing them too or you would not be here reading my report right now.  If you do believe in God please don&#39;t doubt he is there because you are seeing these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings of &#34;twinkling&#34; stars?  PD))<n>

My perspective was that the object was white, round with an orange aura flying  at approximately a 75 degree angle from the horizon.  The object rotated a few times then moved slowly from northwest to south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere.  The witness reported that the object seemed to her to perform several maneuvers in the sky.  It was located above the local clouds, she reported.  We have invited the daughter to submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

I was the first to notice the out of place, orange glowing light outside of the city limits and out towards a large open area in the desert.  It was a clear night, no moon.  I watched the pattern of about 4 lights alternate, each taking turns becoming the brighter light (All orange in color) similar to a Christmas tree light setting.  It was a slow transition.  At first, I thought it was moving like a snake in the sky but now I&#39;m sure it was stationary and on a cycle of some kind, attached to one object - I as we watched, all 4 lights light up brightly and faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky for a while once I got home and did not see them again.  My friend reported seeing something similar that next day.<n>

Seen through binoculars the object was emitting white light in all directions as if it were a sphere.  Size and elevation of object was unknown. No strobe lights or engine noise was heard.  The object traveled westward and stopped over the tree line. The object &amp;quot;hovered&amp;quot; in one spot for approximately 1 minute then changed course and headed north west and disappeared out of view.  The wx conditions were dry and the sky was clear, no clouds were visible.<n>

I thought it was odd to see them there.  I drive through there frequently and I have never scene anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I pulled over, at which point my cousin said the lights must have belonged to a cell tower just over the trees.  Then the triangle started to move, very slowly hover around.  It didn&#39;t make a sound.  I couldn&#39;t believe it, but for some weird reason, rationalized it as a military hovering plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it is awe for a couple of minutes we left for home.<n>

We heard what sounded like a military jet roaring over. When we looked up, we saw 2 lights moving through the sky above heading southwest.  One of them seemed to be chasing the other. They were both moving fast but the &#34;chase&#34; light was definitely moving faster.  Then the slower of them very abruptly zigged, then zagged.  At this point, it zoomed off into the night sky.  The faster object continued on its path and disappeared in teh night sky as well.  All this took place in less than 30 seconds, possibly quite a bit less.  Is it possible that a military jet was dispatched to check into an unknown object in the sky?  Winneconne is located about 12 miles nearly straight north of Oshkosh Wisconsin.<n>

Civil twilight had faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going up a moderate hill and had an unobstructed view of the sky.  A light appeared dead ahead at an apparent altitude of 12,000 AGL and 15 miles distant.  The intensity of the light was about the same as an aircraft landing light at the same range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light dropped vertically by several thousand feet then hesitated for 1 second.  The light then descended to the West at roughly 5,000 miles per hour at a 30-degree angle.  The light did not leave a trail of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light disappeared at an altitude of 4000 feet after a traveling horizontally across 45 degrees of my field of view.  When I crested the hill, it looked like the light had been over the Northern outskirts of Taos.  There were at least 2 aircraft in the far vicinity - one light plane at 5,000 AGL and one airliner at 20,000.<n>

People were getting out their vehicles to view this wedding ring-shaped object with white lights encircling it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes, it just took off at a very high rate of speed straight up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My IPhone camera could not focus on it to get a picture since it was already getting dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a commercial plane or helicopter because it was a circular shape even though this is about 15 miles from the airport.<n>

I looked up to the northeast sky and saw a bright orange light hanging perfectly still.  It was very bright and appeared to have a hair like appendage extending from around its bottom, almost melting in appearance, but this could have been an optical illusion.  I was shocked with what I was seeing.  I screamed out for my wife and daughter to come out of the house and they both saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a few more minutes and it drifted in a straight line west and blinked out.  I mean it just blinked out. I have seen military flares before, but this did not have any resemblance to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to Nashville Airport and airplanes were flying out in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it blinked out, my daughter and I started to get into the car to get her to school.  We were getting into the car and I saw the same type of light shoot up from the horizon, in a straight line, and go to the same exa! ct spot as the previous light and start hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been freaked out by anything, but this incident still haunts me to this day.  Some one could have been shooting off military flares, but flares do not hover or go in a straight line from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also heard no report.  It was above the tree line, but I could not tell distance or altitude due to the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been struggling with myself whether to report this or not.  Hope this helps someone who may have seen something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting in February 2011 is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were never able to find it.  We looked everywhere in every direction. not even 15 minutes had gone by so we decided to go back towards my house to take a picture from there and when we got back there was absolutely nothing there,  The weirdest part about it all is that there was no moon in the sky at all.  ANYWHERE!   We were completely overwhelmed with fear.  There was and long streak in the sky that stretched across the the whole sky in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was almost entirely cloudless, except for the contrails of three jet aircraft passing overhead.  About 70 degrees above the horizon, I spotted a very bright white object that appeared acutely triangular in shape.  I first assumed it was another airliner, but immediately realized it was flying at a much greater velocity than any of the other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed supersonic aircraft in flight.  This object appeared to be going every bit as fast, but there was no sonic boom, and no contrail to indicate an exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It followed a straight line on a south to north track, with a slight west to east angle.  I would guess the arc it traversed was about 15 degrees in length.  I seemed to be gaining altitue, though I cannot be certain of this.  It certainly did not appear to be losing altitude.  It simply faded into the clear, blue sky.  I got the sense that this object was at a higher altitude than the other nearby craft, but I had no means of veryfying that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frequently observe passing satellites.  This object was initially every bit as bright as the ISS on a dark night, but I have never seen the space station (or any other satellite) as brightly visible during the full light of day, as this object was.  Nor have a seen a satellite follow that path, even if it was in a polar orbit. It also seemed to be moving faster than satellites do, when observed from the ground, and I believe it was accelerating, but I cannot be certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have previously seen a large meteor falling toward earth, and briefly thought it was an aircraft on fire, but this object did not resemble that.  It did not have a tail, nor did it flare or disintegrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a United Methodist minister in the community with a lifelong interest in aircraft and spaceflight.  While I have found UFO lore interesting (and I even met J. Allen Hynek, once) I have never seen anything that left me feeling I had witnessed something that defied easy explanation.  But, this observation was unlike any other I have experienced, and it is the only one that I have ever reported.<n>

The objects appeared to be relatively small (5-10 feet) white in color with a V-ish shape. The objects seemed to be playfully flying about with one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 25 seconds 7 of the objects formed a neat triangular formation and flew due east and almost instantly and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object hovered to the left of the triangular formation and with a few seconds one of the objects in the formation flew directly across the sky towards the hovering object in a straight line and both vanished.<n>

To my surprise, at 2 minutes 9 seconds into the recording there are two unidentifiable objects flying quickly and in an unusual path.  One of the objects can be seen for approximately 5 seconds.<n>

When I noticed them, they were travel very fast together, leaving only a small trail behind them.   They were two small to be fighter jets, so I thought maybe meteorites.  But, these objects keep equal distance between them, streaking by togeather very, very, fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to live by a major airport, and I know what speeds planes can go, and what they look like landing and taking off at different angles.  But, I have never seen anything travel that fast.  It took about 3 seconds, and I couldn&#39;t get the words out of my mouth fast enough to tell my husband, because by the time he got to the front window they were out of our sight.<n>

My first impression was that they were helicopters.  But what got my attention was that these objects were not moving at all.  Puzzled, I went outside to get a better view.  These objects were motionless, flashing a red color, then yellow, almost like a flare or welding arc.  They then shot straight up into the air at an incredible speed until I could only see one them. At this point, the one that I could see looked like a tiny star.  The object then began to move north across the sky at a very high rate of speed, creating a haze around it as it traveled across the sky until it could not be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Please excuse me if I go ahead and just tell you about what was seen - even if it has nothing to do with UAP&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The few who were around me at the time, all witnessed a typical plume of a vapor trail which obviously looked identical to the one seen around Nov 10 2010 - off the coast here.  I watched it through the setting sun and thought it was simply a contrail of a jet flying from west to east and coming up over the horizon.  There was one prominent one and two other smallish &#39;launches&#39; at the same time, with that spiral looking plume, contrail or vapour trail behind each.  They were very slow.  But really far off to the west.  It was quite strange to also note these long, far-reaching shadows that all eminated from the set-sun but it was these strange contrail-looking plumes that had cast the shadows across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only want to know if in fact they were launches from somewhere west of us.  I CANNOT find ANYTHING ANYWHERE on the Net about this at this time.  Nothing said on &#34;Coast to Coast&#34;, and can find absolutely nothing about it on the Internet (NASA, NOAA, and indeed on Google) - and it was MORE of a sight to see this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was waiting for my husband because we had both vehicles.  I heard a louder than usual rumble from what I thought were jets, so I stepped out of my garage and looked up at the sky.  We live close to our Intl Airport and within 1-2 miles of our Natl Guard, so jets are common in our part of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up but didn’t see anything at first.  Then I caught a glimpse of something shiny.  While I was focusing on the shiny object, several more became evident.  There were 4 -5 shiny/shimmering spots in a horizontal row.  While I was watching 4-5 more appeared, also in a row, but quite a distance from the first row.  In the shape of a rectangle.  You could see the sky between the rows, but the spots were not well defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise sounded like a regular military jet, but much louder.  It reminded me of the rumble of the battle cruiser in the beginning of Star Wars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my husband pulled up they were almost completely out of sight.  He never did see it, but he could hear it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  The sky was clear<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  There were two rows of something shiny or shimmering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  It sounded like a rumble from the battle cruiser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  I watched it/them for 4-5 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. The direction was from West to East  this is unusual because our jets take off from North or South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose it could have been military jets, but I’ve never seen them fly in a row like that.  The shape of each shiny thing (light or reflection) was not well defined.  They didn’t appear to be planes, no wings, no exhaust, no contrails etc..  Just shiny spots.<n>

When i proceeded on my way home the light seemed to be traveling at a similar rate of speed.  On two separate instances the light went from the passenger side to driver side view instantaneously.  Towards the end of my drive two fighter jets raced toward it and did two separate flybys.  When this occured i decided to stop and take a picture, revealing an egg shaped ball of light. Incredibly i have seen the object two days in a row now.  On day two there was five different jets investigating this object in the sky.  It wasn&#39;t a star, plane, or helicopter.  It changed altitudes and moved horizontally for several miles.<n>

From the position I was in, the Internationtal Niagara Falls Airport was on my right and was already passing the actual gated airfield, but not as far as seeing the entrance to the actual Airport which was a quarter of a mile the least from the time I noticed the UFO.  I was tired and alone on the road also known as Niagara Falls Blvd,  the UFO went unnoticed as I honestly thought it was simply the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That moment I remembered it was winter and snowing an there was no possibility of being able to see the moon with no clouds moving in front of it, because it was almost like the light of a flash light.  I almost lost track driving because of the shock and awe of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to slow down, to about 10 miles an hour extending the ride to the cross section where it intercepts with the entrance to the airport, where I knew I would lose visibility because of the bend in the road.  It did not move, there is a gas station on that same intersection, and it appeared to be high above it, but further out as If it were miles away, just a the sun or moon would appear.  I thought it was a plane but it was stationary and simply hovered.  Just before I lost sight of the UFO it simply disappeared in the blink of an eye, but there was no proof it was moving as I slowed my vehicle down I simply got closer and closer to it, contrary to if it were a moving plane or jet.  The sphere of light appeared to be the size the moon would appear in the night sky, this object was too radiant to be a source of natural light, it was a strong almost glare in the shape of a sphere, I could&#39;nt make out any colors or definite shape for it seemed to be consumed in light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The city (land) was on one side and the Arabian Gulf was on the other. The moon was not full but it was bright and over the land side. It was dark and there were stars. My husband and I were sitting facing each other when he looked up and pointed at something behind me. He exclaimed &#34;What is that?&#34;. I turned to look behind me and in the distance was a bright object higher in the sky than we were and below the moon and coming at us from the land side heading to the Gulf side. My husband said it looked like it &#39;was on fire&#39; but it looked like a blurry bright object to me since I did not have my glasses on. He also mentioned that it looked odd, like a triangle. There were many others also on the terrace at the time and someone exclaimed &#34;oh look, they are going to beam us up!! &#34; So I assumed that others saw it too and were making a joke about it. I had my camera and my husband was yelling at me to take a picture of it. But I thought it would come out very good since it was so far away so I thought I&#39;d wait until it got closer since it was heading our way. There was no flashing lights but it did twinkle, like a star would and it was fairly big in size. He kept yelling at me to take a picture but I kept saying &#34;just wait it is coming closer!&#34;. But just as I said that it stopped dead in the sky, staying in its position for about 15 seconds, then darted away from us in the opposite direction but at the same latitude, it did not shoot up or down, just disappeared in to the darkness extremely fast. And it was gone! My husband was very upset at me for not getting the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I see satellites all of the time but this one moved from NW right above me to South end of the sky and right at the end did a hook to the west and then was gone. It traveled about 70% of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds .  No sound. I stood and thought for a second on what I saw.  I see satellites, too fast. I see meteors, not as fast and lasted way longer.  Not an airplane , way to fast and the pilot would have to pull like 20g’s to make that move at the end.  I told my wife, and guys at work.  I love to watch the stars but , for being outside of Chicago’s lights, we see a lot for a suburb.  But I never saw this.  Just wanted to put it in record .<n>

Just as I pointed it out to my friend and asked, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  It pulsed and shot upward quickly disappearing.  He missed it and told me it was probably a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking to the sky after that trying to figure out what had just happened.

While looking up at the birds, I noticed a small circular shaped object (like a ball or an orb) VERY high in the sky moving in a southward direction.  It seemed to be moving much faster than an airplane and was higher in the sky than I have ever seen an object before.  It seemed to either be lit up on it&#39;s own, but was also reflecting off of the sun (as if it were made of metal or a shiny material).  It was hard to tell if it emitted light itself or not, but it was definitely reflecting the sunlight as it seemed to reflect the sunlight periodically as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to follow it for a couple of minutes until I could no longer see it. I noticed several minutes later an airplane flying in approximately the same location where I last noticed the UFO.  The airplane was flying very high and at a high rate of speed, leaving an entrail ((sic.  Contrail)) behind it.  I know this was not a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if that was related or not, but thought I would mention it.<n>

I woke up and looked out my window and about 7 or 8 lights were in formation hovering horizontally above and around Murphy dome radar tracking station.  Got out the Binoc&#39;s and viewed.  I could see 2 lights on the fronts.  No noise at all.  Looked like stars with hint of pinkish orange.  Lights would fade in and out! Conditions are cloudy and overcast.  They would break formation and fly down in the valley behind Ester and back up to Murphy Dome, then back to the valley floor and then lights went out and disappeared.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  Could be our military but not sure.  So, once again here is my post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this?

I looked harder at the object which in turn looked like a formation of triangles going in the same direction with a hazy, flag like outer shell that seemed to make an appearance of distortion due to heat.  Like a flag in the middle of the ocean, waving in the air. I still felt like it can be interpretated as birds or such until it disappeared behind a small cloud.

After a few seconds, the object veered north and northeast and its light disappeared (apparently making a tight U-turn).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I thought I was witnessing the landing lights of an aircraft coming in for a landing.  However, the lack of lights on the wings and tail was curious.  Seconds later, the object reappeared farther west than where I had last seen it.  And again, a few seconds later, it veered north and northeast and its light was extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared a second time, again further west, but shortly thereafter the object flew behind tall pine trees that obstructed my view.  Throughout the episode I did not hear any sound emanating from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10-15 seconds after I lost sight of the object, I observed a high flying plane in the eastern sky also moving in a westerly direction.  I felt that the aircraft was following the object that I saw, but keeping a safe distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later after entering my house and telling my wife what I saw, a jet approached from the east (possibly from Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo?) and roared overhead, again traveling in a general westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired public school mathematics teacher...and I must admit that this is the first time I have ever witnessed such an unusual event.<n>

There were no other distinguishable lights, stars, craft in that direction.   In this area occasionally a Hercules Transport U.S.A.F. craft will be seen lumbering along headed to Wright-Pat, but this object did not move or change position for an extended period.  It was unusual in configuration and the dots of light seemed to be grouped together in some kind of configuration which made me think it was a single craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of driing with no other vehicles on the road it just seemed to fade out and it was gone.   Visibility was fair with some high overcast.  Writing this to see if anyone else observed this object???<n>

We noticed alot of aircraft flying in the same direction(west).  Moments after, this strange beam of light appeared in almost the exact location of the other crafts.  It just sat there for about fifteen minutes then slowy move toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see alot of aircrafts coming and going form Fort Cambell and this was no ordinary craft. My first reaction was maybe a ufo had crashed, that would explain all of the aircrafts in the area.  I believe that people will see alot of human aircrafts right before seeing a ufo because the military knows about ufo&#39;s.<n>

There was not sound, not flares, not colors, no rotation, no aura or a haze  around the object...  Just the round super shine shape moving in the sky.  Then, it disappear! In a blink of an eye! There was no cloud for it to hide behind or anything else - I cannot emphases enough that the sky was complete clean and without a cloud...  That is actually when I thought &#34;wait ... what was that....&#34;  It was just so fast and then it was gone I did not have time to think anything about it until then....  I looked around to see if I could spy it somewhere else or just in case it would re-appear farther up or down... NOTHING!  It was gone for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the clock in my car.  It was 1:50 pm.  After that I spent much of the afternoon looking up just in case I would see it again...  Later (closer to 3:30pm) I saw an airplane and then around 5pm another airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison  these two aircrafts where leaving a white line in the sky and although,  they were significantly farther up than the first unidentified object, I could recognize the &#34;airplane&#34; shapes....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was still dark.  I live 19 miles due west of New York City, in an area that is still relatively undeveloped.  As I got to the stop sign I noticed that my neighbor’s house (on seven, predominantly wooded acres) was illuminated.  Directly above the house (a one story ranch) was a large triangular craft hovering not more than 30-40’ over his roof.  (He is 90 years old, and I have not heard that he was ever aware of it.)  It was silent and still.   Although I regret not going back for my camera or getting out of the car, my instinct was to get away so I turned right and started up the hill.  But I made a point of looking  at the craft closely.  It,  . It was an isosceles triangle, . The light emanating from it was white and bright,  . It had three large, blindingly bright round lights in each of the corners and rows of smaller, round lights running along all three sides  of the bottom,  . The side had vertical slats running from the roof to the bottom edge (like the old World Trade Center),  . It was only about 10-15’ high,  . It was shining a weak beam of light onto my neighbor’s property (close to the old pond),  My neighbor’s property abuts electric power lines that  I understand shelter a  natural gas pipeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove up the hill and lost sight of the craft above my neighbor’s house I looked to my left.  A a second triangular craft was hovering above a power line tower about a 1/2 a mile in the distance.  This one, however, had no lights on.  I just saw a dark gray triangle juxtaposed above a lighter gray sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have reported this last February, but I only recently became familiar with your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This lasted for about a minute, this was in the area above the yakama indian reservation. I could not tell what elevation it was at because it looks like a star. There was four to five flickers grouped together that lasted just a few seconds, it mite of been caused by the tip of a near by tree.  This would be the second time i have seen this here in the morning, the last time i went outside and watched where it disappeard, towards the low valley.  I dont believe this is the ISS because at that time it was traveling over the pacific ocean due south then turned east at the southern tip of south america.<n>

They were the same size of the small stars above me.  I did not see any flashing or blinking lights on either craft. They were moving at an extremely high rate of speed. (Based on the size and altitude the two craft seemed to be). Looking up..they were moving from West to East.  They started about 3 inches apart (if I was to hold a ruler up to the sky).  They flew straight for a second or two and then started to fly towards each other.  They got to about half an inch away and then flew straight from there.  They took off from that point at double the initial speed I saw at the start...out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two lights were, without a doubt, not shooting stars!  These two craft maneuvered and flew at such a high rate of speed, faster than any I have ever seen before.  It was frankly, shocking to see!<n>

The object was bright and looked like a triangle with one side horizontal to the ground and the pointy end was part way into a circle.  The object was a reddish orange color.  The object was approximately 100 meters above the ground.  The object looked like it was about 1 cm through the side window of my vehicle.  I stopped on the high way just before Kitscoty, rolled down the window and looked at the object.  It was approximately 1 km directly West of Kitscoty.  It was too still to be a helicopter and had no flashing lights.  Then it made 4 to 5 horizontal circle motions (wobbled approximately half of its width) and stopped.  I made several of these motions in a 5 min time frame.  I got back onto the highway then went south on Highway 16 past Kitscoty.  I still saw the object, then it moved south west in a st! raight line keeping a constant altitude.  I estimate that it went approximately 10 km in about 1 minute before it was too far to see.<n>

I saw one glowing amber light brighter and bigger than a star but not bright like an airplane light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed two others off to the left in almost a triangular formation at matching speed. There was no sound. In reference there was an airplane that was further that I could hear clearly.  I thought it may have been one craft, an airplane at a weird angle until the rightmost light started moving slowly closer to the other two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first moving light as it got  closer the other two seemed to start moving in a three way figure eight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all stopped dead and reversed course and sped off at an alarming speed.<n>

It was pretty much cigar shaped, it had a silver color...it reminded me of the color of mercury in a thermometer. It was very shiny. It dissapeared and then became visible almost instantly but it was further down the sky, then was gone.

It appeared very distant maybe 15 miles away and from my location was about the same length as a penny held at arms length. It was moving south at a slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got off on the shoulder to take a photo a very bright shimmer went along the length of the object from the back to the front (which would contradict sunlight reflecting off anything.  It was almost like looking at a welding arc it was that bright, but from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the light reached to front of the object it dissapeared.  The sky provided enough of a background to tell there was no plane in the air or any kind of profile of any thing against the back ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw anything solid against the background and it was a very clear sky just at the edge of the cloud formation where the obect dissappeared  and got the impression it was more like an energy, than a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first noticed the object till it disappeared lasted 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted this as a cigar shape, although it was more like a slit .<n>

I viewed a light I thought was a meteor it went straight toward the the bright light then stopped.  The light I was watching suddenly took off and headed south. by the time I called my guard he was 4 miles away it was gone but when it went over my head I seen it was triangle shaped and had bright white lights on the corners and a big light in the middle  .It was from start to finish when it moved out of sight it might have been 1 minute.  It was the fastest thing I have ever seen. I have seen airplanes coming and going from the same place but they did not even get close to how fast the it moved.<n>

Her report is listed above mine and as you will see , we saw things a little differently. She had told me there was a green light outside and asked what it was. I went outside and saw one large green light and 2 or 3 large red lights flashing and moving together. I didnt see a outline of any object just the lights and I didnt hear any sound. I tried to take a picture and video on my cell phone and I couldnt see anything on it to take , yet if I directed the camera to the moon or the other stars I could see those on my phone. It was a little creepy. The lights seemed to form the shape of a cylinder, moving slowly in a north west direction, after about 15 min  I saw it stop over a hill, looks like near the ocean coast. A red light continued to flash for at least another 30 min and then we went inside. I called the local news and asked them to see if anyone else reported seeing any ! unusual lights in the sky over southern calif tonite. Hoping someone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out my window at 730 pm and saw a shape that looked kind of like a cylinder shape.  It had red and green flashing lights. It kinda looked like a gigantic flashing star.  It was going up and down and then it looked like it was coming towards us  and then I saw a outline of the front of it and it looked like a U shape and it was green.  It then moved to the west and then it stopped on top of a hill and  then  I saw a red flash for at least another 30 min and then went back inside.  The object didnt make a normal plane noise but it seemed like a swooshing noise was coming from it.  My mom and I looked for other planes that may make a noise, but there were only little planes and the sound was very different then that.<n>

After a second of staring I noticed that it started to slowly move eastward.  After a good 3 seconds the objects movement dramatically change.  This white light rapidly did a half figure eight pattern swooping down a good range in the sky.  Now, after the object disappeared from my view, I noticed that there were three helicopters flying in the sky also.  It is unusual to see helicopters in Corpus Christi unless you are on the beach.  We are use to seeing planes here, so the difference can be distinguished easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The time was around 6 pm and is approximate.  The sun had just set and the sky above was still a deep blue and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the sky as I normally do to observe the stars, and just at that moment I saw what I thought was at first a meteorite was glowing red, left a faint trail, and was heading in a southeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light fizzled out, I then was awestruck when the fizzled out light reappeared as a bright white light  much larger than any star, I’d say about three or four times the size of the planet Venus, and was clear and distinct.  For a split second I thought I saw a green light, which would have been the right side of a craft.  As the light turned full circle and coming toward me, it then banked and that is when it revealed three distinct and bright white lights in the form of a &#34;V,&#34; or chevron, with the two lights of the &#34;V&#34; facing forward, and the point light trailing (again each light about three or four time the size of Venus.)   No apparent sound was audible from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made a complete circle and seemed to dive.  It was traveling at a speed I would say was perhaps that of a fighter jet doing casual maneuvers, but was way to agile to be a passenger jet, in my opinion.  The object appeared to be over the ocean and I guestimate, about three thousand feet up.  In holding my hand out afterwards I would say the size of the shape of the three-light configuration was about as big as my pinky fingernail at arms length.  The last maneuver was a diving maneuver on the second circle the craft made and then that was it.  I was wearing glasses I use for driving which corrects my vision to 20-40.  The whole even lasted about one minute, when the object fell below my field of view behind some apartments.  I walked a ways down the street to a better vantage point to see if the object would reappear but it did not.<n>

I observed the object less than two minutes. The object was the size of a large bright night star and glowing white.  The object jumped around in the sky, down and up and continued east.  The object blinked off for a few seconds and then appeared again, continuing to move east.  Then the object started moving west back towards the rainbow and suddenly shot straight up into the sky.<n>

I had remembered that earlier I had seen a rainbow, so I looked around in the clouds to see if it was still visible. It was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, I saw an orb of light moving around.  It seemed about the size of a small or distant plane flying, but it contained itself to a single area and maneuvered too quickly around to be a plane.  The event was occurring just above a line of trees, so I watched to see if it was a kite or something, but then I noticed another circle.  And in another few seconds another and another.  Soon (within 20 seconds of the first sighting) there were 7+ orbs flying around in that area.  None of them were rising from the ground, but gathering together from other parts of the sky.  All of them were flying around each other.  If these were kites, surely the strings would have tangled together and I would have seen them crashing to the ground. They did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been reading different books about UFO&#39;s recently (Communion by Streiber, Redfern&#39;s Final Events, and a few books by L.A. Marzulli) so I&#39;m not surprised that my first interpretation of the event was &#34;UFOs.&#34;  But, because the very name indicates ignorance, I kept watching to see whether these orbs would begin showing behavior typical of some explainable object.  They did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued their dance in the sky and I continued to watch them.  I had no other camera on me but my phone camera, which would not have been able to zoom in close enough to capture an image of these orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 8-9 minutes, I went inside and called for my roommate to &#34;Come, see this!&#34;  I had hoped for another eye-witness to this event.  I went back outside and turned my attention back to the sky, but to my dismay, all but one had disappeared and just as my roommate stepped back onto the porch, that one flew into the cover of the clouds and could no longer be seen.  The rainbow was again visible, however.<n>

I was almost to my front door when I looked up one last time to appreciate the night sky.  My eyes were instantly drawn to movement- the movement of a triangular craft!  It was above my house and flew eastward until trees and homes blocked my view.  It moved quickly and silently across the sky.  Its color was a dark grey, only a few shades away from the color of the sky.  It had three lights, each one close to a point of the triangle.  The lights were not typical white lights, like that of an airplane.  They were dimmer, circular, and wider in circumference than the usual aircraft lights. They did not have a color. It was hard to judge how high it was flying, or how big it was.  It was close enough that I could clearly see that it was a triangle with three lights.  My thoughts while watching it were, &#34;Wow, I&#39;m actually! seeing a UFO!  And it&#39;s a triangle, just like ones I&#39;ve heard about.  And it IS silent.  Wooooow.&#34;  Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked in the door in a state of shock and told my husband and son what I saw.  My son thinks it&#39;s military.  I don&#39;t know.  I suppose they could have some super-stealthy technology that we don&#39;t know about.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was certainly NOT an airplane, a mirage, weather phenomenon, or any of the normal things one sees in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never, ever seen anything like this before.  Not even close!  I am a stay-at-home mom in my 30&#39;s, very honest, Christian, and I am telling you, and anyone who&#39;ll listen, I saw a triangle UFO.  Something strange is out there!<n>
2/6/11 13:30|Center Conway|NH|Other||Military jets over New Hampshire training or fighting something.|2/18/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80105.html|222|ndxe201102| Military Jets over New Hampshire Training or Fighting Something<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday Feb6, sometime shortly before 2 PM, I saw a very strange thing. While working outside, I first heard a jet engine far away, and then it got really loud, like it was accelerating, which made me look up to the southwest of where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very clear open blue sky view of what first looked to me like the Challenger disaster: 2-3 huge white plumes arcing away, bright orange glowing at the tips.  Then, to the north, I saw something else with a steep upward trajectory and a distinct white exhaust trail that had dark spots, like debris falling away.  That made me think I was seeing some sort of rocket, with the spent stages falling away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, back to the southwest, coming out of the white cloud that had been created by the first &#39;explosion&#39;, I saw a fighter jet, and then another.  These were light-colored and shaped roughly like paper airplanes, that is triangular.  I would call them &#39;fighter jets&#39;. They pulled up into a very steep ascent, very close to each other.  I wondered if there had been three and it was a mid-air collision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the two planes veer southward, circling around to the east and then they headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event probably took less than two minutes.  This entry is based on the email I sent to the 104th wing of the Nat&#39;l Guard about 30 minutes after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a hysteric or a crank, but I am deeply curious about what I saw.  It was very dramatic. I had supposed it was a training mission of some sort, but given the non-response from all the contacts I have tried to make, I&#39;m open to it having been something less benign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say for sure what the distance was.  It could have been 20 or 50 miles as the crow flies, which would put them somewhere over Ossipee, NH.  The planes were small to my eye, but clearly visible.  They were probably at 15,000-20,000 feet above me when they circled overhead after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not much &#39;into&#39; aviation, although I do travel by plane a fair bit.  Mostly, I&#39;d just like to know what the heck I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an afterthought, I will add that later on, perhaps an hour or so on, a very large white jetliner went over our property.  It was extremely thin in the body and the wings and very long. It flew low compared to most of the commercial jets we see.  I was obviously hyper alert to things in the sky, but I did not recognize it as a standard 737 and it was virtually silent.  This surprised me, given that it really wasn&#39;t that high in the sky (I&#39;m guessing &lt; 7500&#39;) I wondered if it might be associated with the event and doing some sort of reconnaissance. Thanks, Tracy<n>

Felt good getting this off my chest in detail my arm hairs are stilll standing up and its been almost a hour and a half. theres other details that i remember looking back at it like a plane in the background when i was driving on freeway but it was way up in the air that i thought for a split second that those were s! trange bright red yellow orangs stars i never seen i think i s! aid that already . im going to go talk to those guys about wht they saw them do and i hope its on the news and i wanted to call the police but then say what.i do believe in aliens but to watch it in person i kinda think i really didnt want to see that.everthing looks a lot different now that i saw this day to day worries are going to feel alort smaller and easy to deal with.It dont matter what i used to think was possible because in a way its all possible a new look on life WOW<n>

I knew it wouldnt be a helicopted or airplane. My cousin and I completely astonished.  Just following it down the highway about 300 yds in front of us. We followed it for about 30 seconds and it just shot up.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  It left so quickly and the direction it shot was like nothng ive seen before.  I have no explanation to what it could have been.  But I do know one thing, I used to think of unidentified objects as just a way of people getting attention.  But after that encounter I do not know what to believe..<n>

After picking up some dinner I was returning home with my girlfriend to my home when coming up the hill I noticed 4 distinct red lights in a unique formation not too far above the top of the mountain.  They looked like a red/orange light.  It caught my attention because I am in to astronomy and look at the night sky very often and having lived in that same home for over 17 years I have never seen any lights like this before.  As I pointed out the lights to my girlfriend I called my brother who was waiting for me at the house.  I told him to go outside and look at the lights.  As we are pulling into my drive way I noticed that the lights had dimmed and could only see one.  My brother was in the drive way when I parked in the garage and started yelling at me to get back out here.  I got back out and 1 bright red light had just become visible and it was rising ! in altitude!  As it was rising very slowly it reached a certain point in the sky and stopped and then starting to fade away in distance!   My brothers friend also witnessed this whole thing and having all of us lived in this area for at last 15 years and never have seen anything like this before!  this was truly an amazing sight to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Night sky was partly cloudy, temps in the 40&#39;s, dry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness #2 was driving, when witness #1 spotted the 2 higher objects first at 30 degrees off the horizon, then she noticed the second pair of objects lower in the sky at 15 degrees and to left of the higher objects and then witness pointed out to her friend.  She said, &#34;What are those lights?   Both women were driving north east bound on Hwy 18, a few miles south of McMinnville, Or.  The objects were toward the NE, south of McMinnville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they made their right turn onto Bellvue-Hopewell Hwy 153 towards witness #2&#39;s home.  They drove about 200 feet and stopped the car to take a look at the objects.  Driver was so interested in what these objects were, that is why she pulled the vehicle over.  Both women stayed in the car and watched the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had photo cell phones, but objects were so far away, a photo would not have showed up.  Objects estimated to be south of McMinnville, over farm land.  Maybe a few miles from witnesses or closer. This area is mostly rural and farms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the 2 higher objects, one moved towards the other, closing the gap between them, they stayed like that for a few seconds.  One disappeared from the higher group.  Then the 2 lower objects disappeared.   Witness described that the 2 lower ones did not seem to move, as she was focused on the higher objects.  Then the last object disappeared, witness did not know if maybe it may have been covered by the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.  Color was a dark amber to orange in color.  Steady light, round, noticed no other lights flashing on object.  No aircraft in area, as McMinnville has an airport and Evergreen Helicopters is located there.

2/5/11 20:00|Huntington Beach|CA|Fireball|2-3 minutes|Orange orbs (Fireballs, Plasma Balls) seen on a continuing basis for three years over Huntington Beach, California.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106197.html|232|ndxe201102| Orange Orbs (Fireballs, Plasma Balls) seen on a continuing basis for three years over Huntington Beach, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.F.O.s over Huntington Beach   There has been an ongoing phenomenon in Huntington Beach, California, that has been happening for the past three years, and continues to this day.  Unexplained sightings of objects in the night sky, that have been witnessed by members of my family as well as friends and neighbors.  Let me say that in my almost 50 years, I have never seen these objects before in my life and neither has anyone else who witnessed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first such occurrence happened on the night of February 5, 2011, at around 9 p.m., I was alone and out walking our dog when I looked up and saw a bright orange object heading north from the ocean to about the center of the city.  From my vantage point, the object looked to be about 20 feet in diameter and was at an altitude of only 1000-1500 feet.  It was completely round and transparent like an orb and as if it were made of gas but also had an electrical component as the inside of it appeared to have a charge of some sort like lightning bolts within it.  The orange plasma ball moved very slowly at perhaps 20 m.p.h. across the sky for about two minutes total and then made a 90 degree angle and headed straight up slowly to a very high altitude until it could no longer be seen.  All the while it made no noise whatsoever.  I found this very curious as I have never seen anything such as this before. It wasn’t a plane, balloon, drone or natural object and seemed to move  as if by! intelligent design.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings have occurred at least 12 times in the past three years of which I have personally witnessed 8 of them.  My family and friends told me about the others.  The latest event witnessed was on January 5, 2014.  The glowing balls show up every 2-4 months or so and perhaps more often if they are not seen by someone each time.  These orange balls of light have always appeared solely as one and not a cluster as some have witnessed in other areas.  They are always orange in color, appear in the evenings between 8p.m. and 11 p.m. and can travel from different directions (east to west, north to south, ect..), make turns and even hover over a spot.  My wife says she saw one stop and hover right above her for a minute as if it were watching her and then slowly went onward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not normally make a report on every small thing that I may see but the number and frequency of these objects compels me to report these sightings as they have become almost commonplace in our area and I hope it helps to find an explanation as to what these objects in our night sky are.<n>
2/5/11 18:50|Raleigh|NC|Triangle|10 Minutes|V-Shaped Craft Hovering Above the Intersection of Six Forks Road and I-540 in Raleigh NC|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79957.html|233|ndxe201102| V-Shaped Craft Hovering Above the Intersection of Six Forks Road and I-540 in Raleigh NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I pulled out of our driveway last night around a quarter till 7PM, I noticed a very bright light a little ways off.  At first I thought it might be a passenger jet&#39;s landing lights (as seen from head-on) since we live only a few miles from RDU, but after watching it for about 30 seconds, we realized it could not be a plane because it wasn&#39;t moving.  A car was coming up behind me on the street, so we continued on our way to our destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It takes about 5 minutes to get out of our neighborhood and onto I-540 (the outer loop around Raleigh).  As we were pulling onto 540, we again saw the light(s) ahead of us.  As we got closer, we could start making out the details better.  There were red lights on either side of the &#39;craft&#39;, and white lights in the middle.  540 is a very busy road on Saturday evenings, and as we were getting really close to this object, all of the cars in front of us were slowing down to look at it as well.  It was hovering just above the trees at the intersection of Six Forks Road and 540.  It looked like a &#34;V&#34; with large white lights in the center and down both &#34;wings&#34; with the red lights on the tips of the wings.  It looked to be about the size of a passenger jet, but again it was not moving.  I wanted to get out and take photos with my phone, but we were running late for our event and my wife didn&#39;t want me to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I&#39;m just hoping that maybe someone else took the time to report this as well as I know many, many people saw this.  Maybe someone can check with air traffic at RDU as it must have been on their radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane, nor was it a helicopter (much too big).  It&#39;s worth noting that it was not there when we returned home 4 hours later.<n>

The object was oval in shape moving slightly up and down,moving east to west. The oval shaped object was visible for a few seconds with several tails coming off it. The color was a bland grey color not bright or luminous.  The background was a few hours after sunset clear sky no clouds.  One object was observed,two nights in a row.  The object was seen moving up and down as if being buffeted while entering an atmosphere.I was looking North at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/5/11 17:45|Holts Summit|MO|Disk|3 minutes|3rd Sighting of same craft.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105891.html|235|ndxe201102| 3rd Sighting of same craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2011 February 5 Sighting  By 2-5-11, at 5:45pm, I was beginning to think I might not see the craft from 11-25-10, 01-04-11, and 01-14-11 again but, I was sitting there on a nice day with my inside door open, half watching the nice clear blue sky for hours, that afternoon into early evening, through the storm door window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was when I saw what I thought was a jet coming from the northwest (I&#39;d seen many that afternoon), illuminated by the setting sun, going toward the southeast at a great height, If I had to guess,15,000 feet.  I watched for some time as it grew closer, and larger, but, still at a great height, heading southwest...  I don&#39;t know why I was watching that jet, that particular day, or why I noticed and followed that jet but, I recall that I was thinking; &#34;you know, that could be one of the UFO&#39;s, and I would never know it, it is, so high up&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that exact moment, like they read my thoughts, this,, what I thought was, a jet - a tiny vehicle way up high- with its contrail (shorter than usual for a passenger jet).  Suddenly, this &#34;jet&#34;, made a 90 degree turn directly up (it did not stop and turn, it did not curve upward, it just made a 90 degree turn in continued motion directly up or out, and away from earth) stopped emitting the contrail, as it went up, it began glowing as a bright orange fireball and as I watched flared blindingly bright two or three times the size of the vehicle itself.  After flaring up so bright, perhaps 5 seconds then, the orange quickly started to fade, and as the orange light faded, I could make out a disk shaped craft then, this craft just faded away, and there was nothing but the brief horizontal contrail remaining where it had been traveling before it turned upward and disappeared.  It did not go out of range, it was clearly visible but, just became less solid and the blu! e sky behind it became visible through it, more and more until it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this event against a blue sky with the setting sun clearly lighting up the vehicle, it was unmistakable, this craft left our dimension and faded out.  After all the sightings, I believe it to be the exact same craft I had seen before in January 2011, and I know this sounds strange but, it was like they, whomever they, are, wanted me, to see this event.  As if to say, &#34;we came to visit you, you saw us, and now its time to say, goodbye&#34;.  I did not know if I would ever, see it again, after that, but, gratefully, I have had repeated sightings since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I knew immediately it was something I’ve never seen before.  I jumped up, mouth open, eyes wide,  fully understanding this was my 1st UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live just south of the San Gabriel Mountains and just west of San Jacinto Peak.  From my location it appeared to be coming from Los Angeles area heading east bound  towards Palm Springs, Salton Sea area at appx. 4000 ft.   What I find interesting and validates my own sighting is the posted sighting in Indio which occurred the same day (02/05/11) with a reported time at 17:35:00. BTW Indio CA is 90 miles east, bearing 103 of my location. Coincidence?   I’m ex military/FAA air controller.<n>

It was still daylight out and there were some clouds but otherwise a beautiful early evening approx. around 530 pm.  I had a video camera in the vehicle right next to me so I grabbed it and started to film the bright light that was just sitting in the sky..to me it didn&#39;t seem to move at all, but my daughter thought it might of been moving upwards a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I video taped the object and after handing over the camera to my daughter because the intersection light turned green she filmed it a bit longer and then the camera ran out of space.  A bit after the camera ran out of space the bright white circle light suddenly disapeared.  It was nothing ordinary in our eyes..it was not a plane or anything of the like.  It was a ufo.<n>

Me and my cousin metal detect for old coins and civil war relics and such, we went detecting saturday morning like we have for years, we had a really good spot picked out where a old house had been torn down in Gallatin near my home in Hendersonville TN.  We were there for about half an hour digging your typical nails and trash no coins yet, then I got a signal on my detector sounded good so I dug out a plug nothing in the hole so I new it was bigger than a coin and deeper, I dug down about 12 inches or so and seen the target it was silver in color so I called for my cousin to come over and look cause I just new I dug somthing made of silver. I took the taget out of the hole it looked alot like a pool ball but more egg shaped it was very light not soiid feeling more hollow. It! had a clear area around the center looked like glass flush with the rest of the object. I had it in my hand rubbing the dirt off when my cousin noticed that the glass area had some color to it that looked like it was moving like liquid and changing from green to red, I rubbed the area with my fingers to get a better look and thats when this thing shot out of my hand and just sat there in the air about 5 feet away from us, we were both screaming like girls for a second but then just kinda like a reaction I swung my shovel at this thing like a baseball bat and it moved out of the way, by this time my cousin had already took off toward the car so I followed him leaving our detectors just laying there. I yelled at him saying I will get them, I ran toward the detectors and thats when this thing just took off straight up in the air so fast and high we could not even see it anymore, needless to say we thought about calling the cops but we thought they would not believe us and thi! nk we were crazy or something, anyway I have a son in high sch! ool and he does not need everyone in town thinking his dads a nut. So we thought we would report this here and see if this has happened to anyone else or you may have info on what this could be UFO or what ever, I dont know it was so small like I said about the size of a pool ball, could that be a UFO?   We are also worried we may have been exposed to somthing that will effect our health.  Any info from who ever would be helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

There are three lights. One red, one orange and one blue.  They moved strangly, up and down, sideways and swinging back and forth at times.  They are zipping accross the sky, sometimes disappearing and then they come back. Now, there are four! I don&#39;t know what to make of it.  They don&#39;t behave like aircraft and they move so quickly that I can&#39;t imagine that they are satalites.  Just odd, so I thought I&#39;d report it.  It was first noticed by my 14 year old daughter, and she called me to look.  I saw it too, as did my 17 year old daughter.  I really don&#39;t want to end up on the news, so I&#39;m not comfortable leaving my name or contact info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our home is on the right side of the street from the intersection of Gold Star Hwy. and Great Brook Road, and we were looking at the sky from our front windows - towards the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

2/4/11 22:00|Porter (NE outside Houston)|TX|Triangle|2 minutes|Large object passes overhead in night sky, totally silent, white lights and a single blinking green light|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79969.html|244|ndxe201102| Large object passes overhead in night sky, totally silent, white lights and a single blinking green light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walked out of friend’s house, and looked up at night sky to see if we still had cloud cover, it having been extremely cold recently in Houston.  The night was perfectly still and quiet, and the sky was perfectly clear, cold and my friend immediately spotted the object overhead.  My friend is a career retired Delta Airlines employee, worked the ticket counter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our location is in the country and about 12 miles from the Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), so we see flights come and go.  The object was also observed by my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling slowly from west to east, it was black against a black sky so no outline could be made out.  It did have white lights and a single blinking green light, which is what we saw move through the night sky.  It made no sound whatsoever, it was totally silent.  My friend said it did zigzag slightly, but I did not notice that.  We observed the object for about 1 minute before it disappeared behind the tree line.  Shortly thereafter we saw a commercial jet that had taken off from IAH airport, it was flying much higher and faster than the object and of course, loud jet engine noise.  So the object was probably at about 7,000’ to 10,000’ altitude if I had to make a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he corrects the date to February 04, 2011.

It had a slight counter-clockwise arc to it as it moved through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one object.  It had no tail, aura, or sparks.  It seemed to be at an altitude of ~15,000 feet and appeared to be moving extremely fast.  I estimate the speed at 8000 mph if I compare it to a commercial airliner.  Unfortunately, it was a very clear and cold night (21 degrees F) but dark; I was only able to judge its movement relative to my car windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object over distant trees -- just 2 or 3 seconds after it first came into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen a lot of &#34;shooting stars&#34; in my lifetime but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.

Four circular lights that were bright as stars literally zoomed out of no were into the area of this constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed shooting stars at first but as I watched the lights seemed to rotate to the right, as they did this the fourth light became more like a full circle and less of an ellipse like when it first appeared in the sky.  These lights were not flashing, there was no sound, they were as big as a star in the sky and they moved from the right side of Orion’s belt to the left in literally two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I derived the idea that this is chevron shaped since one of the lights became more visible, and since it did a quick bank turn following the first rotation it made.  It flew past several other stars in the area incredibly fast before taking off upward and disappearing as fast as it zoomed into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted no more than 20 seconds and a marvelous and mysterious short time that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing an airplane in the night sky last night, I compared the speed to what I saw last Friday and can honestly say that the airplane’s speed was nothing compared to the mysterious lights.<n>

Noticed lights over southern horizon at about 7:12 PM.  The lights seemed to break apart and merge again several times, with the number of lights visible at any one time ranging from 2 to 6.  All appeared to be the same size and all glowed a bright orange-yellow light, noticeably brighter than any of the city lights.  Distance was hard to judge, but was definitely past the horizon several miles away.  They moved very slowly, some of them merging together.  At various points, new lights appeared higher in the sky than the others, this is what convinced me that they were not coming from the ground. Lights would go out before going below the horizon.  At approximately 7:48 PM, the number of lights dwindled down to two, and then the two merged into one.  The final light remained stationary in the sky for one to two minutes before going out.  No further lights have been seen.  Additionally, at ! one point, a light noticeably coming from an aircraft was seen crossing east to west above the lights about ten to fifteen minutes after I first saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This is an area of the road which is not well lit and has a lot of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just at sunset.  There was a slight bit of sunlight left behind the craft, as this was west.  At this point, I could not see the object very well because the angle from being in the driver’s seat, could not see what shape it had and could only the edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I doubted I was seeing anything due to the lack of lighting visible on or under it and the low sunlight.  It appeared very dark, and I did not notice any sunlight reflecting off the body of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to stay even with my car, I realized there truly was something there and marveled that a plane would fly so low without lights.  I couldn’t be sure how high it was, but could tell it seemed fairly close to the tree tops.  I assumed it was a plane, as an airport is close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved closer to the intersection, the craft veered off to the right away from the road at a 45 degree angle.  I remember thinking how odd that a plane could turn so fast and assumed that whatever it was had left and I wouldn’t see it again.  This whole event lasted maybe a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I turned onto Hwy 82, I realized I could see the object flying along the highway.  Interested, I sped up and moved closer to it.  I stayed a little behind it so as to try and get a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I noticed that instead of defined wings, it was a solid triangular shape, simular to a stealth fighter plane.  But unlike the stealth, this craft was longer and less acute of an angle.  The edges and corners were rounded, not pointed.  I couldn&#39;t see a bump for a pilot&#39;s seat. it had a slight increase in depth from front to back.  There were no jet engines that I could see or hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I had rolled down the window to listen.  The only lights I could see were two blue round lights, or something like lights, located on the bottom.  At this point I realized that it was odd to be able to pace something flying.  I don’t know a lot about planes, but I would think they need to fly faster than the 60 mph.  I was driving to keep up with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes! the craft did a sharp 90 degree turn in front of my car and flew off into the direction of the airport.  I was never able to hear any sound coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand that this could be an airplane of some type that I do not know of.   I would love to find out if there is a plane such as this.  I did try to grab my phone and take a picture but of course it wasn’t charged up.  This is pretty common for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was listening to music and it was very cold outside, there was no one around although this is in a populated subdivision.  I spotted very clearly across the street on the wires connecting electrical poles a small spherical object rapidly circling the wires; like in tetherball when the ball wraps around the pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object circled the wires for a few seconds as I stood watching trying to figure what it was, then all of a sudden it shot off almost instantaneously literally right past my head maybe a metre or two. I stood stunned on the sidewalk, before I could think it shot past again a little farther in front of me. I immediately called my good friend and shunned it off.  The ball was the size of a grapefruit or softball, it had a light brown orange tinge to it, I dont know why its behaviour attracted it to the electrical wires or why it shot off while I was watching it circle the electrical ! wires.  The object could have left a trail or haze but it could also be just from the speed.<n>
2/2/11 21:30|Seattle|WA|Fireball|2 minutes|Three orange lights over northeast Seattle|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79919.html|262|ndxe201102| Three orange lights over northeast Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaving a residence in northeast Seattle in the Wedgewood area, not far from Lake Washington at about 9:30 pm on February 2, 2011.   My son saw the lights first and pointed them out to my daughter and me.  He was facing north and we were looking at about a 45 degree angle up into the sky.  It was partly cloudy and we were looking at a break in the clouds.  There were three bright orange or amber lights in an obtuse triangular shape.  None of the sides of the triangle were even.   The objects didn’t seem to be going anywhere but there was some movement as if they were hovering.  There was no sound.  They disappeared one by one.  We weren’t certain if they went behind the clouds or went out altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe these lights as fireballs that appeared larger and brighter than stars and planets and they gave the appearance of being relatively close, as if they were within the atmosphere.   I’ve never seen anything like them before.<n>

I happen to look up at the moon and notice three orange lights flying low like helicopters heading west towards downtown Seattle.  I did not think too much of them because of the air traffic we have in my neighborhood and the fact that we see helicopters in the air at that altitude all the time.  My first thought was that those helicopters lights are really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flew over my head they started “orbing” (best way to describe it)this vibrant Orange which startled me. Immediately I ran to grab my camera.  By the time I got back outside to capture the phenomenon they were already in the distance passing over downtown Seattle in a pyramid formation.   As I filmed them there were two other witnesses trying to get my attention on a fourth one, but, unfortunately I had headphones on and did not hear him until the last moment when it disappeared.  That is when the other three started doing the same thing only they kept reappearing.  It looked as if they were jumping in and out of dimensions, in the same location at first but then in different locations.  They commenced to return to the same area they had just disappeared from.  When they reappear they clearly displayed some sort of controlled Aerial Synchronicity.  There were three other people walking up the hill oblivious to what was going on above them.  It wasn’t until I pointed it out that they noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airport is just down the way...I’ve been living here in this neighborhood long enough to know the air traffic where I live and I am conscious enough to know what is ours and what is  not.  To my knowledge, none of our air craft&#39;s disappear then reappears in different areas of the sky nor do they jump in and out of the atmosphere as if they have the ability to open star gates into inner space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, I have the phenomenon on tape, if only I had my camera the whole time I would have capture them at a lower altitude doing their “orbing” thing…bottom line, man made air craft, do not jump in and out of the atmosphere and relocate in a different area in the sky in an instant.<n>

Then it reversed direction and went back the other way, traveling a little more quickly.  From my vantage point it seemed to reverse direction above the West end of Mercer Island.  It continued west over Seattle, sometimes getting even brighter, and then some trees obscured my view, and that was it. It was visible to me for about 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light, it seemed to sometimes have flashes of red and blue. As it was on it&#39;s path West toward Seattle, a plane inbound to SeaTac seemed to get quite close to it. The light was at a higher altitude than the inbound planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second time I saw this. The first time was last week, I think, around the same time in the evening. I found your site that night but I thought maybe I was mistaken, but the way it reversed direction stuck with me. So when I saw it again tonight, I called my mom upstairs to confirm I wasn&#39;t crazy, and we both witnessed it reversing direction. It could be a helicopter, but it didn&#39;t seem to turn, just reverse right in it&#39;s tracks.<n>
2/2/11 20:00|Charlotte Hall|MD|Light|10-20 Minutes|Two sighting, including a single floating orb, and the other including three orbs in a triangular formation.|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80508.html|265|ndxe201102| Two sighting, including a single floating orb, and the other including three orbs in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and two other friends were leaving my house to go to a convenience store at 8 PM.  It was completely dark outside, and we noticed a object in the sky. It appeared to be a bright orb slowly floating about in the sky. It was above the Golden Beach area in Charlotte Hall.  Its light puslasted slowly at different intensities, and clearly was not a star. A later observation concluded that the object was below cloud level.  It moved to many different positions in the night sky in the duration of the sighting. It observed no typical aerial movement attributed to planes or helicopters, and it did not have any wing lights, or any light attributed to any normal aircraft.  It was in the sky for hours - Long enough to have one of my buddies with a high quality camera to come over and photograph and videotape it AFTER we came back from the convenience store. Meanwhile, about 5-10 minutes into our drive towards the Wawa in Charlotte Hall,  (This was after the initial orb si! ghting) we observed three of the same orbs in a triangular formation about halfway up the size of a cell phone tower like this one (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Nyakrom_OneTouch_Cell_Phone_Tower_Vodaphone.jpg) in the sky.  These objects then exhibited the odd behavior of producing smaller lights. These were very hard to see while not focusing on them.  They moved very fast, revolving around the larger, bright orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, the large objects dissapeared one after another. (Another friend in another place in the county was observing the same object and reported them to dissapear at the same time I saw my glowboys dissapear.) At least 5 people witnessed this event from different locations. When we returned to my house, we proceeded in photographing the inital object we saw. (It was still there, just in a slightly different position in the night sky.) I did not lose sight of the object, and ended up just going to bed a few hours later. It would be import! ant to note that during these sightings, airplanes and helicop! ters wer e observed flying in close proximity of the ufos. I can provide names and contact information of the other witnesses, as they would be glad to validate this claim.<n>
2/2/11 18:20|Janesville|WI|Flash|at least 15 min|On our deck on the outskirts of Janesville, we observed one flashing object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD))|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79908.html|266|ndxe201102| On our deck on the outskirts of Janesville, we observed one flashing object.  It looked sort of like a flashing star.  It looked to flash from blue to red to green and white.  It wasn’t very big and seemed to go on like that longer than 15 minutes. It was too still to be an airplane or weather balloon we think.<n>

I have pictures that will blow your mind.<n>
2/2/11 00:15|Redding|CA|Changing|3 hours|Multiple red, white, and blue strobing lights in sky|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79902.html|268|ndxe201102| Multiple red, white, and blue strobing lights in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were up to 6 of them. It started out with just 2, but more came throughout a 3 hour time span. They were star-like in shape that constantly fluttered red white and blue, like strobe light.  They moved around the entire sky, but not in any specific pattern.  Mostly, it was more of a gradual move, but a couple times one would bolt an inch across the sky.  Sometimes they would become really faint to where you could barely see it, other times they would get so huge and bright, and randomly one would disappear for a bit then reappear a couple inches from where it was.  They began to change form: One time it looked like a floating mass inside a lava lamp, another time it appeared in a saucer-like shape. I noticed one of them had a bright glowing orange center and one of them had white/yellow orbs revolving around a fluttering rainbow center. About 2 hours into it, 4-6 of them lined up horizontally. There was no mistake, it was a straight horizontal line. About 3! hours after it started, they ALL just disappeared.<n>
2/1/11 20:00|Greenbank|WA|Light|5 minutes|bright white light moving horizontally and vertically over Puget Sound|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79907.html|269|ndxe201102| bright white light moving horizontally and vertically over Puget Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, February 1, 2011, I was standing outside my Greenbank, WA, home and looking out over puget sound.   What at first appeared to be just a motionless star began moving vertically and horizontally in a very rapid motion.  Quite erratic - there was no discernible method to its movements.  It was around 8pm and I watched it for about five minutes.  The bright light eventually came to a stop for a minute, once again resembling a star, so I returned inside.<n>

We come o|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79904.html|270|ndxe201102| My friend and girlfriend were with me at my house, just spending time.  We decided to go out and smoke a cigarette, so we did.  We come outside and look to the sky like always, just waiting to finally see something, since there has been rumors all around town of strange activity in the skies, just a lot of activity rather than strange.  While we are gazing, we notice something quite peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we first saw was what we thought was merely a formation of 3 commercial planes, but there was something strange about it.  They were completely horizontal and on the same plain. Also they were the exact same distance from eachother.  They looked liked 3 separate blinking red lights in the sky, off in the distance.  Then we all started to realize that it looked as if it was one huge craft, rather than 3 independent ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it was relatively low to the ground and not going up or down, just staying level and moving forward.  A few strange details are that the nearby airplanes that use the Portland international airport did not have any changes in their flight patterns.  They didn&#39;t wait for it to leave or wait for possible clearance to land, which is strange because it was so close to the airport.  But it makes me think that it could have been under the radar. So only civilians saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a last note, we are not the only witnesses in town to see this event.  We got onto a local reporters Facebook website and noticed that someone reported the exact same event as us.  There are many new reports coming out of Portland, Oregon.  So please watch the area:-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS : we had strange things happen to our satellite signal later that night.<n>
2/1/11 19:00|Tucson|AZ|Other|15 -25 seconds|Chinook helicopters escort strange object over Tucson AZ|2/18/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80066.html|271|ndxe201102| Chinook helicopters escort strange object over Tucson AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside in the backyard and noticed 2 chinook helicopters coming from east to west in a diagonal position.  I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it because the nearby air force base&#39;s flight path is right over my house;  What did catch my eye is a object,white or bash with either a ensignia or a dark window on the side middle of the craft.  It was in front of the 2 chinooks going west too but what was odd is the shape(square),  it made no sound,and it skipped through the air.  I mean it did a stop,go,stop,go,stop,go in the air but did it really fast but slow enough for me to see it was stopping and going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well the object and the 2 chinooks went west tillthe 2 chinnoks went right to go to ryan air field and the object proceeded to go west.I forget to mention that the square object omitted no light whatsoever in or around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/1/11 17:30|Bay Point Park (Radio Marti)|FL|Other|10 minutes|Stationary, odd shaped (almost plane like) object in sky - did not move at all - 15 miles east of Key West, FL along Rt. 1.|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79900.html|273|ndxe201102| Stationary, odd shaped (almost plane like) object in sky - did not move at all - 15 miles east of Key West, FL along Rt. 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling up Rt. 1 from Key West back to Miami.  Around Radio Marti, Bay Point Park near mile marker 15, we saw a white object that was stationary and it did not move.  It was up about 2,000 feet  in the air.  It could have not been a blimp because there was absolutely no movement.  It appeared to receive reflection from the setting sun.  It was a cream white object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a short cigar shape and in the front it went up in a circular fashion.  It looked like it had one wing on one side but not on the other.  It may have had a back tail fin.  There was something black below the back tail, square shape.  If it were a weather balloon or blimp, it simply did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two weirdest things that we noticed was the very odd shape, no sound, and no movement but up in the air about 2,000 feet.  My camera shot made it look like a white dot with no form.  It looked like another truck pulled over before us to look at it; the rest of the traffic was oblivious to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had taken these pictures with my Blackberry Pearl and I did not thing they turned out so I did not bother checking.  Well they did!!!  I noticed them on my slide show screensaver...I am uploading what I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have regular and also I zoomed them with Paint shop pro.  That is all I have done...I may have messed with the color on one but I do not think I saved it.  Please notice in one of the zoomed shots with two distinct orbs...then I noticed that there is more going on in the shot.  A mother ship maybe or just my crappy camera.  I would love to hear what you all think... I have been obsessed with the study of UFOs for at least 30 years and I think I have finally got some great shots.  Enjoy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
