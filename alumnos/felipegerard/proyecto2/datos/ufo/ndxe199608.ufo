8/30/96 19:00|Blacksburg|VA|Sphere|1 1/2 Minutes|Two witnesses, no more than 40 feet from bright white sphere 3 1/2 - 4 feet in diameter blocking our way on rd.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92870.html|1|ndxe199608| Two witnesses, no more than 40 feet from bright white sphere 3 1/2 - 4 feet in diameter blocking our way on rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend J* and I, both around 20 years old, were having coffee in Blacksburg around early evening (4-6 pm). We were quite bored and not quite sure what to do with our evening. (We had consumed NO alcohol and NO drugs. Just coffee/tea.) J* suggested visiting an abandoned house on a Mountain just outside of Blacksburg called Brush Mountain (Turn left onto country road off of Rt 460 on the way towards West Virginia, the house is now gone). The house was used infrequently by high school kids and college students for late night parties. It was old (1930s to 1940s) and apparently  neat to visit since it had a great view of Blacksburg and was kind of a creepy old house. I conceded to the idea and we left, with no idea what we were in for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at the house with some difficulty since the country road, not much wider than one car width, was washed out in spots and very bumpy. There were ditches on both sides of the road making it impossible to turn around while on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After smoking a few cigarettes(tobacco, not pot. I am very serious here.)and inspecting the house, we realized that it was getting dark and we had no flashlights. We decided to leave. We got in the car and made our way back down the same country road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must confess that I have a hard time remembering &amp;quot;coming up on&amp;quot; the object. I think it was such a shock first seeing it that I can&#39;t remember how we came upon it. I THINK that we came over a hump in the road and all of a sudden there it was in the middle of the road approximately 35-40 feet away. The way the road was, you couldn&#39;t see all the way down it, it would curve up and then down occasionally, until it finally took you back to Rt 460. I am actually a little bothered by not remembering the minutes just before seeing it, but I don&#39;t think this is a case of missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J* slowed the car to a crawl and finally stopped approximately 30-35 feet from the object. It may have been closer than that. I am trying to be as conservative as possible in regards to distance. It was absolutely no more than 40 feet away from us at any time during the encounter-I have personally walked the distance and I am positive of this fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a glowing ball of light, a perfect sphere approximately 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter. It was hovering, without &amp;quot;bobbing&amp;quot; or moving at all, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 feet off of the ground, perfectly still, in the middle of the road. Not to the left, not to the right-but dead center in the middle. It made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J* and I were so shocked, we locked the doors to the car and made sure the windows were tightly closed (rolled up). Of course this sounds ridiculous, but it seemed the right thing to do at the time. After exclaiming to each other with numerous expletives, etc. I seem to remember J* driving a little closer. I&#39;m not sure how much closer, but it wasn&#39;t much. There was no way, as I indicated earlier, of turning around on the road. We stared at the object for approximately 1 minute. I have timed this by running over the events in real time (initial shock/locking doors/taking briefly/then staring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to J* after this minute and said &amp;quot;Turn your brights on it&amp;quot;. J* turned on his brights and left them on. Immediately the sphere rose up apporximately 2-3 feet more, paused, and then TOOK OFF down the road at a speed that to this day I find hard to explain or even describe. Fast. Very, very fast. You could see the illusion of a tail or the object elongated for a 1/2 second as it took off. Again, with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J* tried to talk, but we were both in shock. I said something, also laced with expletives, to the effect of &amp;quot;Get me off this ******* Mountain and then we can talk about it!&amp;quot;  We had to, of course, go down the road to get back to 460. And this was also were the sphere had gone. It did not take off going up but down the very road we needed to traverse. I remember our eyes were peeled on that road until we got back down to the highway. We got back into town, banged on a friends apartment until they let us in and proceeded to FREAK OUT for hours over the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years I have described this object as a ghost and the encounter as a ghost story. There is a good reason for this. The object, which we both saw in the GREATEST DETAIL, was rather &amp;quot;ghostly&amp;quot;. This is very important and I want investigators (Govt. or otherwise) to take note of this. Whipping around the sphere was a wispy, plasma like substance, almost exactly the type of thing we associate with ghosts. None of this substance extended more than a half foot away from the sphere and was constantly in motion around it. The object was very bright, but did not seem to light the area around it very much. I would say that the sphere itself was luminous &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;colorless&amp;quot; kind of white, and the substance around it was only slightly darker. And by darker I mean it was white too, but more off white. Beneath this plasma that was constantly whipping around, the object was a PERFECT SPHERE. Not oval, but mathematically spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what I saw, but I saw it at very close range. I am to understand that this qualifies as a close encounter of the first kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date I entered is an approximation, but I have been able to deduce that the encounter absolutely occurred in late Summer of 1996. My friend whose apartment we visited right after the encounter only lived in that apartment during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very sorry that we did not get a picture of the object, but this was before cell phone cameras and we had no idea we would need a camera beforehand. So frustrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,  K*<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I believe it was big enough to cover an acre of land. It had one large middle light like a large bulb in the center and on the outer corners were two small lights. It hovered 45 minutes with no noise whatsoever. I stood outside and watched it for 45 minutes. The most amazing thing was the two lights on each point of this triangle then departed going opposite ways of each other and did some very strange things like loops and things and left the hovering thing there. These two little things that left the large thing were much smaller but they were like points of light. It then formed in a line and flew out towards the mountains but it was very unusual for something to hover for solong but the two points departing was really strange. I phoned this in at the center that night and no ! one has called me back. I can draw it and show you where it was. It was right over our pasture and not that high above ground. I thought at first sight it must be a plane going to land, but planes cannot hover for 45 minutes that I know of and things cannot just depart and :do their own little air show&#34;. I have not forgotten this and may never forget it.<n>

My friend and I sat there for a few minutes rather shocked or in disbelief for a while and continued our trip. I didnot mention to him that I had seen simular things in the Rocky Mts. of the USA some years before.<n>

The approach of 2 1/2&#39; to 3&#39; tall beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 21:00, while on a camping trip in the Poudre Canyon area, lights were witnessed flying around some trees. Then, later, at about 02:00 more lights appeared, and a large group of lights overhead. This is when the whooshing sound was heard. The two men of the group were retrieving water when this occurred. The two women were witnessing this phenomenon when the guys came back. The lights landed nearby, behind some trees. The smaller balls of lights were &#34;whirling&#34; around the nearby trees.Shortly after 02:00 these small beings approached the camp site. I was extremely terrorized by this. They approached, then backed off, then approached, and backed off. This occurred numerous times. Their approach was from about 300 to 500 feet from us, and were plainly visible to the group.The smaller balls of light, put a &#34;box&#34; or something resembling a box in a tree, aroung 04:00 to 05:00 in the morning.The small being continued to &#34;terrorize&#34; the group until about 06:00 in the morning. When the sun came up, they departed.Although we were terrorized, none of us were actually harmed by these beings.<n>

I lived with my grandparents in the basement where there were no windows. I was in bed and fast asleep when some flashing lights in my room awakened me. It was very cold all the sudden and I became very terrified.  It was such a scary feeling that i could not move. The blinking lights had stopped when I first woke up. I kept my eyes open for a few minutes and the blinking lights started again. Every time the lights blinked there were these creatures around my bed looking at me, as the lights blinked faster they began to move towards me and one of them put its three fingered hand on my forhead while the others( there was four of them)started tuging on my covers, but they weren&#39;t really touching anything. They were grey with flashy clothes and big heads, with really big black pearl eyes. The fear that came over me when the one touched my forhead paralized me dramaticaly. I closed my eyes and prayed for it to go away. But I had to open them and I didn&#39;t know why it was like a curiousity that made me open them. Then he looked at two of the beings at the foot of the bed and they grabbed my left leg and poked my calf on my left leg. They had a futuristic metal object with like buttons or switches on it, they jabbed it into my leg and pulled it out, but not all of it was there when they done so. When that was done, the one that touched my forhead looked at me and it was like a mental message was spoke. It said &#34;If you tell no one we will return to visit you.&#34; Then the blinking lights quit and it was very dark. I heard this humming noise that got really loud then desipated into nothing. The next day I asked my Grandmother about a loud noise and she said that she heard it and it woke her up but she didn&#39;t think anything about it. I waited several days before I finally told my Grandmother. I finally told my wife about it one year ago and she didn&#39;t believe me. Still to this day my leg still itches in the spot they stabbed me.<n>

I could hear unusual laguages being spoken, as they placed beeping things on my head as if they were measuring my head. Once while at our cottage I awoke to see a small greenish creature next to me with huge eyes.  He asked me through ESP why human&#39;s reason. I answered him back the same way, through my mind and thoughts, and then i fell back to sleep.  Another time I was home alone when my light went out and a rush of footsteps came pursuing me while i was in my bed, suddenly I heard a crash and the lights came on.  i was fine.  Shortly after another incident occured.  Black out in bed and felt myself being lifted spiritually to another place.  It was dark and light all around me.  I blacked out again and never came to until the morning when I awoke in my bed.  I was so fearful for so long it would happen again, so I started to pray for it all to stop and it did.I don&#39;;t think it&#39;s a big deal, so I keep it to myself.  You see I have always believed.  Now I don&#39;t fear them any more becuase Christ helped me to understand.<n>

I was in my first year of working for the hospital.  I was working the night shift between 4 PM and midnight on the above estimated date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had pulled my patrol car over to make an entry into my daily activity log.  It was a clear summer night with not one cloud in sight.  Airport traffic was coming in from the north to north west area and landing in from the east of the airport at sky Harbor international Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aviation enthusiast and sometimes I look up into the sky to look at aircraft as they fly by.  I noticed in America West Airlines Boeing 737 fly into Skyharbor from north west of Phoenix.  I had pulled my vehicle over facing north along 10 Street and Brill Street which is located just south of McDowell Road at the intersection of McDowell Road and 10 Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I was fixed on the airplane flying over the building located on the southwest corner of 10th St. and McDowell Rd.  As it flew over I noticed the stars around the airplane were stationary.  I then noticed one star just to the 1 to 2 o&#39;clock position of the aircraft when it suddenly shot towards the rear of the aircraft, then circled around behind your craft over to it&#39;s 9 o&#39;clock position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It trailed and traveled with the aircraft in a parallel motion tracking and pacing the aircraft for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and then it faded and disappeared.  As I recall, the star or the UFO was constantly illuminated and looked like a star and at no time did it appear.  It looked like it was just sitting there stationary the whole time waiting for the aircraft to fly by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that was the end of the UFO encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One window i|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01922.html|12|ndxe199608| SUMMARY:  Teen girl  saw circular UFO with orange,green,reddish-orange .A series of rectangular windows were around the middle body. One window in the center moved down.The round bottom displayed a metallic gold color. She viewed it from30ft.for 5-10 min. before it zig-zagged and shot up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing north an object appeared to be hovering over a group of power lines in my backyard near a ten foot tall shed. When I saw the UFO, I felt as if I was being watched and I watched for about 5 or 10 minutes. I felt very scared  and I felt as if something drawed me outof my house. When I got outside, I saw this. (drawing will be sent later) I saw the window marked &#34;x&#34;    move open as if something was opening it. The window seemed to move  down like rolling down a car window. Teen states that at 2:15 on 8-20-1996 she was making frozen french fries and she felt drawn to go outside. She states that she never goes around back at night , but something drew  her out thereand when she looked up  she saw an object about 10 feet away  and 10-115ft. above her.&#34; well the object was really low and I saw alot of windows and appeared as if someone or something was opening it. But anyway, I nver believed in UFOs until recently. Anyway, the object was circular and the lights on the !UFO was orange, green, and reddish-orange color, but the bottom was a goldish metallic color which was a round shape. Anyway, I watched the object for a good5 or 10 minutes and then I went inside looked out the window and the object was still there but then it zig-zagged in a pattern and it was really fast and then it was gone! Then I went to bed aat about 2:45, it started about 2:15, &#34; as stated in writing by (name deleted) on August 20,1996. Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn&#39;t act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff&#39;s office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat&#39;l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996. I am trying to get that tape ready to mail this weekend 1-04-1997 and will include the written report to you as soon as possible using your very handy on-line report form.Thanks so much to all of you there for helping us here in Ohio with all the problems we are encountering here of late in our backyards and over our houses.Take Care all of you and a special thanks goes to Mr Gribble, not Gripple. Please excuse my wro!ng pronunciation of your name. You should have corrected me. Thans not only for the time and trouble to look at and have analyzed the video tapes  I&#39;ve been sending , but for having founded the Center in the first place. I&#39;m only sorry to have been such a troublesome part of your life in 1996, maybe I can help in the future by filing things electronically now. Thanks again to all of you so much for your help and to Mr. Davenport, I ask you to forgive me for calling in at pesky hours of the morning. I am sorry for any trouble I have caused any of you there . All I can say is that I didn&#34;t mean to.<n>
8/19/96 22:30|Spencer|SD|Unknown|22 minutes|Alien crafts-Eastern South Dakota- late summer early fall 1996|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24054.html|13|ndxe199608| Alien crafts-Eastern South Dakota- late summer early fall 1996<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry this report is a few years late, but I have just decided to bring it out in to the open due to a more &#34;relaxed&#34; attitude people are having with UFO&#39;s.  My self and wife were visiting my parents in their farmhouse in eastern South Dakota.  My daughter was in bed and Me and my wife went to sleep in an upstairs room room facing west.  Typical to east SoDak there were no trees at all obstruction the view of the sky, and the nearest pollution light was 22 miles away in that direction.  She pointed out a light to me she said had just settled in the sky near by.  I was totally used to seeing the occassional plane or helicopter, even though it was farm country, and low level aircraft are extremely rare, cropdusters are even very rare out there, probably due to wind and a below average economy.  What I saw almost knocked me off my feet it was so out of place and obviously &#34;extra-terrestrial&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 and 1/2 miles straight west, and slightly north there was a light hovering still in the sky.  My sife claimed to have seen it arrive there &#34;gliding in very fast&#34; If she hadn&#39;t caught the movement out of the corner of her eye while preparing for bed, I believe neither of us would have seen it and would have gone to bed.  Even though it was fairly close the ships light was not outrageously bright.  I call it a ship, because after watching it for 22 minutes I had no doubt it was an aircraft we were observing.  She said in suprised voice (amused even). What is that?  I saw a fairly bright light to the west.  I could pinpoint its location be cause for some reason the light cast an extremely faint, but discernable glow on the ground below it.  The light was normal white light, it did have what seemed to be a slight bluish tint to it.  I have always had extremely good vision doctors tell me 15/20, this is in my medical reports since very young childhood.  The land this craft hovered over was occupied by the biggest herd of cattle in the area.  I know the farmer personally, and his Black Angus are reknowned.  (Four years before, his hired man, laughed and told me how this rancher was constantly at stress at how his cattle were getting rustled with no tire prints at the the theft scene, see, load a trailer with cattle and it will chew up dirt when you leave, but then again it was one here and one there, who knows I put this together in the weeks following the siting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this light hover out there, we&#39;re both intelligent and discussed opsprey and harrier aircraft. then 12 minutes into the siting the light shifted about 10 meters to the north (right) and 15 or 20 down, so fast it was mind boggling This was the first time I saw it move, and I knew I was watching a machine from another world or galaxy was right in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked for another ten minutes and it shot straight upwards into &#34;the heavens&#34; we were speechless.  She is the product of a stoic german midwestern back-ground.  And she admitted that there was no way to explain what we saw except UFO.  6 years later, almost exactly, I figure if it was a US military craft, it was alien technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my honor and word, this is not a joke.  I actually wrote because after watching an x-files rerun with a guy wearing a nicap hat in it.  Not a joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly after the sighting, myself and my wife could not drop the fact that we had witnessed something that shook our world and our entire belief system.  We were literally in a mild shock.  We lightheartedly said we would watch that weeks x-files.  I don&#39;t know how long, but it wasn&#39;t too long after that sighting that we saw the episode with the plane and the guy with the nicap hat. (by the way, I guessed date, but didn&#39;t want to guess one for fear of lack of credibility).  I know I am close.  Even for six years of memory erosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One reason I have converted every person I have told this story to, into a UFO believer is that they know the wife.  She is the protestant prude from the wealthy family who wouldn&#39;t believe anything she couldn&#39;t see.  I have to say over the years, that event changed her more than almost anything.  And I have to say for the positive.  Please write if you saw lights in the Dakotas in that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enclosed a email to you earlier, I forgot a fact.  The light also gave me a perfect lidea of its heighth. About 250 meters.  I remembered also when the ship left, it left a trail of light, but just for a fraction of a second, not sustained.  I just remembered, I can&#39;t accept the phone call due to a person I rent from.  Please write or email I will correspond, and can give affidavits by her or me.  I have been into this since then, but this is the only real step I have taken to pursue it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  EDITORIAL COMMENT:  We do not understand why people wait years to report their sightings!

I was awake .Ilooked out my window and there was a bright light like a yellow fireball so i went outside to videotape it .  by the time i went out side the yellow glow went away and all there was left was a silver disc i captured on video .The disc looks like the shape of a shiny metallic tuna can it appears to be flat on the top and on the bottom and it also appears to be round like a can but it hovered above the treeline for about 45 minutes untill the sun came up and ithe image went out of range. The object looked like a metallic can like disk that had no opening it just i was startled at first and i could not believe my eyes but i was tired from not sleeping much the night before. others have seen the tape i showed it to them and they only saw  and heard of my experience after i videoed it and they dont know what it could be ..so its a unidentified flying object that i videoed in my back yard i thank you for your time<n>

Wayne, Indiana<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning from visiting my son in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and while driving down Hwy 33 heading towards St Rd 6 traveling NW towards Elkhart, Indiana area, I witnessed what I now believe to be an Orb or Sphere shaped object.  I was in the country area just about 50 miles NW of Ft. Wayne and I happened to look up at the cresent moon which was to the left of my drivers window.  What caught my eye was that just off the tip of the cresent moon, there was an object which reminded me of a drop of water haning off the tip of the moon.  I starred for a while and determined that it was definitely not a star.  I could see that it had a circular shape and reflected the sun light as did the moon. I continued to see the object (which never moved from its &#34;hanging off the tip of the moon position&#34;.  And eventually the road turned and I stopped paying attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I got home, I was so baffled by what I had seen, that I called the local weather station and asked about possible satelites in the area, but was told there werent any that i could see or anything that would be there like I described.  I have recently seen videos and pictures of what I can now saw if very much like what I thought i saw that night.  And due to the fact that these spheres have been documented as moving and being still, i do believe that is what i saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know for sure is that it was NOT A STAR!   And it was not there later on in the night.  Since it was a routine journey, it did not have a camera on hand unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was V shaped. The lights were amber colored and what appeared to be dimmed.  The first thing I thought was &#34;How tricky of them.  They are trying to blend in with the street lights.&#34;  It had approx. fifteen sets of lights on each side except the first light which was a single one.  It was moving directly west.  It was so low that by the time I ran a half of a block I was directly behind it and it was getting blocked by the trees .  I really wanted to see if I could see the stars through the middle or not but to see if it was solid but it was passing through the trees.  I thought I may have.  Even though I didn&#39;t get to see it for very long, it was no doubt amazing and HUGE!  It&#39;s funny, but right before I saw it I had thought to myself &#34;It would be a good night to see a U.F.O.&#34; A couple of minutes later I saw it.  About a year later I heard some other people had seen a U.F.O. directly east of where I was and the same description.  The area I saw this in is a populated suburb of Minneapolis and was moving directly into the city of Anoka.  I wish I had known of your reporting network back then.  Even though it was 3:18 in the morning I had not been drinking.  I had been dropping a friend off at home. The craft was silent.  I found that amazing!<n>

I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, they were *definitely* not conventional aircraft, I&#39;m talking about going one way at at least 10 times faster than the fastest jet I&#39;ve ever seen, then in the blink of an eye it was going completely the opposite direction, at the same speed, with the other keeping close behind. I just wish I had a video camera with me that night. I know I&#39;ve said a lot, but I really would rather not be contacted about this by phone, or mail, (with all the hype surrounding the MIB etc with genuine sightings) I jsut stumbled across this site and thought I&#39;d share what I saw, it really is something I look up for every night (heh, I&#39;ve seen a lot of shit in the sky since then, but these were the best, in case you&#39;re interested though, we get a lot of traffic out this way, like 40-50 travelling in straight lines across the sky (REALLY high up, binoculars don&#39;t magnify at all , and Pretty speedy too) which could be satellites, I haven&#39;t looked into these (but the volume of them suggests to me they aren&#39;t) I&#39;ve also been privelidged to see a, umm, oval red fiery thing is probably the best way I can descibe it, about the size of (to my eye, I&#39;m not sure of distance) a lamp-post head, and going about as fast as I see cars pass. Sorry this is all very vague, but I&#39;ve seen a lot of this here and it&#39;s all very much &#39;oh, I see it now, what&#39;s your point?&#39; to me now.

I was looking towards the d|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04976.html|18|ndxe199608| My wife and I were walking towards our car through the back parking lot of Andreas Restaurant after dinner. I was looking towards the direction of where the car was parked when I noticed with my right field of view, a very large  dark object that was moving from East to West just above tree top. The event happened so fast that I could barely point fast enough with my hand (while yelling Look..Look!) towards the object, hoping to get my wife&#39;s attention. Even though black in color, it had dimly glowing light along all the bottom edges and the sihlouette of the object was easily distinguished as a large silent triangle. The scene was fairly quiet and I was able to clearly hear in the background the motor noise of a small plane, during and well after the event took place. I was so shook up with my heart pounding that I could hardly breathe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event took place I noticed that to attract my wife&#39;s attention to the black triangle I used my index finger with my arm fully extended.  This would later provide me with a scale of the relative size of the object.  The speed of movement across my field of view (in this case approximately 70° to 80°) took ~2 seconds. The altitude I estimated had to be less than some visible background mountain peaks that are ~3000ft about ~5 to 6 miles from wher I was viewing. It travelled right over the city and made no sound whatsoever!.  If I had not been gazing at exactly in the direction of the mountains behind the city, I would have missed the event.  It was that quick and that lucky.  After gaining my composure my wife and I exchanged information, but it was clearly evident that she had missed all the initial trajectory as i was trying to get her to follow the object by my pointing towards it.  The next morning I went back to the exact place I was standing the night before and took a picture.  From the picture I was able to determine the relative speed at &gt;800 mph!...and an object size (when compared to some features of the background) observed the day I took the picture. I estimated the object to be some  60 to 80 meters? in some size (It&#39;s hard to extract all this from such a short mental picture). It also looked blunt at the back, not aerodynamic per se.  I noted that fromthe perspective that I saw it dissapear behing the trees, it looked more like a wide arrow head but was flat across the back. I purchased newspapers and asked around if any reports were submitted, but was not able to confirm any other observers which would have seen this craft.  I decided to document all my findings before submitting the information back in 1996, but regrettably I lost my report on a disk crash and later was not able to recover the file.<n>
8/16/96 14:30|Fairfield|OH|Triangle|1 minute|Triangle shape observed  on bright sunny day|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21460.html|19|ndxe199608| Triangle shape observed  on bright sunny day<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred on a very bright, sunny, cloudless Saturday afternoon, sitting on my deck, facing north across an open area with another open area (at that time)to my left. Noticed a darkening in the daylight like a cloud was crossing the bright sun. Looked up at the sky and to the east, over the buildings and open space came a very huge dark shape, moving about 25 to 30 miles per hour.  It was wider than a football field. There was not a sound, in fact I could still here a bird out in the open space in front of me just as it started to come into my line of sight.  The triangle was a little higher than tree-top level.  As it passed over my position, it appeared that the larger mass of it was actually over the open space in front of me. I looked steadily at it as it went over my position and thought that it was made of some type of metal of platic with the appearance of very dark gray to black and had the distinct texture of not being painted.  It was not shiny, i.e. the sun did not reflect or light up to top of it which I noted. I got the strong impression thatit was not painted and there were no markings on the bottom of the craft or along the training edge.  There were no apparant appetures  for engines along the back end of it. As it proceeded to the west, I noticed that it seemed to be very thin at the trailing edge of the craft.  I had the impression that it was a little thicker in the middle, like towards the pointy edge. As it continued to the west, and as it was passing direcly over me, I felt like there was some type of disturbance in the air.  I could feel it on the skin of my arms, almost like an electrical/magnetic charge was in the air.  It continued moving slowly and silently over the crest of the hill and disappeared. I waited a long time before I finally told my husband and said that since this had occurred on the day of the Dayton Air Force Show that I had probably seen a stealth fighter from Wright Pat.  Some months later I saw a picture of the Stealth and that WAS NOT WHAT I HAD SEEN. ! Besides , since then I understand that the Stealth does make noise and also can&#39;t fly at such a slow speed.  I know what I saw and felt.  There is no doubt in my mind. I cannot ever forget the impression of the skin of that craft - the color and whether it was metal or plastic, but metal seems closer to what I saw. It appeared to be crossing directly over the area where a building was to be built and passed along and over the hill directly in back of a hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My feet were pointed to the east, and I noticed in looking back towards the west what I first thought was a meteorite approaching from the west traveling east. I sat up to watch, and mentioned to my friend that this meteor is just going and going and not burning out. I watched it fall far below the horizon, and thought it might actually make a landing in the Atlantic ocean. I laid back down and began scanning for meteors, satellites, jets, etc. when it approached from the east moving to directly overhead of me at a tremendous rate of speed. Quite abruptly, and with perfect precision and no change in speed, it performed a maneuver and changed course at about a 45 degree angle. I remember feeling ecstatic, and had quite a surge of adrenaline. I told my friend what I&#39;d just seen, he seemed disinterested. Within a minute, the object moving at the same speed began to approach from the west. This time it performed more high speed perfect maneuvers, zig zagging directly overhead and continuing east. It was at this time that I began to percieve that it looked like a very tiny triangle with a red light at each point. It seemed to be at a very high altitude and made no noise like a turbine engine. The maneuvers were impossible for a fixed &#34;lift&#34; type wing, and too perfect and quiet for turbine thrusters. If It came back from the east I don&#39;t remember because eventually it began doing the same thing but in a North south, south/north flight path. Every time it passed, the maneuvers became more complicated, and I witnessed it at least ten times or more flying back and forth. Again, I stress that the maneuvers were geometrically perfect. My friend is not as familiar with the sky as I am, and it took a few passes for him to actually detect the craft, but what turned out to be it&#39;s last pass, he described to me the maneuvers as I had seen them. He doesn&#39;t talk about it to this day. As a matter of interest, the last maneuver that it performed actually included a full and abrupt stop, followed by a faint burst of light as it took off again towards the south. It did not accelerate...It went from zero to full speed instantaneously. The whole event left me feeling satisfied but puzzled, a bit frustrated but elated, and I can&#39;t just tell anyone, because humans live in darkness. But let those who are wise understand this...A light has shown in the darkness but the darkness has not understood it; I&#39;m not worried about what I saw, just blessed. And someday I&#39;ll know the answer when I look not through the darkened mirror, but meet the Perfect face to face.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The shape of the object did not resemble any craft capable of flight. It had more resembalance to a building than an air borne craft. One single yellow-orange light rotated around the perimeter. The craft was approached by two military helicopters, which came within very close proximity to it. The helicopters closed on it briefly, then backed off to a distance of about 200 yds. and maintained their positions. Three seperate missles, apparently ground fired from the Fort Carson military installation were seen to impact the object, causing it to fall to the ground. The line of sight prevented anyone witnessing the actual impact of the craft. The helicopters then left the area following the route they had come from. This activity was observed by approximately 10 individuals in one location to the south and another four at a location some 20 miles to the north, placing the object at almost the center of the field of observation and at a distance to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It a round ball of light.  It was about a hundred yards away hovering over the trees on top of the mountain.  It didn&#39;t make a sound.  My friend saw it when it zipped really really fast down the mountainside in a zig zag motion and faded out of sight.  I was compeltely sober.  I am a skeptical person by nature but I know what I saw.  It could be a human made aircraft that the government is not talking about but it definately was not a plane or helicopter.

While we were looking up (we were not drunk or on any drugs), we noticed a light slowly moving across the sky which we had first thought was a star since it was of the same size and and a little brighter than one. This object then stopped and made a 90 degree turn and continued before stopping again and then making another 90 degree turn. All four of us witnessed it and were in awe. We quickly went through the possibilities: a star, an airplane, a satellite...but none of which would stop and make such turns. The object soon disappeared.

On this particular night, we chose to go from my house up the road to the intersection with her street, thus allowing more time to be out before going home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before reaching the street intersection, we were both startled by bright lights scanning the woods to our right. To our immediate left were houses. As we stood and watched, the trees began to sway with leaves blowing around and enough wind to blow our hair and clothes. We continued to stand and watch and were shocked to see what appeared to be a very low flying helicopter with search lights, but it made no noise whatsoever. I have no distinct memory of the helicopter having lights on the body, other than the lights shining down. The helicopter was black or dark grey and hovering just over the tree tops, approximately 20 feet into the woods. The lights from the helicopter were scanning into the woods in a strategic pattern, going from left to right, right to left, as if searching a grid, area by area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there watching for a few more minutes before making a quick agreement to run to our respective homes as fast as possible, inform our parents, and call each other to ensure we both made it home safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my parents who offered the idea that possibly the WV State Police had sent a helicopter to search for an escaped inmate because just outside Beckley is a regional jail and a federal prison. I informed them again that this helicopter made no noise. This statement left us a bit perplexed and we decided that we would check the newspaper in the next few days to see if an inmate had, in fact, escaped and law enforcement was searching for him. In the following days there was no published news of such an event. Another idea that we discussed was that law enforcement or a military unit was doing training flights.  Again, the idea was somewhat dismissed as a silent helicopter was not something known at the time, at least to us.  The closest military installment is an hour away at Yeager Airport in Charleston which houses a division of the National Guard or Reserves.  I&#39;m honestly not sure which.  There are no major military bases in the state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the area of the woods where the helicopter was flying there is an older cemetery on the mountain, just up an old and steep road a few feet from where we were standing.  Beyond that, there is a portion of the woods that has been cleared to allow for power lines that run down the mountain leading to a small power station, just below Interstate 64/77.   Our location is in an established subdivision and over the mountain, something you can easily walk or take a local road, is a more rural area with homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything similar since, though I do catch myself watching the sky still as an adult.  I am now 28, college educated, and perplexed by this experience.  My parents are both college graduates and they had no reasonable explanation at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girl I was with was a year younger than I was at the time and part of an Army family that had relocated to the area several months before the event.  Her family was stationed here for a few years to staff the local recruiting office.  Her parents had no other logical explanation beyond what my family had devised.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They tried to explain it away as a balloon or blimp of some kind, even though there was no gondola attached and the object moved purposefully in a very straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was approximately 500 to 1000 ft high and I&#39;m estimating that it was about the size of a standard passenger bus.  It was metallic, shiny and reflected the sun on it&#39;s surface but it was a semi-dull shine, and not of mirror reflecting quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the surface of the object were two lines that seperated it into 3 sections:  pointed nose section, middle and rear.  There were no other distinguising features on the object either; no windows or door apertures could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object passed us overhead we had a clear view of the back which was round, perfectly smooth and also featureless; no exhaust could be seen, No motor or propeller could be seen either and no sound at all - it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An amazing sight, to be sure, and one which I will never forget.<n>

The cloud cover was very sporadic or mostly clear blue skies.  I stopped washing the car to go get us something to drink in the house.  While walking up the path to the front door a silver glint caught the corner of my right eye, turning my head and looking up and to the right I saw what I had previously thought impossible.  In the distance at if I lifted my right arm from waist to object would be two o&#39;clock I saw an absolutely enormous silver cube or box!   It looked to be a perfect rectangle and the sun reflected off it giving it a stainless steel appearance.  There seemed to be orange and red circular lights aglow on its surface and it rotated slowly clockwise and drifted further away and at great height until foliage completely blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father also saw it and was as stunned as I was to see a flying box that formed a perfect rectangle with no sign&#39;s of propuls! ion but what created even more awe was the sheer size of this object!

But, the question that I am curious to have answered is:  Has anyone witnessed an object that makes no sound, is about a large as a hot air balloon&#39;s balloon - and round, and had a colour in almost exactly the same colour as the orange coloured street lights?  It had an aura about it but didn&#39;t cast any light on the ground!  Is this one of your usual type of sightings - it followed me at a distance and when I rounded the road and went up and over a hill it slowly came over the rise and down into the valley.  There were no reports of any aircraft in the area that night and it has bothered me for many years now.  Bearing in mind Kaikoura does seem to be a place of sightings I have never bothered nor believed in them so this wasn&#39;t a mitigating factor of my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted from New Zealand.

Me and my parents had decided to come home that night so we wouldnt have to do so that morning because my parents hated to wait on things they wanted to do, my father, mother, and myself were in the pickup driving home to Lubbock i had fallen asleep half way home to the town of Floyadada,Tx when we came to this town my mother had woken me up saying that there was something in the sky so i sat up in my seat and when i looked out of the window i saw several different lights buzzing around the sky, now where this took place is in basic farm country so there were no street lights and was also completly quiet, these lights were silver,blue,green and also red from the best of my memory, keep in mind this happend over 8 years ago. So we see these lights slowly moving around, a few crossed the road while others seemed to hide behind one another then move back out into view, we became curious so my father stopped on the side of the road we rolled the windows down to listen but we couldnt hear anything what so ever.My dad proceeded to drive down the highway again and noticed one of these lights following us on our passenger side in the distance so my father stopped the pickup and the light stopped with us, my father took off again and the light moved again, needless to say this was a very strange thing that happened that night, this happend for 1 hour to maybe 1 and a half hours all the way to Lubbock, there were hundreds of people parked on the side of the road to Lubbock city limits. It&#39;s a different world out in the country were there are no cities because you just cant see the sky like you can out in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

You can see a top of a tree and the milkeway in the background.  The picture is about three minutes exspossure and starts on the left and heads to the right.  I like how you can see the ufo  starts slow with the thicker line of light as it pickes up speed the light line gets smaller then you see it as stoppes and changes dirctions.

I called my brother and cousin and the other few friends that was with us at the time to look. At first we thought it was the beagaining of a sunami. One other we sere with saw a light about 600 yard out in the ocean were it was hidden by fog or steam like clouds. we all got alittle dissorientaed and watched the light for a few minutes, in awe. It was like we were spell bound as we were stuned and could not move, when the light had dissapered into the ocean, the ripples went away and the steam like clouds dissapated. My brother Had whent into the van to get the spot light, and shined it to were we seen this light. there was no sign of anything, no boat no light house nothing. One of my friends I was with looked down as he had peed his pants and said &#34;Holy shit, It is 1 in the morning&#34;. two to three hours had went by from the few minutes from watching this light. We all freaked out and left back to Tillamook. The next day watching the news this light was seen all up in down the west coast, from Vancouver B.C., Washington, Oregon, California and Mexico. With millions of call ins of the sighting no anwser was given to this date. I am courious as to were those two/three hours went that only seemed like minutes sent and what happen. I know I will die with out knowing, yet knowing we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a hot overcast day.At this time something had caught the corner of my eye and I looked up.In between the break of the heavy overcast clouds there was a very large disk shaped object just hanging there approximately one-hundred to one-hundred and fifty feet above the ground.It was a dark grey in color.No lights,no noise,no crew compartment.Just hanging there like it was looking at me.It appeared to be approximately sixty to eighty feet in circumference.Very large.Up unto this point I was a total disbeliever.I dropped the watering hose at my feet,and ran to a small engine repair shop that shared the same building with my company.There were two mechanics working there at the time.When I arrived there I immediately called the two mechanics outside to where I was standing but the clouds had filled that area of the sky again.I had told them what I had just seen and they began to laugh and make some expected comments until when just then another small break in the clouds had proven my sighting.The object had still been there except it was approximately an added three-hundred feet above the previous position.Both men became very frightend and ran bak to the shop.They said &#34;call news or police&#34; &#34;did you see that thing&#34;? oh my God! We continued for awhile trying to figure out what to do.The main mechanic said &#34; I wish we had a camera&#34; I&#39;ll call nine one one and the news.The news never took us serious until other calls came in but it had been forgotten about pretty quick by the local news and authorities although they confirm that something had been there and no records of any aircraft had been in that area that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I am an avid star gazer. I was watching the clear night sky up above.....just lost in itsbeauty. We were outside for about an hour, just talking aboutthe good times. I was looking up at the stars, when an unusually bright group of stars caught my eye. At first I thought it might be orion......then thought they might be satellites....but was quick to change my mind. They objects were very high up...too high to be planes. They began moving in a snake like motion(s&#39;ing)around the stars. This motion convinced me temporarily that they were satellites.....but then they stoped......grew very bright,and changed opposite direction. We were all quite with amazement at what we had witnessed. We stood out there discussing the rational possibilities of what it was that we had seen. As we looked in the direction of where the incident occured......we noticed a slightly larger grouping......of 7. They repeated thesame motions that the previous 3 had...then grew bright, almost joining in a straight line of light, then reversed course as theothers before had. We are still not sure of what we had witnessedthat summer night.....and have not discussed it with others....but I&#39;m certain what we witnessed was not of human origin or of Earth&#39;s current technology.  I am currently a college student, studying to be a computer technician and engineer. I am also interested in working for N.A.S.A when I havecompleted my education. I&#39;m 24 yrs old.I hope I am taken seriously.....this is the first time I have spoken about the incident to anyone.<n>

I&#39;ve always looked up to the sky when outside as I am the child of a Air Force Lifer. I looked up and a bright white ball of light flew right over the top of my head at about 3000 miles an hours. It was about 500 feet in the air, and simply massive. Not only did I see it blow by me clearly, but I also heard a whoosh of air as it blasted past. It was headed east and blew right across the burbank airport. This thing flew across the San Fernando Valley in clear sight. It brought goose bumps all the way down my back. I remember thinking how advanced the craft was. Like nothing we have in our Air Force or NASA. I also remember thinking as it scared the hell out of me, &#34;What the hell are they doing here?&#34; I mean, this thing was so far ahead of us, we&#39;re like, not even ants to whoever has technology like that. The vessel was silent. The only noise was the whoosh of air. Another guy was sitting there at the table outside, and I said, &#34;Did you SEE that?&#34; He said, &#34;See what?&#34; You wouldn&#39;t have even needed to be looking at the sky for it to catch your eye it was so bright. Okay, it looked like it was made of white glass. It was I estimate, at least 100 feet around. It glowed from inside the white glass walls. Like a flourescent bulb in an office ceiling, only a huge ball instead of a cylinder. Now, as I was out there every night taking my breaks, I used to watch the 707&#39;s and DC-8&#39;s coming in for their landings at burbank airport. I saw hundreds of planes come down from there. I know how fast they glide along the sky on their descent to the runway. This Ball of Light crossed the sky, at least, 10 times faster than those planes come in. I should also note that the very next night, I was listening to Mr. KABC on the radio, and some guy called into the show and reported seeing something buzz the Santa Monica airport. His discription was quite different than mine, not even close really, but two airports buzzed on two nights in LA, with two different types of U! FO&#39;s? Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

The planet was directly north of globular cluster M22 with about 1.5 degree separation.  I spotted something that should not have been there, a small red-orange light traveling leisurely westward halfway between Jupiter and the cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer examination, I discerned that it was triangular shaped, about fourth magnitude, and flickering slightly.  I watched it for about ten minutes, and in that time it proceeded west into Scorpius and brightened by about one magnitude.  It was about 20 degrees above the horizon, and moved very slowly. I got the impression that it was at a great height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After ten minutes, my arms became fatigued from holding the heavy pair of binoculars.  I put them down for a few seconds. When I resumed looking, I could not relocate the object.<n>

I was listening to the music and watching the sky looking for shooting stars (we didn&#39;t have great seats, but the music was great) when I noticed the lights.  I pointed them out to my girlfriend who was also looking for shooting stars.  At first I thought it was light reflecting off of low flying birds since they were moving so fast.  But they stayed in such perfect formation I quickly discounted that.  I came to the conclusion that it was a high flying military plane (no sound, so I assumed military) that was reflecting in the lights of the concert.  Then tonight I heard on the news of a similar report in Pasco, WA (near George) and thought maybe I should report it.<n>

Until I started to move towards it in the feild it had been about 100&#39;foot in the air and the closer I got it moved away slowly I was stopped by a railroad track and it stopped also and then it moved up and down and back and forth real slow and I realized it was a ball of lite greyish white glowing and not sending out a beam also no noise.  I started to get nervous so I drove back to the woods I came from and shut the engine off again to try and here it still no sound I watched for a while as it moved slowly down to the ground and sat there for awhile It seemed about 50-75 foot across and I got within 2000 foot of it at the closest got scared and started the car to go in around the block and come in from the otherside of the mile square and as I got closer it went up and disapeared so I went home to get my son or a friend to come back and see it, but I found no one at home to go with me. So I went back out and on the way I saw it again any this time it was a mile over by a farmers house so I went straight instead of turning to where I was before and went as fast as I could towards to object and about a quarter mile away it took off this time real fast before it disapeared again off to the east and that was the last I saw of it.I didn&#39;t realize untilafter thinking about it that it put off no light and yet it was aball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The back of the car was covered by what seemed like round rear parking lights, 6-10 in number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stopped as we had never seen such a huge car.  Not even in movies!   Slowly the car began to raize vertically.  As we were transfixed with fear and disbelief, this car rose up to the jackaranda tree tops that lined along the road at the hotel.  In no time it began to move away from us towards buildings on the far side.  The acceleration was phenomenal and was passing through the trees that lined on the T junction to this road as if the trees were  not there.  One by one the lights were switched off and the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode took about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then decided to head for home and not walk past were the object had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day when we visited the hotel and asked around if one had seen any strange thing the answer was in the negative!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It is parallel to the High Speed test track at Holloman AFB.  As I sat there to wait for traffic, I noticed that there was a test sleed firing at the the 9:30 position as I was facing due west. All of a sudden a purple or redish ball appeared and ran down the track with the white plume of the test sled. At the end of the first booster the ball changed direction and came straight at my position at the stop sign.  As I looked out the sun was in my face and the heat risers were coming up evenly and steady.  The ball, about the same size as the initial blast of the sled, but to the east of the track accelerated with the sled. At the first booster it began to accelerat at 3 to 4 times the speed of the sled as it changed direction toward my position. By this time it was going so fast that I could not track it with my eyes but the truck rocked gently and I saw the heat risers were disturbed as if someone had thrown a rock into a pond.  That was all I saw that day but a year or two later a friend passed on some mufon reports that mentioned an incident that brought the whole incident to light.  People returning from a day at the races in Ruidoso NM. saw a disc shaped object behind round mountain outside of Tularosa.  As they pulled over to stop and stare, balls of light from all over the basin rushed up to the craft and the craft then took off. This corresponded with the time and place.  If you draw a continuation of the line of this ball that I saw it would put you in the vacinity of round mountain.  end of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I knew dozens of aircraft models by heart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting`s description:  On summer 1996 (I think it was  august 5th but I might be wrong) half past midnight,  I was heading home from a friend’s house in my car, driving northwards on one of Tel Aviv’s main exists .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was nearing a large main 4 lane intersection I noticed something funny ‘ there were about 50 cars facing my direction and some were scattered all over the junction on the opposite to traffic direction.  As I got near I saw a lot of people that just stopped their cars and got out, all of them, looking at the sky. I stopped the car with the engine on and did the same .<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw (with dozens of spectators around me) can be described as a very bright &#34;sphere.&#34; It was about the size of a big van, hovering in front of a medium sized apartment building (about 17 stories high).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object changed colors in an enormous speed, from blue to red from dark purple to Even what seemed like platinum and then back to the color of gold. It looked like it changed hundreds of colors at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was totally silent, it was very close to the building yet it didn’t project or glow on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was near the dark windows of the building yet it did not shine through them into the rooms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there &#34;paralyzed&#34; about two minutes  and no one said a thing .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the object flew upwards in a direct angle towards the sky flying high above the building in less than a seconded (about 100 meter high) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object turned brighter and flew east and disappeared beyond the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point a few of the people shouted in fright and the others said loudly, &#34;Let`s chase it !&#34; Everybody got to their cars and started following the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed into my car and drove very fast to my friends house which was about 7 kilometers far from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to my friends house and told both of them to please come with me to see something amazing. We rushed back to the junction , but it was quite empty already , we encountered A few people that stood there and they said, &#34;You are looking for the ufo?  It went south east.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove south east about 3 kilometers, and got to a bridge the is over looking Tel-Aviv `s main highway.  When we got to the bridge we noticed tons of people and TV cameras plus a few border control army jeeps with fire arms ready .<n> <n><n> <n><n> North to the bridge, &#34;hanging&#34; about 50 meters above the highway`s traffic  , there was the object shining bright like a small sun (it didn’t change colors ) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember clearly standing near the army jeep with my friends and some soldiers were pointing their weapons towards the object and then a shout heard from the CO, &#34;Do not load, Do not shoot,&#34; and he remarked, &#34;What do want to start a war of the world right here?&#34;  Then the object flew east in a blink of an eye. I have never seen anything move so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then made an impossible angle and flew upwards in a straight line until he was Looking like a very distant and small star. Then he just stood there not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all kept looking at this &#34;star,&#34; something like 2 hours more trying not to lose sight.   After two hours or so.  This &#34;star&#34; became a red dot moved again in a straight line across the sky   And vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there were only relatively small and brief headlines, and the army issued a statement saying this object was nothing but a kite that some kids attached a stick-light to.<n>

We played hide and seek in the early dark and such, but i vividly remember that night there being a dark colored helicopter in the field we usually play paintball. There was also two more things stuck partially in ground. Planes do not just get &#34;stuck&#34; in the ground. (i knew this because my father was a b-52 tail gunner and we spent a lot of time around planes and military bases)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just kids so we wanted a closer look at everything. We both told each other that we could never tell dad about this. We walked very slowly and sometimes crawled in the dark field and got about 20 meters from the helicopter which i now recognize as a russian hind. Very dark almost leather appearance to it. only one marking on the body read S^6 ( the chevron was the otherway around but in the same position, kind of like the military uses for friendly identification) There were about 8 men on the scene and it was weird because even though the helicopter was still &#34;idling&#34; we could hear them talk about logistics of getting &#34;them&#34; back to base. We almost ran away after a few minutes because we were afraid we would not be able to come up with an excuse for being out late, but then something strange happened. A glowing wand or something was used by one of the men to ignite or charge a small box type thing on the outside of the craft. It was then apparent they were connected and not just three diffent things. It began to rumble the ground like a deep bass sine wave would from a subwoofer or earthquake. It then became translucent and lost physical shape but the dirt still defined its outline somewhat. It was to the best of my childhood knowledge, the size of three small busses like the special kids rode to school in. Very angular and connected by bars of the same material as the craft in a diamond shape. It had a grayish appearance like an old winnebago, but then again it was dark so i d! ont know for sure. I remember crying with my brother because were more scared that we would be found as people walked away from the craft and toward the chopper. About three or four minutes had passed and we were locked onto each other while they people from the helicopter tried to raise the craft from the earth and get it airborne.(i assume) the rest is kind of hazy, but i do remember talking to some one after the craft had been hoisted or lifted off the ground. Some one said that nothing is more important than not tellng anyone ever-or something i don&#39;t really know. I don&#39;t remember ever going home or ever seeing my brother after that. of course i know where he is now but we don&#39;t talk. I&#39;m not sure what the hell happened but i have a very good memory last i checked and whatever happened to us just isn&#39;t there. I did write everything down the next day in school and i hid it behind a piece of broken drywall in the basement of a library i used to go to.Ever sinnce then i cant remember ever going back there again. 12 years have gone by and for some strange reason i decided to visit the library and get a book for my studies opposed to getting the info from the web and it hit me. I had never returned to the basement. I did find the same piece of broken drywall however i did not find the paper i left as a kid. Someone knows and so it is not secret anymore. I wish to disclose what i know in hopes someone remembers seeing something in the field behind franklin knoll apartments in pottstown/stowe area. I have visited my neighbors and some remember just the rumble of &#34;cars&#34; or heavy machinery at about 8 o clock. I know what i saw and it wasn&#39;t normal. I can&#39;t believe that no one else saw anything as there were at least 20 apartments facing that field, and still are. I went to the field last week for shits and giggles but a grim reality set in as i approached the &#34;site&#34;. there were electrical hazard signs for a local power tranformer all over the place. There is now a large grounding field for a power substation where it! all hap pened. But heres the catch. Theres no power. I am an aspiring electrical engineer. I saw no means of power transmission to this &#34;field&#34;. It is just there. If it weren&#39;t for the damned barbed wire i would go further in and investigate but the fence is pretty seriously guarded by barbs and triple lock out devices common to the electrical trade. i have searched construction maps and electrical manuals far and wide but nothing was &#34;built&#34; in that area according to record. Then why is it there? I believe something weird happened not just in my memory. Go and look for yourself. Touch the fences and listen to the false hertzian waves generated by a loudspeaker within the electrical device inside the electrical looking breaker boxes and switching devices. It is all bullshit. The field had been plowed over and construction of the grounding field was made to cover up evidence im sure. feel free to breach the fence i assure you it is not charged like the signs say it is. I also assure you that all those boxes and wires have never had so much as a single volt passed through them, it&#39;s all fake. There is a nuclear power plant visible from limerick pa from the very spot. That power unbeknownst to locals is being sent to an electrical power grid for texas. Not to stowe. It is a half ass job if you ask me of covering my memory but i still remember it happening. Somebody is gonna fry when &#34;they&#34; read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  Hoax??  PD))<n>

I went out to the south of my home to take some snapshots of landscape material for future paintings. I had taken several shots at different locations before I arrived at this location. Approximately 5 miles south of Knoxville Illinois. I parked at a T intersection where I saw some large haybales and thought this would make for a good shot. I took EXP.#18 looking south. I then turned and took a shot to the west. Then I turned and walked to the intersection and took a shot to the north then I turned and walked a little way to the south and took EXP.#21. I did not know the object in these two exposures were there till I had the film developed. My concentration was mainly on the ground. The object in EXP#18 is approximately 1/3 of a mile away. The object in EXP#21 had moved off to the south east away from me. The time span between EXP#18 and EXP#21 was approximately 3 to 5 minutes. I am a graphic artist for the Maytag Corporation and have been employed there for 40 years. I paint landscapes for a hobby. I&#39;m married with two grown children. I am sending you 2 images that I have blown up copies of. They will be sent via email from ((E-mail address deleted))t. Thank you for your time.<n>

I was a police officer (Elected Sheriff) for a four year term of office. I was a corporate safety director for five years. I have lived from europe to asia and fought in the VietNam as a marine for two years. I have flown on several different aicrafts and seen many things, but the phenomena I witnessed that morning on Aug.2,1996 is nothing I have ever expierenced before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all began when I received a doctors appointment for my dad at the VA medical center, Indianapolis on Aug.2,1996 12:45AM.  I followed their directions on how to get there, as I have not been there for several years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travling south on I-69 approaching the Fishers exit when I observed a dark grayish object about 1/4 mi. to the west.  I backed off the cruise to about 60 mph and I thought it was a blimp, like ones that are used when a new business opens.  I thought perhaps the wind might blow it to its side so I could read what it might say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed that it wasn&#39;t tethered at either end and it was lumpy and seemed to wobble.  I then realized what it was doing. It was doing,it was raising itself up verticle from a fixed horizontal position in the sky, (Like raising a dirty dime up on a table with a magnet,and leaving it balanced on top. Once it was on top it immediately began to glow white inside, (Like a dim light bulb becoming brighter for a fraction of a second and then dimmed again or pulsed). When it did this I could see inside and there was a dark grayish matter at the bottom, (It was offset to the right of center).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the whitenss was its brightess it moved to the left (South) in a perfectly straight line about a 1000 ft.I thought it was going into the cloud to hide, but it didnt,it went in front of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats !! when I could better judge its size and distance.It was approximately 250 in diameter,it was about 50 ft. above cloud ceiling, and approximately 1-1/2 to 2 miles west of my position. When it was moving in front of the cloud I immediately noticed the left side of this perfectly circular object was disappearing (There was a slit an opening in the sky in front of the cloud)it continued into the opening until it completely disappeared. While I observe this event I felt time slow way down, almost to a point that it stopped. It felt like driving into molasses and being hit with novacaine.  I know this happened because I began to worry, (I have not worried like that since the last firefight I fought on football island in VietNam in 1969).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to worry because I could not turn my head, but I still nad my peripheral vision and the Fishers overpass was there and we were going to hit its coluums underneath.Thats when the object completly entered the opening and disappeared and time resumed to normal and I had control again.I said outloud &#34;Hell lets do that again&#34; and it didnt even wake my dad who slept through the whole 8 to 10 seconds of the event.I turned the radio on to hear the news,but nothing was reported, not even later on the t.v. evening news. The next day Aug.3,1996 I read a article in the Indianapolis Star Newspaper that the National Weather Services Doppler Radar Station at Indianapolis had detected unusal rings on their screens the previous day and reported they reported to the news media that they didnt know what would cause such a phenomena, but they did received two reports of birds taking flight all at the same time together.On Aug.5,1996 I called the NWS station at Indy and reported to two meterologist what I had witnessed that morning.I answered their questions and we decided to meet and view the rings on the radar screen.When saw the rings I said &#34; Thats not birds&#34;, and the meterologist stated &#34; No thier not, we know that now&#34;. I went home and never discussed the event again, except with a meterologist at the North Webster Station. This station was constructed about a year later about 23 mi. from my home. Its called NEXRAD for next generation doppler radar because it is linked with all other dopplers to one main office in one location. The reason I choose to speak about it is because I spoke with a gentleman who is a pilot and he told me about an event when he flew into an opening some 30 yrs. ago.We both believe that our events are directly related and we are only seeking scientific explanations.The one thing I do know is that it left its calling card! and the next time this pattern of rings first begins to develope we have about 3-1/2 hrs. before the softspot opens and it arrives and departs through the opening. I believe N.O.A.A. knows this and thats why hundreds of doppler radars are viewed at the same time at one main location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the date is correct.

I even believed the sighting to be some kind of promotional stunt for the movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a news story on 10 o&#39;clock Fox News Baltimore broadcast that stated that there had been many calls to police and to news outlets from the west side of town, near Woodlawn, report a current UFO sighting.  Someone else must remember this news story and they might remember the date.  There isn’t a posted story archive at WBFF 45 (Fox News Baltimore) but someone there who read the news at that time might recall the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the west side of town, so I went outside to see if I could see the UFO.  It was about 10:15 pm and the weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with some small thin clouds.  I immediately saw the UFO flying just above the trees, slowly moving east, as if following Rt. 40 toward Baltimore.  The craft was huge or the size of a stadium, and it made no sound what so ever.  The craft was saucer shaped, like two plates put together.  Around the midline of the craft were rotating red and white lights that rotated in a counterclockwise direction.  The body of the craft was silver in color, and there were windows in the front, or cockpit, and smaller round windows along the side I saw.  A pilot could be clearly seen in the cockpit window, in shadow, and was humanlike in shape.  It was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into the house to rouse others to view the craft, to no avail.  My Mom was in the bathroom, and my boyfriend was asleep on the bed and refused to get up.  I ran back out to my front porch, and I saw it proceed east, toward town, and it disappeared behind the trees.  I am not sure what it was, but I drew a picture of the object I saw.  A similar craft was seen by two girls in South Africa near this same time, or so I heard, on some UFO show on television on the History Channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had just done a radio check with range control to let them know everything was ok (that is why I remeber the time so well)anyway I pulled my poncho up over my whole body because of the bugs attacking me, and the next thing I know my poncho is pulled off of me and I see what would be called a typical &#34;Grey&#34; looking alien, except that his skin was more of an almond color (it was a very bright night with a full moon)standing over me with what looked like four others behind him.  What shocked me even more was that it talked to to me, but it sounded like one of those adult characters on the &#34;peanuts&#34; cartoons - like &#34;wha wha wha -wha wha etc.&#34; I remeber just becoming unglued and jumped up and started screaming when it talked to me and then it just disappeared along with the others- The other guy out there guarding ammo with me, woke up when he heard me scream and asked what was wrong - I told him what had just happened and he looked at me like I was crazy, I then noticed that it was 10:30pm, and I was like what the heck, I know that I did not fall asleep because it was my turn on radio watch, so I know that I did not dream this but cannot account for the missing time. I did not want to radio in what just happened for fear of getting a psych eval, even though an intruder near an ammunition dump is serious and should have been called in and the other Marine with me said that he was asleep the whole time and did not see or hear anything until i started screaming and jumping around.  Anyway I kept quiet about this incident for a few days but it was bothering me so much that finally about a week later I told a couple of my friends about it, and a good friend of mine that had been out there a day before, said that almost the same thing happened to him, except that he had chased into the ammo tent and when he was just about to shoot it, it just disappeared - he said that he was also afraid to say anything because he thought that people would think that he was crazy.  I never saw any bright lights or alien space craft - just the aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard about it after I saw this thing. I was laying out in the back yard observing the stars and watching for sattelites. The moon was pretty bright and had not long been up. I noticed two stars to the south that I had never seen befor. Then I noticed they were moving south to north and east of me. I then realized that there were three stars moving S to N. I first thought it was three sattilites or possibly aircraft moving. There was no sound.. and I had never seen three sattilites move in the same area like this befor. I called for my wife to get my binoculars. She did. By this time the three lights had formed a triangle east of me and were low on the horizon. I could not put all three lights in the field of view of the binoculars. I had to go from light to light. I then noticed that the triangle was really dark in the center and blocked out other stars as it passed S. to N. I then lost it as it moved to the north. It was not three objects. It was one BIG object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private investigator. I have been a policeman. I have been a cowboy and a mule packer, accoustomed to watching the sky for signes of weather. ect.<n>

By the time I got to my car, it was across the street over some houses and I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. It was big then with &#34;windows&#34; and lights along the sides (blue,white,green,red). The lights blinked in a type of sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to get into my car and drive home, taking a left out of the parking lot and heading to a stop light where I just stared and couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.

Driving along a &#34;country&#34; road in a feild that runs parrallel to the ocean, shoreline which is about 100 yards to our left. It was clear out. I noticed out over Frenchman&#39;s Bay a copper colored glowing dot, just above the water,about a mile away. Then the &#34;dot&#34; was moving, appeared to be flying like a plane tward the shore, and us. It had blinking colored lights, green, blue, but still copper orange like flames surrounding. I pulled the jeep over and said &#34; Is that a plane on fire?&#34; to the two girls that were with me. Then the &#39;dot&#39; turned bright white reflecting a path of light on the water tward shore. The moon was out and was reflecting on the water as well, though it was candle yellow and very dim compared to this thing. I then thought it was spotlights from a helicopter, because the object was moving to slowly to be a plane. It had reached the shore, at the most 150 yards away from us, about 75 feet off the ground. I shut the jeep off and unrolled my window to listen, expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter. The girls got nervous exclaiming, &#34;What are you doing?!&#34; The object was silent aproching from the left, up a treeline forming the edge of the feild, close to the tree tops. We sat silent as the object crossed the road directly in front of us, just above the powerlines. It was close enough that I had to lean forward and look up in my seat to see it. It was bright white like oncomming car headlights, as it crossed and went out of sight in the trees to our right. We didn&#39;t really say much, we were just bewilderd. I started the jeep and we drove about two miles up the road to drop one of the girls off at her house. The house was directly beside the road. As she was getting out of the car she said &#34; Youguys, get out and look at this.&#34; The object we had just seen cross the road was right above, and behind us so we couldn&#39;t see it while driving. It was as close to the trees as it could be. We stood in the road, as it aproached, then was directly above, going very slow. I could have hit it throwing a rock. Bright white from the front, underside, and rear. I may have been able to see up through the center of the craft, as though it were a doughnut shape, but I&#39;m not shure. The object appeared to have &#34;geometric framing&#34;, or narrow beams connecting in weird patterns around the perimeter. I walked with it 100 feet down the road, looking back at the girls, which shone no light on them. I was still nearly under the thing holding out my bare arm showing no light, yet it was so bright that when you looked at it, it was shrouded in light. The craft went down the road above me making no noise. I was holding my breath, and turning my head to listen, and I might have heard the slight wirring of machinery, or hum of electricity. But it was to insignifigant to say. The craft went down the road 100 yards and turned back tward the water. We ran out front of the girl&#39;s house to see out over the water, though we did not see the Craft.<n>

The size, height it was flying, &amp; speed it was moving was so unbelievable that I pulled over on the shoulder, got out of my truck &amp; watched as slowly passed overhead from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe there were 3-4 other vehicles that stopped &amp; watched in amazement as well.  The object was triangular in shape with a bright light at each point, it flew at maybe 15-20mph I would est &amp; it made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew slightly higher than the tree tops, low enough I remember thinking I could hit it with a slingshot. The craft was so close u could easily see that it was a solid, metallic object, not a balloon or blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was the most amazing to me.  It had to be something like 300-400 ft in width &amp; length. I&#39;ve never seen anything that looked Like what I seen, the size that it was, that could move at that slow of a speed &amp; ! stay airborne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told numerous friends &amp; family about this event, from moments after it happened to yrs later.  I never reported it due to my not being able to comprehend what it was I saw, how can I report it publicly without being laughed at.  I only do this now after seeing a program about the phoenix lights, &amp; when they showed a picture, it was almost like I was there on the side of the road again.  It was the same object I watched pass directly over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were  mesmerized, but I just got a computer and didn&#39;t know of anywhere I could disciss it until now. I would appreciate any information anyone haas had on a similiar experience. Thank You...<n>

My girlfriend and I were stopped at a stop sign facing East.  It was close to dusk, the sun had droped behind the mountians, I didn&#39;t need the cars headlights to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a slow moving craft that I thought was a B-2.  As soon I looked, I knew the craft was not a Aircraft that was known to me.  I just sat there slack jawed, my girlfriend said something like &#34;go, it&#39;s clear!&#34;, I just pointed head at the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving slow and I precieved low, appox 500-800 feet.  It was about 5 thumbs wide when over head. I&#39;ve worked at an airport and can judge speed fairly close, my best guess is that the craft was woving at about 50-75 mph. when the the craft came close to overhead I shut off the cars motor, the craft was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen and heard the F-117 in flight at about 100 feet,  I&#39;ve refueled civilian and military aircraft of all makes.  I know how conventional aircraft sound and what they look like in flight, this was NO conventional aircraft. It was black, with a light color circle at each point (not lite up), it traveled east to west directly over the city and was in view for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

8/1/96 12:00|Sandy|UT|Light|5 minutes|Bright blue light against a blue cloudless sky, at high noon.|5/2/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28618.html|79|ndxe199608| Bright blue light against a blue cloudless sky, at high noon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending in this report because I saw a very similar report filed by a person in 4/03, which seemed to be very uniqe and identical to what my son and I saw.  At exactly high noon on 08/01/96 my son, who was 17 at the time, came running downstairs wanting to know if I wanted to see a UFO.  I said, &#34;sure, Matt&#34;, as I had never seen one before.  By the time I got into our front yard, I saw Matt pointing up in the sky due south of Sandy, Utah, a suburb located south of Salt Lake City.  Matt&#39;s eyes were bugging out, and his arm pointed up at a bright blue light.  The weather was perfectly clear without a cloud in the sky, so this extremely bright, blue light was against a blue backround, but it was so bright it was easily observable.  It was the size of a pea if you held it out at arms length, and it appeared to be extremely high, although there were no reference points so it was hard to tell.  It was hovering, completely still.  All of a sudden, it started to come down at an astonishing speed, coming down in 45 degree angles, coming down in the shape of a Christmas tree.  Try to imagine the light coming down in the shape of ZZZZ stacked vertically.  It seemed to go from what could have been an altitude of 100,000 feet to approximately ground level in under five seconds, something no plane I have ever seen could do.  After being just above the ground for several seconds, it jetted back up to an extremely high altitude at a straight 45 degree angle, and just hovered.  At that time, I was standing in our front yard pointing up with my eyes bugging out.  The blue light hovered still for about two minutes.  I was so shocked, finally I told Matt to go in and get a pair of binocs.  However, before he could come back out, the blue light started to travel south, at a leisurely pace, due south over what may have been the town of Lehi, north of Provo, Utah.  Later that evening, my son and I went to a movie, and a child three rows in front of us pointed up at the ceiling, then made motions with his ! finger, imitating EXACTLY the flight pattern of this thing to his father.  So, obviously he saw it.  Unfortunately, I did not tell his father that we had seen exactly the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WE WERE CONTRACTORS FOR A LOCAL NEWSPAPER. WE WERE BETWEEN RESIDENCES AND WERE STAYING TEMPORARILY AT A LOCAL MOTEL IN INDEPENDENCE, MO. THERE WAS A 4-WAY STOPLIGHT ABOUT 1/4 MILE FROM THE HOTEL. THIS PART OF TOWN IS PARTICULARLY HILLY. AT ANY RATE, THE MOTEL DRIVEWAY WAS IN A VALLEY OF A LARGE HILL.I RECALL TELLING MY HUSBAND THAT NIGHT THAT ItSEEMED EERILY QUIET THIS NIGHT.THE AIR WAS STILL. AS WE TURNED ON OUR HEADLIGHTS AND CRESTED THE HILL OF THE INTERSECTION, WE SAW A VERY STRANGE SIGHT INDEED. FOR, HOVERING DIRECTLY ABOVE THE INTERSECTION, AND JUST RIGHT ABOVE THE POWERLINES AND TREES, SAT AN IDLE, LIGHTED TRIANGULAR-SHAPED CRAFT. ONE ANGLE SEEMED TO BE FACING DIRECTLY AT US. YOU MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT BEING ON A HILL, THIS THING SEEMED MONSTROUS. THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHT, YET NOT NEAR BLINDING, I LOOKED AT MY HUSBAND IN THE DRIVER&#39;S SEAT AND THE INSIDE OF OUR VAN LOOKED AS THOUGH FLOODED WITH DAYLIGHT. WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS WE REMAINED AT THE LIGHT, AS IF TO SILENTLY ASK EACH OTHER FOR REASSURANCE AT WHAT WE WERE BOTH SEEING. THE STRANGEST THING TO ME WAS THE DEADLY SILENCE. SOMEHOW IN ONE&#39;S MIND, A WHOLE TANGLE OF SNIPPETS OF REALITY ATTEMPT TO CONVEY THOUGHTS TO YOUR BRAIN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. WE BELIEVED ANY MECHANISM THIS ENORMOUS SIZE MUST BE OPERATED ON SOME KIND OF ENGINE, OR OTHER SOURCE OF POWERING. STILLNESS - NOT A SOUND. THE LIGHTS THEMSELVES FELT LIKE THEY WERE PENETRATING OUR VERY SOULS. WE FELT AS IF WE WERE NOT SO MUCH &#34;TARGETED&#34; FOR THIS MEETING AS MUCH AS WE FELT WE UNDULY INTERRUPTED WHATEVER THE MEANING OF IT&#39;S OCCUPANCY ABOVE THE EARLY MORNING INTERSECTION. THIS MADE US FEEL SOMEHOW, STRANGELY, GUILTY. WE FEEL THAT WHATEVER IT&#39;S PURPOSE, IT BECAME FOILED BY OUR PRESENCE. I STARTED FRANTICALLY YELLING &#34;GO THROUGH THE LIGHT, JUST GET AWAY FROM IT. GO....NOW!!&#34; MY HUSBAND LATER TOLD ME HE REFUSED TO MOVE THE VAN UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT FOR AN UNKNOWN FEAR. HE ALSO RELATED HE HAD AN URGE TO PUT IT IN REVERSE, AS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS THING. BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, IT DISAPPEARED HEADING west HWY 24 TOWARD THE TOWN PROPER. THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT LIKE A STREAM OF LIGHT, OR A WHISPING AWAY AS MUCH AS JUST VANISHING, SILENTLY, AS IT HOVERED EARLIER. WE WERE SPEECHLESS, STUNNED, AND THE DIGITAL CLOCK-RADIO IN OUR VAN WAS A SCRAMBLED DISPLAY. IN SILENCE, MY HUSBAND PROCEEDED DOWN M=291 HWY TOWARDS OUR NIGHTLY DESTINATION. I KEPT LOOKING UP AT THE SKY, WHICH SEEMED SLIGHTLY OVERCAST AND FOUND NO STARS. MY EYES ALSO KEPT CLOSE WATCH IN THE SIDE MIRROR. WHEN WE REACHED OUR POINT, WE LEARNED A ROUTINE 12 MIN DRIVE BECAME 2.5 HOURS.  IT WAS 4:30 WHEN WE ARRIVED. WE CALL IT A &#34;TIME WARP&#34; FOR LACK OF ANY FURTHER LOGIC, AND IT SEEMS TO BE A TOPIC OF INTERESTED CONVERSATION ONCE IN A WHILE BETWEEN US, YET FOR THE MOST PART, WE ARE EACH JUST REMINDED SILENTLY WITHIN OURSELVES OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SUMMER OF 1996, THAT REMAIN WITH NO ANSWERS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report taken by MIG, the Missouri Investigators Group. www.ufomig.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

It was clear and warm out and very dark due to no lights. Driving along the road we were passing a field. The very second we past this dark field, I notice a extremly bright light. It appeared to me as the field was on fire. I mentioined this to my ex and she viewed the same thing. I slowed the car and viewed the bright object rise slowly above the lining of trees at the edge of the fields. The object then appeared to be turning in a counter clockwise motion. Each time it turned it was like a series of lights flashing. The object continued to rise right above the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both I and my Ex was terrified and I sped away as quick as my car was able to go. The object disappeared in the view of my mirrors and I returned home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife and I were laying in bed watching television.  Our bedroom was located on the second floor of the house with a sliding glass door leading to a second floor sun deck looking over our back yard.  At our fence line there is another back yard a home then a street and then a green way with power lines running down the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight I got up to turn the television off and close the sliding glass door.  I turned off the TV which darkned the room.  I turned to close the door and about 150 yards away there was a huge object with colored lights just sitting above the power lines.  The lights were not extremely bright but the object was clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my wife come here fast.  The best way to describe the object is oval shaped.  Smooth on top and bottom with an area in between.   On both sides the top and bottom came together and were rounded downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began a slow 360 degree turn.   We could clearly make out windows, and what looked like tubes and barrels stuck to the sides of the craft in the area between windows and the top and bottom.  I guess you could describe it as plumbing.  The window were lit soft white but I could not see in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was probably three football fields across.  I remember thinking I wish I had a video camera this thing was there and right in front of us.   We could see it perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It finished it&#39;s 360 degree turn about 50 feet above the power lines and then just shot away at about a 2:00 angle and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green way is located on SW Johnson Street between 209th Ave and Cornelius Pass rd. in Aloha Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides an e-mail address which is flawed.
