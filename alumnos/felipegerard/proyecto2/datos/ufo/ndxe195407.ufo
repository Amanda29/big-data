I was too young (about 7 1/2 years old at the time) to remember the exact month however, I know that it was warm because my parents took my sister and I to the local drive-in movie theater.  This theater was located in the town of Bridge Hampton.    Bridgehampton is located to the east of Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The orientation of the screen was so that the patrons of the theater were facing west towards Brookhaven.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear and warm with a spattering of stars in the sky.  The contrast between the screen and the night sky was stark.  The sky over the screen was jet black except for the stars.  I really don&#39;t have an idea of what time that it was however, I would have to say that it was probably between 9:30 and 10:00pm.  The object was only observed for less then a second however, it appeared as a Bright yellow white light (about as bright as the planet saturn).  The object moved straight down at a high rate of speed until it disappeared.  It was in a dive of about 170 degrees.  The object oscillated or zig-zagged down behind the movie screen.  The sighting was swift yet did give a clear image of the light and its rapidly zig-zagging movement.  The reason that I associate this sighting with Brookhaven is because it was definitely in the direction of Brookhaven or West Hampton that had a mmilitary airbase that is still in use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/54 21:00|Oakdale|NY|Disk|45 seconds|Three highly luminesce objects in a "V" formation gliding through the black night sky.|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24522.html|4|ndxe195407| Three highly luminesce objects in a &#34;V&#34; formation gliding through the black night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a summers night back in 1954, I was just a kid. My father was working outside and I was hanging out with him, when it got dark my mother called me into the house to get ready for bed. I had been in the house for just a few minutes when my father burst into the house yelling &#34;Everyone come outside quick you have to see this&#34;. I ran out the front door after my father and followed him to the end of our walk. He stopped and turned back towards the house and dropped to his knee,grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around. There to the right of our house up in the black night sky were 3 luminus disc shaped objects traveling from East to West very slowly. I became so scared I ran back into the house at full speed with my father right behind me. He was trying to catch me to bring me back out to watch the lights but his foot steps behind me scared me even more. As I entered the living room he grabbed me and picked me up and said &#34; you have to see this you may never see anything like this again in your life&#34;. He took me back outside and made me watch. The lights were behind the house by then so we moved to the driveway to the left of the house. There they were 3 pulsing discs glowing brightly gliding through the sky, silent, silhouetting the trees that were between us and the objects. A calm came over me as my father set me on the ground, as I watched the 3 objects I noticed something dropping out of the back of them it reminded me of the tinsel we put on our Christmas tree. This tinsel like substance was also glowing as it dropped out the back but soon disappeared a few feet under the objects. I just stood in awe watching them now really starting to study them I noticed that as they pulsed at the dimmest part of the pulse that you could almost see through them like they were semi-transparent. They flew along and finally disappeared behind a wooded area out of sight. Then as I stood there in somewhat of a trance I was startled by the sound of the night insects, the katy-did&#39;s and the like, all starti! ng their sounds together. It was then that I had realized that they too had been in a trance and were silent untill the objects were gone. It was a very strange night to say the least and till this day I have never witnessed anything quite like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My mother, our next door neigbor&#39;s wife, and myself, were standing outside in our barnyard/driveway. I was working on an old bicycle near my mother while she was having a conversation with our neighbor. I noticed an object in the sky (estimate to be at 1500 feet altitude and quarter mile away). I pointed it out to my mother and neighbor, and for at least three or four minutes we discussed it while watching what it was doing. We actually stopped looking at it for a few seconds, continued talking, looked back up to watch it some more but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects revelent appearence to us was that of a cigar shape. Brown in color but with an light orange glow about it. After a minute or so, the glow changed to an obvious large fire ball around it(around it horizonally only, not over the top or bottom), swirling fire with lots of black smoke swirling around it as well. The object stood perfectly still in the air and made no sound that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We commented to each other that it must be some new military test device because we had never seen nor heard of any aircraft like that. We never could come to any uneducated idea as to how it could burn so profusely (black smoke and fire)and not be damaged nor fall from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/54 11:00|Philadelphia|PA|Disk|1 hour|I saw 2 alabaster white perfectly round objects over our ball field as they hovered over us for about an hour ,then they were gone.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42333.html|6|ndxe195407| I saw 2 alabaster white perfectly round objects over our ball field as they hovered over us for about an hour, then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of approx 1954 we were playing ball in our local school yard. I was at bat &amp; looked out toward the wall in deep center field. The outfield wall was a side wall of a School Bldg. At the top of the approx 3 story Bldg wall I noticed an object seemingly not far above the School bldg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A perfectly round pure alabaster white object.It gleamed so white ,like nothing I ever saw before.We stopped the game &amp; watched it for quite some time.It sat &amp; sat, not a sound. After about 15-20 mins it very slowly moved NWest about a few City blocks without any noise of an engine, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving a couple mins it stopped &amp; sat again for a few minutes.It then appeared to go directly West into a nearby cloud. It was gone. A minute later it came out from the cloud &amp; it had a matching partner that sat close to it. They both moved back near the direction of the School yard, moving slowly &amp; quietly &amp; seemingly not too high up. They sat for about 5 minutes near us, then moved due North slowly until they were some distance away from us. Possibly 3 blocks away. All of a sudden they both bolted out of sight so fast that in seconds they disappeared.Still not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many of the guys acted as if we saw nothing. I believe they were upset &amp; didn&#39;t want to face that we just saw two UFO&#39;s. They&#39;d say they were clouds,etc. About 6 or 8 of us had no doubt what we saw. Needless to say we never finished that ball game after that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough that night the Air Force sent some recruiters to the school yard to see if they could sign up some of the older guys that hung out at the school yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought they were coming to talk to us. When we went up to them with our story of what happened about 7 hours ago, they just &#34;poohed&#34; us off as some kids that were making up stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw the ABC TV Special about sightings &amp; felt that I had to tell you of my experience. Only my family knows &amp; I believe they think I made up the story because they don&#39;t believe. I know what I saw. This is a true story &amp; I had to tell someone else &amp; your operation seems to be a perfect outlet for my information sharing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though it has been many years since my sighting I assume any information may help your research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose I may be one of the only guys still around that was at the sighting. I&#39;m retired now &amp; older &amp; spent most of my like involved in Civic/Youth Sports Activities &amp; worked in Retail-Mgmt &amp; also worked many years in the Insurance business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

For a period of 4 days a saucer was seen directly over the 38 parallel in Korea.  The military had it on radar and said it&#39;s altitude was 40,000 feet. People at that point could see it from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 4 days air force jets were sent up to get a closer look, but not to fire at it.  As they reached about 20,000 feet, the saucer lifted up to 80,000, an altitude that the jets could not achieve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed at that altitude for another 3 days.  It was calculated to be 900 feet across -- and then just disappeared.  How can government deny existance of such info.

I feel it should be recorderd somewhere. My friend and I used to take time-lapse photos of the stars and he was a member of the Civil Air Patrol. We were in the backyard and watching for meteors when we saw a &#34;star&#34; traveling  from the north horizon to the zenith. It was approximatly the same brightness as Vega.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very high and traveling very fast. It was at a very high altitude or very small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. The most important part of the sighting was that when it reached straight up from us, (almost perpendicular), it made a 90 degree turn.It did not slow down, it did not describe an arc, it made a pinpoint turn like you would draw with a triangle on paper. Given what we knew at the time about aircraft and the &#34;g&#34; force that would be experienced inside an aircraft, it scared us back into the house. I have never been able to forget what we saw and I have yet to see any human technology that could do what we saw. I swear this is true and hope it might be of some interest to you. I can&#39;t write this in one sentence, sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

7/1/54 22:00|Los Angeles|CA|Circle|15 seconds|In 1954, I saw a red glowing disc traveling thousands of mph straight over the Los Angeles night sky.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96081.html|11|ndxe195407| In 1954, I saw a red glowing disc traveling thousands of mph straight over the Los Angeles night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 years old in 1947 and lived in south central Los Angeles at the time of the &#34;flying saucer&#34; siting.  It was night time and my friend and I saw a red glowing disk traveling at enormous speeds, southeast to northwest over Los Angeles. The flying saucer was very high in a super clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a college graduate and worked for Lockheed Martin Corp. for 39 years and retired 3 years ago.  I&#39;m 69.  I&#39;m an amateur astronomer and I am familiar with the night sky, stars and planets.  I would call myself a &amp;quot;trained observer&amp;quot; having lived near airports and now near Cape Canaveral, Florida where missiles commonly take off.  I was also in the Air Force with the Hayward National Guard in California.  My point is that I know what I am looking at and can judge speed and altitude as well as identify night time objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always described the flying saucer I saw as a looking like a round red Ford tail light of the 1950s traveling at an altitude above 30,000 feet and probably much higher (70,000 feet or more).  So, I estimate the flying saucer was at least twice the size of a modern airliner at 30,000 feet, bigger if it was higher.  The glowing red &#34;saucer&#34; appeared to be a perfect disk, not a ball.  The glowing red disk had no other features.  As I say, the speed of the round red disk was enormous flying horizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds at an extremly high altitude plastered against the roof one of the best night skys I have ever seen which is why my friend and I were looking up at the time.  We caught site of the glowing red disk about 30 degrees above the horizon to the southeast and watched it disappear to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My date of the siting is approximate as to month and time, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was 1954 judging by the events going on in my life at the time.  It was a warm summer evening, and I was taking my friend home on the handle bars of my bicycle at the time as we were marveling at the clarity of the night sky and the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason that I believe it was a &#34;flying saucer&#34; is because no aircraft of the times in 1954 or now could even begin to match the speeds of this object.  This red glowing disk left no trail like a fireball meteor which I have also seen.  It just zipped across the L.A. night sky in a straight line horizon to horizon in a matter of seconds never losing its circular (disk-like) shape or losing speed or altitude.  It left no trail or emited sound.  If I was going to guess at the speed and altitude of the flying saucer I saw, I would say it was flying at 70,000 feet or more at speeds of tens of thousands of miles per hour.  This was not a common site in 1954 or even now with our rockets and satellites which I am also very familiar with having worked for Lockheed Corp and living now near Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Nothing in our arsenal of jets and rockets flys anywhere near as fast the flying saucer I saw that summer night in 1954.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

7/1/54 21:00|St. Louis Airport (Lambert Field)|MO|Oval|20 sec.|EXTREMELY bright, red oval near airport.  Object suddenly accelerates and STREAKS over horizon.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08793.html|12|ndxe195407| EXTREMELY bright, red oval near airport.  Suddenly accelerates and STREAKS over horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fairly certain of the year of the incident (1954), although I am guessing at the month, even though I believe the incident occurred during the hot part of the summer of 1954.  I remember the year, because I was sitting in the passenger seat of our family car, a 1953 Studebaker.  I was six years of age at the time of the sighting. My mother, my older brother (10 yrs.), and I (age 6 yrs.) were attending a movie at the Airway Drive-in Theater, situated on the southwest edge of the St. Louis airport (Lambert Field).  The theater used to be located south of the main east-west runway, directly across the airport from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, approximately where the Missouri Air National Guard building currently sits today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as the three of us were watching the movie, it came to our attention that some kind of disturbance had begun to brew at the theater.  We didn&#39;t know what was taking place, but I seem to recall we could hear people shouting.  I remember looking around to my right side to look at the concession stand, located toward the center rear part of the parking spaces, but could see nothing that appeared unusual. At about the time I looked back toward the screen, people started walking in front of our car, and they were looking, and perhaps pointing, up to our right.  I looked out the right passenger&#39;s window, and immediately witnessed a generally oval shape, EXTREMELY brightly luminous, red object hovering virtually motionless in the sky.  I vaguely recall that the object may have been casting a faint red light over the theater and surrounding area. The object&#39;s apparent size (from my vantage point) was approximately from 50% to 100% the diameter of the moon, and its long axis appeared to be horizontally oriented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be moving generally to the north, but almost imperceptibly slowly, perhaps even not at all. It gave the appearance of simply hovering motionless in the sky. Suddenly, the object accelerated to the north, perhaps passing directly over the airport, and disappeared within 2-3 seconds over the horizon to the north!  The object covered approximately 90 degrees of arc, viewed from my vantage point on the ground, in that amount of time, and appeared to fly in a somewhat straight line, perhaps with slight deviation from a perfectly straight-line course. I seem to recall that my father may have viewed the event from the control tower, which prior to June 30, 1956, was located on the north side of the airport. Whenever my family gets together, we always talk about that event.  Our minds seem drawn to it!  My brother, now a physician, remembers it very clearly, as does my mother. That object was BIZARRE!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now Director of the National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.  I am reasonably certain that the incident occurred during the summer of 1954, but not positive.
