I was laying on a pullout sleeper couch with my girlfriend. She looked up and saw a light through the blinds. she asked me what it was. I reached up and opened the blinds and saw 2 red/orange lights attached to a huge object floating very slowly over the tree tops. I immediately got up and ran outside, trying to wake up everyone in the house as I ran. It came over the top of the house as I ran out the front door. It had bracket looking symbols on the bottom *[   ]* with the lights on either side of it. the top and bottom of the brackets were bent at about 45 degrees as opposed to the 90 degree brackets. This craft was about the size of the house and didn&#39;t make a sound I never saw the &#34;top&#34; of it only the bottom. I ran underneath it and it was very close as I got to the street I picked up a stone and threw it at the craft. I never heard the stone hit the craft nor did I hear the stone land. The craft flew North until it went over the hill and outran me. Even when I was viewing it from behind as it flew away I did not see a top on it. I went back inside and no one woke up. No one heard me yelling for them to wake up either. I spoke with my girlfriend and asked her why she didn&#39;t come outside. She said she was scared. I thought about the stone and the fact that no one heard me yelling and thought that the craft had some kind of noise canceling technology on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

8/23/93 19:56|Laramie (east of)|WY|Changing|9 minutes|Cloud-like object at extreme range changes shape.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32770.html|4|ndxe199308| Cloud-like object at extreme range changes shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account is taken from a personal report made shortly after the sighting:  &#34;I was driving westbound on Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie, Wyoming when I spied what I at first thought to be a tiny cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky.  Very soon after sighting it, we passed from Laramie County (containing Cheyenne) into Albany County (containing Laramie).  The heavens were still bright (sunset had been at 19:39).  The only other object in the sky was the first-quarter Moon.  The &#34;cloud&#34; had an almost vertical orientation at first, and apparently hung over the Vedauwoo area (a formation of exposed granite mountains east of Laramie).  After a minute or so, the &#34;cloud&#34; took on more of a spherical shape but later did resume its near-vertical attitude for a short while.  As I drove toward the very bright object at 65 mph, it only seemed to get further away, more starlike, and closer to the horizon, until I lost it at about 20:05, some nine minutes after first noticing it.&#34;  The most likely explanation for this sighting is a high-altitude westbound aircraft reflecting the rays of the Sun and emitting a short contrail.  But it might have been something less conventional.  It certainly impressed me enough at the time to record the details, even though I am a licensed pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/20/93 23:30|Lancaster (Saddleback Butte Park)|CA|Triangle|2 minutes|there was a meteor shower that we went to watch at the park. three triangle shaped craft passed by 500 - 1000 feet overhead|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04115.html|6|ndxe199308| there was a meteor shower that we went to watch at the park. three triangle shaped craft passed by 500 - 1000 feet overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working at air force plant 42,site 4, on the B-2 bomber in Palmdale, ca. I went with friends to watch a meteor shower in the desert. It was late at night and we could hear normal night desert sounds. We were all watching the falling stars when one person noticed lights slowly approaching. As the lights neared us we saw three triangle shaped craft flying in a triangle formation. The craft were (RAM?)black, with three lights on each one. I do not remember which lights were red and which were white, but each craft had red and white lights on the 3 points. The craft were 500 to 1000 feet above us as they went past. They were moving at about 350 mph judging by how low they were and how long it took them to pass. They were completely silent, as they passed we still heard the desert night sounds. there were no car engines running or lights on,(so I do not know if they would have had any effect on them,) as we were all watching the sky. Most of us they worked at the air force plant and held security clearances,  but none of us had ever seen any craft like that before. We were all used to watching fighters and bombers fly by, so were used to judging aircraft size and speed. We had never saw an aircraft that was a perfect triangle float past us at 350 mph though! They flew/floated overhead and vanished in the distance. The profile of the craft were very low. We saw the light before we saw the craft and the craft outline vanished before the lights disappeared. We were used to seeing F117 fighters, and these were not shaped like them. I worked briefly on the first F22&#39;s and they were not flying yet. Besides, both of these craft make a lot of noise and cannot glide that long and that low without power. This craft was powered by magnetics or atomic/nuclear fuel. There was no exhaust vents visible on the trailing edge of any of the three craft. It was probably 11:30 at night and as they passed no heat from them distorted any stars behind them as they passed. I heard of Art Bell seeing a single triangle craft abou! t the same time, or a bit after we saw these three. The artists rendition of his craft on his web page makes the craft way to big. They were all three the size of an F15 or F16, not any bigger than that. I realize this happened in 1993, and it is now 1998, but I told the story to people I worked with when I was transferred from Palmdale to Everett, Wa. Those people could vouch that I told them about it in 1993. Besides, I did not know who else would care, as it was not the classic round ball of light or flying saucer sighting, and we did not have any camera&#39;s.<n>

I was looking around the constealation Orion when i spotted a hovering yellowish orange oval.  About 2 seconds later the oval suddenly moved in a westernly direction streaking almost as fast as i could turn my head and move my eyes. The oval then shot southward and out of my point of view.<n>

I lived in a house about 2 miles outside of the town of Muncie,Indiana. 80,000 people. I was passing the municiple airport, and saw an object hovering, only 20 feet above a 1 story house, which sat right next to a large subdivision of about 400 homes. Object was less than 1 mile from airport. I drove towards it, in my truck. When I got within 500 feet, I turned my lights off and drove, staring at this object. I came within 300 feet when I realized it made absolutely no sound. It rose about 30 feet, then took off towards the northwest sky and dissapeared in seconds. All without a sound. Object had three lights on the bottom. Red,green,blue. Thought it was a chopper at first. But why hover silenlty, 20 feet over a house, and then take off from a dead stop, to out of sight in 3 seconds? Sonic booms are common in this area, but this was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thats the best way to explain it. It happened so fast that if my crewman and I hadn&#39;t been looking we would have missed it completly. We had just completed work on a light on the snake river and were traveling by boat to the boat ramp behind one of the dams (I can&#39;t remember which one) it was just the two of us on the river and we were trying to reach the ramp before it got to dark. We both looked up to our 10 o&#39;clock posn at about posn angle 30 degrees and this object appeared. I can&#39;t say with any certainty the distance or how big the object was, but it was close enough to see that it was dark gray and elongated (like a fat short cigar). We just looked at each other and said, &#34;What the heck was that?&#34;. The trip back to Kennewick we tossed around ideas as to what it might be but ultimately failed to come up with anything. It was like the thing opened a hole in the sky, entered our &#34;realm&#34;, paused, then left through another opening. There were no lights, no sound, no trailing vapor, no other aircraft, nothing. In fact if I hadn&#39;t been looking right at it I would have dismissed it altogether. Sky conditions were clear, visibility was 10nm, seas were calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/20/93 12:30|Bowling Green|KY|Disk|40 seconds|Disc shaped object over KY skies no lights or sounds and plainly visible that it wasn't convensional aircraft.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24160.html|11|ndxe199308| Disc shaped object over KY skies no lights or sounds and plainly visible that it wasn&#39;t convensional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only writing this because I have kept this a secret for almost 10 years now. I don&#39;t care who actually believes what I have seen but I have to let this out now. I was asleep beside a window on a second story. From where I lay I can see 3/4 of the sky and the other part was blocked by a green leafy tree like an oak. The apartment is in the city and lights from the city stop you from seeing any stars that arent bright. I woke up and looked out the window and froze. I saw what appeard to be a perfectly smooth disc. There were no lights on it like many people see only the light from the city reflecting off the bottom. I thought a baloon or an aircraft but I was shortly proven wrong. The object stayed only in my view as if I were meant to see it theres no other way for me to explain it. That fact alone scared me stiff because its altitude wasn&#39;t very high only within a few thousand feet maybe two football field lengths no more than 3. It moved from right to left in a line then up to the top of my view and then back down as if it had made an L movement. It stopped and lowered quite a bit. The disc got larger and then it rose back up, higher this time. It made a last move to the top of my view and back down then back toward the country side at the right of my view where it had started from originally. I was frozen completely through the duration and couldn&#39;t speak above a whisper. I had tried to wake my brother up but I couldn&#39;t speak. Through the whole incident there was not a single sound from the object. When it left I was unfrozen and then immediately jumped from my bed across the small room to my brothers bed and woke him up. I told him I had seen a UFO. He believed me and quickly we ran down stairs and out on the lawn to see if it would return. It never did. Wether it was extraterestrial or military I don&#39;t know. It seemed to be practicing manuvering more than traveling to a destination. Even though it has been so long, I can still draw the exact portrait of what I saw. I will never forget it as l! ong as I live yet maybe now I can rest easier. If you would like to ask me more I guess you can find me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft would periodically flash a bluish-white light as it sort of hovered around.  The thing wasn&#39;t going fast enough to be an airplane, and the way it dropped altitude one time didn&#39;t seem like a helicopter, either.  It more floated than flew.  I did not hear any sound, but I was in a moving 11-passenger van.  The object, which was very bright, was only a couple hundred yards away, and mostly red.  After turning north onto I-25, I saw the same or similar object a few minutes later, moving south.&#34;  I didn&#39;t stop to investigate the craft more closely, since I had passengers to deliver back to Wyoming, all of whom seemed to ignore the object.  I did not mention it to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/15/93 23:30|Haarlem (Netherlands)||Formation|approx. 15 min.|Two circles of white 'cloudy' balls (rotating in opposite directions), no sound.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29640.html|14|ndxe199308| Two circles of white &#39;cloudy&#39; balls (rotating in opposite directions), no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After working, when I cycled home along the long street I was then living in, I noticed a formation of balls, that mooved ahead of me (about a 100 meters) in the same speed as I cycled. It seemed to me that the hight was about 10 meters. The formation floated over the trees at the right site of the street. There was no sound. There was no wind that night. It was about 17 degrees Celcius. The formation was made of completely round balls in two circles. The balls in the inner circle were bigger as the balls in the outer circle. They were &#39;made of&#39; white smoke or clouds (misty?). When I reached my house and stopped, the formation also stopped mooving and I watched it for quite some time. The inner circle rotated slowly in the opposite direction as the outer circle. I looked around if one of the neighbours was still awake, in order to ask somebody if I was imagining this event, but I saw no lights burning. I had to feed my pats and so I entered the house. In the backgarden I tried to find the formation in the sky, but couldn&#39;t find it. When I left my house again, the formation was gone. I felt uncomfortable. I cycled back to the centre of town to meet my husband and friends and told them what I saw. I could not give an explanation and realised that I had seen a UFO. One friend told about lasershows, projecting light on clowds, but I was sure I had not seen something like that. A few months later I saw a show like that and this was something completely different. About a year back I saw a picture on Discovery Channel of a UFO that was seen in (if I remember well) Australia, simular to what I had seen. This is the first time I report my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was with my mom and bro, I was probably around 6, my bro 11.  I guess there was a meteor shower or something so we took a drive out to nowhere, just desert with mountains in the distant, this kind of setting may be hard to find now but remember this was 10 years ago  :P .  So keep the picture in your head I want you to see exactly what we did.. we are coming home from stargazing now and all you see is flat, kinda sandy, dirt everywhere... a straight rode in front of you and mountains on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alright so we were driving straight ahead, no other cars on the road and we came across these water pump things and hovering over them was a huge craft!  The best way I can describe this thing was it looked like a stereotypical saucer. The kind of things you would see in cartoons...a saucer shape, with the glass kind of bubble on top, black all the way around it and blinking lights on the sides. The lights blinking though is the thing that confuses us the most because the colors of the lights were red, white and blue....government craft??? We have no clue... Now you wont believe this but it was within I&#39;d say 100 yards away from us on the left side of the road!! And so you get a feeling of what we saw, it wasnt &#34;a light in the sky&#34;.. it was like...imagine standing in your driveway and looking across the street at the house on the other side.. only hovering about 50 yards off the ground. thats the best way i can describe the distance away from us and the size of this thing. And it made NO NOISE!!!  We just drove slowly along, staring at it, and it was going the same speed as us in the same direction, I guess following us in curiosity..or wanted to kill us :P  And so we were in awe, we had no clue what to think or do at the moment,  and I was only 6 so I got out of my seat in the back of the van and crawled in between the two front seats. Then out of nowhere the thing literally was behind the mountains that were way off in the distance in 2 seconds!!   So obviously we sped down the road to get a look behind the mountains and it wasnt there, I still cant believe what we saw to this day.. I really wish others could have seen it. Since then Its hard not to look up every 5 seconds :P<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking around enjoying the beautiful scenery when I noticed an object circling a cone shaped mountain to the east. The object was white, no lights, and appeared kite like,  the absolute shape was not identifiable because it didn&#39;t appear symetrical. At the distance I was at, the object would have appeared about a half an inch in an outstretched hand. It went round and round the cone in a sort of strange floating motion. The movement had characteristics like paper falling with that rocking back and forth motion or side to side motion, except this object wasn&#39;t falling. The object remained in a relatively horizontal flight path as the mean, but deviated up and down from the mean. I watched it circle several times and then disappear behind the mountain.<n>

I was looking out through space because the night was crystal clear even though there was a lot of heat lightning over the sea.I was listening to my car radio and lying on the hood of my car when I noticed one of the stars ( I was attempting a trial of astral projection)had suddenly left its place in the sky and moved to another location.This upset me a little because I am inteligent and believe that it is perfectly possible for something to travel through space to another planet.So I left my post for a little while and drove a couple of blocks to an all night convenient store for a pack of cigarettes.I was much calmer at this point and was beginning to forget the whole thing when I noticed a sensation of being completely alone as I was driving back to the parking lot.It seemed like I could here the crickets humming from miles away and the sound of my own heartbeat was clearly audible.I parked the car got out and started my patrol around the condo.I was just starting to round the corner when I notised a little fog was visible and I could see the parking lot lights.Suddenly I noticed from my left someting approching at a very slow speed through the light fog.I remember thinking I hope this is a flock of pelicans but unfortunately it was not. I saw a ship at an altitude of about 20 &#39; traveling less than 30 mph moving across the parking lot.I noticed the design had to be alien because of its overall shape being unlike anything of the earth my experience coming from being in the army and my father who worked for Grumman corp.The cockpit was like anondized metal black and opaque like some kind of energy absorbing substance.I believe the color of the ship was subdued green. The wings were delta shaped and! bent do wnword  away from the fuselage.It was almost past when I noticed engines and ports situated in back and tucked under the wings.Just the a tremendouse muffled blast came out of the engines and I could follow its tightly twisted vapor trail till the object was completely out of site way way out into space in about 10 seconds.THere is much more too be told about ie. its physical effects on myself but I have run out of time for now.<n>

When we both noticed a single light appear in the sky pretty far out. it looked like a spot light at first , yet it had no glow to it. we sat there observing this light for about 5 min. when i said to my friend that i think it is coming in our direction. that was exactly what was happening. this object was heading right for us and about 5 min more it had reached our field of vision. my friend got scared and ran towards the house front door but stayed outside. i on the other hand was fixated on this thing going slowly towards my direction. it appeared to be about 15-20 ft above. moving extremely slow. the light appeared to be on the upper part of it. i&#39;m guessing it was about 10 - 20 ft infront of us when the light moved behind it. this object continued towards us. it went right over us it appeared triangular on the bottom but it wasn&#39;t sharp edges, sort of round. no light reflected from it and when it was directly over us i saw what i thought was some form of energy movement from underneath it. which appeared rusty reddish in color with a dull illumination. it had a pattern swirling in the center and shooting in the opposite direction of the nose or the point of the object. it appeared to be a dark object with no reflection of any kind and no noise of any kind. the object was approximatly 15 ft long and about 10 feet wide at its bottom. it appeared to be flat on the bottom but not ontop, sort of dome like. we both watched this thing for about 30 to 40 min until it was way out there. then we saw two other lights moving from two other areas and all three were meeting up towards the same point then they all shot up at extremely fast speed into space. this is the closest to a ship i&#39;ve been but ive seen something else really close too cant really say what it was but can describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Cloverdale is situated 90 miles north of San Francisco, at the north end of Sonoma county it is surrounded by rolling hills and vineyards.  The geyser’s (at one time the world’s largest geothermal power plant) sits about sixteen miles to the east.  This area was considered sacred ground by the Indians of the area and they made trips there for healing and ceremonial rites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father worked at the geysers for about twenty years.  During his many night shifts he and others had seen several un explainable lights in the sky.  During the early nineties the area known as the geysers, along the borders of Lake, Sonoma, and Napa counties was known as a UFO hotspot.  I had many sightings alone and with other people beginning around 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular event happened in the summer of 1992, along the road to the geysers at roughly 3 am.  I was with two friends C and G who were parked along the side of the road.  We were on a slight bluff overlooking Geyser’s creek, facing up the river valley towards the east and the geysers.  Suddenly C. or G. said, &#34;What’s that?&#34;   There was a super bright white/blue stroboscopic light, blinking two or three times a second heading just towards us from up stream.  The light appeared suddenly from a hill around a bend in the river.  It was slowly following the path of the creek, at a very low altitude and slower than a plane. It was lower than the tops of the hillsides on either side of the river valley, maybe 100 feet high…  It kept getting closer and closer and all I could see was the light blinking almost hypnotically…  The light was so bright that one couldn’t make out a shape.  It was as if there were no craft, but only a light. Eventually the light reached where we were and passed us just above the tree tops and disappeared behind the hill to the west.  It was heading in the direction of town… It floated by extremely close, within a hundred yards or so and we all noticed that it didn’t make any sound… none… zero… if it had been a plane or a helicopter or whatever we would have heard it the entire time we saw it, it was that close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets weirder.   My friends (who themselves are avid ufo observers) got in their car and turned around to try and follow it.  I was left alone with my truck.  I went to relieve myself  behind my truck, feeling quite dismayed by what we had just seen.  All of a sudden I heard a sound that seemed to be the birds in the trees chirping in unison!  Now this is at three in the morning when birds do not chirp.  Suddenly, the chirping became louder and so intense that I could feel the vibrations turning my stomach, not unlike when at a concert, the bass rattles your pant leg.  Although this was an otherworldly sensation, the chirping was at such a vibratory wavelength that it made me feel as if my head were going to implode…  I almost fell to my knees from its force… slowly it faded, sounding like a cross between a flute and a whistle.  That is the closest description I have of the sound….<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It is a very twisty winding road for just a few miles to the lake.  About a mile before we got to the lake, my son, sitting in the front passenger seat, said “dad, is that a full moon out?”  I leaned over to look and saw a brilliant white light about a quarter mile away across a canyon and behind the trees on the ridge.  I thought it must be a full moon and told my son “looks like it” and kept driving not thinking anything else about it.  Around a minute later, we turned to go across the small dam at the lake, drove maybe 100 yards and almost hit my friend Frank who was walking fast towards us in the middle of the road.  I stopped fast, and could tell something was wrong.  Franks eyes were wide open, and he was yelling something before I could even roll my window down to ask him what he was doing in the middle of the road.  The first thing I heard him yelling was “Did you see it?  Did you see it?  Did you see the F***ing light?”  I had known Frank about 7 years at that time, and had never seen him act anything like this before.  I shut off my engine, and turned off the lights on my jeep, got out and said “What light?  I saw the full moon.....”  I looked up to see the full moon, but it was a moonless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then, Frank said “LOOK…….there it is”.  That’s when we all 3 saw it going away from us, going slightly right to left through Long Valley, just North of the lake we were standing at.  It was silent, and very bright white.  It moved slowly, perhaps 10 MPH about 100 feet above the ground lighting up the surrounding hills as it moved along.  From there it just moved towards the West and within a few minutes was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Catfishing was good that night after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frank told us that it was a ring of lights, some different colored ones, and mostly white lights all around the circle, and came across the lake towards him with the circle or ring standing vertically, and made absolutely no sound.  He was talking very fast and very excited about it all night, which is not like him at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were  flying fairly low and would go north to  south first,then east to west. Idrove for another four miles to my home and the lights were still in the sky. They were flying as if they were searching for something,but as i stood in the back yard they started to fly not from north,south then east,west but in a large circular area.As they flew in this pattern i noticed they were regular aircraft but had two bright white lights on them like headlights. By now my mother had gotten out of bed to see why i had not came inside. as she was leaning out the back door i showed her  what i was watching. Then out of nowhere came this huge object. It was approx. 300ft. wide and 175-200ft. long. It was completely dark, no lights,or sound,and was flying very low&#39; around 250ft. It headed north rather slowly and i could hear the air coming off of it .As it went to the north it then slowly turned to the east and drifted out of sight. Then the other aircraft took off in the same direction. I wanted to see if i could spot it again but it had shaken my mother to the point she wanted me to come inside.I have never seen anything like it since and will never forget it.<n>

We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).  I have no clue about what they were.  I would like it if someone e-mailed me regarding this, if it&#39;s possible.<n>

Three minutes from my house, above the Fish creek river, I noticed fuzzy white balls of light whirring around in a circle. Although they did not make a sound. Because of some low lying clouds the balls of light would illuminate the clouds as they passed through them. There location was up off my left shoulder. After five or so minutes I decide to drive on Route 32.  As I drove they moved along with me always above to my left and a little bit in front of me. The road was a winding road. All the while the lights stayed with me, moving with me and at the same time - they continued to circle in a clockwise direction. It became a kind of game as I wanted to see how fast they could go. I drove as fast as I could on this winding road; the fastest being around 78 miles per hour. They stayed right with the car. After eight or so minutes of driving I decided to stop again, The lights also stopped, continuing to circle. Five minutes later I proceeded down the road until I saw a person getting out of his car in his driveway. I pulled in and asked the man if he could see the lights.  He brushed me off and said there are sometimes airplane lights in the sky, but he did not see what I was seeing. He was irritated that I was intruding upon his space, and so I left, turning back in the direction I had come from. The lights hovered this time in above a large corn field. I stopped again to simply observe. I decided to wait and see what would happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, three of the seven lights vanished.  I did not notice them leave. Then something very interesting happened.  The remaining four lights went into formation. Four lights circling into the center. The shape was that of a four leaf clover or mandalla. They circled in unison so that at the same time they were all at the most outer edge of their circle and then they all circled back into the middle. this went on for 4 or 5 minutes. They then went into a third formation. Each light moved to form a perfect diamond. The lights did not move. For a minute they remained this way and then all lights moved to the center of the diamond - creating one glowing ball of light. And then, as though someone would turn off a light switch, they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home to tell my partner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There was absolutely NO sound emitted from this object and from horizon to horizon only took it 1 to 2 seconds to travel.

However, it was moving so fast, I really couldn&#39;t tell how big it was other than to say it was large enough to cast a blue hue over everything below it and it was large enough to see clearly.

Right after I observed it, it sped up, as if it knew I noticed it. I jumped out of the car, never taking my eyes off of it, and watched it speed off due south, maintaining the same altitude, and traveling in a straight line, until it faded into the distance. It never made the slightest sound, and it glowed a &#34;traffic light&#34; green color.<n>

I walked into the entryroom and approached the window to the side of the door. The windows are tall and thin and are to the sides of the door, and have a white lace-like cloth over them. I pushed the curtains asid to see any traffic. There&#39;s a tool factory in front of my house across to street, with a small wooded section blocking the factory&#39;s veiw. In a large central brak in the wooded section is where a disk shaped craft slowly crpt into veiw. The craft had multicolored lights to its side, which didn&#39;t seem to shine like a beacon, yet there was a definite shine to them. The craft, as it was disk shaped, had a side to it where the lights were atached, streching all around the craft.

HOWEVER, after watching the ABC special last night about UFO&#39;s, I decided to find a website where I could report something that has always mystified me so that I could at least get it on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll be perfectly honest and say that I&#39;m not sure if it was in the summer of 1992 or 1993, it&#39;s been so long ago, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was 1993. What I do remember was that it was an August night in the middle of the week, perfectly clear skies, about 8:30-9:00pm, and I was driving home to my in-laws house in Bellevue. I had just turned off the 405 freeway and turned west (right) on SE 8th street. As you drive west on SE 8th, there is a large hill--perhaps 500 feet in elevation--that is about one square mile in diameter with many homes, etc, and on the top of the hill, which you cannot see from the road, is a high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, I noticed a huge, luminescent orb--a glowing sphere--that seemed to be floating just above the crest of the hill. I would venture a guess that it was the easily the size of two football fields, and its glow wasn&#39;t like the glow of the moon but seemed, rather, to be illuminated from within. It was perfectly symmetrical, perfectly silent, with a smooth surface. It was so large, in fact, that I am almost certain it must have been seen by others. But again, there is a track and, I think, high school football stadium on top of the hill, so perhaps many people dismissed it as the lights from that. All I can tell you is, as a verified skeptic of these sorts of things, I was truly amazed at the sight: a completely silent (at least I didn&#39;t hear anything from my car with the windows down), glowing sphere that just appeared to be floating just above the horizon of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so mystified by the sighting that I drove up the hill (I can&#39;t recall the name of that particular neighborhood in Bellevue) to see if I could get a better look. As I neared the base of the hill, of course, it fell out of my line of vision, and I had to drive around the base of the hill in order to go up it--there is no access to the hill from SE 8th. It probably took me 3-4 minutes to get to where I determined the sphere/orb was, and it was gone (naturally).  I must have driven around for ten minutes, to no avail. I told my wife about it as soon as I arrived home, and we both agreed that it sounded very strange. But, like many of these sorts of things (and perhaps like many of the reports on here), eventually the incredulity of it all made me simply let it go, and I&#39;ve just always chalked it up to an inexplicable phenomenon. But, in all fairness, I thought it only right to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband and I were looking for meteors, and we both saw it.  We were on our deck in the back yard.  It was completely silent and moved slowly from northeast to southwest.  I thought it was electromagnetic because all the hairs on my arms stood straight up like with static electricity from a balloon.  It was spooky.  I thought about running in the house, but I couldn&#39;t stop watching it.   It drifted along rather slowly and then stopped, tilted so that the lights appeared to line up, and blinked out.  I saw a red light at each corner of the object, but my husband saw a white light at each corner.  This was the night that the Pope and the President were in Denver (about 15 miles south of us) at Regis University.  There was no air traffic at all while we were outside, which was unusual.  It was about the length of your thumb held at arm&#39;s length.<n>

I began to drive down a sidestreet, the street is at a 45 degree angle to the park, when I looked over to the park I noticed three bright lights over the treeline.  The lights were bright, but they weren&#39;t luminating the trees or ground.  I stopped the car and we observed the lights. Then before I realized it we were drive down the road toward my friends house.  We never really discussed what we saw that night, but when we do (three years later)my friend gets alittle defensive and denies seeing anything. After a few days of the incident I told my girlfriend at the time about what we saw, she told me not to discuss this in public(in fear that I would be considered crazy). Still to this day I wonder if anything happen to us, because it seems like time past and we back in the car driving like we normally did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Both Craft where Huge, Triangler in Shape, with thick rounded Edges, almost Gun Metal Blue in Color, But No Lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very Clear Night, Middle of No-Where (No City Lights) And the Crafts Blocked the Stars as they moved to the North.

Come down to NOBODY would believe it.  And we left it at that...<n> <n><n> <n><n> BUT!

It looked like it was made of a hard metal.  It was not completely round but not square either.  It was more like an octagon shape.  It had colorful lights on the belly of it.  There was about four of us girls standing outside smoking cigarettes and my sister just happened to look up and see it.  It was going really slow and it made no sound.  We watched it until it went out of sight and kept up with it as far as we could.  I yelled to some other girls to come see it and one girl came over and got just a glimpse of it before it went out of sight into the horizon.  It stayed just above the trees and just before it appeared all the lights in the town went out.  All of us girls were raised pretty much normal.  We all were alittle bit mischievous.  We experimented with marijuana sometimes and alcohol but that’s it.  We were at the Job Corp at the time.  My background includes being manic depressive and at the time w! as on medication for it.  I was always wanting to see a ufo ever since my cousin saw an alien when she was about 13 at her home in strange creek, WV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On the other hand, if it was smaller and closer, then it was unbelievably quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man and a woman were walking near us on the path and we all asked each other if we had really seen what we thought we had.  We confirmed the details mentioned above and discussed their implications based on the laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other man was the ((deleted)) coach of ((deleted)).  I hold a degree from the University of Michigan with a major in ((deleted)) science.  We&#39;re not crazy, and we knew that what we had just seen was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next two days the sighting was reported in the local newspaper with no explanation.  Perhaps it was a satellite which had fallen from its orbit and was about to crash into the ocean, but I don&#39;t think so because it had pale green-yellow lights.  A small private jet?  No, it was too fast and too quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you heard other reports of this incident?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

All I could see was the light shining at me and some type of old round old lock or something built into the window.  It&#39;s glued into my mind.

He was stunned for a few seconds, then climbed up the stairs to his house&#39;s roof and saw it from above, and described it as a &#34;low pyramid&#34;.
