It had a Glass Dome on top, flashing lights underneath and stationary lights on the side.  It was approximately 200 to 300 feet in diameter.  I remember, as well as my two other sisters in the car, that the object almost took up the whole width of the river!  It was Pulsing and making a Humming/pulsing sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the 4 of us were watching, it started to pulsate, with the lights moving around the sides faster and faster.  It was then pulsing and flashing SO fast that we thought it was going to Explode!  We screamed and jumped back into the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So did a lot of other people!  All of a sudden there was a bright Flash with thousands of points of light expanding and falling onto the river, almost like a 4th of July sparkler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing we realized was that the Object had either EXPLODED or had DISAPPEARED!  On the way home, we all were crying hysterically with my Mother almost rear ending the car in front of us.  As soon as we hit the door, my oldest sister called the Police Station to report the sighting.  The police told her that their switchboard was lighting up w/ calls from all over the county of sightings of this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never, ever forget this day!  To this day, we STILL talk about seeing this UFO pulsate and disintegrate above the Allegheny River that Spring of 1968!<n>

I had not been asleep. I saw what at first I thought was a falling star.  It became larger, and then I thought it was a meteorite. It didn&#39;t hit the ground, but rather shot back up at what I recall as being a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, It darted up somewhere over or on the other side of our house. I remained in bed and watched the sky.  Several seconds later, it returned and darted over to an area where there are trees and a creek.  I remember it as being a rather large white light and approximately the size of a one of those big therapy balls.  I didn&#39;t hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved along about half the heighth of the trees.  It then zipped through the air very quickly over to a hill located from the same field that I first sighted it in.  It did not land.  I saw it spin several times for just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then darted back up into the sky at about a 45 degree angle at about the same location as it first appeared.  I went and woke up my mother and told her about it.  We watched the sky for awhile, but it never returned.  I remember that there were other reports of sightings around the Malvern, Iowa area in that year also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Is NICAP still in service?  I was returning from playing for a dance. By the way I am not a drinker except on NYears Eve. Far and few between back then too. A friend was with me but she fell asleep just seconds before I saw this brilliant blue like a arc welders light on off ramp grassy area at I 80 interchange at Overton NE. My dashlights turned red. There were other reports of strange lights in area bt were attributed to weather inversions. 67 and 68 were banner years for ufos in midwest. Saw some other strange lights but nothing since. 10 years before that I was at the site of an alleged abduction near Kearney NE. Airforce debunked that as a hoax and the man was rumored as mental case BUT I saw his file. I was later told it was impossible that I would see his file but a lay at the courthouse was evidently as curious as I and she showed me when I asked. The paper from a mental evaluation said he was normal. Later in 1990 I wrote a song about it. In 1993 I wrote a screenplay which became a published audio book. Although most of book was satire; the account was quite accurate. Since my ufo encounter I have become quite a inspired writer and have had dreams that would come true. My latest creation is the &#34;Millennium Song&#34; published lyric in a national country music roundup publication Jan 2000. A group Millennium.org should have that in there archive. I also met a actress known for her interest in ufos in early 1970s. That has also inspired my interest. I was a rockabilly on tv in the 50s and folk blues writer from 60s till now. I also work as a custodian at a school in area. I sent my story to Hollywood in 1993 and had good comments from one director. But no  movie has been produced. I however felt like I might be the real mister millennium considering all the strange things that have happened. It was probably just a coincidence that &#34;Millennium&#34; tv show and X Files came a couple of years after my book circulated the studios.<n>

Sometime around the year 1968 I was visiting my Grandparents in Scottsville, Kentucky for a while.  We would go outside and sit on my Grandparents porch practically every night to just talk and so on.  This particular night my Grandmother and I were sitting out on their front porch as usual talking.  Let me tell you that the night was totally dark-not a star in the sky. I dedided to go out in the front yard to look at the sky (I have always been facinated with the sky and stars etc.).  When I got out in the yard, I looked up and saw a huge disk hovering directly over my Grandparents house.  The perfect outline of a disk could be seen, and the disk had lots of lights all over it.  This object made no noise what so ever.  I yelled out for my Grandmother to come and see this &#34;thing&#34; for herself-which she did. We were both astonished and amazed at what we were witnessing.  She then called out for my Grandfather (who was inside the house) to come out in a hurry to see this object for himself.  He too came outside and witnessed this disk.  It just kept hovering over their house for five to ten minutes.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone.  It had to have taken off at a very great speed.  As I recall, their were several reports from all over Allen County that night of people witnessing the same type of crafts.  Several were seen by a friend of mine-and he said one landed in their field.  It was possibly on our local news the next day also.  We were told that what we witnessed was a meteorite.  As I recall, meteorites do not hover over a house (or anywhere) for five to ten minutes, and then fly away.  I am a Christian and have an open mind about many things, but this incident-I cannot explain it.  This story is true-we DID see this object.  We saw no &#34;little green men etc.&#34;, but we did see something somehow beyond human comprehension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

Q. RUNNER) assigned to pick up solders at the movie theater at a another base (Warner Kaserne) I believe the base I was on was  called Oberschleissheim Army Airfield it was a Nazi airport but since the war was an America base just outside Munich  near a town called Hasenbergm they were building the Olympic stadium near it as I left the barracks driving a ford 2 ton truck because our equipment was being passed to other units I drove through some trees and wooded area with the runway off to my left about 1/3 mile away and almost parallel with it when I spotted the object disk shaped with a pulsating area the circumference of the disk about half of the area of it from the tip of the disk towards the center where the material appeared be a translucent silver there was assort of orange light like beam at the left of the object viewing it from the truck which stalled and all he lights dimmed I was frozen with fear or so it seemed for a unknown amount of time I remember just looking at it as it silently hovered off too my left in front of me eventually I started the truck drove it in reverse till I came to a group of swerves in the road where I k turned it and  returned to the barracks and told some other people so we The guys I were with believed me and went with me to the movie theater at the other base and eventually we searched the area where I had guest it to be but found no trace the next day IT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OR GLIDER and the report I believe kept me from making E5 A PROMOTION for 3 months or so It was towards the end of April or the beginning of may.it was in plan sight about 200 300 yards from me.this links bellow is the map of th bases<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.usarmygermany.com/USAREUR_City_Munich.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.usarmygermany.com/Communities/Munich/Maps_Munich%20North.htm<n>

We followed it on a surveyor&#39;s transit, as did the other family about a mile away, whom dad had me call, as the man was also a surveyor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a direct quote from a diary I kept at the time, which I just got back from mom a year ago after dad died.   &#34;April 8, 1968, Monday.  {....I am skipping the first four paragraphs.....}  After dinner I did the dishes and after that I went outside for a cigarette.  At about five to seven I looked up at the sky and saw a strange sight.  A huge, lighted object, quite noiseless, was hovering and swaying over the city to the SoutEast.  I watched it go slowly across the sky, stopping here, going up there, and it moved very slowly.  I was intrigued, thinking at first that it was  helicopter, but then I became aware that there was no nise.  I watched it and I went to the front of the house to have the folks come out.  I had that silly egoistical feeling that the thing was there just for me to see and that it was watching me and reacting to me.  Anyway, before I got too far, it had one large lighted sphere on the bottom and one small one on the top, aparently connected by some metal structure I could only get glimpses of (here I have an arrow pointing to a drawing I made of the object).  It was the shape that intrigued me at first.  As soon as the folks came out, it egan to pick up speed and travel up, and then after about five minutes, like a trajectory it went into &#34;orbit&#34; and disappeared.  But, mind you, the thing was very close to ttown and earth at first and later went up, up, &#39;till it vanished.  Here I want to inject the story Steve, my 12 year old brother, wrote about it.  It&#39;s not quite right, but it inspired him to write and that pleases me very much.  I copy even his spelling. &#39;Steven Smith and family  April 8, 6:45-7:20 spotted a UFO  At aprovamatly 6:45 Mr. Ken Smith (my brother) saw an oblong [here I edited with: not so, but he must not know it - K.L.S.] shaped object hovering over southern Walla Walla.  It was a lumonus object oblong with a smaller light, a foot above it, at first he thought it was a helicopter.  But as though someone in it saw him looking at it put on &#39;full speed&#39;.  It was th! en he notified us, [myu mother, father and me] it was now southwest and moving rapidly.  My father then got his trancit and sighted it.  It was now west and going up!  It was passed the clouds and shining brightly.  They were very thick.  After changing poisition it looked like a &#39;cone&#39;.  The light on top sent rays and shaped a cone.  But we soon lost it.  Now turning from the transit it was found, but going higher, soonit dissappeared but to reapere and then leave for good.  I hope .   Later my broter phoned the FAA and they said no sattilite was scheduled now.  Well, we know its UFO, funny.  it was noiseless, I was expecting at least a beep.&#34;   Written by Steven Smith.   I hope he&#39;ll be inspired to do more writing.  That is right - Dad and I called several government agencies, but they laughed us off.&#34; end of quote from my diary.  I am writing to you with this sighting as it has haunted me for the past thirty years, I think of it often and before I die, I&#39;d like it recorded somewhere besides my spiral college notebook that I used as a diary.<n>

Over these many years one sighting and an historical event that followed have haunted me and I have never known what I should have done at that time.  Heck I was 17 years old, driving home from cheerleading practice.  I questioned my own credibility that day.  Who would believe me? I told my mother when I got home that I saw a flying object that I couldn’t explain.  She had little to say other than, &#34;I don’t know what to say about that.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it is worth, here is my story:  April 4, 1968.  I remember the day because it was that evening that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  The events of that late afternoon coupled with his tragic death colored my world view forever.  I made a promise that I would remember everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the Gainesville High School gym at about 4:15 pm.  My family lived in a small brick ranch house on Lake Lanier about 6 miles outside of Gainesville, GA in Hall County.  I headed east on the Cleveland Hwy while listening to WDUN radio.  At that time the Cleveland Hwy. was a winding 2-lane road lined for most part by large trees and small residences sparsely spaced out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a restaurant called The Big Bear at a bend in the road.  It was noted for the cage in the parking lot that housed a large bear.  (In hindsight this was a cruel thing, but in 1968 it was just a promotional gimmick for a dingy old restaurant.)  Once I cleared the bend and lost sight of the Big Bear, the landscape opened up.  Trees had been cleared years before to make room for Riverbend Baptist Church on the left and a small strip mall on the right.  The sun was very low and bright behind me at that point.  I recall that my rearview mirror caught the sun and I slowed down because its reflection in my mirror temporarily made seeing ahead more difficult.  I adjusted the mirror so I could see, but I still was going very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment in front and above me I saw it.  The object had suddenly appeared from the south or southeast.  It came to a dead stop.  It did not waiver.  It hovered silently above the highway.  I looked in the rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me and there wasn’t.  I wanted someone else to see this.  (There weren’t a lot of cars on the road because most people didn’t get off from work until 5 so I saw few cars in front or behind and passed few cars traveling in opposite direction.)  I slowed to almost a stop while my eyes fixed on what hung suspended ahead and in the air.  Its size I could not begin to guesstimate.   Its altitude I couldn’t say.  But I can say that it was metallic silver because the sun that had so bothered my eyes fropm the west reflected on part of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it must be a jet the military was testing.  But there was no noise, there were no windows or markings and I saw no lights.  It was daylight and if there were lights they had to be white and were indistinguishable from the sun’s rays that bounced off the right side of the cigar-shaped object.  I knew I was looking at whatever it was from the side.  It could have actually been a disk.  Its smooth shape was almost too perfect. It stayed there for a number of seconds, but it seemed like minutes to me because of all the thoughts that raced through my head.  My body felt as though something passed through it.  I vowed to remember every moment.  Maybe one day someone would want to know when I first saw an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it catapulted to my left and was gone.  Not a trace.  Not a sound. It was as though it disappeared, but for a nanosecond I did see movement and I know it headed north or northwest.  I simply don’t know which because the road twisted and turned often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another strange occurrence at that moment it left.  The radio DJ or news reporter commented on Martin Luther King, Jr. being in Memphis.  I distinctly remember something about a garbage collectors strike.  Now I had given very little thought to King in my short life.  I heard the things my parents said and I had listened to the &#34;I Have a Dream&#34; speech which greatly impressed me.  But heck I lived in the Deep South and there was controversy that swirled around him.  Back to the story.  At the moment I heard the radio and saw the object disappear from sight a thought passed through me, MLK was going to die that day.  Now this thought came to me between 4:30 and 4:45 EST.  King was in Memphis and was shot at 6:01 pm.  It hadn’t happened yet. When I got home and after I told my mother about the UFO, I asked her if she had heard about King being killed. The question was asked because I thought it was strange that I was aware of his death and yet the radio announcer had said nothing.  I turned on the TV to see if there were any news bulletins.  During those times there was no 5 PM news.  There were no bulletins.  So I thought to myself, &#34;You are crazy.  That UFO has rattled you and crazy stuff is going through your head.&#34;  I plopped down in front of the TV and was the typical teenager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point that evening a news bulletin did come on and said King had been killed. My first thought was, &#34;Why did it take so long for the news to announce this?&#34;  Then Walter Cronkite (I think it was him) said King was shot on the balcony of the Lorraine (sp) Hotel at 6 pm.  My heart started pounding.  That was wrong. He must have died earlier. You can’t imagine how I felt.  I had known something was going to happen to King, but I couldn’t interpret my instant knowledge at the time it was revealed to me.  I wouldn&#39;t have known what to do.  I thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I felt such guilt.  I could have stopped it.  I could have called the radio, but I was so young and had never had anything happen to me that could be classified as weird.  The UFO sighting and the knowledge that King was going to die occurred almost simultaneously.  I didn’t sleep well that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as you read, these two things are entwined for me.  I can never separate them.  Everything is so clear from that afternoon and evening and yet it was 40 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then when I hear about UFO sightings, I don’t doubt that some of them are true.  Over years I wondered what it was I saw.  Funny, I never thought of the object being piloted by aliens, at least not aliens of a hostile nature.  At some point during my college years I found peace about what it might be.  I came to believe that the UFO was piloted by the descendents of humans.  Maybe this seemed plausible because as a young child I loved science fiction.  I have always chosen to believe that time travel would one day be possible, far off into the very distant future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the technology exists to transcend space and time, our descendents, whatever they are like, will come back to witness history.  I don’t believe they will or can tamper with us very much because if they do, they could be destroying themselves.  Their mere existence hinges on us.  The desire to understand from whence they came, what we looked like at this primitive stage, how we lived, and what formed our values is certainly things to study.  They are looking for themselves.  No, I don’t believe in aliens that truly are alien to us.  I believe in beings that have evolved and long left earth.  They have populated other celestial orbs.  They won’t bother me or anyone else.  I am one of their ancestors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that my story is in the distant past.  Before the Internet I didn’t concern myself about what or who I should tell my story.  It was shared over the years with only a few close friends.  Still before I aged anymore I wanted to tell my story for the record.  I saw something I couldn’t explain. It flew at a speed I couldn’t comprehend.  I don’t know why it stopped there or why I was the only car at that point past the bend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wondered if anyone else saw anything that day in North Georgia, but I never heard any stories on TV.  I presumed that either I was it or the others were like me.  It couldn’t be explained and people questioned their sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It still amazes me that NO ONE has taken a credible photo.  When these things appear they are often too far away to get clear shots.  No pilots who have claimed to see them up close even had a camera and could record it.  There have been so many hoaxes over the years that the few that have credibility are questioned.  I didn’t have a camera that day and even if I did, the event passed so quickly I could have never gotten a shot off.  Surely someone at some point with get a verifiable photo that can be blown up and will make it evident to everyone.  We are out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I have never seen another.  It was a one-time thing, but I still look up and hope that before I die I can see another.  If I do I won’t wait 40 years to share it with you.<n>
