And started moving again but at a slow pace!|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42231.html|2|ndxe196908| The object would stop and move and then blink off and be somewhere else in the sky. And started moving again but at a slow pace!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, Saw the Peter Jennings report tonight and thought it was time to finally report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1969 late August. We were leaving to come back to Pennsylvania the next and my mother&#39;s whole family was there that night. As everybody was talking and saying goodby I started watching the western sky and saw what I thought was a plane moving north along the western horizon. At first I didn&#39;t think much about and watch it move slowly along. I had moved away from where my family was at the time and kept watching this so called plane. The it did something very strange. It stop dead, right in the middle of the sky. Then it started to move high but straight toward our house. It was very high in the sky. Like the hight of a jet. Then it just stop again and started moving in another direction. It kept stoping and moving and I knew that it wasn&#39;t a plane or a satelite. Then it just blink out of site. For a moment I look around the sky and there it was again. To describe how far it had moved in less then 10-15 seconds would be like looking at the hands of a clock and watch the big hand move from 9:00 t0 3:00 in a blink of an eye. It did this several times and when I went to tell my family it was gone. I had to have watching this object at least 10 mins or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time in the seventies I heard or read in the paper someone describe seeing an object in the sky moving just like I saw. I kept it to my self except for some close friends over the years but to no one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

8/19/69 23:00|Duncan (Canada)|BC|Cylinder|15 to 20 minutes|A group of people sighted an "object" that hovered for some 15 minutes, it pulsated red to mauve.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42320.html|3|ndxe196908| A group of people sighted an &#34;object&#34; that hovered for some 15 minutes, it pulsated red to mauve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning from a City Council meeting at about 11 and 11:15 in the evening, as I approached my house I noticed my next door neighbors standing on their front steps saying goodnight to some friends. I asked them if they had seen the object that was hovering in the sky to the north of us. They all said no and immediately came over to our front walk to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had been there for about five minutes as I had been watching it during my walk home. What attracted me initially was the fact it was pulsating sort of a cherry red to light mauve or soft purple color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and got my binoculars and we watched with the glasses for about ten more minutes, suddenly it sped off to the Northwest, there is a large 1200 meter hill or mountain close by, just as it appeared that it was going to hit the mountain it suddenly made a right angle turn and shot straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood around for another ten or fifteen minutes talking about what we had seen and then dispersed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later there was a report in the Victoria newspaper of a sighting by a gentleman living in an area some 7 miles to the north, he claimed the &#34;object&#34; was over Duncan. The interesting thing is that directly between this gentleman&#39;s locale and Duncan, there is a hydro station that draws DC current from the mainland and converts it back into AC current for distribution to Lake Cowichan areas. This object had to be positioned directly above these transmission line. It is our theory (and it is only a theory) that the &#34;object&#34; required some form of electrical energy for propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/17/69 02:30|North Hollywood|CA|Sphere|10 Minutes|Was up late watching TV and glanced out of nearby window to witness 6-7 bright orange lights to the south about half of a mile away.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10380.html|4|ndxe196908| Was up late watching TV and glanced out of nearby window to witness 6-7 bright orange lights to the south about half of a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> North Hollywood:13061 Vanowen St. Second Floor apartment bedroom window facing southward. Church and unobscured clear weather view of the sky in direct path. Got up to change channel on TV and was drwn towards the window by bright orange glowing objects outside and to the south behind the church. Six Objects in formation. One other that was much lower and cruising appoximately one hundred feet above the power lines. They came over the apartments where I was living and I could see them quite clearly from the center courtyard second floor catwalk. They (6) stopped in mid flight just when passing to my direct west and abruptly changed direction from due north to west. I&#39;d say that they were each about the size of a quarter at arms length away from the body. The rogue ship that was lower never did come up above the horizon from where I was watching this. At this point a neighbor was awakened by what he thought was an explosion and came outside to where I was standing with another person to watch the sighting. I did not hear any noise from the objects during the ten minutes that they were in my complete view. As they ascended at 45 degrees azimuth they seemed to be shooting sparks out from the rear and I could see small silvery disks being ejected from the object that were not illuminated except from the orange glow of the UFO. They quickly were lost sight of after they descended into the darkness. At this time three other presons were returning home from a late night poker game and immediately came up the catwalk to see what was going on. This was approximately 8 minutes after they were first spotted by myself. The next day I talked to another of my neighbors who also witnessed it but was too frightened to come outside and watch it with us. After nine minutes of observation the two objects to the right and left of the center object blinked out. The remaining two objects sped off at a fantastic rate of speed. I could still see them for only a few more seconds before they were out of my vision range.  After the sighting was over we called the local radio station (KGIL) to report the sighting. The overnight board operator said that he received one other report from someone in Van Nuys, CA. The next morning, we called the local US Air Force to report the sighting. the officer told us, &#34;We do not know what they are.&#34; Also, I observed a LAPD patrol car going down Vanowen St. at Ethel Avenue to the West. I not sure if he saw it too. But, I think that it would have been very visible to anyone that managed to be outside and looking up. I managed to somehow snap a single photo from a Kodak instamatic 126 camera of a single object. It was not very impressive! But, I still have the negative available. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t remember taking the photograph until four years later! So, It was in the early 70&#39;s that we finally had it developed.<n>

We all belonged to the Church of Scientology, and they had secretly smuggled a bunch of us down there where we were to study the mechanics of Dianetics and Scientology, for our own benefit and that of the Sea Org, as it was called then.  We were housed in one large tent which was situated some 2,000 ft., or not quite a half mile from the ocean, where which was the vast expance of rocky bluffs above the actual beach, that were maybe 40 to 50 ft high in most places.  One night around 11:30 someone noticed the lights over the ocean, so we all went out to the edge of the bluffs to watch.  Six brilliant diamond shaped craft were dancing in some irregular pattern over the coast, maybe no more than two miles out.  These craft would sometimes actually stop momentarily, then streak off again in some strange angle, seemingly mentally connecting with all of us. Even today, mant years later my brother and my friend and I often discuss this incident that happened so many years ago. We did feel a distinct feeling that not only did these craft know we were there, but that they were actually trying to communicate with us. We know that these craft were from somewhere out of our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks earlir we all experienced a light as bright as the sun outside our tent, so we went outside and saw a disk shaped sphere glowing flourescent white intense light.  These were the incidents that we all wish to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

8/15/69 22:00|Lamont|CA|Formation|4 to 5 seconds|9 to 13 objects in "V" formation travelling about 100 mi per second graze ionosphere.|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33209.html|7|ndxe196908| 9 to 13 objects in &#34;V&#34; formation travelling about 100 mi per second graze ionosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have listened to Peter Davinport on the air several times with both Art Bell and George Noory. After hearing him again with Art over the last weekend, Peter said that only 10% of sightings get reported, so I have decided to report a sighting from 1969 to add to your data base. This sighting has never before been reported by me, but there were other witnesses to the event. I will give details as I remember them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 14 yrs. Old and lived in a small town called Lamont just southeast of Bakersfield, CA. I don’t remember the exact date, but it was a warm August evening, around 10:00pm, and the skies were very clear. I was with my best friend and we were in his back yard. He was talking to his girl friend, which lived next door to him, through her bedroom window as she was not able to come out and visit with us. Not wanting to eves drop on his conversation, I was walking around his back yard staring up at all the brilliant stars in the sky. I was looking northeast when all of a sudden I saw approximately 9 to 13 objects that looked like falling stars enter the earth’s atmosphere or ionosphere. These objects were flying in a perfect &#34;V&#34; formation (I&#39;d be happy to send you a crude drawing). I actually saw them enter the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately just west of Las Vegas, fly true north to south and then watched them exit the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately over San Diego. This took about 4 to 5 seconds to travel that distance (approx 400mi). The objects made absolutely no sound, not even a sonic boom, and remained in perfect formation the entire time we viewed them. I say we, because as soon as I saw them, I hollered at my friend to look, and he caught them about mid way through the sighting. If you hold your arm out at length, the “&gt;” encompassed about the length of your thumb from one end of the wing to the other. They were individual objects because I could see stars in between them as they crossed the sky. I couldn&#39;t see any lights on them, as they were too high up, but they glowed red hot and had long fiery tails with short smoke trails following the fire, very similar to meteors entering the atmosphere. They just entered the ionosphere, flew across the sky never breaking or veering at all from formation, and left the ionosphere just as easily as they entered. This sighting scared me because I couldn’t explain what I had just seen, so I ran in the house covered in goose bumps. My f! riend stayed out a while longer talking to his girl friend. He came in and told me another set of them flew by after I went in. 10 years later, while talking with a fellow musician up in Lake Arrowhead, the subject of UFO’s came up. I asked him to explain what he had seen, and he described the same thing I saw, the same month of the same year. We assumed it had to be the same objects because his description matched mine perfectly. He was in Whittier, CA when he saw them. Whittier is about 100 miles south of Bakersfield. We both remarked that we just happened to be looking up at the sky during those few seconds, and anyone else who may have been looking up at that particular time could not have missed them. It’s also sort of interesting at how this event affected both my friend and me. I got so excited, I started reading all about UFO’s and talked to everyone I could about them. My friend clammed up and wouldn’t talk to anyone about it, I think for fear of being called a kook. I have never had another personal sighting, although I look up at the skies whenever I can in hopes of seeing something again. Thank you for being an outlet for all of us who have had sightings. It’s a validation for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We at NUFORC estimate that the number of legitimate sightings of UFO&#39;s that get reported to anyone is probably ONE PERCENT, or less, not ten percent, and the witness suggests above.

On a warm summer night bout 9-10p.m. about eight of my friends and I were playing tag out in the middle of a one neon light lit common yard that everyone shared at the apartments we lived in.  As I tagged my friend and ran away, I could see looking back at him a bright light in the sky about six miles to the east of us.  I stopped playing to look at it and got all my friends to turn and look at it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be hovering about 400 to 500 feet moving around slowly coming towards us like a helicopter with its bright spotlight.  Some of us thought it was a helicopter, but the light was very bright. Within a few seconds as we were looking at it, it suddenly in one quick movement advanced directly right over us and hovered there slowly moving east to west a few hundred feet over us.  The whole area lit up like the sun was out.  I looked around looking at the wooden fence and trees near by which were in the dark and now could clearly be seen with this bright light.  I also look around at my friends who were still looking up in awe.  I also heard a very low humming sound as it was going over us.  It was long cigar shaped about 500 feet long with the under side giving off a bright white light.  Along the outer edges near the under side were a row of different color lights going off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the body of the UFO completely passed over us, it quickly shot out to the west to the horizon in just a second.  Looking like just a bright light again, it stopped for a second and shot up almost straight up into the clear night sky looking like a shooting star, until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

8/15/69 20:00|East Barre|VT|Cylinder|8 minutes|Fast moving but in jerky stops and starts|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55900.html|10|ndxe196908| Fast moving but in jerky stops and starts<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was age 12 at the time. My sister was 10, my older cousin about 25. We were traveling by car from Barre, Vermont to a summer house on Nelson Pond in Calais, Vermont. I believe the time to have been about 8 pm, possibly a little later. It was dark outside already but there was enough light in the sky to see the silhouette of the tree line. We were driving up a small hill, with a field on either side bordered by woods. We were in a green Chevrolet Impala sedan with four doors. My older cousin was driving, I was in the right passenger seat, my younger sister sat in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we mounted the hill, we noticed a large bright ring of yellow and red lights in the sky to the left. It was relatively nearby, about 800 to 1200 feet in altitude is my guess, and it maintained its location for about 3-4 minutes. My cousin stopped the car and we just stared at it. I began to notice that the lights I had seen were on the bottom of a larger short cylinder shaped object. The cylinder was darkish brown, a little bit like anodized aluminum. The object was probably 5-6 times larger than the ring of light in the bottom. Rods or pipes, or maybe antennae extended from the sides of the cylinder. I remember thinking that there might be a window or a rectangle of light on the side of the cylinder, but that rectangle shape was not as intense as the ring of lights on the bottom. At first I was calm, and fascinated. Then my cousin locked her door, reached past me and locked my door, and might have locked the back doors. I noticed my cousin was edgy, and had tears in her eyes. My sister began to cry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to move from left to right, which I believe was west to east. It did this quickly but also sort of jerkily, in a series of short quick moves. It maintained the same height for about I guess 3 minutes. It seemed like we were stopped for a long while. I remember the sound of the car, the headlights on the road, and the dashboard lights. The movement was from about 10:30 in the sky to about 1:00. Then it moved rapidly upward, a similar quality of motion: fast but a little jerkiness to it. The object stayed in that position another minute to two minutes and then rose upward again very fast until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately we began moving again. My cousin only said we&#39;ll have to tell our dad, and her husband, who we were meeting at the summer house with my mom. When we got to the summer house (we say camp even if it&#39;s quite finished) my dad and her husband were very dismissive. My dad suggested we had seen lights on a radio transmission tower. I knew we had not. Her husband joked about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later my sister and I from time to time draw what we saw. We will do it in separate rooms. And the pictures are very similar. On several occasions we have drawn the scene from a perspective outdoors, looking down on the green Impala. Once a friend who saw those pictures observed that it was curious we drew it that way given we were in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a boy I was fascinated by space, the manned space program, and the possibility of space travel. I think that is why the initial response was just fascination, not fear, until my cousin began locking the doors. Later in life I wondered if what we had seen might have been a product of our defense intelligence, or a spy vehicle from the Soviet Union.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reports of similar experiences from mature friends, one in Wisconsin, and one in Maine makes me wonder about this. The edge of this thing were so sharp I can not imagine them to have been fog or vapor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/69 20:00|Rockford|IL|Other|3 minutes|Seen an object in the sky that appeared to be an old World War II plane, buy wasn't!|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63292.html|11|ndxe196908| Seen an object in the sky that appeared to be an old World War II plane, buy wasn&#39;t!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened long ago, but it is as if it happened just yesterday. I was just fifteen years old at the time. Here is my terrifying experience! My twin brother was in the hospital which was located only a few blocks from my home. My aunt who lived across the street from me at the time wanted me to go with her so that she wouldn&#39;t be alone. My aunt was deaf so she didn&#39;t feel comfortable going by herself. We arrived at the hospital about 7:15pm. My aunt and I visited my brother for about 1-1/2 hours. At about 8:45pm when the sun was just about down we were on our way back home when all of the sudden something caught my eye in the northern sky. I looked up and saw two huge lights. The object was about 400-500 feet up in the air and as it started to pass over us I notice that it looked like an old World War II airplane. It was not what it appeared to be. First, there was no noise at all. It also seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly. It was NOT a blimp! If this was an airplane I surely would have heard something and if the airplane was flying that low it certainly would be moving much faster then the speed it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I seen this and realized this object was not what it appeared to be I became so frightened. I have never been so scared in my life before then or since. Anyway, I looked down because I didn&#39;t want to see this thing anymore. I grabbed my aunt&#39;s hand and tried to run, but she would not run. I couldn&#39;t leave her behind so I just held on to her hand tight and held my breath because I just knew we were going to be picked up by this craft. After what seemed forever I looked up and the object was gone. My aunt and I made it home alright and I told my family what happened, but they thought I was just seeing things. As far as my aunt goes, she didn&#39;t run because she couldn&#39;t hear and what she seen was an airplane to her although she did say that it seemed strange that it was moving so slow. She was also puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened I always closed my curtains in my bedroom and tried to stay inside when dusk came. I always felt that they would come back for me. I know this sounds crazy, but this event did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me share my unforgettable experience with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was an accomplished athlete at the time and was driving home to my family showered, refreshed, comfortable, well rested, in excellent condition and sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event: As I was negotiating the paved roadway, following the lazy turn to the left at the top of the hill, a creature strode up from the steep hillside on my right and without breaking stride, looked directly at me and directed me to, &#34;DON’T HURT I.&#34;  ((witness recognizes grammatical error in telepathic message.  PD))  The three words were clear and precise but without sound. The powerful engine sounds did nothing to dampen the order.  My mind heard the words, not my ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I backed off the accelerator and slowed slightly while the creature completed its brisk upright walk across the road from right to left (south to north) and up the cut bank on my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did the creature break stride or exhibit any difficulty managing the steep terrain, especially going up the man-made and much steeper cut.  It was as it stepped onto the pavement that it regarded my presence and sent its order not to hurt it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I so desired, I could have run it down.  I estimate my speed before slowing to be around 45 MPH but was not conscious of my speed at the time, nor did I look at the speedometer either during or after the event.  Higher speeds are dangerous at that spot in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was the creature appeared to me a bright blue—sky blue and intense. It was clothed in a neat double-breasted tight fitting or tailored suit with matching pants and a flat-brimmed hat. Exposed skin was exactly the same color as the clothing (sky blue). I could see no wrinkles or folds as the creature progressed across my path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creature had almond-shaped eyes and a tiny mouth but otherwise was basically human size and human shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my next trip through that stretch of road, two days later, I parked and examined the spot where the creature had emerged.  The terrain is steep with native trees and Chaparral, which makes a difficult hike for anyone, yet this creature had no difficulty climbing it. I also tried to climb up the 5-6 foot cut bank but could not scramble up without clawing and grabbing handholds and footholds, yet the creature easily strode up the angled hillside upright without straining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt no fear at the time and I wish I had taken the time to try to communicate with it but driving at that location takes concentration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about the quivelent size of a dime...at arms length, and was a bit duller in color...like aluminum....and totally soundless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated it&#39;s altitude later to be at or above about 10,000 feet, because commercial jet traffic enroute to JFK were flying below it. I distinctly remember watching a four-engined Boeing glide well below it, and noting that the object (which was hanging stationary in the sky above it) was nearly half it&#39;s size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became immediately intrigued with the concept of what it could be, a balloon perhaps?...no..it didnt move like a balloon in the wind should....a planet in daylight?...no, didnt make sense  because it was too large, and definately looked like it had metallic structure to it...and I called out to Dad and Grandpa on the roof to take a good look up at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After studying it, admittedly very perplexed , for a while...my Dad, suddenly blurted out that it had to be &#34;one of them there damned ufo&#39;s that everybody&#39;s been talking about&#34;!.....Granddad said nothing,, as I seem to recall, I think he was just totally confused by the sight,,as was I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched that object remain airborne above the jet traffic for nearly an hour, them were distracted long enough to recall that when we finally looked for it again, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day...35 years later, and a now a lifelong aviation industry veteran, who has worked with many types of aircraft over the years...I simply cannot make sense of what it was that we witnessed that day, in broad daylight...I will tell you that it was no planet, and no vehicle of NASA&#39;s, that I&#39;m familiar with....and it was evidently very large, but very high up in the atmosphere....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fail to believe that no one else would have seen it, let alone reported it back then,,,especially, the pilot&#39;s flying in the vicinity of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry that I must remain anonymus, due to the nature of my profession, but I can tell you that , on that particular day, and on two other occasions, years later (and always with additional witnesses) ..I had seen something truly unidentified and unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We first noticed what appeared to be the moon infront and above us. I remarked on how spectacular and bright it was. We noticed after a few seconds that this object was on a collision course with us looking as though it would smash right on top of us. I stopped the truck. The object stopped. I just hovered there without motion or rocking. It was absolutely still. We got the idea that it was wanting to take us with it. We both found ourselves muttering words like, &#34;Go away, we don&#39;t want to go,&#34; etc. Suddenly it took off as though it were shot from a slingshot going straight out into the night sky as far as we could see. The object was a yellowish gold, slightly glowing. I could not make out any detail in the object. It made not noise. It scared us. It was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This sighting (video) showed a circular light that had traveled fast enough to catch up the the NASA space craft going about 18,000 miles per hour, suddenly slow down and then reversed course.  I saw the exact same object back 1969 over Baldwin City KS, and it again did a totally impossible physical manuever, only this time what I saw was it travel way up in space very fast across the stary sky, and in one instant do an exact 90 degree turn.  I&#39;ve never told anyone about this buy tonight i saw the exact same sight when I was 13 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was only about 12:30 a.m., too early to expect to see anything much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then low, just on the horizon, I saw a bright light.

8/5/69 19:00|North Haven|CT|Disk|20 mins|UFO explosion and sighting|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28319.html|20|ndxe196908| UFO explosion and sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wanted to share this experience for years because I have wished we investigated it more at the time, but we did nothing. At one time, my family had twenty-five acres of very high land in Connecticut. Behind the house, separated by some distance,  was a pool with a screened in porch. Beyond that, a very large, open meadow surrounded by woods.At thirteen, I was sitting in the screened-in porch with my younger cousins. They faced the house behind me, I faced the open meadow and woods. It was toward the end of the day, but still light out. It was then that I noticed two objects moving very slowly,traveling right to left, up above the tree line that skirted the large meadow. One was following the other. Moving slowly and silently. Then the strangest thing happened.The first traveling object just exploded. There was no reason for it. It just happened. It was a silent explosion. It just exploded into white and yellow burning light and its pieces just seemed to disintegrated as they fell. It didn&#39;t fall as a single large structure.It just broke up into chunks and each chunk- large to small burned up.  There seemed to be some smoke around each piece or chunk as it burned, but  no huge plumes.It just burned up and I saw little of it trail to the ground. It happened very fast. The strangest thing was that the disc traveling not far behind it was completely unaltered by all of this. It just kept traveling its course as if nothing had happened. Amazed, I ran inside to get the adults of which about five hurried outside with me. There we saw the surviving disc still making its way silently, slowly over the tree line until it suddenly,very abuptly, dove down sideways into the woods between two large trees. The only thing I could think of that could be of any interest there is that this is the location of a very deep, small pool of water left over from an old quarry.Yet, the disc seemed to almost instantly shoot straight back up.Changing its direction to come over the meadow and straight toward us! It went directly over our heads not any higher up than a large tree. I actually stood under it as it passed. The sun was setting in the distant valley below us, but it was still twilight with plenty of light to see. It was classic disc shape, flat bottom smallish hub on top- unified color. I seem to remember the texture of panels, but not sure. Over head it was a darkened metal color - yet as it traveled off into the valley below us and the setting sunlight hit it, I noticed it was shinning silver. When it went over my head I felt no fear, I think because there was no sound. It seemed surreal. I would say robotic! I felt no wind, no rush of air nothing. We all silently watched it sail off into the valley below us like one would watch a hot air balloon, totally unalarmed. All my aunt said was that it was a UFO and that she recently had been coming back on the New Jersey Highway with my Uncle when about thirteen UfOs appeared traveling down the road. She said people just got out of their cars and stared at them.We thought it was neat we got to see them. We didn&#39;t feel scared or threatened or that we had to call someone.I remain unfrighten by them. I feel they&#39;ve been around for so long that if they wanted to have ended us, they would have done so long ago.I feel I am luck to know something personally about the world others have to still guess about.Yet, now I am left with intense curiosity. How did the craft and explosion emitt no sound?  Why did the other disc following behind the first just keep going and remain unaltered? Why did it shoot so quickly into the woods? And most of all, why did it chose to come right over us. Did it want to see us too? I don&#39;t know, but I hope I get to see another UFO in my life time it was great!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was very dark, while walking along I noticed that there were strong shadows from the pine trees growing north east of me.  I looked to see a very large round bright object or light.  It appeared to be stationary and hovering in the air no more than 300 meters away.  I know it was close becuase it was positioned between myself and a new water tower under construction across a small valley from my location.  It was on a heading to the north east of me at less than a 30 degree angle up.  There was no noise at all but it was very oviously not any noral aircraft due to lack of noise and closeness to the ground no more than 100 ft or so.  I ran to get my friend about whose house was fifty yards away but lost sight of object when I went to door.  WHen we came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/1/69 21:00|New Castle|PA|Oval|50 minutes plus|This was in 1969 and I was only 16. There were eight of my family and friend that witnessed this event. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89879.html|22|ndxe196908| This was in 1969 and I was only 16. There were eight of my family and friend that witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO sighting in 1969  It was a warm summers night in Princeton Pa. and I was visiting my girl at her house.  Unlike today communicating with your family could be a problem. You see back in those days we were lucky if we had land phones in our houses. Many of these phones were still the old party line phones too. So there could be a long wait at times to get to use your own home phone, unless of course you interrupted the conversation of those who were using it and asked them to allow you the use of the line. Fortunately for me such was not the case on this particular night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girl and I were at our favorite spot which was right beside her little record player in a room in her downstairs. We were listening to some of our favorite tunes on single 33 records. Those old record players were cool because you could load up a half dozen or so records and not have to change them every 3 minutes. It was the high tech of the day! At least for what we could afford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we listened to some songs the phone rang and I was told it was for me. When I took the call my Mother was on the other end and she was quite excited about something that was outside of our house. She asked me to get home as soon as I could to see this object which she claimed was floating above our farm. I told my girl friend about what Mom had said and we piled into my car to go see it.  She had a younger brother who wanted to go so we let him this time.  I had only been driving since Oct. of 1968. Which was about nine month&#39;s total. So it was always cool to get in my 57 Chevy and speed down the road. Today you can hardly get me to drive anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were only 5 miles from my place so it took no time for us to make the trip. As we topped the last of several little hills on the way we could see an amber colored object in the sky hovering above Mom and the rest of my family. They were all standing in our driveway looking up at this thing. The object did not move the whole time we approached the house and parked the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got out of the car it was still hovering over the trees. It covered the house and the road and some trees across the road. It was huge, at least four times the size of our home and it was silent. It made no noise at all. The object was not like many UFO&#39;s that we had seen on T.V. reports. Most of those were blurry movie film and camera stills. This was crystal clear and it was amber in color. I say clear because we had no trouble making out that it was nothing like any of our aircraft. The only thing was that its color came from a light that was around the whole craft. We could see what appeared to be a disk shaped metal craft inside of the amber light. We could not see any markings on it or any windows or doors. It looked solid in the light and it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well silent that is for most of the time. What this craft would do was hover over the trees and house for approximately five minutes. After that amount of time it would turn on some kind of device which sounded like a very large vacuum cleaner. The noise from the craft lasted only a minute or so and then it would stop. Every time the noise stopped the craft would shoot straight up until we could barely see it. It went so quickly that we could only see a streak of orange light trail behind it. It would stay up there a little while then it would shoot straight back down at us. It came down so fast we thought it would hit us. Lucky for us it always stopped at tree top level. It repeated these sounds and the up and down manuvers for approximately an hour. I do not know how many times but I will guess a dozen or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this event down one more time for my children and their children too have a record of. I believe it is worth remembering. I do not have any memory of an abduction of any of us that night. Even though the craft behaved strangely and returned so many times. If I believed that hypnotizing someone is actually possible I would be hypnotized just to remember the event better and hopefully find out if there were any abductioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did try to contact the police but that was a joke. They laughed at us and said yea right then hung up the damn phone. Ever since this experience I have not trusted any policeman to help me out of any fix. Of course it was 1969 and people then were a lot less inclined to believe that there were any UFO&#39;s in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The little picture I linked to this post is eeriely reminiscent of that night. However, the light from the craft did not shine out from it like a flash light. It just enveloped the craft and barely light up the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing before I close, the book of Ezekiel speaks of a craft that the prophet saw in a vision. If you study hard you will see that Ezekiel&#39;s craft was a bright shiny amber colored object. (amber is the color of a highly polished brass/bronze metal)  I have wondered many times if our sighting was of the same craft!<n>
8/1/69 20:30|Fort Lauderdale|FL|Light|3--5 minutes|1969 summer Ft. Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60980.html|23|ndxe196908| 1969 summer Ft. Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 and living with my married sister (26) while she was pregnant in a residential area of Fort Lauderdale, FL near the inter-coastal waterway. We went into her backyard, behind the pool to steal lemons off of her neighbor&#39;s lemon tree.  It was dark and a clear night. My sister exclaimed &amp; grabbed my arm &amp; pointed up towards the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> STRAIGHT UP was the brightest white light I&#39;d ever seen (brighter than a Klieg light), a pinpoint of white light that spiraled out in lines that were so even they could have been made with a &#39;compass&#39;... the pinpoint of light continued to shine as the spiraling lines filled the entire upper horizon... but what was odd is that we could see through the widening white, spiraling lines... we could see the starry sky through the widening white lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next to the pinpoint of white light was a neon green cloud.  A cloud, like a white cloud you&#39;d seen on a blue-sky day, except this cloud was green and it glowed like a green neon sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood there with our mouths agape and watched this entire phenomenon for about 2 minutes... the white, transparent, WIDE spiral lines filled the entire upper horizon and then the white pinpoint just stopped emanating light and the green cloud took a few more minutes to fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, thousands of people in Ft. Lauderdale saw this and called into police.  NASA claimed the next day that it was a &#39;reflection off of a rocket that was shot over the ocean... as the sun was going down.&#39;  The only problem is, it was DARK, it was 8:30 PM and the sun sets on the Gulf/west side of Florida.  We were on the east side of Florida, quite close to the Atlantic ocean (perhaps 1 mile).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no way this was a reflection off a rocket as it was STRAIGHT UP and the pinpoint of light was emanating from above the earth (from space) and it shown down to the atmosphere where it spread out across the entire upper sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion, some superior visitors were taking a very large &#39;photo&#39; of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green cloud was translucent.

We were a crew of three professional airline pilots, with a cumlative flying experience of 50 years. As the object drew closer the approach speed slowed and it flew along beside us.  It showed three lights at the top and four at the bottom in a trapezoid shape, with a trailing colored glow at the rear. It changed altitude, up and down, as it flew beside us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A query to air traffic Control (USAF) resulted in no radar contact in the area.   As we descended to 6,500 the object descended with us in formation.  Upon approaching the bright lights of the city of Berlin, the object fled South at an incredible rate of speed.  After landing we found some other pilots who had witnessed a similar object, while flying into Berlin through the south air corridor, streaking south and climbing, at about the time it left us.  All agreed it was definitely under control and had better performance than any aircraft we&#39;d ever encountered before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

((name deleted)) was driving, suddenly I noticed to my right over the tree tops was a large silver disk that seemed to be rolling along the tree tops going a couple of hundred miles an hour and completely silent. I called it to Tom&#39;s attention and then suddenly the craft made a 90 degree turn and headed into space and was completely gone in about 5 seconds! Tom and I thought that we had witnessed a new secret Air Force fighter and scanned the newspapers for a couple of days for the story. We were near the infamous Wright-Patterson AFB and thought that the Aircraft had come from the base. ((name deleted)) and I were quite impressed with the Aircraft&#39;s performance! Thirty years later no such craft has been disclosed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of several reports submitted by same source.  PD))<n>

I looked up to the south. From my position you could see about 50 yards across a vacant lot, then a raised railroad track, which blocked any other houses or sceenery. What I saw very clearly, just beyond the tracks and about, 200-300 feet high, was a huge craft, floating silently and slowly from west to east. This craft was about 80-100 yards long and 30 yards wide with 6 spheres connected by smaller cylinders. A sphere at each corner of the rectangle and a sphere in the middle of each longer side, all white to silver in color. I was amazed but not scared. I really had no idea of UFO&#39;s at that time. I pointed and looked back to my mother. I looked again and it was still moving across the sky. I looked back to my mother and grandmother to get their attention but they were having a serious conversation and did not acknowledge me. I looked back to the object and it was already fading out, and I watched as it simply dissappeared. I looked back and forth to mom and the sky and I didn&#39;t really know what to do. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t shout out, I felt a bit paralyzed or mesmerized. What I do know is from that day on I started acting very much more mature, and became disinterested in kid stuff, and grew to have a 160 I.Q. and seem to have an amazing grasp of the inner workings of the world. I&#39;m not saying that was even a result of this encounter, but something changed that day. I never talked about the sighting until years later with friends. And many years later I saw a craft with this same design in some science fiction movie, the name I don&#39;t know. The point being, I have drawings I made of the craft from 30 years ago, long before I could have possibly seen this design, and it begs the question did the movie&#39;s designer, accidentally design my craft, or have others seen this and made reports of it that could have been copied. I will include a drawing if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/69 03:00|Independence|MO|Sphere|2 hours|ASD Missouri MUFON reporting for witness re:  1969 UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for Two Hours|6/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110467.html|27|ndxe196908| ASD MIssouri MUFON reporting for witness re:1969 UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for Two Hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1969 UFO sighting at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant Reported in June, 2014 to ASD of Missouri MUFON<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received a call from the witness regarding his sighing of a large UFO over Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in 1969.  The witness, who was told to keep quiet about the event, recently decided to come forward in order to let the public know that an unidentified object hovered and moved about the plant for two hours in the middle of the night and was witnessed by at least 13 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary witness, age 22 at the time, was living in Independence, Missouri and working as a civilian contractor at Lake City.  Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is a 3,935-acre U.S. government owned, contractor-operated facility located in eastern Independence near 7 Highway and 28 Highway.  The plant manufactures ammunition for the military for the U.S. Army.  In addition, Lake City performs small caliber ammunition stockpile reliability testing and has ammunition and weapon testing responsibilities as the NATO National and Regional Test Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness worked the night shift from midnight to eight O’clock A.M. in the printing shop.  On a hot August night in 1969 the electricity for the entire plant and all buildings suddenly went out, so the crew of seven in his department went outside to cool down.  That is when they noticed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright chrome spherical object hovered just over a building which was located four buildings away from the men’s position.  The object was so bright it was blinding.  The object then slowly moved over another building across the road and hovered, then continued to zig-zag back and forth across the road from building to building for approximately two hours.  The seven men on the crew with the witness talked amongst themselves while watching the UFO.  At the same time, several jeeps with MP’s were driving to and from the area very quickly, which is something the men had never witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From their vantage point on the dock they could not see other people on the property at other buildings, but believe that everyone working there must have been outside since there were no fans running and the temperature was over 100 degrees that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unidentified object then left the area by shooting up into the sky at a 30 degree angle at an incredible speed. Raymond said that it was gone in ½ of a second, and that solidified the fact that the men were looking at a real UFO and not a military craft of any type. Just as the UFO exited, the electricity came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, two men arrived at the office that no one working there had seen before. One was dressed in a gray suit and the other in black.  One of the men said to everyone “Remember that you have all signed a security clearance and you did not see anything.”  The men then turned and left.  They did not introduce themselves or show any identification.  The message was clear, and the witness kept his mouth shut for 45 years.  But after seeing an episode of Hangar 1 in which Missouri and the Kansas City area were featured as a UFO Hot Spot he decided to come forward with the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Margie Kay, Assistant State Director for MUFON-MISSOURI, for sharing the interesting report with our Center.
