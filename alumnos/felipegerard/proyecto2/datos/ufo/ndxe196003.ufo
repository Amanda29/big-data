It was lighting up the whole sky, whole neighborhood.  Curiously no one seemed to notice but me.  I was outside with my telescope.  I trained telescope on the object and saw triangular shaped object sitting on platform on top of the trinagle was a light flashing gold and white.  Along the bottom of the platform was a row of blue and gren lights blinking in alternate succession.  I tcame to stop across the street from where I was standing, approximately 75 feet away and about 60 feet up in the air.  It was making no sound.  I saw it clearly with the telescope.  It left after about five minutes, shooting straight up into sky like rocket taking off and was gone in less than a second.  Later it came back, the whole house lit up in inside with this bright golden light like you saw in episode of X files where mulder&#39;s sister is taken.  Remember this was thirty years or more before the X files was even heard of.  I saw three figures in our house, the classical big eyed, slant eyed greyish white aliens.  But at that time I had never even heard of such a thing!    my father saw these figues too, up closae since they were in his bedroom.<n>
