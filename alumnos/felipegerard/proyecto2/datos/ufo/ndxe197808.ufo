Directly across the road were four semi detached houses and a huge silver ball above them. It had the same kind of shine you get from turned aluminium, like someone had stuck christmas decorations in the sky. To the right was a lane filled with a small copse of trees and across the road on the skyline there stood a hirise block of flats, above the entire lenght of one of the blocks was a silver cigar/cylinder shaped object. There was no sound, and I guess I sat and stared at these things for about 3 mins. It wasn&#39;t scarey it felt kinda peaceful, but then it occured to me to go get a grown up so I ran inside but by the time I&#39;d convinced my mum to come and have a look they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time we lived about 2 miles upwind from a chemical complex so theres no way you could ever smell anything but sulphur so I can&#39;t say if there were any accompanying smells.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve read alot of ufo stuff over the years in order to try and solve this one for myself, but so far nope. The ball wasn&#39;t the moon and the cigar thingy wasn&#39;t quite the right shape for a zepplin, the closest descriptions I&#39;ve ever come across have been here so I&#39;ll share this now with more brains in the hope someone can work it out. Growing up where I have I&#39;ve seen the prototype probes and delta winged aircraft, so I&#39;m aware of some of the more peculiar objects in the sky at weird hours, but short of viewing a 5th dimensional object I can&#39;t explain this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I spotted an object fifty feet in the air as large as a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back to where I was staying that night after dropping off a friend, I was driving up a road in Avon CT. when I saw a bright light up ahead, I thought this was unusual for this time of night. I proceeded up the road and when I got to where the light basically was coming from there was no light present, I looked arond in curiousity and discoverd an object the size of a house hovering about fifty feet in the air, It was basically a half moon and visability was good, this object was very dark and large, there were no lights on and it made no noise what so ever. I parked my car in the middle of the road and left it running with the lights on hoping someone would come down the road to witness this as well. I stood still in one spot staring at this object for about 5 min fearing what it would be capable of doing. I looked around and saw a house that had it&#39;s lights on so I ran over to it and knocked on the door, I waited for a couple of minutes but nobody answerd, I ran back to where my car was and the object was still there. I became so scared I jumped in my car and drove off quickly, as I went to the stop sign at the end of the road I looked up and the object had followed me all the way down the road, I turned to the left and saw the object was still following me, I floored the gas and never looked back again, it took me over a month to tell anyone else but eventually I told my parents, we ended up moving to an area basically right where this event occured and a neighbor saw the same thing almost one year to date later, she described the exact same event I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have also recently discoverd coasttocoast on am radio and have been listing to it nearly every night.  Some of the stories we hear on it have brought back a flood of memories to my wife and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have two stories which occurred about 24 hours apart.  I don&#39;t know if they are somehow related or just coincidence.  I think it&#39;s important to relay that I am a G.I. Brat who was raised on Air Force Bases throughout the US as well as Germany and England.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after high school I joined the Air Force where I was trained as an Air Traffic Controller.  After leaving the service, my girl friend (now my wife of 26 years) and I took a trip from Ohio to Florida.  While in route to Florida we stopped to spend the night in my van.  During the wee morning hours of Aug 26, 1978, I recall having the scariest most vivid nightmare of my entire life.  I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my girlfriend of two weeks to death.  For years I could recall in vivid detail the majority of the nightmare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But now, two and a half decades later, I can only remember bits and pieces.  I can recall running and hiding in the ruins of city buildings, dodging ray like beams which were fired from numerous disc shaped craft hovering over the city.  I don&#39;t remember seeing any movies prior to this dream that might have led to it, but since the dream, I&#39;ve seen many war of the world type movies that always bring back little flashes of my nightmare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife says I screamed for a long time after my dream, and even after I stopped, it took me quite a while to completely wake up and overcome the dream induced fear that took quite a few minutes to shake.  I remained shaken all the next day as we drove the rest of the way to Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing we wanted to do was see the beach.  So, at about 3 AM on Aug 27, 1978, we were laying on our backs in the sand on St. Pete Beach.  It was a beautiful totally clear night and we noted that the stars never looked so bright in Ohio.  A bright star caught my attention as it seemed to get brighter and bigger over a couple of minutes period.  We were trying to decide rather it was actually an airplane or if our eyes were just tricking us for starring so long.  It seemed to be at least five times larger than any other star in the sky, then it started.  It seemed like a normal size star had emerged from the larger one, then another.  At this point they had our undivided attention.  The smaller ones darted back and forth in erratic fashion for several minutes then darted off faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen before or since.  We talked about what we had just seen when several more darted out of what we were now calling the mother ship, and in like fashion darted around occasional disappearing as though they had gone back inside, zipping off into the distance etc.  As best we can remember there were between 6 to 8 lights that we watched come and go in no particular combinations.  Sometimes only one at a time sometimes groups of mixed numbers.  We watched in amazement for twenty minutes or more.  We can&#39;t recall rather or not any or all of the little lights had retuned to the big one, because what happend next kind of made what we had been watching insignificant.  The largest light hovering over Tampa Bay was obviously getting bigger and bigger and seemed to be comming in our direction.  What once looked like the largest star in the sky soon became the size of a dime at arms length, then a quarter.  As it grew larger it turned to a bright reddish orange.  By this time we were on our feet and my girlfriend was tugging on my arm trying to get me to leave.  It was at about this point that the quarter size light which seemed to be miles out to sea accelerated so quickly that in a matter of a couple of seconds it was directly overhead and appeared larger than the sun in the sky.  The beach lit up as though it was high noon as it soared over us.  At this point I had no choice but to run as my girlfriend was already heading for the van.  We did&#39;nt have far to run, but by the time we got in the van, the light had disappeared inland over St Pete.  We argued over rather or not to leave for less than a minute, then we could see the reddish orange ball returning in our direction very rapidly.  As one of us was now screaming bloody murder and jumping up and down, I thru it into drive and sped away.  There is absoluteley no doubt in our minds that we saw an extremeley large space craft which sent out a half dozen or so scout ships to explore the area over Tampa Bay and the city of St Pete Fl.  What we are unsure of is rather or not the nightmare the night before and the actual sightings are somehow connected.<n>

The object was moving slowly across the sky going east to west. After about 15-20 sec. object suddenly speed up to super sonic speed ( 20,000 mph ). At the time I thought it was heading down toward the Santa Rosa airport and attempted to track it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was 18 years old and lived and worked at a sawmill in Windsor. For some unknown reason I never mentioned it to anyone until a year after the incident. When I was alone with my thoughts the vivid memory would re- surface and I would wonder why I was unable to discuss the matter openly. I lived alone as the night watchman at the sawmill and had just finished dining alone at a German themed restuarant. It was dusk and no alchohol or drugs were involved.  I always wondered if other people saw the same thing that evening.<n>

I sensed something unusual and we began to run not even knowing why.  We hid behind an auto and watched this craft hover silently from the east to west. It was right over head and it hovered to a stop right above us.  It was in plain sight during broad daylight.  As it hovered above us, it started to glow, an aura around it. It was glowing a greenish color.  I also observed that it had what looked like a circle of red in its center like a neon light.  It remained still for about 1 minute then slowly curved toward the south and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This area of Montauk hwy had old trees which lined both signs of this two lane road, and being older trees the branch and leaves from one side of the street to the other formed a tunnel apearance over the roadway. I was driving behind a dark green Volkwagon Karmenghia, who was pulling of to the right to stop, I pulled behing this car, the reason I did this, is that there where incredible lights in all sorts of colors coming through the canopy above us. I stopped and got out of my van, and a woman exited her car, we both starred up trying to make sense of what we were seeing. She asked me and I quote &#34; DO you see this or am I going crazy?&#34; As I starred up certain clearing through the trees revealed the enormous size of this what appeared to be huge disk. I looked out toward the horizon as this thing appears to be lifting higher, it was then that I realized that as far as I could see in any direction, only the edge of this craft could be seen, and none of the low light left at dusk. I retrospect, there was no sound, no wind, and to this day, I still cannot recall another car coming up this busy road. It was if there was only myslef and this stranger from the VW. I was not frightened at all, it must be that your brain is in disbelief mode, and you don&#39;t have time to be scared. In what seemed to be about 10 to 15 seconds the disk rose up, I got in my van and looked through a clearing where you could view the entire shape. It moved two more times each time it did it shrunk to a fraction of its size at least in the distance from me to it. It moved so fast and in such straight lines and would stop on a dime, it moved one last time as it vanished. I never have seen anyhting like it, and I am 100% positive this was not from this world. My best desciption of what I saw, appeared to look like what Spielberg showed us in the Close Encounters movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We sat down for dinner.This seating area is outdoors and sits about three stories on a cliffside overlooking the beach and view is to the east. While having dinner I began to observe an apparent helicopter out on the ocean horizon with two very intensely brilliant search lights sweeping the water.I began to notice the other dinners pulling out cameras and mumbling to one another about this and taking many pictures. We finished eating and said goodnite to some friends and headed to room;all the while noticeing that the [helicopter]is slowly working its way towards shore and us. Now the layout of the resort is important.It is &#34;J&#34; shaped, in a cove,on the ocean,with thelong part juting out on a jetty which is where our room was. there is a break in between the building which alows you to get to the beach.We were right at this area about 30 feet from the water when al of a sudden we were lite up like Richard Druyfess in closs encounters of the third kind. I noted to my wife there is the helicopter.Less than 75 feet in the air and no more than 100 feet away.In amater of a few seconds I obseved the 2foot in dia.spotlite turn red as it began to fade of.As it is going out I see that the red color is the filement in the center of the lite and there is a flame coming off it.At the same time Inotice a gas orfice pulling away from the back of the lite and both the lite and gas line are retracting into the bottom of the craft.Also lights[small] are now apearing around the helicopter so I thought!With absolote excitement I now realize that I am looking at a 30 foot in dia. flying saucer, so closs I could hit it with a coffee cup.As I turn to my wife and say it , she is already gone, running scared and screaming for me to get away.I off course noway. I stayed riht there. I observed now that! it has rectangular windows around its perimeter,that everone having dinner above us on the cliff is takeing pictures like it was at arock concert and some were screaming.You see that I now notice that there are 3ET&#39;s near the windows. There were two to the right side of the saucer and they were WAVEING HELLO!, to the other people haveing ddinner and then I notice the one looking strate at me. I now know what it means to have your hair stand up on the back of your neck!!!!! It was the most fearfull thing I have ever felt in my life. They were the &#34;GRAYS&#34;; without a doubt!!!!!After about 1 minute with out any noise, it began to head out over the ocean. At about 150 yards out you could hear jets comeing. The British military began chasing them. And off they went out off site.The next morning just after 5a.m.,around sunrise my wife shakes me awake.&#34;A-----,she says I dont&#39;know how to say this but a they wre just here.&#34;I said who???She tells me that someone just layed her down on the bed. When she oened her eyes there at the foot off the bed et was standing there It raised one hand and waved and lept right out out balcony door about 10 feet never touching the rail. I noted also that I was under the covers and she was on top off them....That day on the beach people said that we should have been there the night before there was a dozen [flying saucsers buzzing the island......<n>

About to celebrate our 30th wedding aniversary.  Yet I will remember this as long as I live, as though it happened yestreday!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Married 8/19/78. arrived in bermuda for honeymoon 8/22/78.  We arrived around noon.  We stayed at a resort called The Reefs Beach Club. The resort is situated on a [u] shaped cove on a small cliffside. Around 7:30 in the evening we went to dinner. The area where dinner is served sits above the cove beach, about 2 stories up, overlooking the ocean and our room; which was off to the left down a long walkway and from our view appears as though it was situated on a jetty. You could fish from our balcony. It is now sunset and we are having dinner with friends and I notice off to the east what appears to be a helicopter with two big searchlights sweeping the water, out on the horizon. I notice the other guests are seeing this also. I also observed a man in a dark suit,sitting just behind me at a table with a camera and long telephoto lense, snapping away pictures like crazy. He was so out of place; in a suit and alone at a resort. After dinner we were headed to the beach for a walk. The break between the building was just outside our room. We were standing in between; about 30 feet from the water,when suddenly we were lighted up like R.Druyfus at the railroad crossing in close encounters of the third kind! An intensly white spotlight from the helicoprter was shinning on us no less than 100 feet in the air and 100 feet close.I am looking at this for a few seconds as the light starts to dim, I can see the element in the spot light glowing red as a flame inside burnes off, also what appears to be a gas line retracts from the rear of the light with a flame burning from that also.They both retract into  the bottom of the copter, So I thought.I look at my wife and exclaim thats no copter; its a flying saucer. I look to my right and the only thing I see is my wife running to our room yelling get away from it. I say come back , its not everyday you see one o! f these, and she yells I do not want them to take me again!Knock me over with a feather,I make note of that but continue to check it out. Its still hovering, about 35 feet in diameter.with a bank of rectanguler windows completly around its upper circumferance, several red lights appeared on its top part but went off when the spotlight did. I now notice all the people upon the balcony where we had dinner.They are screaming and yelling about it and takeing pictures. Flashbulbs going off like at the end off a rock concert. Hey I have one in my hand. A keystone 110 everflash camera ;it does not work ;great, but if I turn it around you use the lense finder as a binoculer.Thats what I did. O my God! I can see two et&#39;s to the right of the saucer waving to the people on the balcony I then realize one is to the left and looking straight down at me I now know what it means to have your hair stand on the back of your neck. That thing looked through me,not just at me.The et&#39;s were definately the grays as described by others.Those big black eyes. I will never forget them.I then notice the gray that was looking at me turn its head to its left. The saucer then starts to move out over the ocean. It is behind my apartment for a few seconds as I run to my left towards the end of the jetty wall . It is now already 200 yards offshore and riseing. I now hear thunder behind me getting louder and realize the RAF is sending jets after it If only I had a camcorder I would have them both on film at the same time.and just   like that they are gone.Its now about 11 pm and we decideto call it a day. We go to sleep and about 4 am My wife wakes me. Wake up,Wake up;they we just here. I said who , she says the space people. I said what? She says someone just laid me down on the bed .I look over and she is on top of the covers I am under. I woke up to see the gray alien at the foot of the bed turn towards me lift his right hand and wave; he them turned and hopped into the air and out our balcony door. I quick jump out of bed to look and of cours! e nothin g is there.That day on the beach we asked others about what they saw and they said we should have been ther the night before as there were dozens of saucers buzzing the island . They thought we under an invasion. This storey is also partially documented in the Bermuda Royal Gazette Newspaper 8/21/78 and 8/22/78 The headline reads close encounters of the bemudian kind. P.S. Also with all of the many pictures ever taken that night, I havenever seen a one posted anywhere!<n>

The object was roughly about 150 feet long, and 40 feet high, with a light shining in the left front corner.  We watched this object for about 10 minutes, it made no sound.  It then slowly moved east ascending in a spiral before it shot straight up faster than anything i&#39;ve ever seen and dissapeared.  We have never reported this experience and would like to find others from the area that may have seen this object in this time frame.<n>

It was just as the last rays of the sunset were lighting up a few clouds to the West. It was at that time that we noticed a saucer shaped craft above us, it was approximately 80 deg. from the horizon. There were 3 other people besides us also in the immediate vicinity, (within earshot that is).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember making the comment that &#34;We are now experiencing a UFO people.&#34; The 50 yd diameter craft was remarkably close, only about 150 yards away. We saw many details on the craft, not all of which we can remember. It moved silently and very slowly for 100 yards or so from west to east. It then changed direction to go away from us in a southerly direction at an ever increasing speed. We watched the craft until it was out of sight. My wife and I then proceeded to our car which was parked across the street and we left the area going on Hwy. 12 south. When we had reached an area that was approximately near where County Hwy. U crosses Hwy. 12, it was already nightfall. It was at that time that we saw what we have assumed is the same craft, however it was brilliantly lit up with a wide lateral band around the craft. We noticed that it was a very complicated pattern of everchanging multi-colored lights. Now this was 1978, it has only been recently that I have compared the lights! to what today we would call a very complicated screensaver or even fractal color display. I pulled the car over to get a better look, but my wife looked very terrified, so i pulled back onto the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw. I have worked for many years in the aerospace business as a R&amp;D machinist. I know it was not of this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I am reporting it for record only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1:00 AM my wife and I were driving home.  At the intersection of Corbin Ave. and Osgood Ave., we were turning the corner, and to my left I saw two glowing orbs falling directly downward from the sky.  One was red and the other green.  We were about 100 yards from them.  They were soon hidden behind some pine trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove quickly up Osgood which was a hill to see if I could see where they went.  When we reached the top we saw the red orb fly at a fast rate of speed toward Hartford which is visible in the distance from that position.  In approximately four seconds it was out of sight.  We did not see the green one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the surface of the orbs I saw a lot of movement.  It looked like the surface of the sun.  This may possibly be ball lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later a relative said a friend of hers say the same things dropping from the sky the same time as I did but was not in a position to see either one fly off.  I did not tell her I saw the same thing before that.<n>

A window, if you will, dome to a flatter verses round shape, seemed to be the front top 1/2 to a 1/4 of craft.  It appeared that two human forms where in this window with like a panel in front of them, like a desk or control board?  I say human forms because they seem to have a round shape for a head, shoulders with arms, a body-trunk.  I could not see faces, clothing, skin, nor hair.  Just the shape of a human form, two I believe, in this window area of the craft.  This craft was that close!  Just above the tree tops.  I&#39;m not sure if it was adrenalin from fear but my lips rolled on my teeth!  Not a drop of saliva was in my mouth.  I slowed for only moments, I&#39;m sure, and drove away very fast with my heart pounding!  My brother and I never uttered a word at the time.  I was 17 years old he was 12 years old.  I lived on my own in a cabin on the Chocolay River that feeds into Lake Superior not far down stream.  This was very close to KI Sawyer Air Force Base, which was active at this time.  I called the air base and reported the sighting.  I&#39;m not sure with whom I spoke but I was told there was nothing on the radar, as if they&#39;d tell me if there was, and that if it was just above the tree tops they wouldn&#39;t see it on radar.  Still so frightened my little brother slept with me that night, one bedroom cabin but he could of slept on the couch.  I had lace curtains on the two pain (one on top of the other) slide up windows. Close to the ground, if you where outside the bottom of the window would be at waist level.  I had no way to totally close the outside form inside.  This craft, I swear, hovered over my cabin about two miles from the incident not long after I had arrived home and called the Air Force Base with report.  My little brother and I just clung to one another with fear, light from this craft shown through the windows of the bedroom.  Now I wa! s use to B-52 flying over constantly and never had this happen before or after this incident.  From that day on until about 4 years ago, I&#39;ve moved out of the area, i.e. state, I had dreams, which is nightmares of UFO’s in the sky there down by the Chocolay River and by my home on Silver Creek Road, all in close proximity of incident.  My brother and I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t speak of this incident.  I&#39;m now 42 years old and he&#39;s 37.  We both have families of our own now and have not experienced some thing like this since.  Of course as time has gone on I&#39;m sure he has as well as my self, talked ourselves into believing it didn&#39;t happen.  Yeah know what?  Some thing did happen and we couldn&#39;t explain it and still can&#39;t.  So for what it&#39;s worth this is my UFO story.  Every one doesn&#39;t have one, I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After so much information became public I started to mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the fall of 1978 I was working at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center and living on the military base.  As a friend and I were entering the rear gate, I looked over at him and something caught my eye.  I told him and he looked over and saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled off the road onto the dirt shoulder and saw a car behind us also pull over.  We sat there for maybe 10 min. and watched this saucer type UFO (rounded dome on both top and bottom and the saucer type middle) hanging over the middle of town.  An illuminated cloud surrounded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, it all of a sudden swooshed back really fast heading south west it just flew faster than anything we had in 1978 or now.  The illuminated cloud hung there for quite a few minutes the cloud dissipated and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Gentleman I was with and I talked about what we saw.  We both saw the exact same thing.  I’m assuming the car behind us saw the same thing since we both did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a small town I expected something would be published in our local newspaper but it never was.  After so long of not finding it in the newspaper I decided to put aside and not mention it.  Our town at that time had maybe 12000, 13000 people and some one other than us must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1996 while still living in Ridgecrest I was headed west on hwy.178 and then south on hwy.14 to pick up 178 again after a few miles.  While I was climbing up the hill a light caught my eye.  It was speeding fast and was a completely round bright light.  I watched as it went behind the peaks and then into the clear and then back behind the next peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, I feel really stupid seeing two UFO’s in my lifetime but I did. I still remember the name of the man I was with and know where he went back to his hometown.  He was a very nice honest person and so am I.  I would even be willing to take a lie detector test.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I visited Roswell NM in April and after seeing all of the information there I decided to inform someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 65 yrs, old and not in great health.  I would like to find out what professionals like you think of it, especially since we were on a military town.  The object was not over the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Next made a bee line to our car, then shot straight up. Awesome color as it shot skyward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell mention that he would like people to report their UFO sightings, even if they are in the distant past.  My incident occurred in the summer of 1978, sometime in August.  My father was a pilot on many occassions flew the family to California to visit relatives.  We returned to the Pendleton airport and were on the way home when the indident occurred.  It happened approximately half way between Pendleton and Athena in the state of Oregon.  I was only eight at the time, and as a child could never sleep in the car.  The car we owned at the time was an Audi, which had a shelf-like dash behind the rear seat.  I often used the shelf as a rest as I looked out of the rear window to view what we had passed.  That night was no different, and I rested my elbows on the shelf and looked out the window.  The sky was overcast, as evident by the lights Pendleton reflecting off the low clouds, but the ceiling was relatively high due to the fact that the red warning light was visible on a tower located on Cabbage Hill.  The object in question was seen soon after turning around in the back seat to look rearward.  Before the object was actually seen, a pulsating glow was first observed through the clouds that appeared greenish in color.  A few seconds after noticing the change in cloud color a turquoise-green ball of light appeared as it dropped from the cloud ceiling.  It hovered exactly half the distance between the cloud ceiling and the ground, just to the left of the towers on Cabbage Hill.  The object emitted enough light to reveal the trees and grasses around it.  The object remained hovering for several more seconds, and the best way to describe its action was as if it was looking for something.  Our car was the only car on the road for as far as the eye can see, and it didn&#39;t take long for the object to pick something out.  In a flash the object was streaking directly toward us, and it took no more than two or three seconds to traverse the distance that seperated us from it.  I was unable issue a warning partly because I was frightened and partly due to the rapidity of the entire event. I thought that the object was going to hit us, when it shot straight up and disappeared into the clouds.  I feel that it is important to emphasize that the at no time that the object moved was there any type of arcing trajectory or slow graceful movements.  All movement and change in direction was rapid, quick, and at angles I know could not be made by conventional aircraft.  When the object shot straight up into the sky the entire interior of the car and the surrounding area turned a brilliant turquoise colored, no other color could be seen.  It was as if everything had faded to turquoise. Everyone else in the car was asleep, except for my father who was driving, and did not witness the incident.  My father only withnessed the aftermath of the object&#39;s departure as the world around us turned that brilliant color.  Events immediately after the sighting is fuzzy, and I am not sure if my father pulled over, or continued to drive, but I then told him what I saw.  sometime later he contacted one of his buddies in the Airforce that had some knowledge of certain aircraft and asked him if he knew of any experimental aircraft that looked like, and could move like the object I had described; he said no.  Rumor has it that the object harrassed a nearby airplane and then was seen near Mcnary dam on the Columbia river.  Although the event lasted no more than ten seconds, the memory and detail is embedded in my brain as if it happened yesterday. I know that this event happened quite a long time ago, but I figure that it is better late then never when reporting the incident.  I&#39;m sure your organization can use this information to establish a timeline regarding this type of object.  I didn&#39;t report this incident not because I was afraid of being branded a kook or a weirdo, but rather because it happened so long ago.  I am also aware that many of the sightings are associated with natural or man made aircraft.  This object was in no way, shape, or form a conventional aircraft.  I have also been told that what I had seen was St. Elmo&#39;s Fire or ball lightening.  I&#39;ve seen St. Elmo&#39;s Fire associated with the numerous types of aircraft I have flown in while in the army, and I have seen the beautifully graceful movements of ball lightening while in Panama, again while in the army.  There is no way that the actions and speed of the object that I saw could be described by either of these types of natural phenomenon.  I thank you for your time and appolagize for the age of this report.<n>
8/15/78 22:00|Heath|MA|Circle|several minutes|Parked in car on isolated road, object with flashing lights desended over the car.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34024.html|18|ndxe197808| Parked in car on isolated road, object with flashing lights desended over the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1978, the month and day are approximate to my best recollection, as this happened over 20 yrs. ago. The event took place on Dell Road in the town of Heath, Mass, approximately halfway up the road. I owned property on the left side of the road at that time and a friend and me were basically just camping out on the properyt and parking alongside the road. The location of the event is fairly close to the Rowe Nuclear Power Plant and sightings at that time were very common around that nuclear power plant, unfortunately at the time there was no way to report such encounters. My friend and I had come back from Greenfield a little before 10PM after getting dinner and had parked in the location described (right side of road facing uphill). We were sitting in the vehicle (I was in the driver&#39;s seat) listening to the radio and relaxing when we suddenly noticed swirling lights all around us. It kind of startled us, we thought maybe a police car had pulled up behind us and was wondering what we were doing parked in such an isolated location. At least that was my first thought and my first comment. We were facing uphill and know there was no vehicle in front of us. I thought it had to be behind us, I rolled down my window and looked to the rear of the vehicle and there were no other vehicles on the road. I then looked up and there was a huge, very huge, object just above the treetops covering us and both sides of the road with lights underneath, the only way I can describe the lights are flashing and swirling. The exact size of the object had to be at least 40 feet in diameter and absolutely silent, it made not one bit of noise! At that point, I rolled up my window, started up the vehicle and slammed it into gear and took the uphill road with the pedal to the floor and did not look back. When we got to the top of the hill we parked at Heath Center, just past the town hall. At that point we weren&#39;t quite sure what happened. We just watched up through the windshield up into the sky! We felt a little safer being in the proximity of several houses rather than an isolated road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the first experience I had there, but there were more to come, which I will also post on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we turned onto the dirt road that led to the campground we observed a large saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 ft. from our car.  It made absolutely no sound and sat motionless as we watched it.  As we drove away I spotted it flying over a lake at an unbelieveable rate of speed and then it rose to about 100 ft. and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors had taken me camping in Steubinville and Mrs. **** and I had been shopping at a local department store.  I recall the time because the store closed and we had to leave. We drove along a very rural road and as soon as we reached the dirt road that the campground was located on we spotted a large object in the field to our right.  It was very close to the road. My neighbor stopped the car and we just sat there and watched it.  It made no noise whatsoever and it appeared to be hovering approximately ten feet off of the ground.  There were red, blue and white lights blinking around the middle in a sequence that, at that time, I had never seen before (I have since seen laser Christmas lights that resemble them).  There was a very bright white light imminating from the center of the bottom that lit the ground beneath it.  I think there may have also been a small light on top but I&#39;m not certain.  I also don&#39;t recall the color of the object. We watched it for several minutes and eventually decided to leave.  We continued up the road and I happened to look toward the lake to our left and saw it again.  It was literally ricocheting around the lake.  This craft absolutely defied explanation.  It darted toward the bank at an unimaginable speed and then changed direction and headed toward the other bank.  This area was extremely hilly and, to this day, I know of nothing that could negotiate those kinds of turns at that rate of speed. It made a triangle shaped pass across the lake and then rose at an angle to a height of about 50 yards and then just shot off. I never told very many people about this incident but I&#39;ve always wondered exactly what it was that we saw.<n>

I started to experience static on my radio and slowed as I attempted to adjust it.  My car cut off in the middle of the street and I was unable to get it started again.  I noticed outside the drivers window a circle of light on the ground on the ground in a field next to the road.  I said to my passenger, &#34;I don&#39;t remember there being a water tower here?&#34; and when I looked again I noticed that this watertower had no legs.  The next thing I noticed was that there was no sounds.  This was especially odd as we were next to a small lake and dam where the water could be heard almost all the time.  There was no cricket or frog noices.  It was the loudest quite I had ever heard.  My friend became hysterically screaming and pounding on the dashboard of my car saying &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here!&#34;  Then I was compelled to get out of the car.  I remember thinking to myself that this was incredible and I wanted to remember it.  There was an old fence around the field that had some vine type growth on it and although I don&#39;t recall crossing it, I remember standing very near to the circle of light on the ground and noticing that the hairs on my arms were standing up and I was not cold.  I also noticed that there was no filteration of light from its source to the ground.  I could look across the circle of light into the woods at the edge of the field and it would appear as if no light was around.  There was no spreading of the light.  I wanted to remember this.  I looked up into the light source and saw what appeared to be a circler light the size of the stars in the sky.  However, it was only about 50 feet off the ground and the other stars seem to only be visible in a circle around the object, which was black as the sky, approximatley 50 feet from the center.  The light source had a 50 feet diameter length of blackness the same color as the sky around it and then you could see the other stars in the sky, so the craft was vertually invisible.  I looked over at my! friend, who was perfectly still in a pose that looked as if she stopped in mid stride of hitting the dashboard of the car.   I looked back and noticed grooves on the underside of the craft along with what appeared to be a flag and symbols and then the crafts light went out or it shot straight up until it looked exactly like its surrounding stars, no blackness around it any longer that was unusal compared to its neighboring stars anyway.  Then the star did a criss cross toward the north until I could no longer see it.  I was very excited about it and wanted to discuss it when we got home.  However, my passenger was unable to stay awake and two hours had passed that only seemed like a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I woke my friend yelling, &#34;get up if you want to see a ufo&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He got up, came to the window, and we watched for another few seconds before running out of the room and yelling for his sister to wake up and come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the three of us got outside, the object was still hovering, motionless, in the distance.  It was close enough that all the lights were clearly visible and a metallic shine came from the surface of the craft.  We watched as it sat perfectly still for another 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the craft took off, flew over our heads and toward the opposite horizon.  About halfway before getting to the other horizon, it immediately took a sharp 90 degree turn right, flew about a mile, and took another 90 degree turn left.  It then flew at an amazing speed before disappearing over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time that it took off until it was completely gone from sight over the opposite horizon was only about 6-8 seconds.

The first time, I saw three seperate lights forming a triangle,one light at each point. I said &#34;It&#39;s going to land! What I meant by that, I have no idea. I just blurted it out. As soon as I saw it, it was gone. The three lights were florescent pink. YES,florescent PINK. The person I was with saw nothing, heard nothing&lt; and felt it was huge. The next time,it was around 9:30 p.m., same as before. The same person was with me only this time he saw it!!He said he thought I was crazy but now he sees what I described before.Same color, only this time it was pointed up, one light at the top and two lights underneath, forming a triangle. THIS time there were two more pink lights under the two bottom lights,with pink smoke coming out of them, almost like it was landing! It seemed to be landing down by the Lake Champlain Ferry Landing and radio station. We drove to the place we thought it was and as soon as I got close to the Lake, all the hair stood up on the back of my neck, with an awful feeling I should mind my own business. I drove away as fast as I could and as soon as I got away from that spot, the uneasy feeling went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I will never forget it...It has been one of the most profound events of my life, and I think about it every so often....I was out running sprints up and down the street practicing for a high school track meet... The night was calm and clear...I ran about 150 yards or so and when finished put my hands on my hips and looked upward while gasping for breath...I immediately saw six star-like objects that appeared to be at an altitude that a small cub plane might fly at or even less...I was immediately transfixed and just stared at them for about two minutes...A car came by and I ran over to it to ask them to come and be a witness to this but they thought I was some kind of nut and just kept going...I ran back over just 30 yards or so back to where I was and stared at them some more...I knew in my heart and mind that this was something unique, and I began to feel as though I was having a religious experience-- I remember saying to them, &#34; Take me, but please bring me back...&#34;  Then all of a sudden, two of them left the irregular grouping and slowly traveled upward a little ways above the other four, and then they just stopped and stayed...I watched them even more intently then for just about 30 seconds or so, and then ( I will never forget this ) all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, these six star-like objects went from being totally stationary to taking off and getting in a single file formation while at a speed that was just totally unearthly...The only thing I can even compare it to is like watching fireflys fly...There was no noise, no sound, no flashing lights, no sonic boom, just simply an unreal experience...I estimate that they traveled 25 miles in less than 5 or 7 seconds...I have no way of knowing that, it is just a guess...I saw them travel in a southerly direction following Highway 301 South in the direction of a town that I knew to be 22 miles from where I was...It appeared t! hat they had traveled that far in that short amount of time as I watched them travel for as far as I could see with my naked eye on a clear night....They were like miniature stars, very bright white, but with no color or lights...They were silent and could move slow or EXTREMELY fast-- I know enough about physics to know that if there was a human being inside one of those objects, his body would have exploded like jello due to the G-forces ...But human beings in association with this event have never entered my thoughts-- I knew then as I know now and will always know, that these were not of this world...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was 21 years old and recently completed a 3 year tour of service in the U.S. Army.  Two of my friends and I had completed a day’s work and decided to have a beer, ( one 6-pack, we were by no means intoxicated)  We stopped on a back road outside Carbon Hill Alabama called “ Nubin Ridge “.   Which is the highest point around the small town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were talking, I was facing the direction this thing came from.  Then I saw a light in the top of the trees.  We were higher than the trees because of the lay of the land.  At first I thought it was a helicopter because the light lit up the tree tops and was coming towards us. I told the other guys to look.  Now this light was getting close (it was probably a quarter mile away when I first saw it ).  It was not going fast at all, Maybe 25 or 30 MPH.                                                                           !<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the actual light comes in to view.  It’s very bright and low to the ground, 500 ft or less. It gets within 2 or 3 hundred feet of us when I made out the shape of this craft, a triangle, black, and very large, I would say at least as big as a football field or bigger.  It goes right over us; the light actually lights up the road we’re standing on and never makes a sound. Being in the military,  I knew about aircraft, and this was nothing like anything I’ve ever seen, then or now.  I never told anyone for fear of looking stupid, especially back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was brought up in a christen home so that sort of thing was taboo.<n>

I was about a half hour away from my destination,and had taken the scenic route by mistake, I had not seen another car for a least a half hour before the incedent. It was just getting dark, and I noticed a bright light coming from the East almost in line with the utility poles on my left. The light seemed to be approaching at a steep angle downward and I slowed down thinking it may be a private plane in trouble! All I still saw was just a bright light but as I got closer it was getting lower I slowed down more thinking this (plane) was going to crash! right in front of me!! Then I saw it! it wasn&#39;t a private plane at all! and was now turning above me no more than (20 to 30 feet) above me! heading South moving very slowly 5mph at most,no sound noticed at all, it was a dull grey (sandblasted aluminum color object (reminded me of the melinium falcon in starwars movie)(sort of) (as I only saw the side view),alot of probes or antenna like structures sticking out of the sides and bottom! alot of  angles like different size boxes all stuck together in random fashion was what the craft looked like close up.The final and in a amazing and scary way was there was a face looking out the window at me! and it looked more scared than me!! the best discription is of the painting reffered to as (the scream)! As every time I see it I am reminded of that event! I is wierd but I do not recall watching it as it headed away from me, and at first somthing inside me said no way that just happened! When I eventually saw my cousin he said  &#34;what took you so long to get here&#34;,I said I took a wrong turn off the Highway and must have taken the scenic route,but I realized after is was alot longer than it should have taken. We went to the beach that night,I never mentioned it to anyone until years later, but I know what I saw, and feel privliged to have a close encounter of the (third kind) for the last 10 years I have ! been rea ding about all the information I can get my hands on, and of course the internet is one of the best tools to use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a supervisor for a large aerospace company located in Connecticut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened to me in 1977or1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As the &#34;craft&#34; came directly over our vehicle i was shocked to find that it gave off very little noise, just a pleasant humming sound. There were two vehicle coming to a stop on the opposite side of the road so, i know there were other witnesses to the sighting. I thought of stopping also to observe but, shortly after as i looked up and out of my window, the craft flew straight up and out of sight in the blink of an eye, again, without noise as you would expect.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a light in the Southern sky that looked like Venus to me and, as a joke, I told my brother &#34;Hey, look! There&#39;s a flying saucer!&#34; and I looked at him, waiting for him to call me a dork or something so I could tell him &#34;I made you look!&#34; But he didn&#39;t look back and his jaw dropped and I thought he was putting ME on so I looked and it looked like there was a black spot in the sky, about the size of a quarter at an arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became quickly obvious that the object wasn&#39;t flying _over_ us but rather was coming _toward_ us, so we stood up. In a matter of 30 seconds from my first sighting the object (and maybe a minute or two from when I first pointed it out) the object was directly overhead. We instinctively got out from under it as it descended, walking about 50 feet so we could take in the entire sight of it. I thought it might just land on the lawn and squish the house, and us with it! I&#39;d guess it was about 100-125 ft wide - it was wider than the house - and roughly six or eight feet thick. It hovered just a few feet over our parent&#39;s single story home, around 25 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a small steady red light at the N by NE side of the ship and was aspirin-shaped, cobalt blue in color - like gun metal. It had what looked like an observation deck on top of it with what appeared to be smoked-glass panes, set at 15 degree angles, just slightly tilted. I tried to see inside but I couldn&#39;t. Well, we stood there for a few minutes and I turned to my brother and asked him &#34;Is that a flying saucer?&#34; and he said &#34;what else could it be?&#34; and we both laughed. Then a white light started flashing on us. That happened for roughly 20-30 seconds. I looked for a bulb after it stopped but I couldn&#39;t see one. I looked at the underside of the disc and didn&#39;t see any markings or rivets, welds, etc. My Father was a welder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, the saucer started to hum like an electric motor and when the hum reached its peak or became in phase or whatever the whole disc sort of clicked visably - it moved just an inch or so and then started flying over the cow pasture next door. It was moving at a pace where anyone could walk along with it, 3-5 mph. After it flew over a few of the neighbor&#39;s houses it took off like a bat out of hell! It turned into a blur at a straight line toward the sea, to the West. After a couple seconds, it looked like someone drew a line of light from where it was on the horizon to the stars, roughly at a 45 degree angle and the end of the line eventually caught up with the point of origin and then it looked like a star for a second, and then the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent except for the humming before it took off and it didn&#39;t glow or anything. I wonder if anyone else in the area saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

One, in 1977 when I fell down from the tree, one of my legs was injured and my mom got angry about what happened because I was too naughty as a child. My mom punished me by flopping and then I heard the voice from unknown space in the sky. Everyone was shocked at that time, I looked around and then I saw one object looks like two plates combined together, one up and one down flying from that area. I noticed that the voice that object sounds as Khmer language, and if it is translated in English language, it was like this : &#34;You have to learn to teach your children, Do not hurt him.&#34;. It is also remarkable that the voice of speaking from that object sounds like sound of the alarm signal. Suddenly when everyone looked at around to see source of the voice, that object flying away and disappeared when the bright light covers it. And later at the same place I heard the sound as alarm signal, and about a few months later I heard clearly the voice of laughing and I saw not clearly a few images of the girls through the bamboo tree. and i talked to them that I want food and suddenly a table with a chair appeared in front of me. I sat on it, but when i want to eat that food. That food disappeared and the images of those girls also disappeared. The food was mango, tamarine, salt,.... It is remarkable too that I talked to those girls who laughed at me ( I thought so at that time), my words was that &#34;If you laugh at me again, I am going to ask my father, God to punish you.&#34; And later at another one place i have seen another sport plane flying and disappeared into the oval object when the bright light covers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was about 20 ft. off of my left wing.  It was about 3 feet in diameter, tan in color, and looked like a weather balloon except that it had no inflation nozzle, no radiosonde attached to it, and it was perfectly round.  Weather balloons have a teardrop shape to them when strapped to a weather gathering payload.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I circled back to get a closer look and noticed what appeared to be a red crecent moon or a hammer and scycle shape on it reminiscent of the emblem on the former Soviet flag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I circled around a second time to get closer look, the object moved away from me and maintained a distance of about 50 to 75 yard spacing between itself and my plane. When I became aware that the object could manuver, I was certainly rattled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to pursue the object about a minute or two but it accellerated away to the point that I could not keep up with it.  I was traveling at 120 knotts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scared, I opted to return to the Gadsden Airport.  When I arrived home, I reported the sighting to the Anniston Flight Service Station.  I believe the attendant at the FSS was unofficially impressed, but I don&#39;t know weather or not he officially filed my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the UFO to be either alien, a Top Secret USA probe, or the Russians aren&#39;t telling us something.  I maintain that what I saw was not a weather balloon and flew under its own power.  I strongly believe the markings were used camoflage the UFO to be from Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sound would have been similar to the sound made by dragging two heavy concrete objects (one on top of the other) in different directions. It was loud enough for us to take notice from some distance off. As we walked the trail we realized the sound was getting louder so we were getting closer. We came to an area in the forest with a small overgrown field and took note of the fact that the sound was coming closer and was on an intercept course with the field. This would give us the opportunity to check out what was making the strange sound. A sort time later three objects emerged. The objects were on the ground. The were in a triangular formation, they looked like pyramids tipped on their sides, they alternated in colour between brown and orange, the colour seemed in radiate at a low intensity from their interiors, they were about 4-5 feet tall and moved a 2-3 mph. They maintained a constant course and speed. We ran after quietly freaking for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Within in one to two seconds they had crossed the sky. My first impression were that they were high flying jets. It was hard to comprehend...to cross the sky that high that fast. Then within 30 seconds, the event repeated. White dots streaking across the sky in a straight line, west to east. I continued to see white dots streak across the sky, in the same line of path, every 30 seconds or so.

We were listening to my transistor radio; it was after midnight and the guys were inside the cottage.  We had consumed no alcohol or drugs and were just enjoying the cool, rather misty night, and each other&#39;s company.  We worked together at an advertising agency during the week, at Yonge Street &amp; Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, we heard a very faint whirring sound behind us overhead, and both looked up above the cottage roof where it originated from, at the same time.  What we saw there was this...a large, silver object which appeared perfectly round, beaming some kind of light on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our jaws dropped, and we simply sat there frozen, stunned and terrified for a few seconds, which was how long it took me to receive a silent communication which was,&#34;you&#39;re afraid&#34;.  Then, the object took off upward, resembling what I could very loosely compare to the Roadrunner in the old cartoons when he was under chase, said &#34;beep beep&#34;, and ended up way beyond the mountains on the horizon in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only now it was who-knows-how-many-miles directly above our heads (this was probably what is known as a &#34;hyperspace&#34; move); it then did a slow rectangular trajectory, then disappeared behind a cloud.  Perhaps it joined with something else, because what we witnessed next, through the clouds w! as a huge mass of light moving up, up and away into the northeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lay awake that night, half-expecting &#34;little green men&#34; to come knocking at the door.  Our husbands were kind of in disbelief at our shared experience, I guess you can&#39;t blame them, but we saw what we saw, and looking back, I now consider myself extremely lucky and perhaps even chosen to have had them come and observe my friend and I that night ... it was definitely the highlight of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear from others who have had sightings!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers,  M ~<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

This is where things get upsetting, this thing, moved from about a half mile away from me to being within 50 foot over my head in what I can only describe the time it would take to walk three steps.  I remember trying to make sense of its appearance, I thought in a logical sense it must be a helicopter but it made no sound but I could feel a kind of low grade hum, its appearance was like a boomerang with the tips slightly pitching up and the bottom was covered with lights reds, greens and possibly blue.  The structure or body had a graphite look.  I remember the switch grass seamed to swirl but there was no wind, I was truly terrified, my home was only 70 or so yards away and all I could think of was I was going to die.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing i remember was falling to the ground I never felt so small.  I tried to hide my face in my arms putting my hand on to my head I guess you would call it the Fedics position, then it was gone. I rose to my knees and that thing had already moved 2 miles away moving NW and I never heard it leave as I was curled up on the ground. As I can best recall the size was about 50 foot or more nose to tail and near to 60 yard from wing tip to wing tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We were looking at shooting stars and all of a sudden the craft flew over our heads and hovered.  It then took off extremely fast out of our vision.  Then it came back and hovered again over our heads and took off in the other direction, again, out of our vision.  I believe it came back one more time, hovered for what seemed like maybe five minutes and took off again.  After being frozen with fear we ran into the house.  We never reported this to anyone.  I would say that it all happened within 10-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was on a clear hot august evening and I&#39;m almost sure it was a Wednesday night. I was watching TV and my mom was sitting on the front porch trying to cool off. Before my mom even said anything I could see a bright light coming over spring hill. At first I thought it was a very low airplane since we live right in the flight path of Spokane Int. Airport and Fairchild AFB., and planes flew over all day and night. Then my mom yelled at us to come see this UFO. My brother and I and my cousin from Montana all went out to see this and it was round, rotating counter clockwise and didn&#39;t make any noise. It didn&#39;t seem very high up, maybe 150 feet.It was about 50 feet in wide by about 12 feet deep. There were square lights all the way around it, maybe 2 feet by 2 feet. The strangest thing was it was totaly silent. As it rotated there was a dark spot where it seemed like a light was out. A neihbor who saw it with binoculars said the lights were windows and he could see white walls inside. It was going from the N/E towards the S/W. But not very fast. A week later and every week therafter for several weeks an advertising airplane was seen over Spokane in crowded places like the Spokane interstate fair and Playfair race track and looked just like the disc shaped craft from a distance but you could hear it from several miles away, an obvious cover up. Everyone in Spokane who heard the stories of people in North Spokane who saw the original silent flying disc were effectivly convinced we saw the advertising airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in Spokane all my life and have seen two other UFO sightings in the 1990&#39;s which I will try and provide information on at a later date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was hot out and we had all the windows and drapes open. I was watching TV. My mom took the trash out by the front door and after a moment she came racing back through the house and out the back door, she didn&#39;t say anything to me at first and she didn&#39;t even shut the back sliding screen door. I was into my TV show and only just sort of noticed her odd behavior. After a moment, she began to call my name in a frantic tone of voice. I jumped up and ran to the back yard. I looked up where she was looking and couldn&#39;t help but see this huge, and I mean huge oval shaped thing that was just glowing with a yellow white light. It was right over our heads, but didn&#39;t light up the back yard or cast the light at all, even though it was like the brightest thing in the world. It made NO sound at all. My mom yelled for our neighbors, next door (their lights were also on). They came out and the four of us just kept looking at it, I don&#39;t remember us talking much at the time. After watching it a while, I could see that the glowing lights did seem like individual lights not just one huge light. It was bigger than a blimp size, more like 3 or 4 large blimps, but the wrong shape to be a blimp. The sky was very clear and there was no sound at all. Suddenly, it just took off toward the west, toward the beach area. It was as if one moment it was over our back yard and the next moment it was gone. We could see it go, but it left so fast, as fast as you could move your hand from in front of you to your side (holding your arm out straight).  I&#39;m not sure of the date, but I was still living at home, so I had to be between 19 and 20, I married in Nov. of my 20th year. This was the third UFO I had seen. I think it was my Mom&#39;s first. I don&#39;t know about the neighbors.All three sightings were very different looking, however, all three were silent. This was by far the largest, the others were much smaller, and seen in the day too. This was the only one at night. After it left, I did call the newspaper, but they ! weren&#39;t interested, and didn&#39;t seem to know anything about it, no one else had called it in. I also called Miramar Air Base, and asked if they had anything that looked like this thing out flying that night. They acted like I was a nut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was one of those incredibly clear high country nights, not a cloud in the sky, no moon. Just above the tree line, my eye caught a moving light. It was a perfect sapphire blue, and was large enough to just show a disc, rather than a pinpoint. My immediate impression was that this object was at very high altitude and moving very fast. As I watched, it crossed an arc of about 100 degrees of the sky, in about 5 seconds. Then I saw another object coming in on a converging course at about a 30 degree angle from behind. This object was a greenish white pinpoint of light, also moving very fast,and converging on a collision course with the first object. At this time I thought the guys at at Sandia Missle Lab had really come upwith some kind of intercepter missle, and there&#39;s going to be a hell of an explosion up there. To my surprise, ther not only was not an explosion, the two objects met, merged, moved another 30 degrees across the sky and winked out. I then had the immediate thought-scout ship pick up!!! This had all happened so fast that I hadn&#39;t said a word to my ex, so I asked her if she had seen it too, and she said yes and described exactly what I had seen. I would like to add at this time that I have spent most of my life outdoors, in all conditions, and I am very familiar with aircraft of all types, having seen them in every combination of light and weather. Further I have ecellent depth perception and distance judgement, as I am a life long hunter and also a competitive shooter. I point this out because while I had no real reference points to judge the altitude of this object, I had an immediate impression of extreme altitude [possibly sub-orbital].  Given that the first object was showing a disc, barely, and that it covered an arc of sky of about 130 to 140 degrees in about 8 seconds it would have to be BIG and FAST !! Like way beyond anything in the inventory, then or now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I told you in my last e-mail back in the 1970s I think it was 1978 or 1979 I had just turned 18 years old as well as many of my friends that I grew up with in Dorchester, Massachusetts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we all got of age we decided to take a cross country road trip to California, so 4 of us went cross country on a Greyhound bus to San Diego California to see just what the west coast was all about. It took us about 5 days to reach California from Boston and before we ever heard anything about UFO&#39;s we found out after being in San Diego for only 2 days. We all shared a motel room and on our second night in California we were watching the local news in San Diego. The news reporter said that thousands of calls were coming into the news station as people were reporting sightings over the area of Palo Alto, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing was no T.V. footage was shown and it must have been the government trying to cover it all up. The people reporting the sightings said they saw huge discs hovering over Palo Alto in the middle of the day and it was starting to cause panic for some people. I do remember the news people saying that it was not a good idea for people to travel up to Palo Alto because of too much traffic from all of the on lookers. All of us at the motel just thought it was strange and never gave it any thought after hearing the report on TV. Well we stayed in San Diego for about 3 weeks before we all decided to head back to Massachusetts, so we did. We pooled our money together and bought a 1968 Dodge Charger for the big trip home so we could have more freedom than being stuck on a bus for the next 5 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left California during the late night hours so the car would not overheat during the day as we crossed through the areas of desert. Well all was fine until we crossed into the area of Arizona known as the Black Hills. We had to drive over a mountain range that seemed to take hours to get over, once we were headed down hill to the desert areas and level highway we noticed something very strange indeed. We saw 3 blue beautiful lights ahead of us, they were the color of cobalt blue like the old vicks salve jars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed that no matter how far we drove the lights were always in the same location in the sky ahead of us. We decided to pull over and get out to see if these lights were aircraft or radio towers as it was hard to tell moving at 70 miles per hour in a car. Once we pulled over we got out for a closer look and noticed that these blue lights did not make a sound at all and they were in the same exact spot as an hour before when we first spotted them in the sky. Another strange fact is that we were the only car on the highway at the time and not even a truck or anything was spotted during this time. So we got back in the car and drove for almost another hour before pulling over once again because the lights were still in the sky in the same location as before. We started getting a little nervous and wondered if this was what the people in Palo Alto have been seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to turn on the car radio to find out if anybody had called in anything about what we were seeing in the Arizona desert but as fate would have it the radio was nothing but static on all stations. We just thought we were so far away from the nearest radio station and that was why we could not get any music or news on the radio. We all looked at each other in shock asking one other if we all saw the same blue lights and if we could still see them, we all said yes to that. After a few minutes my friend who was driving decided to turn off the car head lights and shut off the engine and as soon as he did we then became instant believers of UFO&#39;s because when he turned off the lights the 3 cobalt blue lights that looked as if they were at least 500 feet apart from each other began to move towards each other until the 3 lights became one large blue light that headed away from us and then went upwards at the speed of a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My many thanks to the witness for the sighting report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

We had been to a family function. Our car at that time had no air conditioning and we had the windows down. My father was in a rather foul mood and had the radio off. We were approx 3 miles away from a small city on a rural paved 2 lane highway travelling East. We came to a T intersection and turned south. This road was the Fremont road. There were houses on either side of the road. The moon was out bright that evening. As we started south my sister sitting in the back seat drivers side asked what is that in a startling tone.. We all looked and my father immediately stopped the vechicle. Less than 300 feet away at tree top level we observers a black cylinder traveling very slowly north to south paralleling the road. The object traveled approx 100 ft to the left and front of our vehicle and stopped. No remember it was a hot evening no wind and quiet not a sound could be heard except the car motor. The object only stopped for approx 10 seconds and then made a 90 degree turn on it&#39;s axis and started moving again east to west it crossed approx 100 feet in front of the car. I was in the right hand back seat. I lost site of it for a moment and then it appeared on my side of the car. It stopped again approx 200 feet on the west side of the road made another 90 degree turn and started heading south again very slowly. My father must have been really terrified as at this point he acclerated very quickly we reached speeds of up to 100 mph trying to outrun the object. After he had accelerated the object kept pace with our vehicle for approx 4-5 miles. Not a word was said in the car during this whole encounter. Finally after what seemed forever the object climbed and turned at a incredible rate. I quicly left our viewpoint. I have seen high speed jet aircraft make 600 knot passes and this object left the area by probably a multiplier of 5. My family talked only that evening of the encounter and for nearly 22 years it has bugged me. Recently we talked about that encounter and agreed to test our memories Each one of us took turns and made a tape. We then all reviewed them together and our story lines stayed pretty well true even though it has been 20+ years. Other generations of our family have had encounters and one was even interviewed by the world famous blue book team. My grandmother who is now in here 90&#39;s has black and white photo&#39;s of pictures she took in the early 60&#39;s. What ever we saw that night was no way from this world. Why we were choosen to observer the object and why it played a cat and mouse game with us while my father was trying to win the indy 500 is beyond me. But I would like to hear from anyone else in the Southern Michigan area that has had a similar encounter.<n>

I had gone into our back yard on the east side of our house and noticed a bright light above the foothills to the east about 7 or 8 miles from me. The light looked like an aircraft landing light, staying stationary in the air, about 1000 feet above the hills. I stared at the light because it wasn&#39;t moving and wondered why it was so still if it were a small airplane. It was too bright to be a star. All of a sudden, the light took off with no accelleration toward the north. The best way I can describe how fast it took off is if you were looking at one frame of a moving film and then started the movie, you would see instant motion. The light flew horizontally and covered about 10 miles less than a second. As it flew further to the north it got farther away and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was night and my boyfriend and I were looking at mountain and were amazed that car lights could be seen when the lights, 5 in a row, moved slowly off mountain toward Reading Airport. The lights stayed in a row which made us think it was one structure, maybe blimp or something.  We waited for helicoptor noise or some noise but never heard anything as they became closer. Suddenly the 5 lights all got a little brighter and spread out and up very fast and disappeared. We were terrified and called Reading airport but they said they saw nothing and had no blimp or helicopters in area.  We searched the newspaper the next day but no one else seemed to have seen it.  I don&#39;t tell too many people because it still frightens me to think about it.<n>

I was about 6 months pregnant at the time.  I woke up and saw a large craft outside the upstairs window of an A frame structure located in a wooded around.  My husband saw it too.  For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, &#34;why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn&#39;t tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn&#39;t want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.  I will detail this later.<n>

We were sitting around the campfire &amp; saw a UFO that was traveling from  the west to the east. The lights were high in the air &amp; we would have thought it was an airplane if it didn’t hover &amp; dart in a zig-zag direction. The UFO continued to travel in this manner, hovering briefly &amp; then darting in a zig-zag fashion. It continued in this manner, until it was out of sight. It also had multi-colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Three whiteglowing ojects in triangular formation flew|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02156.html|54|ndxe197808| Summary : My sister and I were takeing the garbage cansup the driveway one summer night.  Three white glowing ojects in triangular formation flew overus.  Their angular size was slightly larger thanan US quarter held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the date I gave above could be up to 2 months inaccurate since it wasquite a while ago.I am presently a mechanical engineering student.So far I haven&#39;t come across anything in my studies which would explain what I saw, except the slight posibility of ball lightening.I first spotted the objects when they were approximately35 degrees above the southwestern horizon.  The flew nearly overhead toward the northeast.  They had an angular sizesomewhat larger than a quarter, there was no wayto tell the actual size.  I got the impression that they were distant because I couldn&#39;t discern any surface details.Their shape was most likely spherical, since the shape of their profile remained roughly spherical for the duration of the time I saw it.There were three of them, each on the vertex of anequilateral triangle with sides about twice as longas the diameter of the objects.  They glowed almostpure white with just a touch of bluish-purple.  Theymade a soft very high pitched sound like anultrasonic cleaner used for cleaning draftingpens.  I didn&#39;t notice any thermal radiation.Our horses which were in the front pasture werespooked by them as were my sister and I. (I wasabout 10 or 11 and my sister 4 years younger)I was facinated by them, but frightened to thepoint that I couldn&#39;t move for about 20 seconds.When I did move I ran home.If I had to guess their actual size, I&#39;d saythey were 20 to 50 meters in diameter.  Theiris the possibility that they exerted a force onme, but that was most likely my stomach jumpingin excitement.If I have the time and skill, I&#39;ll try to emaila drawing of what I saw.<n>

I got all freaked out and ran downstairs and told my mom I saw a flying saucer and she told me to go to bed and stop fibbing. the craft was pretty big.. at least 30ft across. I remember this like it was yesterday. my first thought (mind of a 7 year old) is I thought it was the lost saucer from sid and marty craft... then my mom told me there was no such thing .. that freaked me out and I could not sleep for weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a very crazy childhood involving stuff like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Me, my sister and a friend were playing in a park when we saw what looked like lights on an airplane in the sky. The strange thing was that it was not moving. We then thought that it was a helicopter. It hovered in the sky for about 20 seconds and then made extreme radical diagonal moves. It then hovered again for a few more seconds. Then we saw 3 large Military/Air Force planes approaching. The oval shaped object then flew off in a diagonal direction EXTREMLY fast and disappeared. The Military planes (looked like the kind with radar) flew directly overhead. We ran home and told our father and he said that it was probably just an airplane, but he didn’t see what we saw<n>

WE HAD BOTH BEEN IN THE POOL AND AS WE GO OUT AND WAS WALKING AROUND TO GO ON THE DIVING BOARD, I LOOKED UP AND SAW THE SPHERES.  I SAID TO MY BROTHER, &#34;WOW, LOOK AT THAT!&#34;.  HE LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT I WAS SCREAMING ABOUT AND GOT A FULL VIEW.  THE TWO SPHERES FIRST TRAVELED SLOWLY TOGETHER, THEN PICKED UP SOME SPEED, CHANGING PLACES WITH EACH OTHER.  THEY THEN SLOWED TO A ABRUPT STOP FOR 3-5 SECONDS, ALLOWING US, (BOTH FORMER U.S. AIR FORCE) TO GET A PERFECT, DAYLIGHT SIGHTING.  NO QUESTION THAT THESE WERE NOT AIRCRAFT.  WE SAW THEM CLEAR AS DAY, TWO PERFECTLY ROUND METALLIC SPHERES, WITH THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SHINING OFF OF THEM.  THEY HOVERED, AS I SAID FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN TOOK OF IN A SOUTHERN DIRECTION AT SPEEDS BEYOND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.<n>

Weather calm and completely clear.  1st large oval rises up from directly behind mountians due east from me.  Motion is slow, floating like a blimp or balloon.  At first I thought it was a large blimp with a mirror-like exterior reflecting the sunlight (sun was below the eastern horizon during the entire encounter), object was extremely bright, yet had a distinct oval outline.  After rising a few degrees above mountains object stopped all motion.  Total time to rise up was about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second identical object then began to rise just to the left of the first object.  Second object moved identically to first, then stopped next to first at equal altitude.  Third identical looking object then began to rise just to right of first object, at same slow rate, until it was at equal altitude with other 2 objects.  All three objects remained still for about 2 more minutes.  Very curious sight at this time, but all witnesses still thought objects were blimps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right-most object then begins to rise slowly above others, stops completely, then moves from a complete stop to a point slightly above the horizon almost directly due south of us (visible out the right side of the car) in about 2 or 3 seconds then comes to a complete stop again.  No acceleration or deceleration was apparent.  Middle object then does exactly the same, stopping next to the other above the southern horizon.  Third object then repeats the same exact manuever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When all 3 were stopped hovering next to each other then all 3 objects slowly decended torwards the ground until disappearing on the southern horizon.  Objects retained their extreme brightness throughout the entire encounter, even when in a position near the southern horizon where there was no sunlight to reflect in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All witnesses agreed with each other not to speak of the sighting due both to fear of ridicule, and due to the fact that all of us were under orders to speak of any potential UFO sightings ONLY to our commanding officer (to my knowledge all AF personnel, including myself and the witnesses, at the time were required to sign a statement acknowledging the order upon enlisting in the AF).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have felt comfortable to officially report this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

8/1/78 01:00|Harrison Lake (Canada)|BC|Circle|10 - 15 seconds|Light sped across the night sky, slowing to apparently "check out" a satellite, the zig zaged and sped off at a high rate of speed.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56103.html|59|ndxe197808| Light sped across the night sky, slowing to apparently &#34;check out&#34; a satellite, the zig zaged and sped off at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were sitting at a campfire late on a summer long weekend.  Our group of camping friends consisted of about 5 families or about 20 people.  We often went to a site that was about 2 hours from where we lived, at Wood Lake, above Harrison Lake 25 miles north of Chilliwack, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about 15 years old and had been enjoying staying up late with the parents.  Between gazing at the campfire and listening to our parent’s stories, we would recline in our camp chairs and gaze at the stars, counting the satellites and looking at the stars, in amazement of the beauty of the night sky and what might be &#34;out there.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1 AM, we noticed a fairly bright satellite traveling westwards across the sky.  When this satellite was getting close to the half way point across the sky we noticed another bright light traveling at about 5 times the speed of the satellite (it seemed as though it was almost streaking across the sky).  To describe the approach angle of the light heading towards the satellite: if the satellite was traveling from the 6 o’clock to the 12 o’clock position, the streaking light came from the 4 o’clock position.  When the streaking light came within a close distance to the satellite and as though it was about to cross the satellite’s path just behind it, it slowed suddenly to match the speed of the satellite and was now on the same path, following it and just slightly to one side.  This portion of the experience happened within the space of about 5 seconds.  The bright light then sped up to get closer to the satellite and kept that closer distance for a few seconds, then accelerated in a zig-zag pattern making sharp angled turns that seemed unrealistic because of the speed and the seemingly impossible sharp angles of the turns, not bends but sharp bends.  When it did this I had the impression it was &#34;checking out&#34; the satellite.  Then after the last &#34;zag,&#34; it sped off faster then it entered the picture, at almost the speed of a falling star, but without the streak of a falling star.  My friend and I watched for a few moments more to watch the satellite and be sure we wouldn’t miss something else, then looked at each other and I said: &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  He looked at me with a bit of blank stare for a moment, then said slowly: &#34;yah, I did.&#34;  I asked him what he thought it might have been, and he said I don’t know and neither did I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve only told a few people over the years about this because I didn’t think I would be believed, and sometimes I would begin to doubt the experience myself.  I have tried to reason with this experience and all I could come up with is that it must have been intelligent to do what it did.  I couldn’t say that I believe in &#34;aliens,&#34; because I’m the type of person that has to see it to believe it.  What I do know from that night is that my friend and I saw my first and only unidentified flying object.<n>
