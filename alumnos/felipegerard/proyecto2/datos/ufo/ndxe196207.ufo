Some friends and myself were at a small little country church where a few local singers and guitar players were meeting for an informal get-together. Some one came in and told us about some lights over Springdale (about 3 mi. west of us). We all went outside and there they were! It appeared to be a large formation of red lights over Springdale.These lights were in triangular patterns. The lights were stationary except for some more lights coming out of those and forming more triangles. We jumped in my car and started to go to Springdale for a closer look when the formation started slowly moving south toward Fayetteville about 5 mi from Springdale. We watched until they became too dim to see in the city haze.Breathtaking!  Kelly from Tulsa<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

From behind, over my right shoulder, I noticed a flying craft.  It was low enough to tell it was nothing but a flying disk. I pointed and said &#34;Look!&#34;.  It went overhead, flying low and not making a sound nor leaving any contrail. We did nothing but stood still and quiet and noticed that it had no rivets or seams in the metal.  The sides didn&#39;t come to a pointed edge but were somewhat rounded.  I could see no windows and regret that I hadn&#39;t seen the front of the craft.  It moved at a steady rate of speed and, withing minutes or less, went over the hills in the distance.  To my knowledge, no one else in the small town saw it and I can understand why as it was completely silent and, if seen from the side, would probably be hard to see.  But this went right overhead.  Needless to say, we were frightened and not quite believing what we were actually witnessing.  My father has died within the past few years, but we talked about what we saw to each other many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is absolutely true, but I have never posted it before now.  I have mentioned to others, throughout the years, but found only a few who would believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

For more details you can contact me...but to describe what I saw I&#39;ll make it brief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and about four other cousins where sitting in the back of my parents car at about 11:00 pm CDT in early summer.   We were staying in a little concrete cabin built by our grandfather.   This was a time when nothing was built around us.  Lake Ozark at its beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway...as Sam began reading from a book from flashlight I looked out my back passenger window to see a very large cigar shaped object come over the hill across the cove.  It was, to my best guess about 5,000 ft..  It made no sound, and it had several bands of different colored lights rotating around it.  It was moving at a slow speed and I wanted to tell everyone in the car to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise.. I couldn&#39;t say a thing...and just watched the thing drift over the next hill.  I guarantee you it was NOT a balloon.  It had a motion of direction and a lot faster than the wind!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Come to find out..the old settler that has been there for years had built a landing sight in the woods near us for these little fellows as he called them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone thought he had lost it living in the woods as long as he had.  I did see the concrete landing pods he made and to this day I&#39;ll bet there still there.<n>

I believe I would have been 6 to 8 years old, so the date is a guess.  It was a hot summer night after 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that my father was hanging his head out of the car window and looking into the sky.  My mother asked him what he was looking at, to which he replied, &#34;look&#34;.  My mother seemed concerned as did my father.  When we children asked what was going on, my father just said that there were some funny lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around and noticed that more than half of the cars around us had the adults standing outside them looking up at the lights.  We all got out of the car to look and at that point the movie was turned off.  Some people were yelling for the drive-in to turn off the lights so that &#34;they&#34; would not see us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for over a half hour as a long, cigar-shaped object that blocked out the clouds illuminated by the moon.  It ca! me in parallel to the ground and then proceeded to turn upright so it was standing on an &#39;end&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then over 10 shiny disc-shaped objects shot of the bottom and zoomed around at all directions and &#34;danced&#34; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes they all shot back and came to a dead stop, stacking up like plates and then ascended up into the larger cigar-shaped object which then rotated again to be parallel with the ground and then it took off at a rapid speed and was out of sight in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I distinctly remember my father referring to the large craft as a mother ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately left the drive-in and I listened to my mother and father talking about what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched the internet for any other reports of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and mother also remember this distinctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was 4 years old and was walking back form our mail box  on a cloudless evening when an orange shere appeared over top of a pine tree which was about 100-125 feet away. The object had come from the western horizon and moved to it&#39;s position over the tree at an incredible speed. I would say that it took 1/2 second or less for this to occur. I immediately turned to my left (north) and gazed at the object. The sphere had no discernible features other than the color orange. In fact it it almost seemed to occupy only 2 dimensions like a projection of light against a flat surface. As I stared at the light I felt as though I was being observed. After perhaps 3-5 seconds the thought occured to me that the object was going to leave heading east. No sooner did I have this thought than the light sped off eastward (and out of my view as our house blocked my vision) at the same speed as coming out of the west.  Within 3 seconds I had another thought, that the object was going to reappear from the east. Again, as soon as I had this thought the orange sphere reappeared out of the east (as quickly as it had departed) and hovered over the tree again. Once again I felt I was being watched. The object then disappeared eastward and I ran to our house to tell my family. (being only 4 I was not taken seriously and the incident was dismissed. I have never forgotten it.) Also, this object was absolutely silent and appeared to be a little larger than the moon appears to be at its zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Light changed to a large cicular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer of 1962, my friend and I were at the beach fishing for striped bass.  We had decided to make it an all night fishing trip.  It was a warm summer night and to the best of my knowledge no one else was on the beach.  I was sitting on a beach chair when my friend saw some- thing and yelled, &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;.  I looked up and saw a round rather dull orange light approaching us directly off the ocean. My initial thought was a lost fishing boat using a rather large spotlight to find its way.  It was an odd sight but at the time seemed to be a plasible explanation.  There was a river inlet close by which fishing boats used regularly and I was used to seeing boats in the general location, al- though not that close to shore. I would say the light was 50 yards off- shore and maybe 15 feet above the water.  The width was about the same as a large floodlight, the kind you see at movie premiers, maybe a little smaller.  The light was slowly approaching directly at us and I started to become nervous as it appeared the fishing boat was going to run ashore right at our feet.  When the light reached about 25 yards to our front it suddenly commenced to rapidly accelerate.  It was still heading directly at us and I jumped from my chair, ran back a few feet, and turned back around.  I expected to see a fishing boat run up over our position and ground itself.  To my surprise the light was gone but now there was a large circular object to our front at an altitude of maybe 150 feet. The object was lit but I don&#39;t remember any details or the exact size.  It departed to the NW at a steady slow rate of speed. At the time it seemed to be an exciting adventure.  I was 17 years old and my friend 16 and wow we say something spectacular.  As I think back there is something very disturbing about the event. What happened to rapidly approaching orange light?  Why didn&#39;t we see the large circular object until after the orange light disappeared?<n>

It was during the day and would have been between 1960 and 1962.  I lean more toward 1962.  We were just sent outside so I think it was summer.  I believe that it was mid morning, say about 10am.  The object flew from south to north.  It was at an angle of about 10 degrees from vertical. We could not see the object, it was shiny.  Like it may have been a mirrored ball with a very bright light shining on it.  It left a vapor or smoke trail.  It took approximately 60 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  I do not remember it making any noise.  I did not see the object disappear over the northern horizon as I was yelling for my mother and ran inside to get her. When we came back out it was gone and only the vapor trail remained.  Shortly two delta winged jets appeared chasing the vapor/smoke trail of this object.  You could hear the noise of the jets.  Now I could tell they were delta winged but I could not read the lettering or the symbols on the aircraft.  I would hazard to guess perhaps F106&#39;s.  I am going to guess that they were at about ten thousand feet or higher.  We saw them crisscross the vapor trail.  I feel that they were traveling fast but not as fast as the object.  I could not tell if they were going overtop or under the vapor trail though for some reason I have a feeling that they were flying under it.  The location of this incident was in the Northern Catskills of New York.  The village of Tannersville is approximately 110 miles north of New York City and about 30 miles west of the Hudson River.  I have not talked about this for many years and I am just curious.  I watched the news that night.  At that time we got two channels out of Albany NY, and nothing was mentioned about a meteor or anything such.  I know that there had to be other people that saw this phenomena.  Now I have to say that I do not know what it was.  It could have been some sort of experimental aircraft.  I may have been a meteor though I feel it was flying entirely to ! slow and the jets would not have been chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I was a small child living with my great grandmother in a small town in Oklahoma, very small town. I guess it had a population then of less than 2,000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lindsay, Oklahoma is where I was born and raised and where the following events occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed with her a lot. My mother lived nearby and had 4 other children younger than me. I was very close with my great grandmother and was her favorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I had no way of describing what happened at the time I recounted the events to my great grandmother the next morning over breakfast as that I had been lifted in the air last night by a white light to what my mind at the time thought was a giant silver tube of toothpaste. (the shape was the only thing I could come up with that my little mind could describe). I tried to describe how scary it was. I don’t remember any discussion about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t until I was an adult and something caused me to think of it again that I realized what had happened was an UFO abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will describe exactly what I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in bed with my great grandmother which is where I always slept. I awoke to find myself floating up in the air inside a white beam of light. I was outside because I looked down to see my great grandmother’s house below me. I recall being terrified to the nth degree. I can’t even begin to explain how scared I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see that I was being drawn through the air to a very large, cylindrical shiny silver object with a dark opening in it…to which I was being lifted towards. It seemed that a being was standing near the opening and watching me floating up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have absolutely no recollection of what occurred inside the UFO. I woke up again back inside my great grandmother’s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A disturbing thing to me now which at the time I didn’t relate properly and couldn’t explain properly is that the day of my return I complained to my mother and great grandmother that my genital area was very sore. I complained enough that they examined the area to see if something was wrong. I was questioned as to what made me so sore and I know this sounds weird but because I was a small child and had no remembrance of being inside the UFO and anything that could have happened all that my mind could come up with was that a blade of grass had been inserted into me. They were perplexed and asked me repeatedly what had happened and I gave the same explanation again. It’s all that I knew to say….for some reason I believed that something had been inserted and knew that it was something similar to a blade of grass. I had no idea how the blade of grass came to enter me. It’s all I knew to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old now and still remember these events vividly. I believe that it was an UFO abduction. When I became an adult and began to read and learn of other abductions I realized that I had experienced this too. As a child I couldn’t explain it because I had never heard of UFOs  and had no vocabulary or knowledge to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have related the experience a couple of times to family members but they think I must have dreamed it. I can understand that because it sounds so weird that I don’t want to believe it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to tell my story to someone and have it documented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was 14 or 15 years old at the time and I was with two high school classmates. We were sitting on a park bench in the Sawyer elementary school playground. This is on the south side near 51st and Kedzie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was summer vacation and we were out late (about 10 PM). It was already dark but as anyone who knows the city will tell you, the lights from the city will illuminate anything in the air. We noticed this object (which looked like a disk from our angle) move from our right to our left (this equates to south to north). It was fairly large and fairly close. I was about the size of a 474 jumbo jet and it was close enough to look like an airplane making a landing at nearby Midway Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly and there was no sound at all. As I said it looked like a disk from the angle we were viewing it at and it did not have sharp edges – they were more rounded. The edges had what looked like portholes (round windows) around the periphery of the object. The inside of the object was very brightly lit and it looked like people moving around behind those portholes! I remember seeing at least one “person” who appeared to be looking at the bird’s eye view of the city! I think the object was rotating but very slowly. Other than the light from the windows there were no other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it slowly make its way very far north and we were able to follow its path until it just appeared as a spec of light which then moved east and disappeared. We were all very exited about this sighting and we decided to call the police to report it. It turned out that many, many people had called about this and the official police explanation was that it was an airplane towing an illuminated sign. I never believed that explanation because I know what I saw and it was NOT an airplane towing a sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this on that night in Chicago please tell what you saw. I would appreciate hearing that someone else was witness to this strange object (notice I did NOT call it a craft although I believe that is what it was). There is one person here who describes the same thing but with square windows and he says it was in September 1964. I am fairly certain that my date is correct – summer of 1962.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

But I could feel something and what ever it was, affected my head and ears with some sort of humm. When I turned around to look behind me. There was this flying object just above the trees hovering.

I could feel its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember seeing any bright outside lights on the this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The side that was facing me had a transparent window which was as large as the craft.
