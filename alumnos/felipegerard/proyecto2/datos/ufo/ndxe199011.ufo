11/30/90 19:00|Hollsopple|PA|Disk|10 minutes|On way to work, parked car and upon exiting car observed a u.f.0. hovering at the far end of the parking lot ( no noise ).|1/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11535.html|1|ndxe199011| On way to work, parked car and upon exiting car observed a u.f.0. hovering at the far end of the parking lot ( no noise ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is second hand info. provided by my sister who is a serious minded, responsible, and sober individual. We don&#39;t see much of each other but last week I visited her for a few days. My sister and I are very close and we talk freely with each other. As close as we are she reluctantly told me about her encounter with a u.f.o. the following is her experience: She had pulled into the parking lot of the V.F.W. where she had worked at that time ( keep in mind she is a non-drinker, as I have said she is a very responsible person)upon exiting her car she noticed a strange object hovering at the other end of the parking lot above a small patch of trees about 40ft. from her car. She told me that the craft was very large, but couldn&#39;t tell exactly what color it was because at that time of the evening the sky was dark. She told me that the disk shaped object had six very bright lights that flashed around the perimeter of the object as it hovered motionless and silently above the patch of trees. She told me that she stood and observed the craft for about ten minutes and the craft just sat there hovering, then to my amazement she told me that she turned and walked to the V.F.W. and unlocked the door and entered the building to prepare for her evenings work. I ask her if she didn&#39;t think it was strange to just turn and walk away from the strangest event that she will probably ever encounter in her life, her response was that she had work to do before the customers arrive. She told me that a few minutes later that she looked out a window of the building and the craft was gone. She told me that while standing and observing the object she was in awe but had no fear and she felt strangely calm. She also told me that didn&#39;t appear to have any time period that she couldn&#39;t account for. The mysterious part of the whole esperience is that Hollsopple is a small town and only one person that she knows observed the object and he was driving on a highway that was about two miles from the site where she was. As I said Hollsopple is a small town and I believe there had to be more eye witnesses, but my sister said that no one else had said anything except for a few phone calls to a t.v. station in Johnstown reporting a strange object that they had seen in the night sky. I am writing to you after conviced my sister that she should pursue this incident further. I&#39;ve suggested going to a Hypnotist in the hope that he can bring out further detail about her experience. I guess the reason that i&#39;m writing to you is to get some advice from an organization such as yours who are experienced in these matters.<n>
11/30/90 18:30|Naples|FL|Other|5 seconds|A very large, black, silent, boomerang flying very very fast over Naples, Florida.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47755.html|2|ndxe199011| A very large, black, silent, boomerang flying very very fast over Naples, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I did not submit a formal report because the incident happened so long ago, and I can no longer find the details I wrote down immediately after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I read the report on this website of a sighting in Naples, Florida on 11/3/2005 I couldn&#39;t help but be stunned. The reported sighting was almost identical to a sighting I had about 15 to 18 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also live in Naples, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night of my sighting, I was walking down my driveway with my dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was less than an hour after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking from north to south. I looked up because I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving from west to east. For some reason I can&#39;t remember I thought it as Hubble. I watched the satellite until it disappeared into the dark side of the day/night terminator to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At almost the same time the satellite disappeared, there was movement directly above me.  Whatever the object was, it was absolutely flat black, and very very fast!  The sighting was so brief (only a few seconds), that I could only gather impressions of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the sky was dark and moonless, the object was so dark that I could see a boomerang shape against the slightly lighter night sky.  It seemed to be low,  and was very large.  Much larger than any airplane I have ever seen.  It was absolutely silent. Not a hiss or whoosh came when it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I had the feeling the leading edge of the shape was just a very little lighter than the trailing edge.  Basically, I saw a very dark object against a slightly lighter, clear black sky blocking out the stars.  The weather was clear, with a few clouds on the southern horizon.  The star Fomalhaut was clearly visible above the clouds to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thought has occurred to me, the object was intentionally flying near the edge of the terminator in order to remain in darkness.  When I checked the date and time of the 11/3/05 sighting, I found that the position of the terminator would have been similar to my sighting.  The largest discrepancy in the two sightings is that my object was traveling in a north to south direction, rather then the northeast to southwest direction of the 11/03/05 sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can still see the object in my minds eye, although some of the detail has been lost.  It is something I hope I will never completely forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

No one said a word while watching it, after it was gone we all confirmed with each other we had seen the same thing, whatever it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. The object was a brilliant white/blue light in the shape of a circle. 2. It moved slowly at first, as it moved futher away it did an erratic pattern of movement, the movement was like a child scribbling on paper, I describe it like this because you could see the entire outline of its movements &#34;a light trail&#34; behind it, all of this within a second or two. It then moved out of sight in a straight line in less than a second. The object only left a trail of light during it&#39;s erratic movement. There was four of us who witnessed this event, 3 white males, one black male, ages between 20 and 25 yrs old, all of us in the US Army.<n>

One object was shaped like a pipe with lights on each end; the other was just a light by itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad and I were out in the woods deer hunting and when it got too dark to hunt, my Dad walked over to my blind to get me. Just after we left my blind at about 5:55 that evening, our attentions were drawn to some lights up in the sky. There were no clouds and no wind that evening and it was still light enough out, that you couldn&#39;t see any stars yet, nor did you need a flash light to see where you were going. My Dad and I saw them at the same time. They weren&#39;t that far up into the sky; maybe a 1000 feet or less. The larger object was the shape of a pipe (but of course, much larger) with a bright light at each end of it. They seemed to be as bright and as large as head lights would be on a car. The other object was sightly lower and to the left of the larger object and it was just a light. Neither of them made any sound and they just hovered in one spot; we never saw them move. My Dad then drew up his gun to look at them through his scope. When he did this, they slowly dimmed their lights and disapeared, vanishing, without ever moving! It was as if they were watching us. As light as it still was out there, we should have been able to see the outline of the objects, in the air, but they were gone. I was shaking soo hard after we saw them, I had a hard time walking out. Note: Earlier that evening, we heard military jets flying around the area. I don&#39;t ever recall hearing them fly around there in the 16 years I&#39;ve hunted there. Do you think they were looking for something? Note: After we came home, after our week of hunting, I did create an ink and watercolor painting, of the objects. I would submit them, but I didn&#39;t know how to scan and email pictures yet. If you would like a copy of the painting, contact me and I&#39;ll mail you one.<n>

It was still a night sky and the stars were crystal clear.  Within a 30 second time period it seemed as though the sun was rising and then the sky was as bright as dawn, I could see my town and the house tops of Augusta.  5 seconds later I saw a ball about 600 feet in the sky flying overhead towards Augusta.  The UFO flew steady and straight maintaining a constant speed and direction and then once over Augusta made what seemed to be a 90 degree angle and bolted off towards Whitefield.  Within 30 seconds the light had vanished and 30 seconds later I could see the clear, dark starry night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To back this sighting up, here is more evidence.  My uncle was up at the same time in Farmingdale getting ready to go hunting.  He was in his living room and noticed the light coming in through his roof windows and then noticed the same ball of light going over head towards Hallowell.   As is passed by the lit up area then faded again and he could see the darkness again and eventually the stars.  I was a Junior in Highschool at this time and my uncle an archetect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date is correct, but we are pursuing that issue.  He might have been witness to a meteor, since there is a major meteor shower annually at this time of November, but a meteor does not last for two minutes.  We have requested a report from the uncle to the witness, as well.

In<n> <n><n> addition, something that I did not mention was that the local police station had said there were calls<n> <n><n> also from Augusta, Chelsea, China and Whitefield, Maine.  As for my uncle, unfortunately I have lost<n> <n><n> touch with him but if I do get a hold of him I will certainly point him in your direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ***Why so interested in the date and year, have you heard of others that reported something in and around that time?  It&#39;s kind of strange to talk about this stuff but after reading all of those stories I guess I felt comfortable about telling my little experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Very interesting event seen over Maine on the same date, Friday night, November 17,  in 1995.

This particular trip had a surprise in store for me.  I&#39;m not sure on the dates, but I was probably around 11 or 12 years old at the time.  After the desert sun went down I began to notice a red glow in the Northeast sky that seemed to be eminating from behind the mountains.  As the sky got darker, the glow got brighter and brighter.  It was a bright blood red.  The glow covered maybe an 8th of the sky and had no defined cut-off line, but instead faded from bright to normal sky color further up.  There were a few cumulus clouds in the sky silhouetted against the glow.  I remember being a little frightened by it.  The wierd thing was, noone else seemed to notice it.  My family was off somewhere else in the campground and when I asked them if they saw it, they said they hadn&#39;t.  As the night went on, the glow had all but faded away hours later.  Not sure what to make of it.  Aurora Borealis, weapons testing?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

While traveling down the highway she said &#34;wow the moon is bright tonight&#34; As they got closer the light she soon relized it was not the moon and thought maybe it was a chopper.  Soon they got close enough to relize that it was not a chopper but some kind of triangular craft with 3 lights on each corner and a red light in the center.  This craft was no more than 100-300 feet off the ground and she said the lights were moving all over the ground as if searching for something.  This craft was just above them and to the left over a field.  They could see it clearly above them because he had T-Tops of his vehicle.  She was screaming to drive faster because she knew it was nothing she had ever seen before.  It had no sound and she side it was huge like size of a football field.  When she got home she told knowone until the next day.  She thought about calling the police but did not.  She grew up in a strict Baptist home and these such things just dont happen.  Until that moment...  I have always believed her becuase she is my cousin #1 and she had no reason to lie about it..  I checked on materials on the subject and found that many people thought the moon was bright on first observations of a UFO.  She also spoke to my uncle who was a pilot with a major airline.  He really had nothing to say about it..but a few weeks later unsolved mysteries ran a show about german police officers that tracted a craft across there city.  They had it documented on tape there conversations between all officers.  The craft they showed on the TV show is exactly what she said she had seen.<n>

I cannot recall the exact date only that i know it happened a week after reported seeing a  strange &#34;crash&#34; of an unknown object on Mt Kearsarge in Warner NH. I am trying to find articles in the newspapers to get the date it was definately covered in the papers {i can find nothing online). The Civil Air Patrol searched the mountain and found nothing. I distincly remember this being late October or early to mid November. there were two witnesses to this event. myself (at the time i was in my earl 20&#39;s and going to school I am now 33 years old and work for a high tech company in the GIS field). My Mother ( a retired school teacher)  saw the last half of the objects sighting, their manuevers and their sudden speeding off. I had also been on the phone with my brother who was away at college and i was describing to him what i was seeing. We both agreed that no planes could ever pull off the manuevers these did in such a tight formation and then suddenly shoot off like they did.. This sighting happened for well over 10 minutes. I reported this to MUFON some years ago in NH but never got a response back. I am suprized nobody else had seen this or if they did they never reported it?  All these years  I have wondered this. I have no reason to make this up and what i saw is what i saw and i just want to find out what the hell this was and why it happened a week after the report of a crash on MT Kearsarge. Hopefully someone else will read this and will say &#34;I saw it too&#34;. I wish i had been able to photgraph these lights. But i can also draw what i saw quite clearly. Its something you don&#39;t forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> on to what we saw:  It was around 7:15pm on a clear calm fall evening. I had gone outside to look around at the sky since it was so clear and it was not too cold. After about 10 minutes outside  I started to notice something through the leafless trees as I faced South. There was a bank of red lights that suddenly shifted to green and then they went out. I thought that was rather strange. It seemed to me to possibly be the edge of a huge black featureless object but i cannot be certain because i did not get a full clear view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main objects appeared directly south of me across a field . I would say they must have been about a mile away. Size based on distance they were about the size of a dime. [by this time it was around 7:30pm where i opened the backdoor and called my mother to come see this careful to keep observing] There were two formations of yellowish lights (almost like incandecent lightbulbs). each formation was in a rough upside down scewed L shape they moved at the same speed slowly together holding their formation. There were 12  total objects with 6  in each formation. At first i thought they were two solid objects until they pulled their manuevers.  I heard no sound whatsoever. Then several of them did some incredible manuevers shifting their position in the formation. That part really freaked me out.  they then shot off  at an incredible speed.[this sequence lasted roughly 1 minute] My Mother only saw the few moments when they did some anomalistic motion and then shot off at high rate of speed (near blink of an eye speed).  I was a little shaken with what i saw and it still sorta gives me the creeps today. I travel I-89 frequently at night  and see lots of strange stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/1/90 23:00||MT|Disk|3 seconds|Driving at night in Montana enroute to N.Y. I saw an orange saucer-like object moving at great speed exactly parallel to the ground.  D|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61037.html|19|ndxe199011| Driving at night in Montana enroute to N.Y. I saw an orange saucer-like object moving at great speed exactly parallel to the ground.  Distance away estimated at 5-10 miles.  Lighted, but dull, not bright.  Another passenger was with me, but asleep.  By the time he awakened at my cry, the object was gone.  The lack of any downward trajectory belies any likelihood of a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/1/90 21:30|Lowell|MA|Light|20 seconds|A huge, round, red orb hovering in the sky|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77023.html|20|ndxe199011| A huge, round, red orb hovering in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been years, so I don’t recall the exact date, or even the exact month, but I do know this event happened during late fall of 1990.  This happened on the outskirts of Lowell, in one of the more suburban areas along Andover St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:30 PM I went outside to take the trash out.  It was raining pretty hard and I remember it being exceptionally dark that night.  I walked out the front door with the bag of trash and around the back of our house.  As I turned the corner from the side of the house to the back, I saw a huge, round, red light hovering in the sky almost directly above me.  It seemed really close- maybe JUST  above the trees (and certainly below the clouds), but it made absolutely NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large. if you hold a small paper plate at arm’s length in front of you while looking at the sky, that’s about the size.  The light was deep red, like a stop light, and in the 20 seconds I watched it, it didn’t flicker, fade, or pulse.  It was solid.  I remember thinking how strange it was that it was just glowing with no portion of the circle being any brighter than another and had no different characteristics - just one massive, solid, glowing orb in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, I looked away to drop the trash into the barrel I’d been standing next to, and when I looked back, the orb was gone.  I waited a few more seconds to see if it would return, but it didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been 20 years since it happened and I STILL think about it all the time, as if it just happened yesterday.  Every so often I search the net but have never found much until now, when I found NUFORC.  Reading through this site, just the Massachusetts section alone, I can’t believe how many people have had similar experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, for reference purposes, the accounts I’ve read from July 4th 2010 and the subsequent videos all over Youtube from that night are very similar to what I experienced, except, in my case, the single orb was red, didn’t move and seemed closer to the ground (just due to the size difference).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

11/1/90 19:00|Traverse City|MI|Light|2-3 min|Three eye-witnesses to a bluish light that moved so fast it was unreal above the tree tops.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75612.html|21|ndxe199011| Three eye-witnesses to a bluish light that moved so fast it was unreal above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In November of approx. 1990 or 1989 I witnessed with two of my children a bright light approaching our cabin.  The light was a bluish spotlight that appeared funnel shaped and it was shining down just above the tree tops as it came toward us.  The leaves were all off the trees and we were just about to get into our car.  It dawned on me that there was no noise at all like a month earlier when Coast Guard heliocopters were searching for a lost kayaker on the lake beside us.  Suddenly, the large light went straight up to a pinpoint in a matter of seconds and zig zagged across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local air control tower and he said no flights were in the area and he gave me the closest AFB in Oscoda and I spoke with their air controller who also said no military planes were in that area at the time.  He gave me an 800 number to call and report a UFO which I did, however, no one ever contacted me about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months later on the front page of the Record Eagle newspaper was an article about another sighting in Kingsley,MI. about 12 miles from our home.  This time a State Police trooper saw one as big as a huge football field over a lady&#39;s barn.  He took some pictures of it (which were never released to the paper) and he and the lady watched it for about an hour.  It was never explained what it was that he saw.  I work as a nurse administrator and I did not report the event I saw with my kids because of the way people react.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 57 years old and my son was about 9 years old..  He is now 32 and he still recalls what happened too.  We feel we saw a real UFO.  My ex-mom in law the next day described what I had seen too and she lived about an 1/8th of a mile away.  She said she had never seen anything like it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report indicates that the date is approximate.  We suspect that the date of the incident may be in 1994, given that the trooper managed to video a UFO in late December of that year.  PD))<n>
