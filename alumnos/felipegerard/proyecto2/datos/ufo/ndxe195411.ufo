I haven&#39;t told a lot of people about it.  I thought because I was so young at the time that no one would have believed me.  Anyway, we lived in a hotel in downtown Denver.  I had stayed over at at friends house and had ate supper with his family.  Anyway when I headed for home I had to walk past the City and County Building.  It looked like it was going to snow, the clouds were real thick and hanging low.  As I walked across a the light by the City and County Building all of sudden out of the clouds came a fireball shaped like a basketball.  It appeared for several seconds and then went back into the clouds.  I thought it was so odd because it was so cloudy.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else had seen this to this date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note<n>
