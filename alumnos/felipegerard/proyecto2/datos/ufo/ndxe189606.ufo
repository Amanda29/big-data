6/2/96 13:00|Melbourne (VIC, Australia)|N/A|Formation|4 hours|A group of spaceships "danced" about the sky.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44740.html|1|ndxe189606| A group of spaceships &#34;danced&#34; about the sky, disappeared into each other, and then left without a trace except for a burn on ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going home and saw two spheroid objects in the air with a rectangular one between them. I told a nearby store owner and he came out to look. Soon, the people on the street were looking at them too. The colours of the objects were red. Then, the round ones split in two a couple of times and the rectangular one split into two squares. They then emitted sounds and different colours flashed from them. The spheroid ones then clumped together in a tight pack and went between the square ones. The the square ones closed together to form the rectangle again. After hovering for half an hour about 20 foot above the ground, it zoomed up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether this is a serious report.
