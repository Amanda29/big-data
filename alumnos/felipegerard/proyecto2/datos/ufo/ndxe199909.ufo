The sky was only partially cloudy and the Moon was in full view, so the lights were seen against a background of stars. They appeared to change direction and speed relative to each other while at the same time staying in a group, there was no sound from them and they eventually disappeared behind cloud over the City. I have not heard of anyone else who has reported a similar sighting on that night.<n>

We correct the date here, and include her addendum.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> BEGIN ADDENDUM:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date revision requested: Hard evidence of actual date of event received by me from my Bank. I requested copy of a check that I had written to the supermarket minutes after the sighting and right before they closed at 23:00. Check confirmed: 9/30/99 22:58:54 - what makes this unusual are several issues. (read on.....)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am adding this addendum to my original report to amend the sighting date by 24 hours (from 10/01/99 to 9/30/99). The supporting evidence was photocopied to me by my Bank at my request, and features the critical &#34;time/date stamped&#34; verification on my personal check which I wrote at the grocery market immediately following this sighting event.  Of additional importance:  it is extremely rare that I ever shop for anything on a week night.  Days at work during ongoing projects are commonly 15 hour work days; weeknight shopping is usually out of the question!  Otherwise, I have already submitted my original report along with drawings and maps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> END ADDENDUM<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Original observation of bright lights of craft 20-25 miles away; lost sight of craft for awhile as I meandered through hills on way home; sighted craft again as I descended into Fairfield; huge (!) craft hovered motionless 800 to 1000 feet above major highway as if WANTING to be seen.  I stopped at side of highway to observe and although hundreds of other cars passed by this thing also, I seemed to have been the only one willing to stop.Odd! Fascinating! Scarey! Astounded to hear on Art Bell program of 1/21/00 that some police had seen similar object.  This thing is huge...several football fields in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about October 1, 1999 I was just finishing up at a job site in San Rafael, California. At approximately 10:00 pm I was heading home to Fairfield which is about a 45 minute drive eastbound across Highway 37 through Vallejo and then northbound on Highway 80.  Travis Air Force Base is about 5 miles east of Fairfield.  The whole trip is about 30 miles. I am a professional Account Manager/ Project Manager with a bachelors degree in Design; I have also spent about 10 years as a flight attendant.  I know what various aircraft look like and what the typical lights on aircraft look like even from a distance.  My vision is extremely good and I am a well balanced individual.  Still, the events I am about to share always puts one on the defensive...trying to put all this into some perspective is difficult because I have no point of perspective from which to start!! I originally observed what I thought was a &#34;single&#34; very bright light far off in the distance at a position of about 10:00 o&#39;clock and 30 degrees above the horizon (at 22:00 hours)during my drive home from an ongoing project. I had made this same trip at night multiple times before during the previous week and had never seen such a thing in the sky.  The weather was clear as a bell with no clouds at all.  The brightness of the light and the seeming motionlessness of it really caught my eye.  It definitely registered as &#34;odd&#34; to me.  The area where I was driving (east on Hwy 37)is not lit.  It is a long, flat stretch of highway single lane which crosses a marsh land.  There were not many cars on this particular part of my drive.  I had nothing better to do than watch this thing and the road.  I began to wonder:  #1 about how far away this thing was and #2 why I could percieve no movement.  I speculated that it must be moving directly toward me OR hovering in one place.  I deduced, however, that it probably was not a helicopter because it sitting was TOO still in the sky. As I drove on, I was still many miles from home.  The single bright light slowly shifted on its axis toward me and became two bright lights.  Combined, these lights were definitely a &#34;show stopper&#34;!  The brightness, the distance and the motionless of this held my curiosity.  Suddenly, as soon as this &#34;thing&#34; had rotated towards my position so that I could see its two lights, it also started a &#34;strobing&#34; effect with one of it two lights (the right one).  I then knew that this was something I had never seen before and that it was definitely not a usual thing. Traffic and terrain took my attention away from this object at this time.  There were some small hills to pay attention to and quickly I lost track of this object.  I had actually forgotten about it as I traveled through Vallejo and up into the hills onto Highway 80 east.  There are some massive foothills I travel through at this juntion of highways 37 and 80. Dropping down into the Fairfield area is quite a site once you punch through the blackness of these hills. As I came into site of Fairfield, I could not believe my eyes.  Furthermore, if I had not seen this thing from such a distance away, I am not certain that my eye could have picked it out from all the other city lights and recognized it for where it was and that it was what I had seen before. I have been a resident of Fairfield for 20 years; I know the developed and undeveloped areas; I have driven this stretch of highway thousands of times and this was definitely out of the norm. At this point in time because of the elevation of the hill I was now driving down, I was higher up (!) than this craft which hovered motionless down in the valley.  I was looking down on it (spellbound) and approaching it fast. As this craft sat motionless over a vast dark barren area just to the side of the highway, there was no mistaking it&#39;s presence.  It was RIGHT BESIDE the highway as if it were taking a scenic tour and WANTING to be seen.  Furthermore, it was so low that as I passed it, I layed my head on my steering wheel to get a look at the underside.  I have no brains for math, but I am certain that one could compute the actual feet above the ground with some simple geometric calcs. As I came down the hill, a CHP (California Highway Patrol) car came by me at a high rate of speed.  I thought at that time that at least HE had also seen this thing and was also going to be a witness.  I do not, however, know where he went.  I leveled out onto the flat part of the road, I kept trying to maintain my speed, watch the craft, wonder if anyone else was seeing this event, and find a spot to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. As I passed under and beside this craft, this is what I saw: a craft the size of at least three football fields long, triangular shaped with lights all around, two bright lights in front, and shapes underneath (2 circles and 2 straight lines beside each other)the craft which were backlit with light seemingly &#34;seeping&#34; from inside the craft. As I struggled to comprehend what I was seeing and trying to find a safe place to get over and stop, I still couldn&#39;t fathom why, with all the cars around me, there weren&#39;t 30 accidents or 30 people pulling over to get a better look.  Either they didn&#39;t realize what was just above their heads because of other lights and traffic around them OR they were as terrified as I was. But I stopped.  I pulled over off Highway 80 right beside the Inn America motel.  As I got out of my car and stood in front of it, the craft had already started to move slowly across the highway towards my location and headed in the direction of Travis AFB. I called Travis AFB about a week later to ask if they had had any reports of any strange events.  They said they were unaware of any of these events.  Additionally, I did call the local newspaper and they had no reports of anything. Last but not least, I was driving home a different route (Hwy 680 west which also hooks into 80 north) and I noticed some very bright lights up in the hills to my left on two successive nights soon after this major sighting (dates unknown).  I did not put these events together at the time, but I do remember thinking &#34;gosh what in the heck was built up in those hills so quickly.  That&#39;s alot of light for the middle of nowhere&#34;.  I have never seen those lights again. I do alot of driving late at night along both these routes commuting from San Francisco to Fairfield and this was one STRANGE but exciting event!!  Thanks for having a site where one can report such things.<n>

As the cited article said, this thing was no helicopter.  It was at least four times the size of a B-2 and from what I recall it was triangular in shape, black(possibly), and had seven lights.  My father and I saw it as it traveled over our house (and shook it quite violently).  It had a very low-pitched roar, rather dissimalar than a helicopter&#39;s - it was more like the noise you would hear from a quake, and for its size it was moving at an alarmingly low velocity and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this was, but I can vouch for its existence. From my father&#39;s friend (an onlooker which saw the vessel from the south side of the Chehalis River) we were told it&#39;s size was similar to a small city&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course the local paper &#34;the daily world&#34; called it a helicopter.<n>

The ball then proceeded to float and move slowly but smoothly down towards the street.  It floated about the same height as the street lights and it looked as though it was about the same size as the street light, not very big at all. It hovered a moment then proceeded to drift upwards and then moved further away towards the Waianae Range (west) until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The Satsop quake had just happened a few months before. We ran outside and looked to the south, where the noise was coming from, and as plain as day saw this object the size of a battle ship, about 1000 foot above the Chehalis River and traveling toward Aberdeen. It was moving to slow to be an airplane. It was triangular shaped with bright lights shining down over the river. As it was moving, the loud rumble stopped for a minute or so, dead silent, the shaking stopped, but it was still moving at the same speed. I nearly put a load in my pants. I ran into the house to get a camera, and the shaking and rumble began again. By the time I got back outside with the camera, it was gone from view, behind what I know as Alder Grove hill. It was amazing, and changed my view of life forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still surprised nothing was ever mention about this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you again,    ----- Original Message ----- From: To: &#34; Sent: Wednesday, October 08, 2003 10:06 AM Subject: Re: request for info   I gave it one last shot and searched for UFO and here&#39;s what I found:  This is the newspaper article from the Daily World in Aberdeen, WA  9/30/99,  Whatever it was, it wasn¹t a B-2 bomber The mysterious, loud flying object that was sighted by Harborites from Montesano to South Aberdeen on Tuesday night wasn¹t a B-2 bomber, according to the Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ³I spoke to the people at Palmdale and Whiteman and we didn¹t have any of our aircraft in that vicinity at that time,² said Master Sgt. Kevin Walston from the Air Combat Command public affairs office at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The Langley office is the official Air Force contact office for B-2 information. ³Whatever the person might have seen, it was not a B-2.² A spokeswoman at McChord Air Force Base said there were no aircraft from McChord in the area on Tuesday night, and this morning, the National Guard unit at Montesano said that none of their units were operating in the area on Tuesday either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reports on Wednesday described the rumbling, low-flying craft as everything from a commercial jet to a B-2 bomber to a UFO.

The article was not front page news, which surprised  my  wife and I because of how dramatic it was for us. I remember the article mentioning police reports, and seen from Montesano to Aberdeen, and happened around an hour after dusk. The article may have stated something like  &#34;military spokesman had said that nothing was noted in the area&#34; and had speculated that the object may have been a large helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not file any report at the time, but since then recent television shows on UFO&#39;s have shown pictures that are very close to what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did a quick search of our 1999 archives for &#34;Helicopter&#34; &#34;Military&#34;  &#34;River&#34; &#34;Earthquake&#34; and couldn&#39;t find the article you are referring to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you come up with any more information, let me know and I&#39;ll do another search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is a celebrated event, and sighting, in southwestern Washington.

BUT THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS AN Equilateral triangle.red light in center,white lights on the corners.Altitude Approx. 5000ft. stationary to a tilt.Seen from auto on Randolph and Nicholson slightly to the south 70degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I saw the flying triangle of lights from the car. We live near the landing pattern for Andrews Air Force base and I have noticed within the past year that the nav light configuration has changed for many aircraft and now take on a triangle shapes vastly different from the wingtip and tail configuration. What was different about this triangle in the sky was the red light that was equidistant and in the center of the white lights. This weekend there has been ...JUST NOW AN INEXPLICABLE DISPLAY OF RT.RED AND WHITE LFT WING LIGHTS IN LINE  WITH A SUPER BRILLIANT RED STROBE (TWICE THE DISTANCE AS BETWEEN THE WING LIGHTS) BELOW AND 30 DEGRESS LEFT OF THE APPARANT WING LIGHTS. There was an abnormally loud single engine noise which made me look off the porch by my computer. Anyway this weekend has been replete with low screaming fighter jets 3 in formation that I saw and lots of helicopter traffic. The red strobe I just witnessed as I was writing this was really bright about 10-20 million candle power in red.  And why would it be in perfect 90 mph formation below and to the left as if attached in some way. It reminds me of Pheonix when a later event by the National Guard became the cover story.<n>

The object made no sound, had no lights, no haze or beams, no trail like a piece of space debris (or another Russian booster!) and was only visible through 45 degrees of arc because of backscatter from ground light.  It was really moving as evident short time of visual lock and the amount of sky it covered, in my estimation made it supersonic. Thank you<n>

Approximately 10 or 20 miles away, the object appeared to be anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude. And at the same time as the appearance of the sphere was the beam of light shooting down from it at an angle. Very bright, far brighter than any light I have ever seen, for a moment I thought heaven was opening up and peeking down at us. The strong beam was pointed directly onto a glowing red, twisted, tornado-like cloud. The sphere, glowing cloud, and white beam were all stationary for five minutes. As the sphere and beam appeared out of nowhere, so did the glowing red twisty, tornado-like cloud, which appeared to touch the ground as a tornado would, but was totally stationary. However, the &#34;tornado&#34; did not have a cloud above it, as it just dissipated into the sky, about 1/4 the heighth of the sphere.  After five minutes of sitting totally stationary, the sphere and beam of light disappeared completely, but the red glowing cloud stayed stationary. Gradually, the glowing cloud dissolved into nothingness over a period of another five minutes.<n>

However, fighter a/c do not stop.)<n>
9/30/99 15:35|Morrowville|KS|Sphere|15-20 seconds|Fast, noiseless, highly reflective object seen|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09987.html|11|ndxe199909| Fast, noiseless, highly reflective object seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this afternoon, I was standing on the deck of my house (east side) when I happened to look up and see a bright, shining (looked like polished aluminum) seemingly spherical object moving from east to west across the sky.  The duration of the sighting was limited because the object was near the sun, making it necessary for me to use the eave of the house as a sun-block--which, in turn, meant that the object dropped beneath the roof of the house within perhaps 15-20 seconds.  By the time I could run to the other side of the house, I could no longer see it. In regards to the object itself, a number of things struck me as strange.  First, its shape: Unlike the many airliners that traverse the sky overhead, at altitude, during the course of any given day, this object had no wings that I could discern.  Second, and also quite unlike an airliner, the object made no sound whatsoever.  Third, it appeared to be moving at a rate well above that of an airliner. This is speculation on my part, but I would estimate--given what I would take to be the rough altitude of the object (20-30,000 ft.), and given its angular speed--that the object, whatever it was, was moving well in excess of the speed of sound.  This would seem to point to a military aircraft of some type...but, again, the object made no noise at all, and it is my experience that all jet-propelled aircraft, almost regardless of their altitude, make noise audible to people on the ground. As for myself: I am 23 years old, and a graduate of Harvard University.  I&#39;m currently at home, visiting my parents on their farm 2 miles east of the small town of Morrowville, KS.  I am a licensed pilot with an instrument rating.  My hearing is excellent, and my vision is 20/20 with glasses (which I was wearing at the time of the sighting).  Btw, the sky was clear during the sighting.<n>

Larger and brighter than Venus.  Trailed toward Earth much like a meteor.  I did not witness a change in course or speed but it did change from a brilliant green to a glowing red ember just before fading away.  No noises are associated with the siting.  My line of site was obscured by tree branches at first but it traveled Northward into a clear opening.  It appeared to cross the path of an airliner in the vicinity but the airplane seemed much farther away.  The fireball seemed to be 2-3 miles West of my position.  It was much slower, larger, brighter and more colorful than any shooting star I have ever seen.<n>

The other person was female, who said &#34;Its probably something happening at the State Fair.&#34; She then went back into her apartment.  I continued walking my dogs, when I noticed two sets of lights coming from the east, they were high altitude (est. 25,000 to 30,000 ft in altitude) appeared to be in a formation.  First object had flashing white strobe-like lights, with red, green and yellow lights alternating randomly.  Shape of the object and color - rectanglular and either white or silver. The second and third object was approximately three miles behind the first one directly behind. White strobe-like lights flashing rapidly.  Alternating white, blue and infrequent red lights.  No jet engine heard or recipricating or piston engine perceived or heard from any of the three objects. Travel appeared like they were floating.  Called FAA command center, spoke with Officer J.

Saw extraordinarily bright orb traveling slowly due North in straight line.  This is the second time I&#39;ve seen this phenomenom (the first time was with my son and husband, also during daylite hours).  Like the first time I saw it, I strained to see if I could determine a form or origin of the object.  Have not seen as bright of object in daytime sky like this.  Was defininately not a plane or helicopter.  Thought maybe could be a reflection of some type but the reflection would not have disappeared behind a cloud.  The first time this object was observed, my whole family watched.  It was there one moment and gone the next.  Wasn&#39;t like we saw it fly off rapidly -- it just disappeared.  Today, the object went behind a cloud and just never reappeared.  Almost had a wreck on two-lane country road trying to relocate the object.<n>

The light was at a 30 degree inclination, traveling North to south very quickly, covering a distance of 5 inches on my windshield in 1 second. It left no contrail, no exhaust trail or any heat variances visible against the sky which was beginning to light up due to the rising sun (not visible yet). The western sky was still a very dark blue/black. The object left a light trail, such as seen on meteors entering the atmosphere and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared which is why I suspect it is a meteor. However it was very bright for your usual meteors and left no trail in the sky whatsoever. Again there was a north south heading as well.<n>

We then turned right again into the street where I live and saw on the horizon a bright star shaped object like a satelite viewed from the ground moving at a speed. An hour later going back on that road, my brother saw a bright light move through the sky, and the person behind us also saw this light. It lasted for about 15 seconds. Strange?<n>

I was able to make out three pinpoints of light in a triangle formation about the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length. This formation seemed to be dimming out at times, as though covered by a fuzzy darkness that would occlude up to two of the lights in the triangle.  I followed the object with my eyes while it moved left, then diagonally upward to the right, then left again, continueing toward Orion&#39;s belt, where I stopped watching to go and get my roommate, when we returned to the front yard, I could no longer spot the object(s). This observation took about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, beginning at about 7:55 pm PDT, 09/27/99.<n>

I believe the ufo incident occurs within the first half.  Behind the main object of the scene (either shuttle or MIR),  there is time to see stars, and perhaps a planet or other satellite arcing gently from left of screen to right.  Suddenly, there appears a narrow football shaped bright light which travels 1/2 across the screen considerably faster than the other objects, and maybe 20 times larger than the stars.   Solid white bright light,  perhaps a little fuzzy from speed of movement.  Object is only on screen a max of 15 secs.  Since the film is shown every other hour all day long at the Space Center Imax Theatre 1,  it should be easy for others to look for it.  I happened to be observing the stars moving when I spotted it.<n>

It was bigger than the planes in length.It was completely silent. I saw this same object fly above the plane going in the opposite direction heading east or towards Washington. This was approx. 10 minutes later. At 8:30 P.M. I saw a triangular shaped object fly overhead also heading east. It was a bright white light flying approx. 1000 feet above regular aircraft. Because it was flying low enough, I was able to make out it being triangular in shape. It could have been the same object I saw earlier.<n>

I was in the passenger seat of the car, and turned to say something to my friend when this object caught my attention.  It was turning low over the trees about 300 feet away to the east (near the Mormon Temple) and the closest thing I could attribute it to was a miniaturized Stealth Fighter.  It couldn&#39;t have been more than 20 feet long, and it seemed incredibly thin ... no more than a few feet in depth.  I directed the driver&#39;s attention to it, and he caught a small glimpse of it as well.  It was headed towards Lake Sammamish, keeping low to the trees and I lost site of it after 10 seconds or so.  Not sure what I saw, but it was no bird and no aircraft I have ever seen.  Again, the only thing it reminded me of was a mini-Stealth Fighter.<n>

We were playing on the old number 2 hole (new #11) on the Granite Pointe Golf Course. We both heard planes overhead, and we saw quite a sight. At least three military type jets flying in close formation around a much larger plane. The plane seemed to have a very large tank or possibly craft underneath or attached to it&#39;s belly. The planes were flying quite low. A Chemtrail/contrail seemed to be coming from the bizarre looking craft or tank. Later that day, a couple who live on Kootenay Lake - and a co-worker of mine, - 5-6 miles away, saw several jets flying patterns for over 20 minutes above the lake.

In a clear sky there were 4to6 lights surrounding about 100+ small lights tightly condensed togeather in a mass that looked a swarm of bee&#39;s would if each bee had a light attached to it. There was a little bit of motion within the pack but the surrounding lights &amp; the pack were fixed in the formation. The color of all lights was amber with the pack also slightly fuzzy like a cloud or mist were enveloping it. There was no sound. they wre about 3000ft,and no more than a mile away, at about 100mph? They were north of my location moving south south-east. When first sighted ,I had 15-20 seconds of viewing time before they were behind the tree line. I then ran to the other side of the property to se the object clear the trees. At this point only the condensed mass was visible (rest of the formation was gone) and it was very fuzzy looking but still amber in color, same altitude, and gone from sight 30sec. moving S.E. this formation was only bright enough to be seen with binoculars.

My husband and I were outside in our spa in South Las Vegas. At 11:08 we saw an orange illuminated round object approaching from the South. It flew directly above us and headed North/east.About one minute later we saw another coming from the same area as the first, again flew above us and off to the north. About two minutes passed, then the third appeared, this time from the south/slightly west. About 15 seconds later the 4th appeared, then another 15 seconds elapsed and the 5th appeared. The 4th &amp; 5th came from the same direction as the first. There was a full moon that evening and clear visibility. In comparision to planes which we could see flying off to the east, the speed of these craft was 4X the speed of the planes. No more than one object was visible at the same time. It took each object 5 seconds to cross our line of vision. All objects left in the same north/east direction. I have contacted the local newspaper and found that a man called to report orange objects int he sky that Saturday, however the newspaper did not take a report or get a name/number. A woman called a local television station and reported seeing one round object at 3:30am on Sunday the 26th, again a name/number was not obtained.I went on a &#34;well listened to&#34; local radio station and discussed my sighting and asked to have others who also saw this call, there were no calls. I have also reported this to NIDS.<n>

The lights were identifiable.  Not as an airplane, we&#39;ve seen those often around here, but of something irregular.  The flight pattern was stagnent. It hovered for about 5 mins, then eratically set off. it didn&#39;t fly in a straight line. It zigzagged.  the lights on the object were white, spaced unevenly.  The light was emmitted in a pulse tone sequence, going off beat every now and then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband does not believe in UFO&#39;s.  He had witnessed the sighting the other evening with me.  he is a skeptic. I on the other hand have witnessed many sightings, since I was about 7yrs old.  I&#39;ve ahd dreams of attempted abductions.  I also experience insomnia and fear of sleep at times.  It always feels as if someone is watching, sometimes, even in my room before I fall asleep.  i have awaken dozens of times in the middle of the night, my pulse rate through the roof, but I couldn&#39;t recall the dream.  I wake up scared.  I know it is them.<n>

It was a silver/metallic, apparently cigar shaped object (maybe smaller in the middle?). I couldn&#39;t see any wings and it didn&#39;t make any noise that I could hear. An airplane passing below it going in the opposite direction (eastish?) made me notice that the object didn&#39;t have any sort of lights- only the reflection of the sun on its surface. I know nothing about airplanes. The only thing I can tell you about how high it was is that the airplane below it (a big commercial one coming in for a landing at Nash. airport) was red in the setting sun and the object was still in bright sunlight. It didn&#39;t zip across the sky; it was there before the airplane flew over and it was there for a while after it was gone. It moved in a precise, high arc across the sky.<n>

It was heading north-east towords Hanford and the Yakima Firing Center.<n>

This evening I had a clear view of the south end of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains behind.  I was watching the sky from my window and saw a streak of light that appeared to be moving very slowly at an angle of 25-35 degrees in a southerly direction.  I looked at it through my 8X binoculars, when I first saw the streak and it was near the middle of the field of view with the lower edge of the field on the water/Whidbey Island edge. (I don&#39;t know if that is helpful - it&#39;s a way to locate raptors for birdwatchers.) I was able to watch the streak through my spotting scope which has a zoom lens 20X to 50X, and it looked like dense orange burning gasses getting less dense toward the end, but not fading very much.  I could see no object associated with this streak of light, just the look of roiling, burning gasses.  It did not leave a trail as it moved, but moved as one entity.  As the streak was moving toward then behind the mountains, it passed an adjacent mountain peak, possibly Mt. Olympus.  The streak was about 2/3 the size of the silouetted slope of that mountain peak, so it must have been very large.  Mt. Olympus is about 70-80 miles away as the crow flies from Everett.  I am not sure about the length of time of the observation, but I had time to get my binoculars across the room, watch through my binoculars for a short while, go across the room, get my spotting scope set up, find the streak in my scope, which took a little while because I could no longer see it with my naked eye and had to check again with my binoculars to get a location, and watched the streak until it went behind the mountains.  I work for Snohomish County Surface Water Management as a watershed steward for the Snohomish River basin.  I have never seen anything like this before.  One more thing, it probably moving westerly as well since at first I could see it without optics, then it must have gotten farther away since I could only find it again by using my binoculars.<n>

I noticed up in the sky at some distance from me 3 circular (oval) disks of light arranged in a triangular fashion, as though they were attached to something much bigger. I thought it rather unusual, and although there were plenty of passenger aircraft around due to the proximity to heathrow airport, the object appeared to stay stationary in the sky, but then changed its axis slowly, so instead of the lights looking oval they appeared completely round. As I continued to view this thing, one of these disks of light suddenly shot between the other two at great speed &amp; vanished, leaving the other two motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside to check why they were barking.  I looked around and saw in the north east a hovering triangle object.  It&#39;s had bright lights coming from it. They would get bright and dimmer.  During this time 8-12 Jets flew in the approximate area of the object.  The object would move in circular and figure eight moves, while bobbing in the sky. It eventually moved farther away in the sky untill it was just one light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was close enough when I first saw it to see some detail.  It had a triagle shape. Lights came from the three angles of it&#39;s triangle shape.  The light it omitted was white like a star, however at the angles of the object the light was a golden yellow color.  The object kept moving away from me in a north east direction in the sky.  While hovering away it would move in circles and figure eight motions.  While moving in these motions it would bob up and down quickly.  A couple of jets were flying around it.  Later many more jets flew over the area in the sky.  The came from the east and west.  The first few jets banked around the object.  The rest flew straight accross the sky. From the east and west.  The last jet flew high above the object.  The jets lasted about half a hour.  Then they left.  You could hear them and see their lights flashing on and off.  When the object and the jets were in the sky together they seemed to dance all around the sky. We rarely hear or see more than one jet at night.  To see that many in a half hour was bizzare.  I also saw little dots moving fast around the sky of the object. During this hour I saw two shooting stars or what I believed to be shooting stars.  One went across the whole eastern sky, while the other one went across the western sky. Eventually, after an hour the object moved far off into the north west sky.<n>

At around 20:30 hrs we were travelling west bound on Highway 183 and had just taken the exit to highway 10 when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter hovering several miles away. The light pattern consisted of two soft crisp white lights (no glare, like white globes.)equally spaced in a horizontal plane centered on a triangular formation of three synchronized, pulsing (not flashing), red lights. there was a dark green patch in a whispy V just above the red lights. On initial observation the outside white lights were spaced as far apart as my pinky finger held up at arms length. We were startled when the object quickly came strait toward our position as we approache the first stop light after the bridge.  Duration of the transition was less than two seconds and the object stopped several hundred meters away approximately 100 meters AGL at our 1 o&#39;clock position. Accelleration and decelleration appeared to be instantanious.  At this point the white lights were spaced as far apart as all four of my fingers held together at arms length. The object held its position for approximately twenty seconds then slowly moved less than half of its lenth to the left. As the traffic signal changed and we started forward. It was then that the object sped off in the same direction that it had come from becoming apulsing point of red light in the distance.  We lost sight of the object behind the local terrain.  At no point during this observation did the relative position of the lights change (ie rotate, tilt, lose relative spacing etc...). Total duration of the observation was approximately one minute. Two outbound civillian airliners were observedat a higher altitude during the progression of the observation.

The first of thses was noticed approx 1 hour into the flight.  At approx 39,000 ft i noticed on the l/h/s of the plane a formation of red and blue lights about 10 feet apart,  later i witnessed red and white lights going under the plane and pinkish red lights that turned to glowing red at the side of the plane.  They formed a triangle of lights before merging into a straight line. Then later in the flight flourescent orange/amber  shapes, in the shape of a sofa.  The object was in front then adjacent to the plane. before i lost sight of it.  I got out of my seat to see the object appearing to be going backwards slowly. I went back to my seat and continued to see triangular formations mimiking the plane, copying the lights and appearing playfull.  later i saw an orange shape very low over a village. All others on the flight were reading, sleeping or watching the inflight movie.  An orange sphere moved towards the plane, i asked a fellow passenger to look but it dropped suddenly out of view, the passenger was female and French, she said she saw nothing,but i felt she had.  I felt scared an isolated.  I asked the pilots after the flight did he see weird lights..he asked me what i saw, then said no.<n>

I heard them calling for me (Dad! Dad!) in very excited voices. Before I could get outside, they arrived at the door out of breath, telling me of a huge triangular shaped object that hovered over the area, then &#34;took off&#34; at a such a high rate of speed that the lights around the edges, and other lights on the bottom, were blurred. No sound was heard. Shortly after the craft disappeared past the eastern tree line, both boys described a very bright red light beam apparently coming up from the ground in the north, then falling back down to the ground. From the vantage point that they took me to, I did see a jet passing overhead, and asked them if that was what they saw. They both immediately insisted that that was too small, and spread their arms apart wide to show me how big the object that they saw had been. I asked both boys, who have never made up stories before, to come inside and draw pictures of what they saw. I sent both boys to separate bedrooms to make a picture and them bring them to me separately. Both boy&#39;s drew the same picture without collaborating. I am convinced, that they did see something very unusual.<n>

What was so odd was the tail of what seemed to be a contrail from the object immediately from the back end that was much thicker than the object itself and extended about 15 lengths of the object into a point, as though it were the tail of a comet.  The contrail was thick and solid, but billowy looking and was very illuminated or bright, but it did appear like smoke that was coming from the object.  It did not trail off in a long dispersed fashion, like it does from high flying aircraft that leave contrails across the sky.  This stuff coming out of this thing was very contained in its appearance.  The object traveled very slow almost 4 min in my vision while I parked the car in the drive went in the house, grabbed the phone came back outside and called my husband at work and proceeded to describe what I was seeing to him.  It traveled as though I were seeing it from the side view but as it moved farther away it was not exactly perpendicular to me.  The path was more like southwest to northeast.

We were startled to see a black hole in the center of the round light with a band of black protruding from the left side and which changed to the right side, and on the opposite side of the black circle was a slight bulge.  We also viewed the moon to make sure our telescope was working correctly and it was.  If this is Venus, why does it have this peculiar black circle in front of it?

The moon was out and almost full. Above these two were a circle of approximately 10-12 smaller lights creating a semi-circle above and then appox 4-5 more to the north creating a &#34;tail.&#34;  There was a lot of interactive light activity going back and forth between all of the lights, creating what appeared to be lines of light.  There was also unusual movement of some of the lights (up, down, left, right) which confirmed to me that these were not airplanes, satellites or the Russian Muir Station which was in the night sky.  I went in the house to find binoculars and when I came out, the two main lights dropped behind the mountains at amazing speed and simultaneously.  The remaining lights also dropped behind the mts.  Then a massive group of lights rose up above the mts in a horizontal oval shape.  At this point, my daughter who&#39;s 6 and my husband came home from their evening walk.  I pointed out the cluster of lights and they witnessed the remainder of what I describe.  The cluster of lights looked like a galaxy, but very organized.  Occasionally a light would blink or twinkle.  The mass of lights then proceeded to move to the south in a collective, organized manner.  They moved faster than the rotation of the earth.  They then stopped.  They dropped below the mountains and we could barely see the glow of the lights on the horizon.  Then two bright lights moved above the horizon and stayed for a bit.  Then dropped back below the horizon.  The collective group then all rose above the horizon and created a side portrait of a jet airplane (tail, body and cockpit).  The mass of lights stayed there for a few minutes then dropped below the horizon.  They then fazed in and out, up and down from the horizon until they finally disappeared completely below the horizon.  The evening was mostly clear with a few scattered clouds.  The area is rural and city light is extremely minimal.  The moon was very bright, but not enough to deter the visibility of what we saw. My ! husband and I are college educated (Univ of Wash).  I have witnessed other paranormal activity, but never felt compelled to report it.  I consider us to be normal, professional people.  We all felt the experience to be really eery and it bothered my daughter quite a bit.  I also noticed that a lot of dogs in the neighborhood were whining.  Thank you for the opportunity to share this experience.<n>

They didn&#39;t have any kind of remote starter mechanism either.  I got in the car to try and figure out what was wrong and about 30 seconds later my friend&#39;s told me to get out of the truck NOW. I got out because they actually sounded serious.  I looked up and saw three bright lights about 150 yards up.  It was dark out so I&#39;m not sure it was that high.  It didn&#39;t make a sound AT ALL. The ovalish shaped object didn&#39;t do anything to us. It was dead quiet and the small breeze seemed to stop on its own.   It hovered above us not doing anything for about 45 seconds to a minute.

I happened to look up at the sky and saw a bright orange ball (almost like a ball of fire in the sky) travelling at a high rate of speed.  I pointed it out to my friend.  At first we thought it was a comet, (but it didn&#39;t have a tail), then we thought it might be a meteor or a shooting star.  However it was neither.  We watched it coming down toward earth at like a 45 degree angle, then it abruptly started falling straight toward the ground.  Thats when we saw it like transform into like a triangle and had bright lights that lit up on the bottom of it which we think might of been thrusters.  The lights were really bright, then this object shot into the sky and dissapeared completely.  This all happened in approximately 30-40 seconds.  As close as it was to us, had it of been any kind of aircraft, we would have heard something.  As it is it was completely silent.  It was also a cloudy and semi stormy night, and it was traveling under the clouds, and even though the actual object was bright, no light reflected off the clouds.<n>
9/21/99 20:49|Everett|WA|Changing|25-30 seconds|I watched a cylinder shaped object head west, then changed form to a boomerang, transparent like state and then it traveled south|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09868.html|63|ndxe199909| I watched a cylinder shaped object head west, then changed form to a boomerang, transparent like state and then it traveled south<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the deck of my home which faces southeast.  At 20:49 on 9/21/99,  an object caught my attention out of the corner of my eye as I was facing south.  To my left, this cylinder/tubular shaped thing appeared to have some substance to it.  It had some depth.  I could not identify the color, but the spiral material was darker than the actual cylinder. The item did not appear to be hollow.  It appeared to have some kind of material spiraling around it, not in motion around the object, but being in complete contact with the cylinder.  At first, it appeared to be hovering but it was slowly moving west.  It was approximately 1500 feet high (max).  I watched the cylinder travel  west for about 5 seconds. At this point, I lost focus on the item for about 3 seconds.  It was like it had just disappeared.  From this point, I believe it was the same object, a transparent, boomerang shaped object located about the same distance up, maybe 500 feet higher, began to travel south.  The boomerang shaped object appeared to have more of a rounded top while the bottom appeared to be more flat.  Maybe 2000 feet high.  The moon was south/southwest of the object and I could see the reflection of the moon on parts of the object.  However, I could not make out a definite outline of the object.  I could see it, I could make out its shape but I could not describe what color it was.  I could see right through the object.  When it passed stars, I could see the stars through the object but they were a little diffused like seeing them thru a tinted window.  Then, the definition of the curves in the object were a little more obvious as I watched the stars kind of curve a bit when they would pass the edges of the object.  The object was pointed south, but it was traveling at an angle where I could tell that it was boomerang shaped. As the object traveled more towards the moon, I blocked the light of the moon out with my hand and continued to track the object.  It continued to travel south but I lost it about an inch and a ! half (fr om where I was standing, it was an inch and a half from arms length) before it would have passed in front of the moon.  Total time of watching the object travel south was about 20 seconds.  I ran downstairs and grabbed the binoculars and yelled at my mother in law to come verify what I had just seen.  I searched the sky with the binoculars and my mother in law for about an hour and saw nothing again but a shooting star.  No sound came from the object.  No light came from the object.  I will be sending a map with the location of the object, the direction it was traveling and a scetch of the item(s) as they appeared<n>

Observed fireball with other cars stopped by side of highway for approx. 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving eastbound on Interstate 90 going towards the ID\WA State line and I noticed 3 cars parked on the side of the highway. Then I glanced up at the east sky and I saw what appeared to be a fireball. My first thought was that it could have been an airplane on fire. It was approx. 200 feet above the ground. After driving closer to it I noticed it was spinning at a high rate of speed in a very tight circle. I am color blind so I could not observe what color it was.  It appeared to be hovering at this time. For the last 2 or 3 minutes it appeared to be in motion going away from us toward Spokane WA. Then entire event lasted approx. 20 minutes until it was completely out of sight. The light level was dusk almost dark. I am a student at North Idaho College.<n>

The event was at right about sunset on 9-21-99.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday evening 9-21-99,at about 6:45 PM, I was walking through the Country Club apartment complex on the South side of Indianapolis near S. Madison Ave. and E. Troy Ave.. I was facing West just at sunset when I observed what I at first thought was a hawk flying in the West / Southwestern sky. As it moved, it soon became apparent that it was actually a large chevron shape. The object pivoted on its left wing and leveled off It then either shot off faster than my eyes could follow it or it became invisible. I would estimate the size of the craft at between 100 to 150 feet across at about a mile distance; at an altitude of approximately 2,000 - 3,000 feet. It appeared to be a solid dark grey or black color. Just as soon as the craft disappeared from my sight, a second object shot just below the point where I had seen the first. It moved so quickly that all I could perceive was a solid black streak. It reminded me of what a hockey puck might look like after being hit as seen at the level of the ice. I couldn&#39;t detect any sound or unusual lighting.<n>

It had 3 whitish yellowish lighhts and a center red light that was fairly big. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I then saw it fly upward at very high speeds and it was gone bfrore I knew it. It looked approximately 20 feet from edge to edge. I noticed when it flew away it didn&#39;t fly away like i thought it would, smoothly. It flew kind of in sections, like  it would fly then stop and suddenly appear 10 ft. away. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I tryed to tell my self that maybe a cloud or dust had blown between us and it to cause the color change, but the stars behind it did not change color. We had been looking at it for about ten min. when it change back to white, that is when we notice that a jet plaine apaired to be approching it. When the jet got close the object turned orange again and a beam of light from the object,[like a spotlight], lit-up the jet. The jet turned very fast and looked like it was circling around. The object then moved down and got very large has if it were getting close, and then shot out of view to the south. I have seen strange thangs in the sky before, but nothang like this!<n>

As I realized what I was looking at it quickly and visibly slowed almost to a stop,before performing what looked like a loop de loop and shooting off East to West.At this time I saw what looked like a second object appear and take off after the other one.(I say &#34;appear&#34; because I diddnt see where it came from) The entire event took less than twenty seconds.<n>
9/20/99 02:00|Momoishi (Japan)||Triangle|unknowed|Encounter described in details.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77185.html|80|ndxe199909| Encounter described in details<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I’m about to describe next isn’t open to discussion.  I’ll simply put what I came to know through an experience which can’t be described by words has changed everything. I don’t expect you to believe and, honestly, I don’t even care what you think.  I will never disclose any of my personal information simply because my end of the rope is weaker than the end where a government stands and I still need to pay my bills.  Denial it’s an unbreakable law kept by all means where one’s life value means little or nothing against governments and corporations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I would like to ask your discretion for what I am about to describe will affect the way you see life itself, including religion.  If you truly believe in God, stop reading this.  I wish I had this option myself because once you lose hope, there’s nothing left.  Trust me.   Sometimes, ignorance it’s the best patch to find happiness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll start saying that I’m not American.  This experience has nothing to do with stories about Area 51 or Roosevelt crashes.  I’ve been in 29 countries around the world and speak 5 languages and I work with computers (I will not disclosure my profession).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year is 1999.  Just another Friday night under a beautiful sky, around 2am.  Location: North Japan. Life in Japan is really stressful.  It’s normal to work more than 12 hours a day (at least in my branch).  It’s very different from western countries where people socialize with their neighbors and have a social life.  In Japan, you socialize at work and with family and one’s circle of friends are those people from school times.  Kind of weird but that’s how most people live their lives in that island. So, the most common question: - Were you there alone?   Yes, unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What were you doing there?   Relaxing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2 am?  Many people (like myself) go shopping at the supermarket 2~3am.  It’s normal in north Japan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does the government know about the incident?   Hell yeah, I saw 2 F-16s trying to catch up before we left, probably from the American military base in Misawa, 15 to 20 miles from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What you mean &#34;we?&#34;  Keep reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the beach on a city Momoishi.  It’s an industrial park that has a long walk patch where you stand 5 to 6 meters above sea level.  This patch was actually built to break waves brought by tsunamis and high waves formed by a typhoon that hits Japan very often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking along the patch, the only source of light is the stars and the moon.  If you ever went to a place where there are no cities around, you’ll know what I mean.  The sky shines in a way that it’s impossible to see on the cities.  That goes without talking about the fresh air from the ocean blowing smooth on the hot summer.  Just perfect.  I did that a lot before that faithful day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked about 3 miles along the coast before I spotted a bright light coming from the hoods.  I thought it was just young people parted in one of the many parking spots along the cost with their Xenon’s headlights.  In Japan it’s pretty common and affordable to have a custom car, just like you probably saw on movies.  I didn’t really pay too much attention.  Actually, it has kind like blurring my vision because when you walk in the dark and suddenly you see light, your eyes take some time to adapt and you go almost blind when trying to see dark spots again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I kept on moving carefully, watching out where I was walking.  I wanted to walk faster so I could kept appreciating the beautiful, quiet and peaceful night but I heard a &#34;boom&#34; coming from the light. It was so dammed laud that I thought it was an explosion of some kind.  It scared me to death just like when somebody plays a trick on you.  I looked back and saw that, once bright white light had moved vertically and now has changing colors.  I thought to myself that maybe it was because I was half mile away so it was just a optical trip but I discarded this option because I was the one already at 5 to 6 meters above the sea level walking the patch and I that car supposed to be at least at the same level as I was, not above.  Despise me been blinded again because of the light, I started to run back on the light’s direction.  Maybe someone needed help.  I took my mobile to call the cops.  It was working but it was completely useless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything had vanished, including the OS. No line, nothing worked besides the backlight.  That’s when I stop running a got scared.  I got really scared.  I know that takes a great deal to an electronic device to be how to call it, &#34;erased?&#34;   And of course, all those stories that you heard about thieves, monsters, and ghosts start flooding your mind and you just get in high alert like your life is in danger or something.  I can’t even describe the feeling.  The air becomes heavy, hard to breath and you just want to get out of there.  I started to run again, blinded by the light.  Of course, the worst happened. I feel from the patch.  Blinded and now hurt, that was the worst that could happen. At first, I didn’t realize how bad I got hurt.  I was trying to find a way to climb back and run to my car and go home. Where I was, there is a small forest between the beach and the patch.  The trees are spaced and almost no ground vegetation.  Depends how is your mood, it can look beautiful or r! eally scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up back on my feet but when I looked forward, no more that 10 meters away, that small guy with his huge head has staring at me.  My legs gave up on me at the very same moment. I was shaking so much that I couldn’t even screen for help.  Thinking about it now, I am not half of the man I thought I was.  It’s embarrassing and pathetic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were starting to get used to the environment.  That’s when I saw a second individual behind the first one, between 2 trees about 25 meters.  If you ask me what I was thinking at that time, I would say: - I don’t. I wasn’t able to hold even one thought in my mind or make reason of the situation I was in but I was well aware that it was an encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a lot of stories about abducted people and crops.  I always thought that it would be nice if were true but for me, it was nothing but a good story.  But now days I think to myself: those were really brave people that were capable to make a reason of the situation and analyze the circumstances or it’s a complete hoax.  Either way, I never thought that my body and mind would give up on me so bad. The worst part for me was the staring.  Those big &#34;black shiny&#34; eyes were so indifferent, so cold,...I can’t explain.  One thing I know for sure.  Those eyes saw right through me. I tell you why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t really know how long it took until I heard a voice saying:  Come down now! My head has steady facing those individuals at all times like a cat hunting a mouse.  My full attention was to those two standing before me but I didn’t saw no lip moving.  I looked around real quick and I heard again:  No harm will come to you.  Come down now.  That’s when I realize that the voice was I my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without even realize, I start putting some order in my thoughts.  My shock state has start been replaced by reason.  Until this point, my head was a mess.  I can’t tell how long time had passed since I first spot the first individual and I didn’t paid attention at all on the light anymore.  I felt like if I took my eyes off the subject something bad would happen to me.  Slowly, I stood up and took a defense position. I start to look around for places where I could run.  My legs stopped shaking but my shoulder and hand were killing me. I look at my hand and I saw a lot of blood.  I cut my hand deep when I felt and also mess up my shoulder. I tried to stop the bleeding by holding the cut with my other hand.  While I was attending my hand I heard the voice again:  No harm will come to you.  Until that point I haven’t replied a word but this time I asked: what you want from me?  The voice replied: To teach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never knew if just one of them were talking to me or both.  The voice was always the same tone.  It never changed. The following is a series of questions and answers that followed my first reply:  Me (after a short moment of reflection, I said -always using my own voice-): I  do not understand and I am scared to death.  What do you want to teach me?  Voice:   No harm will come to you. I am here to answer your questions.  I am here to show you our ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t think of anything to ask besides what regards my safety and situation.  Then I asked: Me: If you mean no harm to me, can I go home now?  Voice: I am no more alien to you that you are to me. I am here to help you.  To guide you.  I cannot force you to see what I want to show you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that very moment, the second individual backed up and disappeared in the dark.  The one standing in front of me took a few steps back.  A heavy silence stroke the air. I asked:  Me:  What will happen to me if I choose to see what you want to show me?  Voice: No harm will come to you.  I will show you our way.  I will guide you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me:  Will I be allowed to go home after that? Voice: Yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same moment, the second individual appeared and joined the first one. I looked around again hoping that somebody would show up…the voice said: This way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they turned around and started walking deep in the hoods heading to the light’s direction, I could clearly see for the first time the anatomy of those individuals. Unlike us, it seems that they try to balance the head while walking which gave me the impression that they push the neck back and direct the head down in order to look straight. It looks creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked 300 meters (approximately) towards the light. I avoided looking up because I didn’t want to be blinded and lose sight of my surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a platform like thing ahead. I hesitated. The two individuals stepped on the platform and turned to me. I headed: This way. My story begins here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I start I must state that I don’t really care what you think my story it’s a lie or true. I still have my life to take care, my bills to pay, my reputation as professional to keep and a social life to attend.  I won’t compromise my life to satisfy your ego or curiosity. It’s for you to decide what to believe. It’s for you to decide how to deal with what I’m about to tell you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live our lives based on what we think it’s true and based on our own sense of justice. Because of that, we rage wars against whatever contradicts what we think its right. What if your truth it’s an illusion created to deceive you, to control what you think? I put all these conflicts behind and now I’m just trying to have a good life and enjoy every second of it. I truly don’t care if people kill each other over oil, money or whatever because, in my opinion, we are a no more than a cancer for this planet. We are not even able to understand each other and organize like cancer cells does. That put us lower as viruses. How pathetic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, my opinion counts for nothing and that’s not why you are reading this so let’s move on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked into the platform keeping my distance from those individuals. I guess they were prepared or experienced of dealing with primitive civilizations such as ours (comparing to theirs). There was in no moment pressure or treat on their part against me but I could tell that they didn’t trust me too which is completely understandable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he platform started lifting toward the light. As we approached, I could see the craft’s “belly”. It has triangle shape, dark colored (maybe because was night), and the strong lights were coming from something that looked like half spheres placed along the corners plus one right above us. Unlike the lights on the corners, the light above us was like blue neon but not strong enough to blind the eyes. Actually, that particular light didn’t affect my eyes at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We float into the air for about 20 to 30 meters, just above the tree top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got onboard, the blue light faded until shut complete off. The first thing I saw was one more individual standing on the edge of the platform, just like it was waiting for our arrival. I started to shake again thinking to myself how stupid I was for been there. At the same moment I heard the voice saying: No harm will come to you. That’s when I realized that they could listen to my thoughts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked them how come they could go into my head and talk to me. They answer that they can’t communicate with me if I choose not to listen. It said that nothing can be imposed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following sentence was: This way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The compartment we arrived was rounded and the walls were just dark. There were 2 entrances in front of me and a bigger on the other side. They the 2 entrances had no doors but the bigger one was closed with the same material as the wall. I could tell it was a door because of the void in the wall. I don’t know for sure though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the right entrance. Two of them in front of me and one on my back. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable on my entire life. In this corridor, we passed through 3 other entrances closed by similar material as the wall. There were no symbols of ornaments anywhere. By this time, my body was hurting so much and my hand kept bleeding. I was really tired. We enter a room which has a table like thing which I was asked to sit. Two of them entered the room along with me but one of them followed the corridor. One of them took my hand and pointed a pen like instrument towards my wound. I felt like getting an electrical shock so I pulled my hand away. As I looked at my wound cleaning the blood using my shirt, it was fully closed and a small scar replaced the wound. I was amazed. Once more, it pointed the instrument on my shoulder and the pain was gone (after the shock, of course). As it returned the instrument to its original position, I heard: This way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up fully recovered. I was no longer tired plus I felt my body was lighter. As I followed the two individuals, I came to realize that they also no longer had trouble walking. My conclusion was that the craft environment provides a lower gravity allowing the body to waste less energy. Again, this was my conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them looked exactly the same just like a copy of each other. They were wearing metal like filters although I don’t think it was metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out of the room back to the corridor. After 3 entrances closed by doors, we turned left which leaded to another corridor. This time, it wasn’t so dark. I could see some sort of device on the left wall spreading to its entire length. It had some small blinking lights on it but nothing fancy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t count how many doors we passed by for I was looking the device on the other side of the wall but the corridor lead to a wider room where another 2 individuals were sitting on something like chairs. There were control panels on the front wall which was rounded in just one side. The panels where transparent and full of symbols draw by light, very different of our standard monitors. Their hand movements were always slow. My best guess it that they don’t used their bodies randomly like we do by making sports or other activities. Every time they talked to me, there were no movements at all. No gestures or lip moving, nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the wall and floor became transparent like glass. I was able to see the moon and the city’s lights below us. That’s when I realize that the craft’s position had changed and we were no longer at the beach and no longer at low altitude. I didn’t felt a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we slowly flew across the city below (I think it was Hachinohe but it’s impossible to tell), something happened. The two individuals sitting on their chairs pointed to dots of light on the east pin-pointed at the wall. The view just zoomed like you zoom your video camera but in high quality image. I recognized by shape two F-16s approaching fast. The image zoomed back to normal then suddenly, all the wall images faded into a dark blue and soon into black with bright dots everywhere. It took less than 2 seconds.  We were in space!  My perplexity was broken by the voice saying: Listen carefully for you are in danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a second to react. I was about to ask it how come but it starts its speech: -	The universe is a cycle of life.  Life is re-engineered at the end of each cycle. During each cycle, new species are created and develop conscience but at the end of the cycle, those consciences are destroyed to allow new species and conscious to rise. Only those species capable of organizing and learn will be allowed to go through the next cycle. My specie was allowed to continue through the next cycle by understanding the rules of the universe and its compositions. You are not prepared to continue through the next cycle. You will be destroyed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked. Those bastards lied to me by telling me “no harm will come to you”. I felt anger and I hated myself for been so stupid. Then I said: - I thought that no harm will come to me. That’s why I am here. To learn. Not to be destroyed! The voice continued: -	Our mission it’s to find species capable of communication and teach them the rules of the universe. No harm will come to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when I realized that it was referring me as a human been, not as individual. My head exploded with questions but it continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout time, we came to you to teach and to guide. We showed you how the universe works and teach about the stars. We send one of our own throughout time in order to live among you and teach our ways. And yet, you still fail to understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interrupted it by asking how come I never heard of another species teachings on my planet. It replies: -	We sent one of our own through one of your vessels. A vessel is no more than a transport as machines are a way to enhance the vessel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interrupted it again by asking:  - Why am I in danger? Why telling me this? What can I do? -	The end of the cycle has come. We will help those who have learn our ways as we did to those we teach how to build. No harm will come to those who are willing to understand and learn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds were filled by silence. Then I ask: - Even if I am aware of this, what difference could I possible make?  Who will believe my story?  Why can’t you land your craft before the crowds and make your point yourself? -	Nothing can be imposing. We have a pact with your species that allow us to contact you individually but not public in exchange of technology. We will no longer come back until the cycle ends. When it does, we will help those who can be saved. No harm will come to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My interest of their technology or the craft itself disappeared completely.  It wouldn’t even reply all my questions properly. Without even realizing what’s were going around me, I looked to the wall and I saw city lights. We were on Earth again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard: This way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked back to the corridor, just back to the rounded room where we arrived. I was dropped 30 km away from where my car was parked. My clock has dead, my mobile dead but I had money enough to take a cab.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never spoke a word about what happen that night and I never went back to that beach alone again, especially at night time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my story.  Feel free to discard or do publish it but do not try to locate or contact me in any way.  I will not discuss this in public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked to my left (150 deg.) and saw three circular spots in a triangular pattern ,about 30 deg. above the horizon. At first I thought they were searchlights, then I realized that they were moving in unison. The three objects were circular in shape, and the bottoms were evenly illuminated in a brown-orange light, with no distinguishing features or markings. There were no navigation position lights or anti-collision strobes,red or white. There was no noise from these objects. From my perspective they appeared to be a little smaller than the size of a dime. During the pass one of the objects position changed in reference to the lead one. They were moving in a northerly direction.I ran into the house to get a time check and went back out and observed the objects until they faded from sight. Prior to losing the original three objects I looked directly overhead. I saw two points of light (at great altitude), similarly colored to the original three objects, moving in the same northerly direction. They did not twinkle and the fifth ones&#39; position changed slightly in relation to number four. My home is near the intersection of Roosevelt Blvd. (US Rte 1) and Rhawn St. in northeast Philadelphia. I am about one mile south of Northeast Philadelphia airport and in the flightpath of runway 6. I am a Tech with the local telephone co.,an amateur radio operator, and hold a private pilots license, though not actively flying. Of all my years of looking up at the nighttime sky I never seen anything like this before, I am 53 yrs old. faded from sight. Prior to losing sight of the original three objects, I was looking dirctly overhead and saw two points of light,(at great altitude) similarly colored to the original three objects. They were moving in the same northerly direction and the fifth objects position shifted relative to the fourth. These two high altitude objects did not twinkle like stars. It was a clear night in Philadelphia with some very thin clouds. My home is west of the intersection of Roosevelt Blvd. (US Rte 1) and Rhawn St. I am about one mile south of Northeast Phila. airport and in line with runway 6. similarly colored to the original three, moving in the same direction<n>

I retreived binoculars to observe what I believed to be helium balloon clusters that had been released.  While verifying that they were indeed balloons I noticed a fast moving light pass behind the balloons. I tracked the light with binoculars until I lost sight of it behind some tall trees. The light was 1/8 inch in diameter at arms length as seen through 8 X 23 power binoculars and appeared fuzzy, rather than a single spot of light.  Light tranversed 1/3 of the horizon in approximately 5 seconds in a north to south direction.  Seemed too fast for an artificial satellite.<n>

It was star shaped and rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out my bedroom window (facing North) because I heard many sirens in the neighborhood.  At that time I observed an object in the sky which at first looked like it might be a plane.  However this object was rotating while at the same time moving slowly up and to the south east.  I saw lights flashing on and off intermittently.  I also photographed it (although by the time I got my camera loaded it was pretty far away).  I thought it might be a balloon because of the way it was rising but the way it was rotating vertically and the lights on it were not consistent with a balloon.  It was black on the underside and possibly yellow on the top.  It really looked like a plane the way it looks when it is free falling from the sky but it was going up and the vertical rotation (rolling motion) was slow.  I want to know what this strange object was and if it was reported by any other people in the SB area.  I will email you the photos when I get them developed if you are interested. Thank you.<n>

Hovered, slight climb, hover, slight climb. Lights flash about every three minutes. Color grey to black, black to grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)), age 47.  First sighting.  Retired.  My wife noticed object out of bedroom window looking north over mountains.  She told me to come quick and see it.  We both observed it for approximately 15 minutes.  I saw it as a disk, color light grey, than dark grey, then black. It kept changing color.  Altitude was approx. 1500- to 2500 feet. Kept hovering.  Saw flash of light from it on two occasions. Very sudden bright flash like a flash bulb going off. We were able to go outside and view it as it gained altitude.  My wife got a picture of it. It&#39;s distance from us was hard to determine.  Could have been one to three miles away.  I reported it to our local police department and they in turn gave me your hotline number; where I obtained this website address.  We have tried to understand what if anything could it be.  We are convinced that is truly was a UFO sighting.  You can contact me at 805-((number deleted)).  Sincerely. ((name deleted))<n>

The objects moved quickly.  My best guess is that they took 15 seconds to move across the sky. During this time, they moved in a straight line, leaving no trails, and stayed in perfect formation.  The objects were colored, as best I can recall, light yellow.  They moved silently.  After they had disappeared, I checked the time on my computer (it&#39;s synced up with GMT) and it was 2:51 am pacific daylight time.  We discussed the incident afterwards and both agreed that we had never seen anything like it.<n>

The light pulsed between red and white in a cycle of about twice every second (two red and two white every second). The light also appeared to be centralized, as in it was deffinately not on a wing-tip, or fin. This was also the only light on the object. There was also at leaste one other vehicle in the vicinity, and possibly two. The primary object maintained a rather steady corse, changing direction about once every minute. The secondary vehicle(s) appeared to be following or chasing the primary object, but not maintaining as steady of a corse. The other vehicles had no lights on them except for what appeared to be an engine flame (white). I belive that the aircraft in pursuite were military because one of the engines appeared to fire an afterburner twice during the time that we could maintain visual contact with the objects. All objects appeared to be Northbound and about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up, although this is just a guess.<n>

It looked stationary although it was slowly ans steadily moving. At first it appeared so low I thought it might be a blimp. But there were no flashing lights, just one bright light like a giant star. I checked out the other lights in the sky and plane lights were way too weak and swo were the few stars I could see. I got a telescope out (the usual home telescope) and managed to get a look at it close up - as did 8 friends of mine. We all agreed we could not idetnify the light. Through the telescope the light looked like a perfect white circle kind of fuzzy and slight red hues on the top and blue hues on the bottom. The edges appeared to change slightly so sometimes it looked liked an egg. At first it disappeared and reappeard a couple times but once it was higher up in the sky it became brighter and it&#39;s been there all night traveling West.<n>

One other person who is employed at our company was able to see this object as it headed north.  He said he was amazed at how bright it was even during the day.  There were no noticeable clouds in the area.  We both did not hear any noice of any kind coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> see above<n>

This suddenly totally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred at about 6:25 AM, when it was just starting to get light. I had just gotten off at work at 6:00 AM near downtown Seattle where I work the graveyard shift and was driving home to my apartment in West Seattle. I had decided to drive the scenic route around Alki Beach and drive instead of the normal direct route since there was no traffic and that it was such a nice early morning. On the way I briefly stopped in several places to look at the sights. The eastern sky was pretty with the early morning skies and Venus shining brightly to the East. Later stopped near the Alki Beach proper and looked out and saw a brightly shining planet / star which I thought it was at first, shining out over the sound. It was from Alki Beach proper generally in a Northwest direction over the Puget Sound Waters. You could see the Olympic Mountains to the left of the object. The object was low in the sky NOT high up like directly overhead. The object appeared like a very bright planet or star or maybe a plane that was a long distance away. It remained stationary for maybe about 1 to 2 minutes while I observed it. Then I looked away only momentarily to observe two people walking with their pets nearby. Then I looked back to where this object had been and it had totally and completely disappeared without any trace of having been there. I then spent the next 5 minutes or so looking all over the sky anywhere out over the sound to see if I could see anything that had been this light and there was nothing to be seen. I concluded this could NOT have been a plane since if it was and it had turned there were usually several lights on a plane and if it had turned, you would have been able to see several of the other lights. Also at this time it was early morning and just getting light but there were still stars out and visible which was alot more faint by far then this object had been.<n>

There were seven lights in total, and they were flying in a perfect formation, it was a formation similar to a &#39;V&#39; which ducks fly in, one side of the V had 4 lights, and the other had 3.  The object or objects seemed to be quite high, the lights were about the same intensity as the average star.  I pointed out the lights, and we watched as they flew across the sky at a very fast speed.  I am not good at estimating speeds, but I can tell you that it was at least 3 times faster than an airplane; it was very fast.  Also, the craft curved through the air, it did not go straight.  It curved in abuot the middle of the sky, and proceeded to go a different direction, about 45 degrees away.   The formation made no sound which I could hear.  Please inform me if there have been similar reports. -<n>

I was frightened. I didnt know where I would wind up if I continued on at such a fast speed. I awoke and was still scared and recalled that awful feeling of being out of control and whisked upwards at an enourmous rate. I thought it was a strange dream, couldnt make sense of it. Fell back to sleep and forgot the dream in the morning. When I went to wash some dishes and put on my rubber gloves I noticed a mark on my inner left wrist. It was a kind of a circle that looked like it was burned onto my skin. Like I was branded. It was small - 1&#39;2&#34; . The skin at the mark didnt hurt at all. I thought I might have slept on something that made an imprint on my skin. I have a button on my nightsown sleeve so I looked at it but it was completely round and larger than the mark I had which was a perfect oval shape. I pressed the button into my skin just to see what kind of a mark that made but it wasnt anything  like the red-outlined oval on my wrist. I couldnt think of any way that I could have burned myself like that. Then I recalled the dream. I still have the mark today and will take a picture of it. It&#39;s hard to tell if it has faded any.<n>

My route was going east on Hwy 25/70. I glanced down at my clock and it said exactly 10:30pm (est) when an older model four door car passed me on the left.  Right after he passed me, my attention was drawn to a bright planet in the upper right hand side of my vision.  I also noticed a larger orangish light about three inches to the lower left of the planet.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was moving at first, but as I slowed down to get a better look, it sped up. It was moving to the left at the same speed as an airplane would.  I pulled over to make sure it was blinking like an airplane, but it wasn&#39;t. Before pulling over, I passed three separate parked cars, that had pulled over,  each about 1/10 of a mile apart.  Out of each of the cars there were some witnesses looking and pointing towards the object. I pulled over into a gravel lot and rolled down my window.  As I began watching it again, two lights broke away, in opposite directions.  One was red, the other was blue. The object was about the size of a dime, then shot off in opposite directions. I then continued my journey towards Dandridge.  I wasn&#39;t the only one that saw it.<n>

There were no lights on the object, and it made no sound. It was apparently traveling east to west and was in the process of making a u-turn to go west to east.

I watched it for a bit and it shot straight up, almost out of sight. I could still see the orange pulsating light, so I continued to watch it. It came back down and hovered. Then 4 lights came on and then a whole ring of lights revealing the shape of the object. Then, continuing to pulsate, like a nuclear reacter, the whole thing lit up bright orange. The dome top seemed translucent. The object we saw, was approx. 1/2 mile away and was incredibly huge. It hovered for a bit an slowly went below the treeline. I called the sheriffs dept., who in turn called Ft. Polk to see if any military exercises were going on. Ft. Polk had no comment. Shortly after I witnessed two planes flying a grid pattern. Numerous flashes of light were seen on the ground for airial photography. Also two helecopters on silent mode were searching the area for something. I waited till 1 am to see if it ever came back up. It didnt. It would easily have contained my house inside it. A camera was the farthest thing from both of our minds but believe me we have one ready to go now should the object return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have been friday night but I drink nothing stronger than Pepsi, nor does my wife drink.

The spherical object was traveling from southwest to northeast. The object appeared to be decending in an curved trajectory. I observed the bright mirror-like sphere pass in front of a cloud formation, then pass behind another cloud, and then back into view before it disappeared behind the mountain range peaks 5 to 6 miles to the east of my position. The sphere was perfectly round in shape and cast a pale greenish reflection at it&#39;s edges. As the sphere passed it appeared to have a faint vapor trail feathering off it&#39;s trailing edge/side which was a little bit more greenish in color. The sphere&#39;s primary color was an overall mirror-like silver. The speed of the sphere (as it passed) was faster than a falling object as it appeared to be propelled. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the object for approximately 7 to 8 seconds. The weather conditions were bright sun with some scattered clouds to the east of my location. At the distance I viewed the sphere it was as large as a 5 cent coin (if I held a nickel at arm&#39;s length it would have covered the sphere. This is my only unexplained sighting.<n>

As a airliner aproached it moved to the east.The object was videotaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport. Per our phone conversation this morning I am submitting this report of my encounter with a UFO. This report was submitted to the FAA on September 22, 1999. They have already forwarded the video tape of this encounter to you. The following is an account of what happened: I awake each morning at 5:30 am. After a shower I take my dogs for a one mile walk. The area in and around White Rock, South Carolina is rural. On our walk back twords the house my attention was drawn to a rather brilliant light just above the trees in the northern sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft landing light because aircraft on approach to Columbia Metropolitan Airport generally come from that direction. But as I approached the light it was perfectly still in the sky at approximately 2,000 feet altitude. The closer I got to the light it became obscured behind the tall trees, but is was so brilliant that streams of light came down through the trees. Then I heard the distant sound of jet engines and saw an aircraft approaching from that same direction at an altitude of about 7000 feet. As the plane approached this object moved around to the eastern sky and rose in altitude to approximately 4,000 feet. If the pilot in that approaching plane would have seen this object it would have appeared to the pilot to be below and to the east. If the pilot had observed this it might have looked like a bright street light. The object made no sound. I went into my house and got my video camera. (Hitachi model VM-3700A, with a 24 to 1 zoom) As I came out of my house and observed the object, it was in the eastern sky and again just above the trees. In the video the silhouette of the trees is visible twords the end of the video. The silhouette of the trees gives scale and distance to the object. Could you please evaluate this video and keep me informed as to your findings? Thank You.<n> <n><n> ((Personal and contact data deleted.))<n>

I WAS PATROLLING IN A SMALL TOWN IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA, IN THE BLUE RIDGE MTNS. I AM A POLICE OFFICER. I HAD PULLED UP ON TO A LOCAL LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD AND STEPPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO STRETCH MY LEGS. IT WAS 0535 IN THE MORNING. I WAS FACING ROUGHLY NORTH BECAUSE I HAD JUST FOUND POLARIS. I BECAME AWARE OF A BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE SKY BEHIND ME. IT MADE MY SHADOW APPEAR ON THE FIELD AND I NOTICED THAT MY SHADOW WAS MOVING. MY FIRST THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A STREET LIGHT THAT HAD BLINKED ON BEHIND ME...BUT THERE ARE NO LIGHTS ON THIS FIELD. I ALSO KNEW THAT NO LIGHT SOURCE FROM A STREET LIGHT WOULD MOVE WHICH IN TURN WOULD CAUSE MY SHADOW TO MOVE.I TURNED AROUND AND SAW A BRILLIANT FLASH IN THE SKY. IT WAS OF A BLUE-GREEN COLOR AND WAS IN THE SOUTHERN SKY AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELLING FROM EAST TO WEST. THE OBJECT LEFT A VISIBLE TRAIL THAT STRETCHED OUT BEHIND IT. THE OBJECT THEN BROKE APART INTO FOUR OR FIVE LARGE PIECES AND WENT OUT....OR RATHER BURNED UP. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT WAS MORE RE-ENTERING SPACE JUNK...OR SOME TYPE OF METEOR...BUT IT WAS BY FAR THE BRIGHTEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT TRULY DID TURN NIGHT INTO DAY FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. IT WAS A BRILLIANT FLASH.<n>

We have a video tape with a duration of more than one hour.  It was shot with a Sony 8mm CCD-Trv 46 with Night Shot on. This was shot hand held and although there is a lot of footage, much is out of focus or in process of zooming. The video is one uninterrupted take with the cameraman trying to follow the movement and the camera trying to auto focus. At times the objct appears to be a sphere that is transmitting various colors of light and is more organic in nature than metallic.  Other times it appears to have a triangular shape, but it is difficult to say because it is transmitting so much light. At times the light eminating from the object was so bright that it illiminated the mountain top. At a point in time approximately 45 minutes into the take the viewers saw a dark smaller object rise from the mountain top and enter the bottom of the glowing sphere.  Upon entering the sphere seemed brightened intensely.<n>

She also stated that this object shot off very fast.  The object was seen in the Western Part off the sky.  The witness stated that the object was very low and had no sound to it.

Thank you, Chad!))<n> <n><n> <n><n> post script to Leader Telegram article reporting strange object in sky witnessed by 3 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The paper did not report the whole story regarding the objects seen on 09/16/99 in Menomonie, WI.  When the sheriff&#39;s officer responded to the call, he stayed and watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes.  During this time he stated that he had never seen anything like this before.  He was so intrigued that he left to try and find the location of this object. The witness reported the first object to be 1/4 of the way up the horizon. The object was reported in the SE sky. The weather conditions of the evening were clear with no fog in the area.  The witness also reported that he has seen planets many times before and stated that this was unlike anything he had seen either.  The gentleman watched the object for nearly 40 minutes, until it seemed to just vanish. During this time it would change color form red to yellow to green at a very quick rate.  He also reported that the object would shoot up into the air and fall back down at rapid speeds.  The object also hovered over his farm area for several minutes at a time.  When this witness called the sheriff again to report the second triangle object, also seen in the SE sky. The sheriff&#39;s office said they look into it and never contacted the witness again.  The witness watched the second object &#34;hover&#34; over his farm are for nearly 10 minutes. This second object was yellow and triangle shaped. This object also just seemed to vanish. Neither object made any sound that could be heard by any of the witnesses. There was also no smell associated with the objects.  The witness was very suprised to read that the officer who only hours before stated this was the strangest thing he had ever seen, had now turned aroung and claimed it must have been a planet.  The sheriff&#39;s office have not returned any of my calls on this subject.<n>

The object was round, and was going in circles changing colors from red to blue. About 1/2 hour later a second object appeared and was triangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the couple was getting ready for work they spotted an object in the morning sky. It was going in circles, back and forth. It was also changing colors from red to blue to yellow. About a half-hour later, the man reported seeing a second object right over the city of Menomonie. It would glow bright yellow and then die down and get dim. During the dim period the man could see the outline of a triangle. The Pepin County Police Department reported that they thought the lights were the reflections from the plants being low in the sky. After getting input from Pepin County, the Dunn County Police Department agreed with this assessment. The couple who reported this incident claims that in no way could this sighting have been plants. As reported in the Thursday Edition of the Leader Telegram--page 1A 09-16-99. This event happened near Elmwood Wisconsin.<n>

I was sleeping with both my children who had come into my bed. My husband had fallen asleep in our basement rec room. There are two windows on either side of my bed at the head. There is another window on the oppisite wall. The light entered only through one window, one that flanks the headboard. This would be Northeasterly. I was sleeping and awoke by a flood of light on one side of the bedroom that shone onto my daughter, the bedside table and the whole side of the room. I felt that it shone directly in my face, which was what awoke me. I remember wondering if a helicopter was searching for someone, but I couldn&#39;t hear anything that sounded like a helicopter. I may have heard a buzzing sound but I am not even certain of this as I was half asleep and confused by the intensity of the light. I looked at the clock and remember thinking that it was still early and I couldn&#39;t have been sleeping all that long. I believe it was a little before midnight. I kept thinking that this must be a huge spotlight and couldn&#39;t figure where it came from. I still thought that it was police or something. What didn&#39;t make sense then or now, was that the light was shining down into my second story room, not up. It definitely was from above and I continued to listen for helicopter sounds. Then suddenly it was gone. I went back to sleep and figured my neighbors would tell me if something had happened. I mentioned it to a few people including my husband and kids but no one heard or saw anything. I know I wasn&#39;t dreaming but don&#39;t know anything else for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

Lights did not look like aircraft through binoculars. Had horizontal line of white lights, distinguishable through binoculars, and red lights above and below white row of lights, that seemed to throb brighter and dimmer, not blinking totally on and off. Watched the light in relation to other aircraft moving by. And, by the way, there seemed to be much more air traffic in that direction than usual. The night sky was very clear.  No clouds seen.  The object was barely distinguishable with out the assistance of binoculars for me, but my wife who is farsighted, could see without binoculars. I would say that it could have been a large plane going away from us, except that the event took about 6 to 7 minutes. The object moved from about 30 degrees up from the horizon down to the tree level and out of sight, which would be about 10 degrees above the horizon. The object, if moving away from us, would have been going east to west. However, over the 6 to 7 minutes, the object didn&#39;t move far, and it didn&#39;t appear to grow smaller as it would have had it been moving away. Also, I did not notice in colored lights on what would be the wing tips if looking at an aircraft from behind. One more thing about the object. we had been looking straight up and out toward the west for 5 to 10 minutes prior to it&#39;s &#34;arrival&#34;. It was suddenly &#34;there&#34;, and we had not seen it what so ever before our first visual sighting of it. Both my wife and I had been &#34;scanning&#34; the sky as we do almost nightly over the last two months. The other air traffic over our area, while looking west from the front of our house, was very heavy in the western sky.  One aircraft went over us from West to East, fairly low.  It also didn&#39;t appear to resemble what we typically see when regular airline passenger jets go over. It was also fairly quiet. Could have been military, but I can not verify that. Tonight has not been the first night we have seen &#34;unusual events&#34; in the sky.  In august, (I know it was a Sunday evening, and I believe it was 8/13/99) during the &#34;meteor storm&#34;, we happened to see the very, VERY bright light in the west sky. It lasted long enough that my wife saw it first and said &#34;look at that&#34; - I saw the tail end of it, and it seemed to last for a good second or two. There was NO TAIL. It came, &#34;out of nowhere, without a tail like other falling stars&#34;, according to my wife. I have never seen a falling star like that before. We have also seen a very dimly lit light going quickly across the sky, from NW to SE, directly overhead. About the size of a star. Round, no blinking lights. Looked like a headlight in fog, or a flashlight shining through a sheet of white paper. Small, even with binoculars. Since I didn&#39;t write down the dates and times or report those incidents, I won&#39;t submit seperate reports for those incidents. However, I wanted to include this information, as my wife and I feel like many things are happening that don&#39;t quite fit the norm, and it is the reason why I took the time to write about the event we saw tonight so that it can be recorded... just in case... and so I can remember the date and time (I lose track of time more and more)... You can contact me if you want to. I will let that be your decision. I am not checking the box below that I want to be contacted.<n>

I was in the passenger seat.  We were headed to my house late at night.  The forest was thick along the road but opens at one point to a clearing.  We drove into the clearing and were surprised beyond belief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clearing was illuminated as if it was daytime. In the clearing at about 300 feet was a massive glowing object the size of a cruise ship.  It was football shaped and glowing a fluorescent blue/green that was the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  Although it was illuminating all around we could see it clearly without hurting our eyes.  We were only about 200 yards from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said,&#34;do you see that?!&#34; and my girlfriend replied,&#34;of course I (bleeping) see it!&#34;  She slowed the car as we watched it but it shot off over the mountains like something out of Star Wars.  Then we were both gripped by a paralyzing fear like nothing I&#39;ve ever felt before or since.  When I say fear, I sincerely mean it.  My very soul was struck in fear.  What we saw shook us to our core.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to my house and talked about it for hours trying to console ourselves.  We were afraid it would come back and still felt its presence although we saw it shoot off and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For over ten years now I have thought of it everyday and am now afraid of the dark and of being alone.  I&#39;m a grown man but the memory of that fear has left its mark deeply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I looked up my girlfriend on Facebook and asked her about it.  She was amazed I brought it up but I wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t something I mistook.  We talked about it for awhile but we both felt the fear again and stopped talking to each other altogether.  The fear of that thing we saw is still real.  I wish I could describe it better.  It froze my blood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am finally reporting it because of it being on my mind every single day.  It may be childish but the feeling of that fear is with me every night.  The fear always makes me think more happened and we don&#39;t remember.<n>

They were moving paralel to Fairview Boulevard, toward the coast( I think that is south/west). They flew under the overcast, so I know that they were pretty low. I should have been able to hear some type of engine, jet or propeller noise since they were aparently low and their path was directly overhead, but they were silent.

The light came shooting over real fast, then turned, and flew at a 90&#39; angle, then stopped again, and did a loop, and flew back over the mountain out of sight then it flew back over again really fast then stopped. It then just flew around. It definately was not the planet I thought it was.We have seen it many times since, and my friend has seen it many times before. It seems to be in the same area every night doing something.<n>

Lauderdale, FL in the late 1990&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in the late 1990&#39;s or maybe 2000, my wife Kathy and I were sitting out by our screened pool facing west. We felt a sort of rumbling and heard a low hum. We looked up and saw a very large black object in sky heading east. It flew over us and over the house at a slow rate of speed.  It was a triangle like shape and appeared to be black but it was hard to tell because it was night but with alot of light pollution. As it got directly above us we saw &#34;lights&#34; that were inverted V in shape and a greeish yellow color.  Both of us thought at the time and still do that we saw a stealth bomber flying at night in a heavily populated area at a low altitude and slow speed. We had both seen stealth bombers at air shows and were convinced that this is what the craft was.  We listened to the News to see if there was such a craft in the area but there was no mention.  We looked at the newspaper but no mention.  I asked people at work the next day if they had seen or heard anything but no one had.  I even mentioned the incident to my boss who lives in Phoenix.  We do not remember the date that this happened because we were completely convinced this was a stealth fly over.  We did think it odd that such a craft would be flying at night at such a low altitude and slow speed over a heavily populated area near a busy airport (FLL.) But for us it was not a life changing event because we thought we knew what had happened.  We were reminded of the incident last year when we were at a Jacksonville Jaguars football game during the day and there was a stealth bomber fly over. I became an avid CtoC streamlink listener this year and have heard Art&#39;s similar story and was suprised to see so many similar accounts on your website. My wife and I are both degreed and both work in the financial services industry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Due to my our sighting on 9/14/99, we told 2 of our friends about it.  We decided to hang out and see what might happen the next night, 9/15/99.  Around 20:45 we saw approx. 5 jets circling our area, this occured until 21:05.  About 21:05 while we searched the northern night sky, it was clear, our friend noticed an orange light luminate and another orange light luminate.  The first one disppeared and then the second disppeared.  Of course, we were excited.  Within 15 minutes we saw the same thing but with 4 orange lights.  Within another 15 minutes we saw orange lights luminate and then disappear.  We attempted to take pictures but won&#39;t know if they came out.  None of us have ever seen anything like this before.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ultra-slow totally silent low-flying huge dull black triangular body with evident &#39;cockpit.&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re on a flight path here for either Dayton or Cinci airports, so I often see aircraft of all sizes flying overhead, day and night. However, one evening [late summer or fall??] I saw lights over the trees that were somehow different, and then I realized something very large was blocking the night sky.  I kept listening for the sound of engines or jets, but there was total silence. The craft was huge, so large that it may have been higher than I first thought.  At the time, as it passed over [an angle of about 30 degrees to the left of right over my head] it seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred yards above treetop level. The eeriest part was the dead slow speed and total absense of any sound.  The second thing I realized was that it had &#34;headlights&#34; under where one would expect the cockpit to be [4 or 6?], but none of the FAA required &#39;navigation&#39; lights on wingtips, and no strobe light. The color was generally a dull black, a bit lighter than the night sky so some shape details could be picked out and not just  the silloette.  It was a wide triangular shape, wider than our stealth bombers but not as wide as the old &#34;flying wings&#34; of the mid-40&#39;s.  It was relatively thick, with a &#39;cut away&#39; portion in front where what appeared to be cockpit windows were above the &#39;headlights&#39; previously mentioned. Nothing of note was seen on the bottom, no lights, no indentations, nothing but smooth dull black. Living close to Wright Patterson AFB I might expect to see experimental craft in the area, but not ultra-slow totally silent craft lacking the FAA required lighting.<n>

While I was speaking to my husband, I noticed outside our window which would be north, I noticed an orange light moving across the sky.  The orange light immediatly stopped and than it exploded into a fireball, a perfect circle.  What caught my husbands attention was when the orange light exploded into the fireball, the fireball lite our room and my husband looked outside and also saw the fireball and it disappear.  About 5 minutes after, we heard jets flying accross the sky.  Which is unusual for our area at that time of night.<n>

After the last turn, the contrail appeared golden in color and the object was also moving at a high rate of speed.  After the last turn, there was a &#34;U&#34; shaped contrail visible in the sky.  There was a brief interruption in the contrail on the last leg, it came back for a few seconds then disappeared.  When the object stopped making the contrail, the entire &#34;U&#34; shaped contrail disappeared leaving no trace or trail.  It was dusk but there were no clouds in the sky that may have obscured the trail, it simply disappeared.<n>

I used my field glasses to look at it and it appeared star like. It moved very slowly. But to my amazement it made a U turn and started back toward the direction it came  from. I have no idea what it could have been.  It traveled what to me seemed miles before turning back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another occasions, and this really frightened me, I was going to work at the shipyard where I work. It was about 9:30 at night. I looked to my left and sitting up in the sky was an object with orange light in the outline of a commercial jet. But this was way to large to be a jet and it was not moving.  It just sat there what I believed to be right over the river. I drove on a block before looking back up. The orange lights were replaced by 3 large white lights in the shape of a triangle. Very huge. I set my eyes back on the road and suddenly there was this bright light that seemed to me like someone setting off a flash on a camera. It lit up the trees and the rooftops, and when I looked back the object was gone.   This object to me later as I went over it’s size had to be as big as a football field, or damn near as big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the source of the report to submit two, separate reports, and to establish the exact dates, to the greatest degree possible.

I have worked with the govenerment on &#34;black Projects&#34; and this object floored me.  I have no idea what it was. I have noticed that this 15 mile square area is a &#34; hotbed&#34; for odd objects in sky. Unlike some ufologists, I have worked on &#34;unknown&#34; projects and know 99.9% unknown &#34; ufos&#34; are new military planes but his was nothing like we have or will have for 50 years.

I must have been starring up into the sky do south looking for anything such as meteorites, constellations, I had been scanning the southern sky for about 20 minutes when I suddenly realised that there was a patch of the sky that was starless. At first I didnt recognise anything beyond that until I watched that area a few more seconds when this very large triangular ship materialized right in front of me. Its hard to explain but it was like-cloaked in such a way that at first you could stare right at it you wouldnt see it but when I focused on it I could easily see it. This craft was very close. Estimate size 200ft. I would estimate 60 yards away. Light eminated from it as if it had a low glow to it. No specific lights only the craft itself was lightly ablase. This led me to believe that its stealth quality was do to its ambient light equal to the light from the stars and street lights. Anyway I could make out the ships color which was a light brown or tan similar to the camoflage color used in the Military for desert combat. It was in a position gaining altitude at least a 45 degree angle and yaued left pitch where I had a good view of its top surface but not its bottom. It was perfectly silent as it moved gracefully and slowly at first. Estimate 20 mph. Then the higher it got and further  from my position it picked up incredible speed. It winked out of vision withen a few seconds heading in a due southerly direction. I was able to make out some details in the ships design such as rounded edges and the triangular shape was very slightly ovate in that it had a slight concave curve to its over-all body. It appeared very high tech and what I would expect to see in our own technology withen a few hundred years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I began to walk after it and its glow illuminated myself and the path beneath it. As I increased my pace it would distance itself. There was no sound at all.This objects approximate size was that of a softball. I know this because, it passed underneath a telephone line that was connected from building to building. Approximate height 12-15 feet and I was directly under it. The objects heading was perfectly straight and did not rise or fall in height.I followed it for a good 200 feet until it passed over a small building that was fenced off.I watched the object illuminate the building as I was backing up to keep a visual on it.The object seemed to reach the back of the building stopped and then just winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was looking between two very tall cedar trees at the stars when I observed a glowing, greenish object moving steadily from approximately the Southeastern horizon to the Northwestern horizon.  I may very well have my directions a bit off center but I immediately thought that it was not a comet or meteorite because it was moving perfectly horizontally and not in a downward manner like an object entering the atmosphere.  It was definately not a private or commercial jet landing at Paine field and the object did not appear to be a missile because at an arms length of distance between thumb and forefinger, it measured at about8-10 millimeters in circumference.  I couldn&#39;t tell you how fast it was moving but it would be similar to watching a vehicle at maybe 20-25 miles an hour pass by you.  It was completely silent and a discernable glowing, greenish tail followed it.  I then went inside looking for the hotline number but couldn&#39;t find it so I decided to wait until I came to work tonight.  Then, at approximately 22:33 on the same night, I heard the most awful noise RESONATE from the forrested area behind our building.  It sounded like a cross between a coyote and a cow.  I&#39;m not trying to speculate at any animal mutilations, but I began to freak out at that moment and brought my cats inside.  These howl-like noises continued for about six minutes at an interval of about a sound every thirty seconds, becoming more frequent towards the end.  Nothing else happened after that and the two incidents may or may not be related but on a side note, I work on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and have observed some interesting things floating about in the sky.  I listen to Art Bell on occasions when I can and I know that there are numerous sightings these days, so I hope this is useful information to you. Also, I just remembered that I noted that there were NO jets coming into or out of Paine Field for about three hours after this incident on the 14th.  The air was totally silent which was very unusual.<n>

As we live near an airport, I looked for any lighting or markings.  All I could see was a shadow moving NW to SE and as it cleared the stars, I could make out it&#39;s triangular shape. I also noted that there was a slight bluish gray outline of the leading edge, quite possibly from the city lights. I noted no engine noise, nor could I see any other remarkable traits of the object.  It moved in a straight line towards town.  I then ran to the SSW side of my home to see if I could get a better view of the object from the glow of the city lights.  I could no longer see the object. I am a 40 year-old white male and am currently employed as an electrician.<n>

My daughter and I were watching this and originally thought it was a large bird. When it stopped and hovered in the same spot for several minutes I ran and got my glasses for a better look. What I saw appeared to be a black non reflective object shaped like 4 cubes connected to form a tri-pod rotating on an x/y and z axis. At approximately 19:15 hrs it seperated into two (2) smaller black objects of apparently equal size and or mass. Neither of the smaller objects appeared to have a definitive shape and moved fairly fluidly in what I can only describe as elliptical orbits around eachother and appearing to come into contact with eachother every few orbits. At approximately 19:20 hrs the objects rejoined in the original shape and started to ascend straight up very slowly. The sighting continued until 19:32 hrs when it passed out of my visibilty range. At approximately 19:21 hrs I tried to phone you via information in Seattle, and they repeatedly told me they had no listing for either the National UFO Reporting Center or anything under UFO at all. The operator was intrigued that I was witnessing it at the time and I tried to describe what was going on while she was looking for your number. Subsequently I am submitting this to you in this format. My daughter and I were watching aircraft and I was explaining the contrails from them to her when we sighted this.<n>

It was seemingly stationary. I saw it for about 30 seconds, but briefly had to keep watching the roadway as well.  Remarkably noticeable, solid-appearing, sharply-outlined and apparently reflecting the sun&#39;s rays. The almost flourescent (day-glo) orange, oblong &#34;appendage&#34; underneath on its left side (or north side) was tight to the body of the object--not loose, or hanging.  I noticed no contrail, movement of any kind, nor saw the apparently reflective, metallic shine change or shift.  There was a stagnant air advisory on the ground at the time, so the wind was negligible, if at all.  I lost it in tall trees along 1st Ave. So., and could not see it about one or two  minutes later near 320th (main drag through Federal Way). The object was about 1/4 to 5/8-inch long at arm&#39;s length.  It appeared to be at very high altitude. A very vivid, startling sight and my only UFO sighting since way back in 1967!  I hope someone else saw this...<n>

The shape was a sleightly streached out 55 gallon drum. The size was about as big as a house. It had four &#34;legs&#34; attached to the mid section. They were wider at the top and tapered down and appeared to be solid. The west end was a bit higher in attitude. It was not safe to pull over so I slowed to observe. I turned onto first avenue, but trees obscured view. I doubled back but could not find it again.<n>

This is when I first noticed it. A tear drop shaped &#34;fireball&#34; with continued in a straight line from the vapour trail and then made a curved drop below the mountains to the east. It was between Mt. Baker to the right and the rising sun to the left. To the farther left of the sun was another vapour trail and two smaller ones below it. These seemed farther eastward than the &#34;fireball&#34;. Can send a roughly drawn description if you are even slightly interested. Thought it might be MORE of those Russian rocket boosters.<n>

As we were passing the school heading down Crumpton South, I noticed what appeared to be a planet sized orange/red object in the sky.  It was at about 40 degrees above the horizon (facing south/southwest). At first I thought it was mars or mercury, but it seemed to big to be a planet (appeared a little bigger than I have seen Venus). I kept walking while watching the object.  It appeared to become slightly bigger, so I stopped before I reached a group of trees that would block my view so I could see if it was moving like an airplane with its lights on.  It wasn&#39;t, so I started walking again and thinking about what it could be.  When I got past the trees to where I could see it again, it had changed from an orange/red glow to a single white light(much smaller), like you would see on a plane.  It blinked once, maybe twice, then moved in a quickly accelerating motion at approx 20 degrees up and to my left, out into the atmosphere. At it&#39;s fastest rate, it looked just a little slower than a shooting star.  I was looking south/slightly southwest the entire time.  It was still very dark, enough so to still be able to see all the stars in the sky. I was going to call the local airports to see if they noticed anything unusual on their radars at that time, but didn&#39;t think I could get through to the controllers, or whether they would give me the information if I could get through.  If you can get that type of information, I would appreciate you letting me know what they picked up on their equipment.  Thanks.<n>

They were above the clouds but very low. There were other objects in the sky during the night which could be easily identified as airplanes by their blinking lights and their landing lights are only visable when they approach my vision and not when moving away from my vision. These lights were brighter than landing lights and moving away from me about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no sounds like when aircraft fly over and lower than when I see satilites. The objects left no trail and disappered when they went behind cloud cover and reappeared on the other side. My computer was on inside the house but did not seem to be affected by the object. I am not sure what I saw but it was not an airplane, sattilite, hilicopter or anything else I can think of. I decided to send this information in case there may be other sightings.<n>

I was outside of my house smoking a cigarette and was looking north into the sky (towards Canada).  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a orange sort of light that was pulsing at a slow rate. The pulsing never went completely out just faded in and out.  I watched this object as it traveled east to west. All of the sudden it came to almost a complete stop and went in the opposite direction (east), then almost stopped again and came back to the west. Then the object started moving in the direction of north towards Canada.  I watched this for about 1 minute and 30 seconds before it dissappeared over the tops of the houses.  It was not moving at a fast rate of speed, slower than an airplane would, I should know, many airplanes fly over our house all day long, and there was no red or white flashing lights, like the airplanes use at night, just the orange colored pulsing light.  It was a bit larger than a star, and made no noise that I could here.  This really caught my attention because of the half zig-zag it did in the sky.<n>

About every minute there would be a flash at around 7:00 to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked into the sky as I was exiting my building and noticed an object in the sky. It looked to be a star but it was at 11:30 in the morning. The sun was shining bright and there were not clouds in the area. I then went and asked another person to come and take a look to seee if they saw it. They did see it and then went and got another person to take a look. He saw it as well. The object was about 45-50 degrees in the eastern sky and did not move. We looked to see if we could see other stars but could not. After watching it for about 15 minutes I noticeed that at about one half inch and at 7:00 to the object there would be a flash about every minute or so. I asked one of the others if he saw a flash around the object with out telling him where and after a few minutes he that he did and in the same position as I did. I wanted to make sure that it was not my eyes playing tricks. The object looked to be very high in the sky like it could be a star. We watched some jets fly through the sky and they did not seem to be even close to it. The jets looked very small to our eyes and ones that looked larger and closer left condensation trails behind them. We all left and went bak to work and would periodically look to se if it was still there. In a two hour period the object seemed to get more dull. We think it was due to the sun moving toward the west. In that time the object moved a total of 2-3 inches the the north, maybe due to the rotation of the earth. I last saw it at around 2:00 when I had to leave the building and go to another location. When I got there I looked to see if I could see it but there were clouds in the sky blocking the view.<n>

It was just to the south of Mt Rainer and decended over the south slop as I watched. The second object At 11:30 am was similar to the first but smaller. It was in the same location but it&#39;s decent was much more rapid, this one lasting about 3 mins. The third oject, again in the same location,at 12:10 pm was smaller yet with a decent that lasted less than a minute. the third I saw begin to appear in the sky at aprox.11,000 feet near the summit of Mt Rainier, first just a bright glowing ball then forming a tail as it started it&#39;s decent... thats the best I can do to describe this strange event.<n>

This is not the first time either. 4 previous nights they have been awaking folks in the middle of the night, but the Control Tower at Truax Feild deny&#39;s any activity. Well today the proof is not in theyre hands, one of their F-16&#39;s did infact go down south of Mt. Horeb for no apparent reason. The Guard unit blames it on mechanical failure, but witnesses describe a shoot out between the jets and the objects when one of the lights turned a different color and emmited a ray type of glow and took out the F-16 # WNG46-5607 piloted by Col.

The weather was clear with some clouds moving in from the west. I stopped on the side of the road and looked at the sky.  I could see some lens shaped clouds. I wasn&#39;t able to see too many stars due to the clouds.  Yet, I was able to see the brightness of that fireball just a few minuets ago. I called The UFO center about 01:11.<n>

It got brighter for a moment than started to move away at a high rate of speed .  It moved in a direction so that it got smaller, and smaller and than just disappeared or vanished. There was no blinking or colors at all.  It appeared to just be a very bright star.  This was no star, or plane.<n>

Thought I saw a black spot in my eye but after looking again, I ran inside and got my binoculars. I immediately saw clearly  2 objects, at the same height and seperated about 1 inch in my view. They were hovering stationary with a VERY slow movement to the west. From where I live, they were approx at a degree heading of 250deg( just slight north of my Dish which is at 240deg. I observed them, and had my 21 year old son also confirm the sighting with the binoculars. The objects were just barely visable without the 8x50 binos. We were both very convinced what we saw was not something natural.My best guess is that they were somewhere over the Watchung or Scotch Plains NJ towns. We were truly amazed as they 2 objects displayed some kind of unstable motion while hovering. They were clearly not balloons or airplanes. They disappeared into a cloud 15 minutes later. The really weird part is that what appeared to be a military style small jet, with 2 engines on the body between wings and tail appeared and circled the area 2 times and then in the reverse direction. My wife also witnessed the jet and it appeared that they either were observing or trying to locate the 2 objects that we saw.<n>

It lasted about 5 minutes. I wanted to shout to my mum and dad but i found that I could not move. All this time the craft did not move either. Eventually, it started to get brighter and brighter. There was a flash and everything went white. After the flash, I found that the light had vanished and i was able to move again. I was white in the face when I went through to the toilet and looked in the mirror. Then, I realised that my heart wasn&#39;t beating as fast. I got a drink of water and went back to my room. I closed the curtains and went back to sleep.Since that night, I have had a great intrest in U.F.O&#39;s. I try to find out as much about them as I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that this sounds like a hoax, but it isnt! Please don&#39;t discard this because I swear that it is true.<n>

I opened them again and I noticed a little light which seemed to be getting bigger. I rubbed my eyes to check that I wasn&#39;t dreaming. There it was. It seemed to be hovering over the farm which was a 5 minute walk from my house. I went to rub my eyes again but found that I couldn&#39;t move. By this time the light seemed to change colour; from yellow to white. I noticed a kind of beam coming out of the ground. The light was quite big by now. It seemed to be observing my house. It didn&#39;t move and it stopped glowing. I felt a sudden chill in my room. My eyes moved over at the houses to try and see if anyone else had noticed, then flickered back to the light which seemed to be growing again, getting closer. It emitted a flash. My eyes were blinded in a haze of white. I fell back and my vision returned. The object was gone. I felt cold and tired. I turned and went back to bed. I felt a pain in my wrist where I had fell back.<n>

My wife and I went to a state park near Jordon Mn. just south of Minneapolis. I noticed what  at first I thought was a satalite moving across the sky. However, the object was not traveling in a straight line, and the intensity was growing brighter. Next the object stopped, this really got my attention. This did not behave like any conventional aircraft. I instructed my wife to not lose sight of the object as I ran to the car to get my binoculars. I returned and quickly regained view of object which had the appearence of a bright star. You would have to be looking for this as it was not easily noticeable. To my amazement the object began to move again, this time in a different direction. The object stopped again. Very shortly later it began to move again. Only this time it appeared to be moving out to space as it began to get dimmer and dimmer. I watched it dissapear with my binoculars. It did not dissapear over the horizen, it dissapeared out in to space until it was no longer visable. I was very impressed, much more then my wife.<n>

It was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the Southeast.  It was very luminous and when inspected w/ binoculars, it proved to have vertical lines that seemed to shimmer like sheer curtains when blowing in the breeze, or like the way you see fumes coming off of asphalt on a very hot day.  My boyfriend who was there and saw it too, has seen Aroura Borealis in Northern Canada several times and that was the only thing that he could liken it to.  The patch itself didn&#39;t move in the horizon, it remained stationary for at least an hour- an hour and 1/2.  At times there were NO clouds near and we could see stars all around it and immediately next to it so it wasn&#39;t any upper atmospheric moisture that was illuminated by a ground light source, as I said, we were in the middle of the national forest.  It didn&#39;t seem to have any particular color, other than illumination. At first we thought, at a glance, that it might be some anomoly of clouds illuminated by a new moon, but the moon NEVER appeared in the horizon, and there were NO clouds in that vicinity.  In unusal circumstances there have been times that the Aroura Borealis has been sighted in this hemisphere, that is what drew us to the conclusion that we seeing it also.  Perhps it was a NASA experiment, or, MAYBE, just maybe, life from another planet???<n>

The fireball was visable for 3 seconds , was a light luminous green in color and traveled in a slight arc towards the ground.  It disappeared behind a mountain with no noticable impact indicators.  This was consistant with the other three green fireballs I saw last fall while driving in this area. This is a suburb about 30 miles north of Los Angeles in the mountains so sky conditions are good enough to see the Milky Way. Approximate size was a sixteenth inch in diameter at arms length. I have a very technical background in electronics, optics, photography and astronomy. I am quite familiar with the air traffic routes and seeing objects in the night sky.  This was definitly not a plane, a jet, a weather ballon :-), a crash test dummy :-), a typical meteor, an orbiting satellite although it might have been a part of one.<n>

One person asked if they were seeing a satellite.  I said it looked just like a satellite, one point of light, travelling in a smooth arc across the sky, from the east to the west.  We saw it directly overhead looking to the north, so it was moving to the left.  All of a sudden, the object became very bright, and seemed to increase in size, to about the size and white color of Venus (or whichever planet is now visible to the east)and it continued to travel smoothly to the west.  The object dimmed and the size seemed to shrink to &#34;satellite&#34; size, then became very bright again.  Then the object appeared to change course slightly, then faded in brightness and size, very dimmly until it disappeared, roughly at the same zenith.  It seemed odd in that I had never seem a satellite change brightness, or fade from sight.  I can usually track satellites until it is obstructed by trees, or mountains, etc.  I don&#39;t think the apparent change in course was caused by the object passing near other stars as the eye looses track for a moment.  This time, the object seemed to change direction when it was not passing other stars.  Just after it faded, I looked back to the east and noticed another satellite, at about the same zenith, but it was travelling west to east.  I had not seen this satellite as I was looking at the one going to the west.  I would have thought I would have seen the two &#34;cross paths&#34;.  This satellite seemed normal, size, speed, color, brightness, direction etc. as other satellites I have seen before.  The night sky was very clear, no clouds, no wind, about 50 degrees.  We could clearly see the &#34;Milky Way&#34;.  We were just far enough from Portland that you could only make out a glow on the horizon to the north.   It was travelling at &#34;satellite speed&#34; and there were no streaks, sparks, or trails like I have seen with &#34;shooting stars&#34;, plus it was travelling much slower. I am a male, 34 years old, that works for a State Agency in an Engineering field.  I have a B.S. deg! ree. I w as with two women, both who have Masters degrees.  The forth person was a male child, age 6.  He was the one who first saw the object, and he became very frightened.  He was afraid it was going to land!  We had to try and convince him that it was a satellite, but we all wondered about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the facts contained in the report are correct, the object probably was not a satellite.  Technical reasons seem to militate against its being a manmade object in orbit.))<n>
9/11/99 22:00|Grand Rapids|MI|Flash|10 seconds|90-degree turn by a meteor|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09716.html|182|ndxe199909| 90-degree turn by a meteor<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday night, September 11, about 10:00 PM. Duncan Lake, about 15 miles south of Grand Rapids, MI. I was attending a party that we put on annually for the OR personnel of Butterworth Hospital/Spectrum Health Downtown. I had not partaken of any of the alcoholic beverages available that evening since I had been involved in the setup and firing of a rather extensive fireworks show for the party. Duncan Lake is on the southern approach flight path to the Kent County International Airport. Several of us were standing around in an open field discussing the fireworks. A northbound jet flew over on its way to the airport and I glanced up to look at it. As the jet passed, I noticed a typical meteor streak that flew from the north to the south. As it faded, I saw an additional streak that originated from the exact point where the first streak ended and flew perpendicular (from my perspective) to the path of the first streak, heading generall y west. The impression that I got was that the original object changed direction, executing a 90-degree turn without slowing down. This occurred within seconds of the jet passing by, but my feeling was that the jet had nothing to do with the incident other than drawing my attention to the sky. We had seen many meteors that evening, but this one was remarkable enough to cause me to ask my companions if they had noticed it. Unfortunately they had not. Logic tells me that this was probably a coincidental sighting of two separate meteors travelling on perpendicular paths. But I thought you might want to add it to your database<n>

I was lying on my back, enjoying the view of the stars, and noticed an object passing directly overhead on a steady west to east trajectory. It was the most unusual thing I had ever seen, and I quickly pointed it out to my friend.  It appeared to be flying fairly low (maybe under 8,000 feet), possibly triangular in shape with be 3 to 5 light underneath/inside it.  This description is not meant to be vague; it&#39;s just that the object appeared to have an unusual but regular &#39;movement&#39;, that actually seemed to change it&#39;s shape, but in a consistent pattern.  The constant shape changing affected how many lights we could see on the underside or inside of the object.  Despite it&#39;s constant fluctuating movement, it&#39;s course seemed to be straight and steady.  It was moving faster than a balloon, dirigible or helicopter, but was not particularly fast.  It disappeared from sight sooner than it should have (probably 40 degrees above the eastern horizon).  We think it was only one object, and we heard no sound from it (but there was relatively loud music from the stage).  I got the sense that it may have only been &#39;obviously&#39; visible to someone directly under it; primarily because it&#39;s lights were similar in size and color to the stars beyond.  Because we were directly under it, we were able to see the motions (shape fluctuations) when portions of it moved underneath (or changed shape) and obscured/revealed it&#39;s lights.  Because of this, we don&#39;t really think that it&#39;s disappearance was the result of it changing speed or direction; we think that once it was a certain distance from us, we would not be able to notice the movement/shape changing on it&#39;s underside; thus it&#39;s lights were difficult to discern against the backdrop of the stars in the night sky.  We agreed that it was NOT a plane, weather or other balloon, helicopter or animal.  I am a 42 year old business owner (rea! l estate ), with postgraduate work in Ethics; my friend, 43, is a brilliant Ph.D. research scientist (and paranormal skeptic), with a major position at a large and renowned corporation.<n>

I said aloud,&#34;What the...&#34; and the light retracted into what looked like a bright star that did not twinkle. We all looked at this &#34;Bright Star&#34; for a couple of seconds and then it started to move fast. First, it moved in a horizontal direction, then it dropped down as if it were falling. Then, it moved diagonally upward, and then horizontally heading south, south-east and disappeared. It all happened so fast, but we didn&#39;t take our eyes off it. I have never seen anything unusual in the sky in my life. I have to say,THIS, was unusual. It moved too fast to be anything man-made(KNOWN),and it literally,made the hair on my neck stand up.<n>

It moved very slowly, and we walked out into the street to trace its progress.  We were able to view it for approximately 15 minutes as it headed south-southeast, and though we had no binoculars or telescope, we saw it clearly enough to be convinced that it was not a blimp (all white, no advertising, and it seemed to be illuminated by itself), nor a weather balloon, nor any conventional aircraft.  It was also NOT Venus, or any atmospheric disturbance!  We are both rational, logical men (and had not been drinking), but neither of us could come up with an explanation for what we saw.<n>

(Brilliant white in color)  As it was coming down it kept getting bigger, brighter and faster.  About 10 seconds into the sighting, a tail came out the back of it.  Blueish in color and very long. The tail was about two fists long.  (Holding my fist up to the horizon as a measurement)  It came to a complete stop just above the tips of the trees in the horizon.  It hovered there for approx. 5 seconds, then shot almost straight up very fast and was gone.  There is no way this was a shooting star, meteorite, or re-entering space junk.

We have tall trees all around us on the horizon. It angled downward and acroos the sky ,and as I jumped up and ran to the door and opened it, the light dropped behind the hillside. There was no tail, no noise, except the neighbor dog barking. No one else saw the light as they were not facing the windows. We all looked and listened for a few moments.

I had just landed about 10 minutes before the sighting.  The air was relatively calm with a building of some very large dark clouds to the Northwest. I had just rolled my plane into the hanger when we heard other pilots talking about what they were seeing.  I immediatly went out and observed a craft that appeared to be dark or black in color.  It was first thought to be an ultra-light but appeared to be too large.  Darkness was rapidly closing in and no pilot without any lighting would continue to fly.  We kept listening for engine noise, but there was not so much as a whisper.  We watched it approach bearing about 080 degrees, at less than 3/4 of a mile it turned to about 360 degrees.  Our concensis was that it was about 1500 AGL, and moving at about 35-40 Kts.  As it banked North it was under the clouds but mostly obscured by a dark background.  Eventually it came back into clear sky, but had gained altitude, at least another 1000 feet or more. At this point with the darkness and distance we lost sight of it. I got a chance to see it with binoculars, it appeared to be chevron shaped.  In discussing the incident with the other pilots, we thought that the dimensions of this thing would have a cord of about 6-10 feet and a span of appx. 30-35 feet. Sorry, no one had a camera, and given the darkness would have been difficult.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date was corrected to 09/11/99, pursuant to correction by witness.))<n>

When we got there I went back outside to watch the dancing light with the binoculars.  I had to cross the street to get the trees out of my view.  After about 30 minutes I noticed there was something in the sky moving towrd me from the same direction (north).  It seems grey, kind of see through, I thought maybe a cloud moving on the breeze?(completely clear night)  There were no lights on the front and the glossy black nose of the craft was just reflecting the city lights below. I could see it but not yet identify it.   It made no sound.   As it got closer it was flying very low, as it came over my head I relized it was a huge triangle with 3 sets of triangle lights on the bottom, the lights were bright but did not shine on the tops of the houses or trees.  It was less then a half a block to the East of me and low enough a major league pitcher could have hit it with a ball.  It banked to turn East.  As my terror subsided I ran fast back into my Dad&#39;s house shaking.<n>

I got up fast and ran out on to the deck and observed it for about 3 seconds before it kept going west.  I was surprized because it wasn&#39;t falling, it was heading west horizontally.  It was so exciting and it was something that I had never before seen in my life! Thank You, ((personal data deleted))<n>

((location deleted))||Changing|10 minutes|Daytime changing Balloon-like phenomena|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54403.html|197|ndxe199909| Daytime changing Balloon-like phenomena<n> <n><n> <n><n> TO THE EDITOR:  DO NOT RELEASE MY CITY OR STATE, the GUYS will be able to find out my identity too easily!   Leave off the particulars after the report, they would divulge my identity..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 11th, 1999, a fine Sunday afternoon, I was in the backyard when I saw an odd thing almost directly overhead..  It was about 7 PM. The weather was warm and partly cloudy with some thick clouds overhead but a bright day with the sun shining most of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up in the clouds (I&#39;d estimate the cloud base at 7000 or so) was an almond shaped zone of brilliant shimmering silvery cloud, like it had a light source in it.  It was shaped like a football, with pointed ends.  It didn&#39;t move and I stared at it for about a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glancing around I saw what looked like five parachutes, stacked one above the other like a team event where they &#39;hook-up&#39; and come down as a unit..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only there were no parachutists or shrouds, and all the canopies were deep red in color.  Not illuminated, but just like dark red fabric.  These were lower in the sky, off to the east less than a half-mile from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, I yelled for my girlfriend who was inside, but she didn&#39;t answer, so I looked back and the entire scene had changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there were two large, round balloon-like things right in front of me, not a hundred feet up.  I was stunned and just kept my eyes on them, trying not to blink.  They were round, apparently made of orange and white material in a high visibility pattern. The were arranged like this- orange square, white square, orange square, alternating in a regular design.  The two were identical.  Then they start to pulsate rapidly, moving toward each other and away at a fast rate, maybe 5 times per second. (These figures are just estimates of course, but I&#39;m trying to tell what I saw.) 	At this point, dark lines appeared between the two round &#39;balloons&#39; like it was trying to run cords or ropes to each of the &#39;balloons&#39;. Here&#39;s where I always get a chill because this next part is so entirely impossible in our reality, yet here I was staring at the impossible, right in front of my eyes, broad daylight.  You folks who want to see this sort of thing, had better realize that it can really upset your world view, confidence in scientific theory and law, in just a minute or two of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top &#39;balloon&#39; sprouted (from it&#39;s top side) another rapidly inflating balloon.  Now there were three, linked together oriented vertically, they weren&#39;t in a straight line, but loosely organized vertically, all of them bobbing a bit as they drifted (thankfully) away from me.  One more balloon sprouted in the next few seconds for a total of 4 in front of me, now in the shape of a capital letter &#39;L&#39;.  After turning and yelling for my girlfriend to get the video tape camera, I looked back and (get this) what looked like a yellow sash or big ribbon  was dangling down the length of the display and fluttering below the now SQUARE objects. Yes, they were now square and the orange and white was a huge checkerboard pattern of dull orange and slightly dingy white square areas.  The material now showed a texture as though it were made of weathered vinyl.  Like an old lawn furniture covering.  I was doubting my own eyes, thinking I must be having some sort of hallucination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Girl friend FINALLY appeared and by now the whole thing had moved off to the east-northeast about a thousand yards.  I pointed it out to her, she saw it, (thank goodness!) so I asked her what she saw.  She said someone&#39;s flying a box-kite.  I look back out there and it looks like a three tiered box-kite with two lines draping down about twice its length, and the tips of the lines were bent 90 degrees to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend noticed two silver beads high in the sky, some distance apart.  Each looked the same size, like the head of a pin at arms length.  They were motionless, and each was in a sort of blurry field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a bit, I couldn&#39;t find these &#39;beads&#39;, and it was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have seen things of a bizarre nature in the sky before, which is why I watch the sky when I&#39;m outside.  But if my own mother told me the above story, I would never believe her.  I&#39;d figure she was &#39;nuts&#39;.  Like you are thinking I am nuts right now.  Ah, but I have a theory....<n> <n><n> <n><n> A HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION?  	This occurred within one and a half miles of a very large Air Force base.  A base known for its engineering facilities.  The technology I witnessed was beyond any known to laymen; for instance, the hovering beads and the almond shaped shimmering cloud.  I doubt the Air Force did this, but who knows what technology all those billions have wrought.  One factor deleterious to the secret technology argument is, why?  Why do this to a regular citizen when it could be tested by sworn-to-secrecy personnel?  It is possible they wanted to see if they could create panic in people, and were waiting breathlessly by the phone to see who would call in the freaky report.  No one panicked, because it was a harmless display, and too bizarre for anyone with any sense to even report.. They would sound insane.  Did they want to see if panic ensued, maybe?  I&#39;ll never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CRAZY ALIENS FROM SPACE?   	It may have been extra-terrestrials, UFO aliens.. but how pointless, to perform these antics and then disappear.  If it was alien, they acted like children playing around with their shape-shifting antics.  I doubt the UFO alien theory.  The whole display was irritatingly absurd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE OLD DECEIVER?  	The Bible says Lucifer is the &#34;Prince of the spirits of the air&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A well read Bible believer knows that Hell is not doing business YET.  The demons of Lucifer flit about the atmosphere doing what they can to deceive men into discrediting God and His Word.  Over the ages men have seen fairies, leprechauns, elves, werewolves, and now bug-eyed aliens.  Maybe they were all the same energy or entities in differing guises.  Play acting in roles to deceive men, causing them to stumble in their faith in the Lord.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Historical ufo occupant sightings from the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s reported witnesses having conversations with these &#39;occupants&#39;.  The stories they told these farmers and quaint townspeople were idiotic.  Saying they were from Venus, or Mars and they ask for water and other mundane, easily obtained items.  They took them inside and showed them their blinking lights and knobs and buttons, but the people never brought back any useful info or evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode might have been a demonstration of mind control.  Creating hallucinations in the human mind at will, to baffle and awe the poor schleps.  Like me.  No physical object could do the maneuvers and appearance/disappearance of these things.  The 90 degree turns, instant acceleration to tremendous speeds, all testify to a non-material object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would explain much.  Out of a thousand ufo reports, maybe ten will describe similar or identical objects.  Like they were all unique and instantly changeable.  This would be easier if the object were a controlled hallucination, nothing would be impossible in this scenario.  None of it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The question is, why would I type all this, (I&#39;m no typist) and tell this stupid sounding (I could invent a much more intriguing disc story) report, unless it were true, and so strange I still have trouble describing it.  I only ever told the whole story to one person, my late brother.  He believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 51 year old  USAF veteran of 12 years service, I attained the rank of E-5 with a line number for E-6 as a 32172p, Weapons control system mechanic on McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms.  (C and D models) I have the Air Force Achievement medal and many others, Honorably discharged in the middle 80&#39;s.  I work as a control panel builder for a small local company specializing in electro-plating and corrosion control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So believe what you will, I don&#39;t &#39;swear-to-God&#39; about things as this is a sinful practice and is not necessary.  I don&#39;t mind you not believing, because I doubt I would believe this strange stuff were you reporting it to me..;) 	It happened September 11, 1999, from 6:55 to 7:05 pm.<n>

I was 15 at the time and my mother was driving me to my dance class in a local town (we live in a rural area around it).  We had barely left home and were driving down the dirt road.  It was fully dark by now, and I don&#39;t think the moon was out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were having a casual conversation, when I looked out the window to my right (direction was north)  I must have looked at exactly the right time, because I barely had to turn my body to see the amazing object travelling alongside the car.   From the ground it was about 35-40 degrees up, and couldnt have been more than 50 to 60 feet from the car.  It was close enough that I could see the outline of the dark surface against the sky, and it had 4-5 orange-yellow lights covering the hull.  It must have been travelling around the same speed as the car, because it seemed stationary even with our motion. (we were travelling east) The oval-saucer shaped object stayed alongside us for about a minute or so, then quickly the lights dimmed and it dissapeared as fast as it had came.   I ended up telling the story to my mom about 2 years later, since I have seen strange occurances off and on since then.  Most of these occured in the fall/winter months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

As we were talking I noticed that beyond his head about 2 miles away (as the crow flys) I saw what I thought was a star. I kept turning on then off. I told him and he turned around to watch it too. I would slowly turn off the all of the sudden it would be there again. This happened a few times then we noticed it was getting closer and larger. We then saw that it had a triangle shape to it. As we joked about it it turned off and dissappeared for about 5 minutes. It then reappeared only this time it was farther away and more north. After it had moved north a little it shot off what seems to be a light ball of some sort.It was strange because it just seems to stay in one spot except when it was moving closer to us.

There were three stars shaped into a triangle. Then all of sudden one of the girls said, its moving. At first we thought it was a satalite, but the three stars was moving together, in a straight line. You can tell that all three stars were connected together. It was traveling from the north and then headed south. With the point going first and then all of a sudden it stop and like it flip over and the pointed end was facing down, and the other two stars were on top, it stayed there for a few minutes, and then it was gone.

The brilliance peaked then wained, however the object moved, slowly, in a hook pattern (like the letter &#34;J&#34; starting at the top of the letter) until it vanished.  The area it moved in could be described as a 3inch by 3 inch square area of sky at arms length.  At first I thought it was a supernova explosion, but ruled it out due to the haze (plasma?)and apparent movement.  The star-like object in the center of the haze maintained it´s shape as a &#34;star&#34; or point of light without warping or disappating. It steadily lost its lumonisity until it disappeared (along with the haze, which mimiced the brilliance accordingly). The event lasted about 5-6 seconds.  Maybe it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere at such an angle as to be &#34;head on&#34; if you catch my drift. Or a satellite activating a booster rocket?  Well about 10 minutes later the same event happened again...about 12 inches at arms length to the right of the previous event.  Charecteristics almost identical only this time the patern of movement was of a reversed &#34;J&#34;. This was no flare, no sound was emmitted.  Since only I witnessed the event (my wife heard me yell &#34;wow!&#34;) a report such as this would only be of use if others reported activity in this part of Bavaria.  A correlation maybe, at best, but worth reporting.  By the way, there was heavy observable satellite activity around this time.  I am 32 years old, married, an ex-US Army air traffic controller with over 5 years of active duty (Fort Rucker, AL and Grafenwehr Germany).<n>

I was sitting on my deck which faces north.  I was watching the air traffic pattern for planes taking off at Kansas City International Airport.  My 4 yr old was in my lap and we had just been discussing birds.  He pointed at a black object which appeared to be floating upward from my left(wsw). It ascended like a baloon which is what I first thought it to be.  However I noticed what appeared to be several shape changes,including yhe final form which looked like an egg with short stubby wings. It rose to roughly 3-5000ft and appeared to hover.  I expected &#34;the balloon &#34; to either be blown further away by upper atmosphere winds or to eventually rise high enough to not be seen by the naked eye.  Upper level clouds came in and eventually obscured my vision.  I did not have my Binoculars much to my disappointment.  I estimate that the thing travelled a minimum of about 3 miles to the north,based on the guess that it was a balloon.  However balloons don&#39;t maintain position against upper air currents.  It may have been larger, so my estimation of distance would obviously be off.  Aircraft taking off from KCI were taking off southbound.  At least 3 took off and went east. They did not pass close enough for me to compare in size.<n>

This has not been the first time that black helicopters of this type have come over and buzzed our trailer court! On more than one occasion, we have seen (3)back helicopters since June 13, 1999. My mom has also witnessed this event. I know this not a ufo report but I wanted to send a report anyway in hopes of finding what it could mean. Thanks, ((deleted)) from Birmingham (09/10/99)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The full description is as follows: ................................ Black chopper (w/ 2 landing bars) Long tail Grey markings on both sides (2) occupants wearing what appeared to be military or government clothing (could not tell). Craft circled (3) times before speeding off to the west coming from the south. The chopper had to have been traveling at least 30 miles an hour flying overhead. We live near alot of trees and woods. The time approximately it took to circle was about (15) seconds at the most. They left, and about (2:20pm) they came back, this time they flew past our trailer and we grabbed our 35 millimeter camera and started to take a series of photos without them knowing and then they left. I didn&#39;t get to take any photos of it but I&#39;ll try next time!!! Mr. Davenport I wish not not to give my name for the safety of my family. I need to get in touch with you on another story I have concerning what my stepdad saw on the night of (July 3, 1999) He saw a ufo just coming home from getting dinner. He saw what looked like a huge ufo explode into strings of multi-colored lights ranging from white to red to blue and purple ect... What I want to do is send you a map of the area in wich we live so that you will know where to pinpoint the locations of these events individually. I believe that the event of (July 3, 1999) and the black helicopters are are connected. Please, I wish to remain anonymous but I give you permission to tell Art about these events when you appear on his program next tuesday night. Thanks for reading my letter! Keep up the good work!!! p.s. If you need more info concerning the times or locations, I will send them to you via snail mail.<n>

Flying from west to east, clear skys.  Just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling down a street called Sunrise from the North heading south and saw this craft that was a pearly white top with no markings I could see just disappear. It was traveling from west to east.  Being a skywatcher of chemtrails, etc. I note all in the sky and I was just slowly driving south and watching this craft when suddenly it disappeared.  There were no clouds for it to fly into as all the sky was clear, not ocean blue, by clear of any clouds or chemtrails. - It JUST DISAPPEARED. I drove into a parking lot and tried to find it further east as if it would come out of a cloud, but it was nowhere to be found in any direction. ;IT JUST DISAPPEARED......  There was no sound I was aware of, or any of the things listed below.  I watched the sky for a minute or two, there were no other crafts around.<n>

I looked up and saw three circular white lighted disks flying in a triangular formation following behind a low flying jetliner. One disk was in the lead and two followed behind, one on each side to form a perfect triangle. The objects trailed behind the jetliner for about ten seconds, then they stopped and there was a flash of light where they had been. The objects seemed to disappear straight upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(about 5 am.) I got into my car as usual,sat there for just a minute before putting the keys into the ignition when I just happened to glance up into the sky just in front of me. For a split second I figured it was just an airplane until I realized I was looking at a fairly low flying triangular object with one bright light in the center and clusters of lights on each point of the triangle.I could hardly believe my eyes and remember saying out loud to myself&#34;No way!!&#34; I then recall just how low it actually was flying. It was just above the trees and was making no sound at all. It came out of the south east and curved very gracefully going just in front of the trees in front of my house twards the north west. As it disappeared over the house I quickly started my car up and pulled out of the driveway to see if I could follow it. There was no sign of it any place in the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had been in the hot tub about 10 minutes when exactly at 3:15am, 9/10/99, I saw an orange fireball (I ran in the house after the sighting and checked the clock). The sky was crystal clear, and my view was not impeded by trees or any other obstructions. I was gazing at the nighttime sky when what can best be describe as a fireball suddenly appeared. It was a very brilliant orange color, with a long tapered segmented tail. It was not crossing the sky like a meteor, but was heading straight down. I heard no noise associated with this fireball, not even the sound of wind. Three seconds later it disappeared as if it was never there to begin with. ((personal data deleted))<n>

My deck faced to the east towards the river. We all of a sudden saw 1 bright light hovering over the tree line. The light would fade in and out. It would go from bright to dim.  Then two more lights showed up fading in an out.  One light was stationary but it was moving erratically back and forth but still stationary.  The other 2 lights were just shooting around at crazy angles down the bitterroot valley southeast of my house.  Nothing an aircraft could do!  The light would be stationary then all of a sudden they shot down the valley.  I mean probably 50-60 miles in the matter of 2 seconds.  Then they would shoot back to the one that was stationary behind my house.  They were not high in the sky.  This went on for about 30 minutes.  We were just all stunned.  We called the airport in Missoula to see if they saw anything on their radar but we didn&#39;t get through. I have goosebumps writing this!

9/9/99 23:00|Cozumel (Mexico) and Ocho Rios (Jamaica) (between)||Triangle|45 min|My husband and I, while traveling on our honeymoon, observed something strange following our ship just before midnight.|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09855.html|219|ndxe199909| My husband and I, while traveling on our honeymoon, observed something strange following our ship just before midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My new husband &amp; I were on our honeymoon aboard the Carnival cruise ship Destiny- at sea between Cozumel and Jamaica. At approx. 11 PM after dinner we decided to walk the deck and get some fresh air. Both my husband and I are non-drinkers are sound responsible people. I suggested we go as far to the prow of the ship as allowed as the night was clear and the sea was very calm and beautiful. The upper-level deck is as far as passengers are allowed and is immediately adjacent to the game room for teen passengers. We walked to the rail and just enjoyed the nights breeze. Far off in the distance, lightning flashed and I remember even mentioning to my husband that we may get a storm during the night, but he shouldn&#39;t worry as this was his first cruise. Before long, we both noticed what appeared to be a ship sailing directly toward us and at a slight angle. Being a scuba diver, I have been at sea many times prior to this and I just thought it was a freight ship passing us in the distance. However, this proved to be very different than any thing I had ever seen. This object moved toward us with a speed not of any ship I had ever seen. Within a matter of moments, it was right aside of our cruise ship. At this time a young man, perhaps around 15 yrs old also came to the rail and asked us if we knew what we were looking at. The object hovered just outside the lights of the ship, but through the clear night a definite triagular shape could be made out. It had 3 lights which were respectively green, amber and white. My husband and I carefully considered what we were seeing. How could any ship have overtaken us so quickly? Why would any ship plot a collision course with a cruise liner. And the most damning evidence. This object made no wake and hovered next to a MOVING ship for 10 minutes or more as we all watched. A Conventional ship would have had to come right at us, made a sharp turn in close proximity to our ship and then have thrown their engines into hard reverse in order to stay exactly along side us for the! 10 minu tes or so. Our conclusion, this was not a seafaring vessel, but rather something suspended in the air. The object casually lingered right next to our ship for at least 10 minutes and long enough for several other young men to come out to watch. The kids were afraid and kept asking my husband and I if we were safe. Shortly thereafter the craft began to move slowly down the length of our vessel. My husband in tow, we walked the entire length of our ship and watched the craft glide out past the stern and out to sea. The strange lightning I had observed just before we sighted it seemed to follow it as it went. We watched as it maintained a course off into the distance from where we had just come, the lightning only seen in the vicinity of the craft. Just a word as a follow up to this. Both my  husband and I are not crank cases. We are normal middle aged adults and most skeptical about these kind of phenomenon, UNTIL now. No ship could have done what this thing did or would have even wanted to get so close to a large moving cruise ship. I also noticed that the same shape craft was reported over Monterray Mexico only 2 days after we saw this. The sighting in Monterray involved police, air traffic controller and tv stations. Thank you for your time. I hope this is helpful<n>

Number of lights would change from 1 to sometimes 4 or 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 10pm on 9-9-99 my neighbor asked me to come outside to see what she and her husband were watching.  At first there was nothing there. Then, 2 or 3 bright (almost florescent) green lights would pulsate in the sky.  They never appeared to move from the spot where they were,  however the number of lights would change.  Sometimes there would be only 1 and sometimes 3, 4 or 5.  Then the lights would disapear altogether for a few seconds (15-20) and re-appear again. The neighbors had been watching this for about 10 min. before calling me outside.  About 5 min. after that another neighbor came home and also witnessed the lights in the sky.  This was a total of 4 people observing the lights.  At 2 instances, there &#34;appeared&#34; to be a &#34;beam&#34; from the light to the ground (or vice-versa).  The lights were quite high in the sky eventhough they were quite large.  At times they appeared to be behind a portion of cloud as the view was hazey and dull, and then other times appeared bright and clear, as if it were in front of the cloud.  There was absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet and any sound would have been heard.  We get quite a few commercial aircraft in the area, so am familiar with their lights and sound.  Also get &#34;copters&#34; from Whidbey Island Base and are familiar with their sound.  We are wondering if anyone else happened to see what we saw that night?  Any suggestions as to what it was?  Have never seen anything like it before.<n>

The lights were far away from eachother at times but seemed to mirror eachothers movements. At times, they would be directly on top of eachother moving in the same bizaar manner. A manner that did not seem logical for human purposes.  I thought perhaps rescue helicopters far off shore but I ruled this out because of the incredible speed and the bizaar nature of these lights.  The lights were mostly white but had glimpses of color from time to time.  They were solid lights though, that never dimmed.  My friend and I watched for hours and I fear that we will never Know what we saw.<n>

I had returned home from work a bit later then normal one evening with thoughts of changing my clothes and then going to visit a sick friend in the hospital which was only about a kilometre from where I lived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t have much time to get there before visiting hours would be over, it was app. 8:40pm when I left the house,  I lived on a road that only had a french school on it, at the end of the road was a privately owned mini-home community-where I lived.  As I was nearing the french school I noticed a car going extremally slow, it was a neighbor that I talked to from time to time, he lived several houses down my street,  he had his wife and kids with him and he was pointing toward the back of the french school which was close to the back of the hospital..........this is what I seen ! Hoovering, still as can be over a inlet of water about app. 200-300ft away and about 50-75ft up was a very bright white light shining down on the water that lit up everything beneath it like it was daytime, on each side of the white light was a blue blinking light and on each side of the blue blinking lights were red blinking lights, blinking about three times faster then the blue lights, my neighbor and I both pulled over to the side of the road and shut our cars off,  this thing was totally silent,  we watched it for several minutes and came to the conclusion that it wasn’t a plane, helicopter,balloon or anything else that we’ve ever seen before, my neighbor had to leave......I didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove up the road a ways to get a little closer to it, I turned off my car and sat against the trunk for about another several minutes observing when the bright white light in the middle of the craft dimmed and then started moving toward me, I was a little scared but more in awe of what I was observing, just as it neared me it turned in a 45 degree angle and headed toward the east and I watched it till it went out of sight.............it moved very slow but precise,  no noise the whole time............I drove back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife what just happened....I dont know what she thought of it,  but I had witnesses.  I called the police and they told me to report it to the airport, and they put me through to the controll tower who told me there were no aircraft in in about 2hrs and none coming in for about another 2hrs,  not a very big place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15-20 minutes later there were about 4 small aircraft surrounding the area that I had seen the craft, I told them I watched it till it disappeared into the east so I dont know why they sent them up............curious I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways I’m not lying........dont need the attention !  ....just wanting to share...........since seeing this I have been trying to search for someone else who has seen this same formation of lights.<n>

We could not see the shape of the object for two reasons. 1)it was still dark outside, 2)it had lights which was bright enough to mask any shape. At first glance it appeared to be an airplane as far as the front lights were same as you see from an aircraft at night. We noticed the object was not moving and made no sound as a helicoper may have made so we came to the conclusion that this object was not an airplane nor a helicoper. It stayed in one place with the airplane like headlights and no other lights visible. The object appeared to be roundish although a definite shape was not apparent and we could not see any extensions, such as wings etc. After about 30 minutes or so we had to leave for work and was unable to continue our observations. If you need any other Info. you can contact me at &lt;gee_4orce@hotmail.com&gt;. My name is Terry Woods. I am now a believer that we are visited by aliens or that our government has experimental &#34;space crafts&#34;. After the observation described above I have no explanation as to what it could have been but I do know that what we saw was clearly a craft and not a conventional airplane of any type I have seen in my lifetime. Also it was close enough that it was obviously not a star and did not move like one of our satellites would.<n> <n><n> Thanks!  (Name deletesd))<n>

Her eyes are goos but not great. Also,she doesn&#39;t watch ANY science fiction stuff like movies or X-files,etc. I recorded her story and now i&#39;m giving it to you.  Got up around 2 am to go to bathroom just finished when all the lights went out. Saw lights ouside. There was a square balloon with lights turning inside, went to the other window there were two more farther away looked out front window there were 3 more over the golf course and down the street were 3 or 4 gold discs. I was a bit tired so I thought to go back to bed but I turned around to watch more. When I looked out the front window, I saw a gold disc by the neighbors garage. There was a sack on top of it (brown) and a tube or rope coming out of it then it started to &#34;pump up&#34; or inflate then I started getting scared. The lights started to spin and it looked like a head coming out of it. There were more gold discs coming.  Just as I started to look away I saw cars coming.  There were 4 or 5 black sedans coming exactly 3 feet apart doing about 90 mph (this is also a semi-dead end street which sees like no traffic except residents) I thought they were coming to tell the martians to cut it out (doesn&#39;t know about MIBs) Then I went to bed.  This is what she saw as she told me.  I really don&#39;t know if she was the only one who saw this or any objects like this.  The cars really scared me, I hope they don&#39;t know she was watching.<n>

A very long trail of smoke was emitted and I could see that this object was on fire. I viewed it for 2 to 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:40 am PST, I was sitting at a traffic light in downtown Renton Wa. when I looked to the west and saw an extremely large, bluish white fireball falling from the sky at a 75 to 80 degree angle. I viewed the object for 2 to seconds and it was so bright and large that I could see the white hot fire on this object. It was even bright enough to light up a very long trail of smoke that it was emmiting as it fell. After about 2 to 3 seconds, the object disappeared without a trace and I could no longer see the smoke trail that it left. If you are looking at the head of a pushpin held at arms length, that was the approx. size of the object. The object disappeard at about the same altitude as a small aircraft coming in for a landing. there is a small airport very close by so altitude is failry easy to guage.<n>

It appeared to have some movement near it, which I assumed was the cloud cover moving... the bottom three of the five stars began to move away from the two top stars... I watched as they slowly moved toward the horizon and then slowly disappeared fading out...<n>

Then we saw the second object almost identical to the first (a little smaller) going in the opposite direction.  Startling.  Nothing we&#39;d ever seen before. Tried to hurry home and get camera, but they had both disappeared behind the mountains by that time.  Would guess people in Ellensburg, WA had a very good and frightening view of them.   Not a word published about it, as far as I can tell.  Yakima Training Range (Army) is hidden just on the other side of the mountains from us.  We have seen many strange objects; i.e. very slow, bright flares?, blue comet like object, strange looking jets...  strange looking jet trails (pulsing?).

We ruled out helicopters, these objects (then one large and 4 smaller) hovered in one place for over and hour - definitlely not a plane, and too low and stationary for a satellite ( we assumed) -- so, on 9/7/99 (tonight) i went outside on the off chance there might be another sighting and i found one of the objects low in the sky to the west of my house ( the previous evening they had been to the northeast).  i called a friend who owns a telescope and he went outside to see, he called me and reported another smaller one above the one i spotted.  He could not explain the flashing objects either.  These were lowering on the horizon quickly, so soon they were behind the trees and i could no longer see them (approx. 30 min.) I am a college gradute with a degree in English - i have an open mind, but tried to explain this sighting logically (plane, satellite, etc...) none of these explanations seemed satisfactory.  I am very interested to know if anyone else reported a similar event either night.<n>

After about 2 minutes of observation I spotted a 3 light formation directly overhead moving slowly from N.W. to S.E. Estimated altitude was minimum 40,000ft. to orbit altitude. The formation was  that of a triangle if you connected them together but not a perfect triangle (all three sides would be different lengths) I do not believe this was one object but 3 separate objects since stars could be seen between them. Each object was not larger than a star or satelite. Each one of the lights were moving in sync with each other as if connected. After about 5minutes of travel across the sky (observed through binoculars) each light separately went out with the last light to go out being the brightest. I am a Private pilot (glider rating) and have 100&#39;s of UFO sighting&#39;s (90%) daytime -one as close as 50 feet!<n>

These observations were prompted by sightings of a similar nature I witnessed on the evening of 9-5-99. On that night I saw 5 similar objects travel south to north within a span of about 20 minutes between 2100 and 2120. On 9-6-99, I observed at the same time as on 9-5-99 and only saw 1 south to north object and 2 shooting stars. On 9-7-99, I thought that if they were all satellites, they may be transiting slightly earlier each night. That is why on the 7th, I started to scan at 2000. The objects appear as satellites both in light consistency and straightline paths. I am curious that if they are indeed satellites, why are so many in the same orbital direction and so closely spaced? On 9-8-99, our sky was cloud obscured and I was unable to make any observatios. On 9-9-99, I observed from 2000 to 2130 and only saw 2 south to north objects and 1 west to east object. If these are satellites, where did the other 7 objects on the 7th go?<n>

I was going up a small hill-side road when I saw an object flying slowly in the sky about a quarter of amile away from me. It was a cloudless sunny day and this object did not cast any reflection in the sky. It was a bright mettallic silver cylindrical shaped object. It was flying very slowly and was almost hovering over a wooded area where workers ,who were at lunch , have been building a new road into this secluded subdivision. I turned my car off and stepped out of my car for a better look and to see if it might be an airplane.  The object made no sound. Nor did it leave a contrail.

The object was traveling due north. It was very bright (reminded me of a night shuttle launch), for several seconds, dimmed for 1 or 2 seconds and returned to it&#39;s original brightness. It dimmed out shortly after that. The object was about the diameter of a pencil, held at arms length.  The length of sighting spanned 20 - 25 degrees of sky.  I&#39;ve seen space debris reentering -- this was moving slower than those and much slower than meteors. A few seconds after it disappeared, a single light crossed the sky, almost on the exact same path (5 degrees off), verred east and back onto it&#39;s original course.  The second object was a dull red color.  It was about the size of a pencil lead held at arms length.  The object maintained its color and illuminosity for the duration of the sighting.  The 2nd object crossed the sky from horizon to horizon, as if chasing the 1st object.  The Gulfport Police Dispatcher reported several citizens called it in also.<n>

I looked out of the dock door between the trailer and the top of the door. I saw something I did not recognize.  I told my co-worker to &#34;look at that.&#34;  He asked me what I was looking at.  We both moved one door south and looked out.  Traveling from north to south was an object that I only could describe as a glass cigar tube with smoke in it and three equally spaced blue lights.  It was not foggy that night.  The moon was clearly visible.  We watched this for approx. 20-30 seconds.  There was no sound at all.  We are 1/2 mile from St. Pete/Clearwater airport where the Coast Guard fly C1-30&#39;s out of.  When they come in, it rattles our building.  There was no sound.  I first saw it when I was facing west.  It traveled south approx. 70-80 degrees and disappeared.  I then went to the east side of the dock and went out on the apron to see if I could see it.  I saw nothing.  I could not tell altitude or size or speed.  We were listening to 970WFLA.  Approx. 20 minutes after we saw this, the station said they were swamped with call of lights in the sky.  I do not know exactly what I saw, but I know that the news explanation that night of a Russian rocket booster traveling at 17,000 mph did NOT satisfy my curiosity.<n>

They appeared to be moving so I got out of my car to get a better look, thinking they were water on a power line. There were at least 5 very distinct upright disks or spheres, the first being a pulsating green, and the other 4 behind it bright white (and all exactly the same size). The disks were spaced evenly apart and each had an INTENSE beam of light shining from one to the next. It had been raining so we knew the object(s) were under 2000&#39; (clouds did not interrupt the light), and the object was traveling (apparently) the speed of a cessna aircraft, but was obiously much higher. The size of each disk was about 1/4 moon, or the size of your thumbnail at arms length, but MUCH brighter. I followed the object visually for over 20 seconds from my direct west, until it disapeared over my southern horizon (about where Disney World is). I&#39;ve worked midnight shifts for over 3 years, the last 2 sitting exactly where I was; in my car facing south, and I have seen planets, meteors, low and high flying planes and jets, bugs, you name it...this was NONE of those things. By the way...it did not make ANY sound at all, OR leave a visible com-trail. My estimate is that if it was a single object would have HAD to be (at the apparent height; just under 2000 feet), at least a quarter of a mile long. Please take note that the &#34;leading&#34; disk was green and pulsing, there were NO &#34;trails&#34; of any kind, and there were VERY clearly visible light &#34;beams&#34; (equal in size to each disk/sphere), between each of the 5. Also note that we are in close proximity to Orlando International Airport, and this &#34;thing&#34; did not follow any usual approach pattern, or even go toward that airport. If it had, they would&#39;ve needed to significantly lengthen the runways.<n>

I made an error on the date of occurrance. The date Isubmitted was 09/08/99, this was in error.  The actual date was 09/07/99. The rest of information is the same as to what I saw. I start work one evening and go home the next morning and dates run together. I was by the location of occurrance this morning and found i was in error. I apologize for any problems I may have caused. It WAS the same morning as the sighting of objects in Tampa. Fl  I live in Miami, Fla My e-mail address is shown below<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date to 09/07/99.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 09/07/99, Tuesday morning, I observed 3 objects in the Western sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 blue-green spheres seen approx 0503 on 09/07/99, on 10 o&#39;clock over horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a security supv and was making a site check. I looked up towards the Western sky (10 o&#39;clock above horizon) and observed 3 objects moving North to South. Distance out from my location was approx 5 miles West of me. I was at 14050 Boggs Dr. Miami, Fl Approx 144 street and SW 112 Ave. The 3 objects had a blueish-green color and at times had a yellow fire like tail. They were no in straight line center object was a little lower than front or rear object. I am familiar with aircraft landig patterns in area and these were not in that pattern. If I were to guess at their speed it would be 200 mph. Like a plane coming in for a landing type speed. Objects dissappered for approx 5-10 sec. Possibly going behind a cloud. We were having some lightning storms down here. Then they reappeared in the same level continuing South-SW in direction. The objects had a &#34;cone&#34; effect like photos a a missle shot where missle causes a white cone to precede it. As said at times objects had a fire like tail. I told my wife when I got home as as ususal comment of being tired was brought up. On the news that evening local TV station (WSVN ch7, FOX affiliate) had a short blip on the sighting in Tampa,Fl. They also had a video clip. There video clip showed the center object higher than the front or rear object. I do not know if you can get copy of the clip Mr Rick Sanchez was the news achorman giving the report.They said officials said it was the booster rockets from a Russian space ship.  I do listen to Art Bell. I heard of the supposed booster entry from last week. I heard the interview with the Dr/Pastor from Tampa, Fl.  This is to let you know it was also seen here in Miami, Fl. Dr/Pastor said his time was prior to 0500,  i think he said 0445 while getting newspaper. I observed objects at approx 0503 hr. These did not appear to be a meteor. I can not give a shape description beacuse of the distance away. News report said going for a Gulf of Mexico splash down. It is along way from where i saw objects to Gulf of Mexico. It is! 90 mile s to Naples where Gulf is. I am about 260 miles South of Tampa,Fl   I like alot of people hesitate to report these because of the fall out of reports. But enough is enough.  Hearing these other local reports I feel I need/must report. You have my e-mail address below. If further info needed contact me there and I will respond accordingly.<n>

I was about 9 miles north of town turning onto highway 302 from highway 86 which would point me toward the south. After I traveled about a mile I noticed an orange glow with a contrail behind it out of my drivers side window at about a 11 o&#39;clock position traveling toward the east. It was a clear night and where I was in in the flight path for airplanes from Little Rock to Memphis. I am an avid airplane fan and I have observed many jets but this object was moving way to fast for a plane and had no visible navigation lights. It was emmiting an orange glow from the back which made the contrail more visible. I couldn&#39;t determine a shape from the angle I was from it but I could make out a large form. I thought it might be a fighter aircraft with it&#39;s afterburners on but it was to large to be that high up and still be seen. The contrail was also very wide. After it got low in the East, I saw the orange turn to red for just a brief moment and it started to fade. It seemed like it was losing altitude and making a southeast turn and it was about the 9 o&#39;clock position at this time, very low and far to the east. I am 43 years old, I drive a tractor trailer truck coast to coast each week. I am a novice astronomer and have never seen anything close to this before.<n>

That looks like something is on fire in the sky. At first we laughed until we looked up toward the north of us and saw what looked to be a large object glowing flying through the sky with a steady red tail of flame. It appeared to be traveling from the west and slowly turning toward the southeast. At that time of the morning there were no planes in the air and very little lights around the campus. There was no doubt that it was not a lighting illusion or an airplane. This kept a steady distance from the ground all the while we witnessed it. I ran further into the parking lot to keep it in sight until it was covered from sight by trees. I have no doubt in my mind that it was still at the same altitude even as it disappeared over the horizon. If it had been a plane in that much trouble we would have seen it go down way before it went out of our sight.<n>

I went out side to smoke a cigarette and there it was, a strange hovering light around the size of the moon. It would hover and then move very fast, short distances. Then it would hover again. The police even called the airport to atleast get some kind of explaination, all 3 officers agreed that it was not an airplane, a star, or a helicopter. The airport&#39;s explaination was that a wildlife/rescue helicopter was doing a deer count. I have yet to witness a helicopter with obvious red,green,and white lights hover and move so quickly and at such bizarre angles. The lights had obvious color changes,first red,then green, then white.

It was late on a cool night around 11  It was not quite summer not quite fall. I was standing outside after walking a female friend home. My friend and I were discussing constellations and stars so we were naturally looking up to the sky. It was a very clear night and you could see the entire night sky over the city. My friend and I ended up talking around a half an hour or so and she offered me something to drink, I asked if I could get some water so she went in the house to get it for me.  She was in the house for around 3 minutes or so and I continued to watch the night sky. I was actually looking to spot a falling star or similar anomaly when suddendly an object started to block my view traveling southwest at a very low rate of speed.  I shifted my view north slightly to see what I thought would be a plane headed to Detroit Metro Airport yet it was not.  This object was perfectly triangular in s! hape, flying at an altitude of 400 feet or less, and was completely silent.  There were hundreds of small lights underneath the craft but they looked to me to be windows like those of a commercial passenger jet because the light did not shine out, it shined through.  There were running lights of some sort at the front tip and two corners that appeared to be externally mounted and super bright white.  They were lit steady and were not blinking. It looked like a flying city and was dark gray or black metal where there was no lights.  I estimated this craft to be the size of at least two football fields across (rough estimate) because once it was directly overhead it was all I could see in the sky briefly.  I watched it another 30 seconds or so and then the object either accelerated away at a tremendous amount of speed or simply turned translucent because I could not see it the distance anymore.  By this time my friend had returned with the water, she handed it to me and asked what was I looking for.  I drank the water and told her nothing, fearing she would think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone about this event until recently and even though it was so long ago the sight is burned in my memory as if it was ! today!   Only after years of reading other reports and watching documentaries on sightings did I decide to offer my sighting to the community.<n>

It was similar to the space shuttle, MIR or ISS, but they were not anywhere near at the time. It was too bright to be anything else. It didn&#39;t look like a meteor either.<n>

Saw them at different times over about an hours length with binoculars. The planes flew in a striaght pattern.  These fles very zigzagged and fast.  One seemed to stop and align with two other stars then take off again and quickly dissappear.  I have never seen anything like it before much less three.<n>

My husband and I parked off the road for a few minutes to watch,then noticed one craft like object over sunset and then another to the right of the sun.  The sun was very low in the horizon.After a few minutes the two on the right seemed to move one ontop of the other.As we began to travel South on Rt. 45 they stayed in view until the sun went down and could not be seen any more.  They did not seem to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object we seen seemed to change shape.  From a craft with contrail to just a cigar shape.  The other two were just cigar shapped objects.  After the two on the right moved close to one another they stayed that way until we could not see them any longer.  We started to travel and their are many corn fields obstructing our view some of the time.  I did not see the two move they just seemed all of a sudden to be one ontop of the other.  They were oblong or cigar in shape.  After the sun went down we could no longer see anything. They were very far from us not close at all.Would like to know if anyone else seen this.<n>

In September of 99 we were painting the barn and staying over there for a couple of days. On the night in question I woke up at about 3 am needing to relieve myself and went outside. It was a very clear night - lots of stars, no moon. This is a very rural area and in the direction I was faceing (NE) there are very few ground lights. I at once noticed a very bright white light over a wooded ridge about 1/3 of a mile distant it was just at the tops of the trees and I could see the tops of a couple of pine trees in front of the lower half of the light. The light did not move and I could not imagion what it could be. After watching it for two to three minutes it suddenly decreased in intensity to about one tenth of its origional brilliance and remained at that level as I watched it for another several minutes. At this point I was getting very cold and went back in to bed (to sleepin bag). The next year, late in the Spring, I walked to the ridge which has a large clearing in front of it from logging. I found nothing at all to account for the light. I have never seen the light again although I look for it every time I am up in Columbia which is 4 to 6 times a year sometimes staying two to four days to work on the property.<n>
9/6/99 02:00|Carrollton|TX|Flash|2 minutes|My boyfriend and I witnessed an intense flash of light yellowish,orange and I thought a plane exploded in midair.|8/5/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13657.html|277|ndxe199909| My boyfriend and I witnessed an intense flash of light yellowish,orange and I thought a plane exploded in midair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an unexplained sighting last year out here in my little area,and to be honest after it happened I came home to see if anything had been reported on what was seen by my boyfriend &amp; I.Unfortunately I found no other people who had reported it so I let it go. But I visited this website and found a report a gentleman had submitted also from Carrollton so now I don&#39;t feel so insecure.This would be the second sighting lol in Carrollton that has been noted.. Last year August 6,1999 my boyfriend and I were coming home from a visitation with my friends in Richardson.As we were sitting at the intersection of Old Denton Rd and MacArthur Dr at approximately 1-2 am (we lived in apartments located on MacArthur Dr.) I happened to look out my side of the windshield.Apparently my boyfriend saw me look up and did the same just as we did a bright flash of  yellowish, orange light occured.To be honest it was so extreme I had thought a plane had exploded in the sky..I looked at my boyfriend and asked what he saw,and he described the flash of light and how powerful it seemed kind of like an explosion.I said okay that&#39;s about what I saw and he tried to explain it away to me as he is semi skeptical of UFO&#39;s and such.First he tried telling me it was just some kind of a plane hidden in clouds but it was a clear night no clouds in sight..Then he tried the most plausible explanation heat lightning (we&#39;re now discussing this in the car in the parking lot of our apartment building) I look at him and stated a good case,first there was no flash before that one and not another flash after it.. To this day it is unexplained and apparently we were the only ones who saw this incident,I know there was a car behind us but as I was not in that car I have no idea if that person did or did not see it..<n>

I was sitting on a picnic tale looking up at the stars in the eastern sky when I saw a large blue-white light moving very quickly from southeast to northwest. It startled me. It was gone behind my house before I could stand up to see where it went. I remember thinking, &#34;Shit, that thing is moving fast!&#34; I thought it might be a shooting star, but it was very bright, moved incredibly fast, and did not have a tail. It did not look like any other shooting stars I have ever seen. I did not hear any sound associated with this object. I am a 30 year old, college educated male. I work in the vocational rehabilitation field.<n>

I observed it for approximately 5 seconds as it burned out and left a visible vapor trail.The fireball almost lasted long enough to pass below the roof of the house across the sreet.<n>

I was remarking on how bright the stars where when I saw what appered to be a small plane&#39;s NAV lights they where very bright flashing red, green and white lights coming over the ridge of the mountain. I had a MAG light flashlight and flashed it once at what I thought was a plane. After I flashed the flashlight the light disapered and reappered very high overhead in all of about 3 sec moving very fast like a satillite in a northerly direction flashing in three colors then it started moving in 90 degree turn&#39;s that lasted for about 2 second&#39;s each and it moved off to the northwest into the trees not to be seen again. All three of us work for a large company of over 10,000 employees I work in system support the other two are Network Engineers that are MCSE&#39;s (Microsoft Certified System Engineers)<n>

I do this just to keep an eye on the sky.  On this night I spotted what looked, at first, as a standard satellite silently moving from the north to the south.  As it passed, from my vantage, just west of Altair.  I watched it pass to the south, I attempted to located it in my binoculars, and I was caught off guard as a bright strobe light went off.  I quickly tried to identify this object as an aircraft, I say quickly because it was still moving very fast, but I could not see any other running or marker lights.  The object displayed three levels of luminosity.  First it was dim, like a normal satellite, then the strobe went off, after which the luminosity was in-between.  I tried to keep it in view, but after a few more seconds, even with the flashing strobe, it vanished.  I am sorry that I could not give exact times, I had to turn on a flashlight to see my watch which read 21:33.  I know that I am not a trained observer, and may not have conveyed or missed what you might be considered valuable information, but I hope you might find this report worth some type of interest.<n>

It moved with constant velocity from the east to the west.  The sighting took about 15 seconds.  The very unique thing about the sighting was that about half way through the trajectory the star like objet seamed to be deflected at an equal angle that veared from the originla path.  Could it be a meteorite that glanced off the high atmosphere and disapeared into outter space ?<n>

When from our left came two circular, hazy donut shaped objects.  The two forms were situated 45 degrees from eachother.  With the forward most shape being to the southeast of the other one. They traveled to the South, southeast.  It took about three seconds for  the objects to be out of our field of vision.<n>

But as we watched we couldn&#39;t see any wings.  It moved slowly North and then disappeared near a tree- as if it winked out.  We see blimps and such around here, but this was much higher up, perhaps 1-2 miles.<n>

I was a senior at Braxton County High and my nephew was staying with me for a while.  As i stood on the porch looking to the east to my left at the orange,pink, and purple sky something on the horizion of the grey sky to my right caught my eye.  Just at the top of the treeline there was something moving making no sound roughtly 1.5-2 miles away.  I watched it for a few minutes and tried to reason out what it was i was seeing. It was a large &#34;saucer&#34; that was a dark flat color that was black or very dark grey.  I ran in the house to get my nephew who just got in the shower so he could see the object.  He said,&#34;WHAT WHAT). I pointed up and there was the object just as i had seen it.  It started moving higher in the sky and closer to where we were standing. the object WAS NOT stationary and perfectly still, but wobbled like a top.  It was close enought that i can see details of the object. The center section of the object was stationary and the outside of it was rotation radidly.  We must have stood there watching it for 7 minutes or so when i heard someone walking their dogs about to enter the intersection where my nephew and I were anding in the road. It was my 3rd grade teacher who lived 3 houses up from me.  She said hi and looked at us like what are you doing...  I asked, &#34;her what was that?&#34; and pointed to the object in the sky. she looked up and asked us what that was i said &#34;I don&#39;t Know&#34;!!!  She said it that a UFO???, and i stated i had no clue. She said she didn&#39;t want to know what that was and ran up the street crying.  As the object moved higher and closer i ran to the next block where my uncle, grandmother, and aunt who had recently had a stroke lived. i banged on the door hoping that my uncle would be awake but no one came to the door as the object passed less than a 3/4 of a mile away.  To this day I have never seen anything like that again and will NEVER forget the experience!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As it was white in color, it looked like the shape of one of space shuttles, but without the nose or tail fins. There were no markings. It definitely too big to be a plane up that high. We watched it for a few seconds move south to north, then it disappeared behind a cloud.  I watched for it for several minutes, but I couldn&#39;t find it again. Living in rural NH I have seen at least two other UFO&#39;s - the first was on Nov. 1, 1989. A bright light caught my attention, then, separately, a huge triangle shaped object hung low in the air making no sound. We have also seen series of white lights forming a large V fly over the area a few years ago. We have also woken to bright lights shining in our 2nd floor bedroom windows from above late at night - with no sound associated with aircraft. My kids (who have both witnessed these events) think I&#39;m weird, but as a professional working in investments, my feet are pretty well on the ground. My first sighting in 1989, however, did change my life.<n>

We was a round light in the sky to the east about 5-10 degrees above the horizon. It could be seen very clearly.  it looked like a spotlight in the sky.  As the clouds went by it went behind the cloud and then would appear after the cloud passed (from left to right).  Then we saw it move from right to left and back again several times.  All this occured before sunrise.  Just before the sun began to come up it disappeared.<n>

9/5/99 01:30|Grand View (near, remote location in N. Wisconsin)|WI|Formation|5 minutes|Myself and approximately 15 others witnessed three lights moving in a triangle shaped formation for about 5-10 minutes.|9/12/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09628.html|296|ndxe199909| Myself and approximately 15 others witnessed three lights moving in a triangle shaped formation for about 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early Sunday morning on 9/5/99, at about 1:30am a large group of friends were camping on a lake in Northern Wisconsin. It&#39;s a very remote area - so much so that we were the only people on the entire lake. Someone noticed lights in the sky and yelled for the rest of us to come and take a look. About 15 of us left the warmth of the fire to go and see. What we saw were three bright lights, very high in the sky - and traveling in a triangle shaped formation. They were about as bright as venus gets or brighter than most all of the surrounding stars. We noticed stars in-between the objects so it definitely seemed like three distinct crafts. They traveled together, but the shape of the triangle would change from equilateral, to right, and back again. We watched the objects for about 5-10 minutes as they traveled in a north to south direction. Nobody had binoculars, so all we could make out was the bright white glow they made. Based on the height, we guessed the objects must have been very large though. My brother, holding a flashlight, tried doing the SOS signal to the objects. About 30 seconds after he started flashing them, the three objects suddenly blinked out and never reappeared.<n>

It resembled an airplane, but was not moving up, down, or side to side.  The lights were changing from red, blue, green, and possibly white or yellow.  The object was unlike any other thing that was in the night sky.  I looked at it through binoculars and it was still a speck in the sky, but the colors were very clear using the binoculars.  I am a police officer and work night shift and I have never seen anything like this before and I really am not a UFO believer, but this was something that I can not explain.  Also, I observed what appeared to be a similar object on the same date at 0545 hours, just before I got off of my shift, in Pigeon Forge, TN in the south eastern sky and several other Officers saw it as well.  My Sergeant said that it was a planet and that the atmosphere was making it change colors, but I have never seen a planet do that.<n>

Saw a bright light with a slight glow in the sky. Direction was SSE from my vantage point. I cannot judge the distance to the light. Thought initially it may have been a meteorite re-entering atmosphere. However, it did not move at all and there was no trail. As I drove, the light appeared to stay in same exact place. Thought could be small aircraft or helicopter, but there were no visible nav marker lights. LIght did not seem to be consistent with helicopter search lites. Light was yellow-orange. As I continued to drive home up a hill overlooking the valley, the light seemed to continue in the same spot. While hanging there, the one bright light rotated or otherwise seemed to become 3 distinguishable lights of the same color. Trying not to crash, I decided to turn around so I could drive back a few hundred yards to a spot where I could see the light(s) clearly. I pulled off onto a side street and turned around. When I! started back down the hill the light(s) were gone. As I drove around (including getting on the 520 highway), I noticed an inordinate amount of police cars(8)driving around rather quickly. I looked for another 15 minutes and did not see the lights again.<n>

It was moving slowly towards the North East.  There was no sound.  I live close to the airport and I see all types of airplanes everynight.  This did not appear to be an airplane because it just disappeared.  It did not appear to be a meteorite because it was moving too slow.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  I listen to Art Bell and I have heard about all the lights in the sky so I decided to report this. I have never reported anything before even though I have had sightings before.  6 years ago my mom and I saw a craft being chased by a military plane low over a lake close to my house.  But who do you report it too? Now, I know a place. You all.<n>

There was a deep humming sound.  It looked like two craft passed over me, but I only saw one lower itself down in a clearing.  When I reached the clearing (5 minutes later) an opening in the side of the craft was evident and something could be seen moving inside the opening.  As I tried to get closer, the opening closed and the craft suddenly lifted off and sped away.  I could follow it&#39;s path and then I saw the second craft join it and then they both headed to the east at a fast pace about like watching a jet go by.  There were no burn marks at the landing site and the next day I could not find any markings in the clearing.

We were spoting shooting stars. Identifiying satelites. Sudenly, we notice a hudge fireball about 25 degres above the horizon. It was so low we though it might have been fireworks... but then it broke in 4 pices and streked down (it must have hit the ground what ever it was) It was so fast... and traveled such a long distance in the sky. So all of our attention went towards the sky. Shortly after we all noticed what looked like 3 satelites-like in a perfect triangular position. I couldn&#39;t tell wether it was a triangular craft with three lights at each extremities or three individual things going along at the same speed in the same direction. It didn&#39;t make any noise. It traveled in the exact same direction as the fireball(what ever it was). I didn&#39;t personaly see the three stars disapeared but my friends said !Ho where did it go?!?! It kind of all of the sudden disapeared.<n>

It was about twice this size of venus is this time of year. There was something very strange about it, I felt it knew I was watching it. I am located about 7 miles north of vancouver, washington at the fairgrounds exit to the east. Thankyou, ((personal data deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 9:35pm I took my dog outside to relieve himself when a BRIGHT object caught my eye--it was in the eastern sky, not very far away from me--seemed awfully close. At first I thought it was venus, then as I focused in on it I realized that it was much larger than venus, and much closer. As I focused on it, it quickly, faster than an airplane could, turned to the southeast, and as it did so, it&#39;s size became like a pin point. The strangest part of the experience was the feeling I got from it that it was fully aware of my presence. ((personal data deleted))<n>

My family and I were just coming around the curve were rt35 conects with I70w and I saw an unusual light off to my left (sw). It appeared to be a plane at first but only one yellow/white light and no other colored blinking lights.  I noticed my wife in the passenger seat looking at it also.  About the time I was rounding the entrance ramp omto I70w, I noticed it had formed a short tail of fire or sparks.  From the direction of the tail (angled upward and to the right) it looked to be falling like a meteor, but much, much slower.  My wife and I were comenting and speculating to each other about what we were seeing, this all while I was merging into busy intersate traffic.  I continued to watch and look for a good spot to pull over at the same time.  As I continued to observe the object it did not appear to be falling! but instead the short tail slowly changed position around the ball of light, making it look like it was now spinning very slowly. The trees along the roadside made it hard to see and we lost sight of it several times, but I finally pulled over and grabbed my video camera.  As I rolled my window down and started filming, the tail was gone and it just appeared as a ball of light again.  Frustrated because I was having trouble focusing on the object, I pulled the camera down and my wife and I observed the object nearing the tree line which seemed to be several miles away.  Just before it reached the tree line the ball disappeared and a large triangle formation of orange lights appeared pointing torward the southwest.  We only saw this formation for a few seconds then it dropped beyond our view.  Setting there as the trucks rushed by discussing what we just saw, I recall seeing a second triangle fromation in front of the first pointing at the first, almost forming an x.  My wi! fe states she saw a line of lights coming from the front of the V.  Re gardless, the V formation was made up of nine lights, four on each side of the center one.  All lights appeared to be the same intensity.  We pulled of at the next exit and scanned the skys for an hour with no other sightings, other than what appeared to be a military plane circling the area.<n>

I could hear my friends talking as I stared up toward the sky, at my pole tip. Suddenly, I noticed the stars moving, I thought! I started to recieve an adreniline rush from my heart, because what I thought was moving stars turned out to be a triangular shape silently moving across the sky towards New Jersey. I froze staring at the the shape moving slowly, and I began to listen for my friends to say that they saw what I was looking at, but they didn&#39;t. I said, &#34;Oh, (S)-word.! Did yoll see that?&#34; They responded, &#34;What did you get a hit?&#34; I said,&#34; No! That UFO!&#34; They told me I was on drugs laughed and continued talking.

I looked into the sky  to check out the &#34;contrails&#34;.  There were absolutely no clouds in the sky, and only a few contrails.  Just below the contrails I noted a smoky gray cylinder floating through the sky from west to east.  It appeared to be about the same size as a 747 would appear at about 5,000 feet. It proceeded to fly directly over my home.  I noted also that it was divided into thirds by blue vertical lines.  As it went behind a tree in the yard, there was a flash of some type of energy in the middle third of the cylinder.  I then stepped to the other side of the tree to try to pick it up as it came out the other side, but it never came out.  The size of this object The object protruded about on inch when compared to my closed fist held at arms length.  There was no tail or wings and no noise of any kind.  There was also no wind that might have moved any noise away from me.  I tried to convince myself that this was just a jet liner, but I watch jets in the sky frequently and have never seen anything like this before.  I tried to blow it off but the next night objects of similar description were reported by Mr. Davenport on Coast to Coast. I wish someone else had seen it and reported.  But according to the data on your sight, they have not.  There was something very strange.  The image almost seemed to be computer animation and the flash of &#34;energy&#34; in the middle section looked just like a cartoon drawing of an explosion.<n>

When we discussed it with friends later we discovered that two others saw it at the same time, both were in their cars, both were traveling south. The object was moving in a line a bit east of directly south. It moved in a straight trajectory and did not waver from it&#39;s path. Again, it was moving *very* fast, but it was not and airplane or a meteor. It also seemed to leave a slight trail, same glowing white color as the object.

At that time some of the firelike gases thinned, and a distinct 90 % angle appeared in the light as something solid.  The other ship appeared thereafter.  I grew up between 5 airports, one was Wright Patterson.  C.A.P. during WWII taught me to notice sounds.  The sound of the second craft was different somehow.  It sounded like a recording.  It appeared suddenly, and it looked like a very, very large airplane at first.  As it went directly overhead I noticed how at different angles it could look like a disc, a cigar shape, an airplane or a triangle.  I hope to send a drawing to explain.  It appeared it was intercepting the object somehow, either by observation, escort or shooting it down.  I have more to say, but need to talk confidentally to someone who investigates phisical proof of events. There were no markings that I could see on the craft, and it had 8 unremarkable lights.  There was no head or tail to the craft.  The front and back were identical.  Neither objects left a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I have entered the date of the event for the witness.  I assume he/she is addressing the dramatic fireball reported from multiple points in California on Friday night, 03SE99.))<n>

My 23 year old daughter and I. I&#39;m a machinist, and she is a veterinary assistant. Anyway, we had stopped to get gas, and had pulled out of the station, looking for road signs to get on the interstate, when we saw a huge streak of light traveling from (at best guess)NW to SE. It actually caught our attention because of it&#39;s color, it was a beautiful greenish blue, and like I said, BIG. It was moving very fast, it didn&#39;t seem at the time to be very high up in the sky. In fact we slowed down and looked over to see if it had crashed in the wooded area to our right. A few months later I was talking to a co-worker and I mentioned it to him, and oddly enough, he had been out in his boat on Lake Greenwood at the time, and he had seen it too. Lake Greenwood is 160 or so miles from Savannah, so what we saw was either a really big UFO or an amazing meteor! I&#39;ve watched meteor showers before, and none of the ones I&#39;ve seen can compare. To give you an idea of it&#39;s size, I&#39;d say that a dime held out at arm&#39;s length would be about right.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each &#34;light&#34; was an object that seemed to strobe-first white, then red, then a green light.  They appeared in the sky one by one and had moved only fractionally during the hour and a half, in a north to south direction, perpendicular to the stars and satellites in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At midnight, my husband and I went out onto our deck as we do most nights. Our deck overlooks the city of Beckley and on out to the Raleigh County Airport at Grandview. In the northeastern sky, just above the trees, we noticed one &#34;star&#34; appeared to be blinking. My husband went back inside for the binoculars and amazingly, the &#34;star&#34; was a revolving light- first white, then green, then red, and was unmoving. We watched for about 30 minutes before noticing a smaller, but identical light farther to the east, again unmoving.  We began scanning the sky and found 3 more between lights A and B, as well as 2 lights to our southwest, that were blinking only the green and white light.   After about 1 and a half hours, the lights were obviously moving SLOWLY  perpendicular to the stars&#39; movement in the sky, and another red, green and white light appeared behind the original light.  There were no sounds and the airplanes that flew in the night appeared oblivious to the lights, as if ! the lights were above the planes, but still in our atmosphere. A little after 1:30 am, my husband and I were suffering from eye strain and a long day.  When we left the deck, the objects were still in the sky.  My husband and I are both former government employees and current real estate investors.<n>

Pretty sure they were in orbit.  1 leading, 2 following equal distances from lead in triangular form heading in a north-easterly direction.  Pretty sure they were not military aircraft as there was no un-natural lighting.  Objects kept the same distance apart until fading in the earths shadow.  Never have witnessed satelites working in threes before on the exact same course.  They were three distinct objects as we could see stars between them.  If you know what we saw I would like to here from you.<n>

This was most likely the Navy&#39;s &#34;Classic Wizard&#34; system.  You may read about it from a Russian report here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/surveill/noss_andronov.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brief description of the observation was excellent, leading to almost perfect confirmation of this being a White Cloud sighting.  Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a synopsis, the White Cloud system has been know under other names, but its salient characteristic is always three satellites moving together and visible at approximately magnitude 2.5 to 3.5 in the night sky.  The posted observation reports the satellites in triangle formation.  This should almost always be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the nature of orbital mechanics, the orbits of any two of the satellites must always intersect twice during each complete orbiting of the Earth as viewed from the ground.  The slightly elliptical orbits mean that the satellites are at slightly differing orbital altitudes during each orbital intersection.  Most of the time the White cloud formation will appear to be triangular, however it will occaisionally appear to for a very distorted triangle, or even a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that other agencies or other governments have ELINT tri-satellite systems in orbit, but the US Navy is the only agency I am aware of that uses this system in an orbital characteristic to create visible triangle formations.  By looking for electromagnetic emissions on the ocean and matching the patterns and characteristics of the emissions to a database, the satellites are able to identify with a high degree of accuracy the type of surface craft and country of origin.  Each satellite can do this, but to triangulate the exact targetting of such a vessel for an over the horizon strike, three satellites are necessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to know this from Russian publications on the web.  If the information was not available in such a format, I would not write about it here.  Even so, I prefer to remain anonymous, as the national security laws may be misused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Regards<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report, who chooses to remain totally anonymous.

Appeared to be tilted at 45 degree angle, hovering high above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving north on M-88 I saw a shiny object hovering above the trees. I pulled off the road and watched, and as it didn&#39;t seem to be moving, I decided to drive to the top of a hill for a better look, but the trees blocked my view. I continued on toward town on a back road, and was able to catch an occasional glimpse of the object. On my way back to M-88 I saw a black truck or SUV parked on the side of the road. The driver was watching the object with a telescope. I wish I had stopped to talk with this man, but I was anxious to get to town to tell my family about it, and to get them to see it also. We drove back out in the country where we had a clear view of the sky, but the object was gone. I don&#39;t know who the other witness was, but he must have had a great view with his telescope.<n>

Multiple sightings with myself and 3 different friends.  Seems to be visiting in Cycles of 3-5 days<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a twenty one year old college student with no criminal record or history of mental illness.  My other witness is 22 and does not believe in UFO&#39;s.  On thursday sept. 2, my friend and I were really bored.  We decided to take a ride in the country and cruise down the roads we hunt and fish on.  We left Galva and drove down The Lafayette Blacktop.  We crossed the road by the cemetrary there and continued on.  About a mile down the road that completely stopped our conversation.  WE saw an orange light rise from a cornfield about 20 yards away from us.  I stopped my truck and we both were watching it.  It was a real clear night.  The light appeared to rotate on some unseen object, and another one appeared in it&#39;s spot.  That onr rotated also and a third appeared.  We sat and watched.  I told my friend I think it was a UFO.  He doesn&#39;t beleve in them and didn&#39;t know what to think.  I was scared.  I wanted to turn around asnd go back to town.  He said that we should keep watching so we did.  The orange lights were nothing like I have ever seen before.  It kind of looked like a lava the way it glowed.  That is the only way I can explain the color. As we were watching, the object disappeared.  WE decided to drive along after that.  About one minute later it appeared agin and was moving south at a very slow speed.  We gave chase to it and followed down towards Walnut creek.  We saw it hovering above another corn field. We stopped my truck and rolled the windows down to sewe if We could hear it.  There was no noise except for the regular coutry noises you hear.  Anyway, the thing stared moving and disappearing and reappearing.  We chased it from Walnut Creek to Hook &amp; Bullet, Out by Williamsfield all the way back over to Oak Run.  It was like it was playing Cat and Mouse with us.  We lost the object when we got to Oak Run.  We decided to stop at the main beach and talk about what we saw. Then over the lake, the object started coming towards us at a very high rate of speed.  it stopped across the lake from us and hovered. We jumped in the truck and chased to the outskirts of Victoria where it just vanished and we didn&#39;t see it aagain.  It was around 11 PM so we went back to Galva.  I was very scared that night and so was my friend.  We only told  a couple of people that we are close friends with because we didn&#39;t want people to think we were crazy. Myself and some other friends have witnessed evets like this many times since then.  I would be happy to talk to them over the phone or through another report.<n>

And I saw floating towards me was 3 orbs.I was facing S,SW. And I thought they where baloons at first but they were floating E.-against the slight breeze and as I was watching them they formed a triangle.For a few seconds.Then 1 orb left the other 2-it went lower and the others stayed about the same height. I was still watching them through the telephoto lens(70-210mm) as they continued to move East.When I noticed that one was flashing and it looked red.It was paired with the other orb that stayed higher.As it got closer I could see it spinning and it was a cube.It had flat sides that were catching sunlight and making the flashes.And it was spinning on its diagonial-or point. I could`t tell if either orbs were spinning or not.And I kept watching them -the cube&amp;orb seemed to be heading slowly away from me going S. The closer orb kept heading slowly E and it came up again in height but still lower than the other two. And then I hear a prop-plane coming towards me and between me and the &#34;objects&#34;. The plane was heading Westward and when it got about to the end of my backyard it turned around and seemed to want a closer look at the orbs/objects!!The plane never did come W again. I lost where it went because I was watching the orbs/objects until they faded out of sight- towards the South. I have some 35mm photos and negitives if you want them. I have a scanner but I haven`t learned how to send photos yet. And I wanted to see the photos before I made a report.<n>

I&#39;ve never ran outside before because I&#39;m a sleepy head, but this time I lied there awhile listening and thought something was hovering over my condo because the field was so strong. Then I ran out side and saw nothing, but my field of view is small due to other buildings. By the time I got back inside my meter was quite. I had a major sighting of a ufo in 1975 , thats the reason I now always sleep with a magnetic meter.<n>

We did not see any of the lights you were talking about but decided this info. might be useful for tracking or coroboration.  This occurred shortly before 1am CDT.  Art Bell began mentioning these events in the first hour of his program (12 mid night to 1 am). I work about 1/4 mile from the end of the runway so am very familiar with the noise of departing commercial and military jets.  We were inside the warehouse where we work late when we were actually stunned by the sudden jet noise. The first instinct was to duck for cover.  We ran outside and watched one F15 making a near vertical departure in an easterly direction followed closely by a second.  Their lights disapeared from sight in only a few seconds such was their acceleration.  This was a HOT takeoff. This is NOT normal even for military jet jockies in this commercial air space.  We think this was a &#34;scramble&#34;. If this was unrelated to what you were reporting on the Art Bell show it was coincidental enough to make the hair on my neck stand up.<n>

We decided to check a favourite meeting spot. It is a cliff that overlooks the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. The area is isolated and high up from city lights so visiblility of the night sky is fairly good. As soon as our eyes became adjusted after exiting the car to look for our friends, my attention was diverted to the sky where I glimpsed a red streak of light travel south-easterly extremely rapidly. The streak of light was very long in covering a distance approximately a quarter of the night sky. The streak of light was not large in length. After the streak had dissapeared, subsequent differently coloured streaks were observed travelling in a similar direction but originating in a position west of the original streak. We thought that our eyes were decieving us until I heard the reports on Art Bell&#39;s ra! dio program. Brilliant show! The streaks and the radio program!<n>

It could not have been personal aircrafts or commercial aircrafts flying so close together. It is not normal to see military aircraft in our area, and myself and my neighbors were wondering why they were out flying in formation. Could they have been patrolling the area after the reported sightings tonight? I hope one of Art&#39;s listeners comes foward with video of this object.

They appeared to be in a tight triangular formation separted by about a half of a finger lenghth.  They remained in my view for approx 30 seconds or so.  What is the most amazing thing about this sighting is that when I went to work the following day I told my friend about this sighting and he told me that both him and his wife observed the exact same thing two years ago while camping on the Naches river in Washington state.  However, he also told me that they were traveling from the southwest to the northeast, exactly 180 degrees the opposite direction.<n>

Facing SW just under and slightly to the right of the constellation Sagittarius at about 45 degrees. It wasn&#39;t shooting as fast as meteorites I have seen and it was wider then tails I&#39;ve seen and definately orange from tip to tip. It was 6&#34; at arms length. It was a ball type front that didn&#39;t taper down to the tail. I am searching the skys all the time and never saw anything like this.

We arrived there about 9:45pm and were sittin on my friends car, for like 5-10 minutes. I was starin at an orange glowing light. Didn&#39;t say anything  until my friend yelled &#34;Look at that&#34; it was another orange light, but this one was coming toward us to the north, Then suddenly changed to the east. While starin at the object in the east another object same as the other 2 appeard in the north. Now with 1 in the North , one in the west and one in the east we started to get nervous and excited. While tryin not to  panic we were all tryin to make sure we diddn&#39;t take our eyes off any of them. Then all of a sudden the object in the North had 2 non-blinking lights appear above it, and joined with the big one( transformed!). After we saw that and almost all had heart attacks, we left the hill and proceeded to drive west on another backroad west of Deer Lake. Whereever we w! ent 1 to 2 objects seemed to follow us and appear ahead of us , then disapear, then circle us.  The closest the object got from us  was about 100 to 150 yards above us, the whole time we never heard a single sound! 45 minutes to an hour after being followed we took a road about 2-3 miles east of Auburn, right off route 895. After realizing all the objects had suddenly disappeared,we were all completely silent -when all of a sudden our lights  on our car turned off, then on, then off. It was in a certain pattern I will never forget, and also the dash lights went off as well as the headlights, but the car kept on running. That is all I can reveal at this time. More information is classified by a tight group of friends!!!!  We are all 18 years old and were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs.<n>

We were having a beer and discussing UFO&#39;s, which I had brought up because of my interest in the issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman said that they see stuff (UFO&#39;s) all the time out in this rural area of Nenana. I asked him what all has he seen and stated that I have always been interested in viewing a siting but had not been really fortunate enough to view anything distinct. He stated that all we had to do was watch the sky outside his home and we would likely see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stepped outside to prove this and as I was waiting I asked him what he had seen. He said just look up and watch the stars very closely. I said are you sure it&#39;s not a satelite because they look like stars and move steadily across the sky.  He said just watch when you find one.  So I watched, and I almost instantly saw a star moving slowly across the sky. I said &#34;Well thats a satelite.&#34; He said just watch. As I was watching this star, which looked like any other star but moving like a satalite, it stopped and changed direction. It was stopped for about 5 seconds and started back in the other direction it had come, I was startled, because I thought that satelites were in orbit and they cannot move in the opposite direction back to where they had come and planes cannot just stop and change direction. The object had moved about an inch in my view then returned and stopped. I then viewed, as it was returning, another about an inch from the first star or UFO doing the same thing. I noticed it moved about the same distance and then returned to where I first viewed it. As I was watching in absolute awe I started to notice others moving and right after I started spoting all of them I saw one of them shoot like a shooting star with a short trail unlike other shooting stars I had seen before which had long trails mostly. Nevertheless it was very much like a shooting star. It could have been one but the other things continued to move about in different direction stopping and changing directions. The getleman who showed me this stated that you view this pretty much every night anytime. I have not visited since but I would be curious if someone could bring out a telescope and view these things up close. This is near a base called Clear Airforce base. I have traveled through Nenana to get to Anchorage and have never seen an entrance to this base. It is there though because my cousin lives near it and my phone bill says her phone number is at Clear Air Force base area.<n>

Saw something again tonite--was not Venus or swamp gas; but I suppose it may have been highly unusual meteor breaking up or space junk re-entering. Was driving westbound on I-80 earlier tonite; on the way back from Lake Tahoe; where I do field studies in hydrology.  About 15 miles West of Donner Summit, at about 9:40 PM; I noticed what I thought was an unusual red airplane light directly in front of me; moving from Northwest to Southeast.  I kept one eye on it (the other on the road, as I was driving on the highway at 60mph), and I was able to distinguish 5-7 distinct large red lights (of various relative sizes) all moving together at about the same constant velocity (speed and direction).  Following and centered behind the leading and largest red light was a long, broad, dense shower of reddish &#34;sparks&#34; or &#34;sparklers&#34;--very dramatic and beautiful!  I quickly pulled off an exit to watch it as it moved overhead to the East; but lost sight of it behind a steep hill (or mountain) directly in front of the object.  I had very good viewing conditions; as I was at about 5000-6000 foot elevation in the Sierras, and had a clean ! windshield.  Wish I wasn&#39;t driving; so I could have gotton my binoculars!<n>

After hearing Ron (sic) Davenport this afternoon, on the local radio station in Nevada City, CA (KVMR-FM), I decided to give my account of the sighting on 01 Sept 99.  Being fairly isolated up on this mountain, I had been wondering if anyone else saw what I saw that evening in the northern sky.  Here&#39;s the account, word for word, that I wrote the morning of 03 Sept 99 in my journal.  Having heard the show, I now think my timing is off for the duration of the event.....having believed it was a group of meteorites when I wrote the following, and couldn&#39;t imagine such an event taking longer than 12-14 seconds to traverse that expanse of the horizon.  It&#39;s easy to lose an accurate sense of time at moments like this. Written on Friday morning, 03 Sept 99 &#34;It was one of two things.  I convinced myself they were probably man-made, but now I suspect otherwise.  Around 9:30 p.m., after the Drew Carey Show, I went out to ((deleted)) for a change.  Looking up in the NNW sky, just below the Big Dipper, marched a gang of light trails headed eastward.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing at first.....one of those wonderful all-too-rare gapes.  (I think it may have something to do with the surprise of finding myself at the right place - at the right time.  Sad, that.) The motion was steady, but  slower than most, if not all, meteorites I&#39;ve seen before....and so many all together at once.  At least eight, four in the front group, were visible during the last couple of seconds, which I viewed with the  binocs.  I wanted to dash for them sooner, but stood transfixed, unwilling to take my eyes off something so amazing for the first 8-10 seconds.  As they seemed to head toward Reno, I took a chance, got the binocs, and watched them &#39;flame-out&#39; one by one.  It&#39;s through the binocs that I counted the eight.....there could have been a couple more in the progression, earlier. The duration caused me to suspect military craft of some sort, that didn&#39;t want to be seen as they approached Reno, so perhaps they cut their engines one by one and flew in a slightly disarrayed order to throw off any observers, and glided back to some secret place in the Nevada desert.  But if they were aircraft, they moved fast, albeit subsonic, and the lit-up trails of gas are something I&#39;ve never seen before at night.  Could the smoke particles that have been lingering for over a week cause that? Went out again the next night (02Sept99), and noticed another meteorite lower to the horizon, redder, a little faster and only a few seconds in duration.....but definitely a meteorite.  So I&#39;ve changed my mind....from a conspiricy of craft, to a cluster of rocks....maybe billions of years old, coming into land. So incredibly better than a movie.&#34; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A couple of notes in retrospect......using the Osborne Firefinder (using true N), I later approximated the portion of the horizon from when I first noticed the objects, to the time of &#39;flame out&#39;, to go from ~330° to ~80° from my position, or about a 110° span.  A very rough guess, but they seemed to be approximately 7° vertical from the mountaintop when due N. The mention of smoke above refers to the large fires that had been raging on the Plumas N.F. for the prior week.  I thought perhaps some of the particles might have scattered higher into the atmosphere and caused the light trails, but evidently not if others saw the trails prior to the objects reaching the Sierras.  I believe the trails were rather greenish in color, though I&#39;m not sure I trust my hindsight on that. I now believe the duration of the sighting was probably closer to 30 seconds, but still don&#39;t quite understand what I was looking at.  Were all those objects with light trails, F-15&#39;s with afterburners on, as was mentioned in the radio show?  Were there really at least eight of them?  In any case, it still gives me goosebumps when I recall the amazement of the moment.  Now if I can only figure out how to be in the right-place-at-the-right-time more often.......…<n>

At approximately 9:45, I overheard two employees talking about, &#34;the strangest thing I have ever seen.&#34; They related the story to me. Looking due west, towards the eugene airport, they saw a white light travelling in the sky, &#34;at the pace of a usual airliner,&#34; traveling from northwest to southeast. While it was the same speed of usuall aircraft,it just looked like a fuzzy light object. It continued to travel south, then developed a red streak behind it (did not mention if it was fire or anything) traveled for a few seconds, then burst into a large fireball. (I asked him if he was exagerating, and he said no, &#34;A real fireball.) THen the white object took off at an incredible rate, Southeast, then dissapeared. We talked about it around 9:45 to 9:50. This is my first time reporting anything like UFO&#39;s or stuff, but my buddies saw it, was amazed, and was confirmed by another forklift loader on a seperate end of the building.<n>

They were not airplanes.  They had no flashing lights.  They were a white, cloudy color--round/oval in shape, with long comet-like tails. They were close to each other and moving in perfect unison.  We observed their movement for approximately 7 seconds, before they &#34;disappeared into thin air!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer who has stargazed in the past from this location (the back deck of my best friends house in Marin Country).  She lives on a hill with a fabulous view all the way to the East Bay.  We went out to the deck around 9:15 p.m. after I commented on &#34;what a beautiful and clear night it was!&#34; My friend turned out the patio lights and indoor lights near the deck so we could better observe the stars. It took about 15 minutes before my eyes adjusted to the darkness.  I was standing,  facing  east when something caught my eye up in the sky to the northeast.  I saw what looked like 3 moving clouds--I stared very closely and quickly observed that these WERE NOT CLOUDS.  They were moving objects that I could not identify or had ever seen before in my life.  I turned to my friend and asked her &#34;do you see what I see over there?&#34;  She looked where I pointed in the sky and immediately replied &#34;YES YES--I see them too!&#34;  We could NOT believe our eyes!  Thank God we were together when we observed these objects! We watched in silence until they disappeared from view.  Then we took turns describing to each other what we had just seen, and found that our sightings had been identical.  We both saw 3 white, cloudy, round/oval shaped objects with long, comet-type tails.  We both remarked at their &#34;exact synchronized movement&#34; travleling in the same direction. My friend and I are &#34;best friends&#34;  and we both are psychic people, especially with each other.  We thought it was incredible that this was our first ever UFO sighting, andthat we had been together when we witnessed it!   We continued to scan the sky for several minutes but did not see them again.  I did see airplanes in the area both before and after the sighting.  I&#39;m certain that the time was around 9:30 p.m. because when we went indoors to check the time, it was 9:35 p.m. On my drive home to Sonoma, I listened to Art Bell&#39;s &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; Radio show.  By coincidence (or synchronicity?), he had Peter Davenport on the air! They had received several calls from people on the west coast reporting mysterious sightings.  One caller was from Novato, CA -- which is just a few minutes/miles from where my friend lives!  I called the show and was surprised that I got on the air--where I gave Art a summary of my sighting! I would like to emphasize that I stargaze almost every night--from different locations.  I know a star from a planet from a meteor, comet, etc.  I am also very familiar with the flight paths of aircraft in these locations.  THIS WAS NO AIRPLANE!  THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS!  NO SOUND!  Their &#34;tails&#34; were long and came to a point.   A &#34;tadpole&#34; is the closest description I can give you of its overall shape.<n>

We agreed that it looked much like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wednesday, September 1, 1999 at approximately 9:30 p.m., my husband and I were traveling eastbound on hwy. 37 in Marin County, Ca.  The location was approximately 1.5 miles from the Black Point/Atherton exit.  We saw in the sky directly above our car what looked like three long, thick, fingers of light traveling at a very slow speed, they looked very much like super high beam headlights shining through a thick fog, (there was no fog that night).  We continued to watch this light show while we looked for a place to pull over on the highway.  As the lights crossed directly over hwy. 37, we saw what looked like a small missile, or shooting star, shot off the side into an easternly direction.  The lights looked as if they had come from a north/west direction, and they were crossing over hwy. 37 in a south/east direction.  At the time of observation, my mouth filled with the taste of having bit down on aluminum foil on a tooth filling.  I had the sensation of metal emitting from an upper back crown in my mouth.  This taste stayed with me for approx. 10 minutes after the viewing.  The next morning I woke up with the insides of my lips feeling sunburned. When we arrived home (which is 1 mile north off of hwy. 37) our 12 year old daughter told us that she had been sound asleep and was woken by the popping sounds of the vertebra in her neck, her mouth was filled with a &#34;bad taste, like a burning taste&#34;.  At this point she looked up through her bed side window and saw bars of bright light going over our house.  She remembers that her bed side clock read 9:30.  The three of us felt exhausted the next day.  We all sensed that what we saw was some kind of pre-empt of something much larger to come.  When my husband and I pulled off the freeway to view the lights more clearly, they continued to move slowly for a few seconds, and then completely disappeared, one second they were there in front of us, the next, they were gone.  We sat there for several minutes in a very stunned mode. I am a 43 yr. old mother of two small daughters, aged 12 and 8.  I am currently working on a project in conjunction with the Institute of Noetic Sciences, called the Future Generations Initiative.  This Initiative is working toward bringing together like minded efforts that are working to raise the consciousness of our youth so that they may be more prepared to face the challenges that we leave them.  I am working closely with the Institute, as well as with members of the State of the World Forum.  My husband, age 46, is the co-owner of the largest privately owned home improvement corporation in the nation.  Our daughter, age 12, is a student of Waldorf Education, a bright and loving girl, musically inclined.<n>

It was also observed by 4 friends of mine who were houseboating with me at Lake Trinity, which is aprox. 30 miles north of Redding, CA.  My friends and I were sitting outside, on the lake when one of them noticed a very bright red ball of light moving very slowly across the sky.  We quickly turned out all the lights to get a better look.  The red ball of light apeared to be very low in the sky.  It was moving in a West to East direction.  At first, it looked a bit bigger than the largest star in the sky.  As it traveled, it got somewhat larger.  Trailing behind it was a smaller bright white light which looked like a star at first, but it was travelling at the exact same speed and exatly the same length behind the red ball of light throughout our sighting.  After about 20 seconds the red ball began to split and turn a brilliant orange color.  It left a trail of orange pieces that continued to follow the main body of light. There were between 4 and 6 of these &#34;tails&#34; following the main body of light.  We watched this for aprox. another miniute to a minuite and a half.  It never burned out, but rather disapeared behind the mountains to the East of out boat.  It was moving very low and too slow to be a meteor.  When we saw this, we had just finished cleaning up after diner and were not drinking at the time.  None of us have ever seen anything like it.  We are all college graduates in out late 20&#39;s.  We are a close group of friends who spend our vacation together on our anual houseboating trip.  I have a degree in Biological Science and I cannot explain what I saw that night.<n>

I was under the influence of marijuana and kava kava and most of my companions were also intoxicated.  What I remember seeing was a series of small lights (colors?) equally spaced and traveling at the same speed.  There was a red trail behind each light with each trail ending just before the next light.  They were moving much slower, and lasted much longer than any meteor I have seen. I heard several other people at the event talking about the lights that night so there were probably a few hundred witnesses.<n>

As it was clear the object did have a surface mass he described it as a triangle or perhaps a &#39;flying wing. he noticed a trail, or something, coming off of this object he referred to as &#39;stardust&#39;, as the tail of a comet may look.  At first he thought it must be coming off the exhaust, which he realized was extremely odd. In trying to gain a better view he almost drove off the road so he stopped and rolled down his passenger window and looked out.  This is the secondary witness of this sighting, as reported in another database file.

Immediately, we both spotted four objects in the sky. The &#34;head&#34; of the objects were glowing, unsure of the color but I remember bluish/green and my girlfriend recalls at least one turning a reddish color. The objects seemed to be at a low altitude, but I&#39;m not sure because I can&#39;t confirm how large the objects were. (MUCH bigger than a star....maybe 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon? I couldn&#39;t hear any sound, but the objects moved very slowly. They were midway across the sky when we first observed them, and they remained visible for about 20 seconds before passing out of our line of sight.  The first three objects were close together, almost in a formation, while the fourth was slightly behind and off center. They left a short smoky trail behind them, easily visible in the dark night sky. We&#39;ve both seen many meteors, and this didn&#39;t conform with anything we&#39;ve seen befor! e. Our first reaction was, &#34;What is that?&#34; The slow speed seemed to rule out a meteor or &#34;shooting star&#34; as did the strange color and the misty trail behind them. One final note, all the objects seemed to be travelling at the same rate of speed.<n>

I was cruising at an altitude of 16,500 feet traveling over the northern sierra mountains at 9:20 to 9:30pm. (by the way, on landing, I heard a report on the local Reno radio station, KKOH, that all the electricity is out in the cities of Carson City, Minden and Gardnerville Nevada.) I was flying from San Diego to Quincy California level at 16,500 feet, in the dark.  I had just made a turn northward from over Beal Air force base, (where the SR-71 is based) on a magnetic heading of 356 degrees, or almost north.  I looked up and from about eleven o&#39;clock above me I was surprised by a half a dozen objects coming toward me.  My first thought was that it was a huge meteor but there were multiple objects, they appeared to be traveling much more slowly than any meteor and they appeared to be in formation.  I then thought &#34;is this what a U F O sighting looks like?&#34; As the group of objects passed slowly, almost &#34;drifting&#34; past my windshield higher than my aircraft, I could see flames coming from each object and a comet-like tail behind each object.  My next thought was that it might be a huge aircraft breaking up, some objects were long like a wing or odd shapes. However, it was not descending, but rather was moving straight and slowly across the sky almost appearing to be level.  It had the appearance of flaming, huge objects, in formation, or in a group.  There was one large object following the group somewhat behind the others.  I thought it might be space debri but they all appeared too large and too many. The group moved slowly from front left to right over at least a minute to a minute and a half time.  I had time to turn down all the radio and instrument lights in my cockpit, watched the objects and turned right to attempt to follow them.  I followed them at 200 knots. They continued south-southeast bound, toward southern California. I have never seen anything like this in over thirty years of my flying career.

I expected the meteor to disintigrate, as most do after they fall to the earth, but as it approached zenith, the object began to have a  glowing white trail after it, so I assumed it was a fighter jet, but the object made no sound like a jet and made no jet trail. A little past zenith, in the eastern part of the sky the object began to slow down and without any indication, the object split into four separate parts, a bright, large portion that continued on the original path of northwest to southeast, and three smaller pieces that went northeast, northwest and southeast. The smaller pieces from the object were just like the original, except they were smaller and they were yellow instead of gold. Almost immediately after ejecting the ! three smaller objects, the large one vanished, then the other three objects vanished a half second later. The object, which became three seperate, but similar objects was visible in the sky for about a minute, and after it was over I finished drinking my coke and went inside my home.  I thought nothing else about this event until two days later on September 3 when my father mentioned an object had been seen on Wednesday and had been talked about on Art Bell&#39;s program, something I&#39;d not heard that night. I told him the story and it turned out that I had seen the object which had been reported.<n>

One of the objects trailed off behind, while the other 6-7 continued beyond the horizon toward the east. They appeared to be a cluster of comets, that travled at exactly the same rate of speed. Their sizes varied (sm-lg) but all of them had &#34;tails&#34; behind them. They did not fall, like a meteor,or falling star, they instead were &#34;traveling&#34; apparently powered by some source. In other words, they did not loose speed as they traveled, but continued in their astonishing fast and silent flight.

They sounded like they were headed in a southerly direction. When things are that low you can tell.

how can i be seeing smoke in  the night sky?&#34; the moon was due to rise shortly thereafter, so it may have  been illuminated by the not-yet-seen moon. it sort of looked like the smoke  coming out of old coal trains, only not nearly as thick or opaque. very  subtle. and then it was gone. over the mountains. i never saw a deviation in  directon, or any other lights etc coming to meet it or break away, other  than what i am pretty sure to be a faint shooting star that happened to  cross right through the heart of this thing/things, about 3/4 thru my time  of observation. there did seem to be one chunk that dropped quickly away  from the others at about the same time, but i wouldn&#39;t swear on that. there was no sound whatsoever. this WAS NOT a meteorite. and in my opinion, it was going too slow and  covered too much distance to really be some sort of booster rocket, the more  i think about it. it really had about the same relative speed, if not  slower, as a satellite seen in the sky right after sunset. to me it seemed  to be powered, given the length and distance of my observation. i would  think something such as a booster casing re-entering orbit would die out  much faster, and be coming in at a much sharper angle. this seemed to have a  constant altitude to me, although how high i couldn&#39;t even guess. it seemed  low enough and slow enough to not be really burned by atmospheric friction,  in which case it must have been powered in some way to maintain its  altitude, yet on the other hand, it seemed very high up and thus moving at a  greater speed, but i would think if that were the case, there would be one  of those atmospheric pressure waves or whatever they are called leading it,  like i have seen when the shuttles re-enter orbit. i just remembered one of the theories i head around BRC the next night... a  hacker was bringing down satellites, one by one. if it was man-made, my  guess would be a satellite, not a booster rocket, unless it was one that had  been caught in a semi-stable orbit for some time and was taking it&#39;s own  damn sweet time coming back down. maybe iridium investors doing some  insurance fraud? all in all, it was absolutely amazing. and what fuels my suspicions more  than anything is the fact that i haven&#39;t heard any &#34;official&#34; explanation  anywhere about it. i would think that something so spectacular and witnessed  by so many people would have quite a few news stories or talking heads or  scientists or nasa geeks or SOMEBODY talking about it. c&#39;mon, at least give  us a good cover-up story! and that&#39;s all i have to say. bug - denver, colorado<n>

I followed it because it was such a bright object.  While I watched, the fireball grew bigger, then faded to a long flat object with what looked like wings projecting from the top and bottom, like it was a very long tube like airplane on its side.  As I was watching it move from west to east, I spotted what looked like a smaller large object move in the same direction, parallel with the large object, but lower in the sky, making it seem to be a great distance away.  The first large object seemed to grow larger in size as it moved seemingly farther away.  the second object continued to track the first.  As I was standing in the middle of the street, there were trees in the area and I lost the object behind trees that were too numerous for me to track on.  By the time I got to an area where I could see more sky, all objects were gone.  This was no more than about 1/2 block and took place over about 30 seconds I believe.  I was entranced, unable to believe what I saw, I almost pooh-poohed it but continued to watch and could not believe what I saw.  I finally realized that it could not be a meteor as it was moving too slow for that.  I am an elementary teacher in the coos bay school system and have been interested in these type of sightings for many years, but this is the first one I have  personally seen.  I was amazed and absolutely thrilled to have seen something out of the ordinary.  I sent an e-mail to KVAL-tv that night and never got a reply but did hear something on the 11:00 news that stated that it was a russian space object.  I forgot about it until I heard a broadcast on KWRO-am radio at approximately 10:15 on September 16th.<n>

This object was completely silent, massive and solid in its structure, as the star fields behind it became blocked as it moved along in a slow controlled trajectory. It was 2-3 times the size of a C-5 and it emitted an uncanny &#39;flame&#39;, which was iridescent blue in color, stretched out aprox. 200&#39;, and had a sparkly transparency to it. Flame was a term used by him for lack of a better explanation, however he was adamant that this was highly unusual in it appearance, and how it trailed behind the object. Witnesse&#39;s mother is vague in her seeing the last few seconds of this, so a strong unrelated secondary witness was found. I believe this to be a very significant event in the September 1st wave.  Full detailed report to be found at http://psi-app.com/SeptSightingA.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eyewitness was a 13 year old boy, whom drew a sketch of the object.  Mother witnessed last few seconds of this event.  Subsequently an article was ran in our local paper and a very strong unrelated secondary witness came forward.  This witness just happens to be a news paper reporter for another paper.  A full detailed report, with sketch, news article, and other witnesses report can be viewed at http://((URL deleted))<n>

The sighting took place in the late evening when it was completely dark and the sky was clear and full of stars.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed movement in the sky from the north moving to the south.  When I looked closer, however, it wasn’t an object that I was seeing move, rather it was the disappearance and reappearance of stars behind an object.  The object itself was black or invisible with no lights.  Given the area of stars that were blocked out, I would say the object was five times larger than a jet.  It was completely silent.  It was shaped like a boomerang only a little more rounded in front rather than triangle and a slightly sharper points on the “wing” tips.  Since the object was invisible, I can only suggest the shape based on the black area absent of stars like a silhouette as it moved across the sky.  If the object was indeed five times the size of a jet and flying at about the attitude of a jet, then it was moving much faster than a jet.  I blinked a couple times, looked away and looked back, and then followed the object across the remainder of the horizon until it was out of sight.  In all it took about 8-10 seconds to span the sky and flew at the same altitude the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the triangular shape, I suppose it could have been a low-flying Stealth Bomber that just appeared much larger if flying low.  But is a Stealth completely silent?  Also, Stealth Bombers have three triangles pointing backwards from the mid section.  The object I saw did not seem to have any mid section as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I dont know any other way to contact you regarding this, so if you could please contact me some way, either through the mail or through e-mail i can give you more information concerning the military&#39;s role in this event.  Unfortanatly the info I have is from my experience in the Air Force during the years of &#39;88 to &#39;92.  I was stationed at Soesterberg Air Base in Holland with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron.  We flew F-15&#39;s out of our base in a continuous joint mission with various foriegn Air Force units from England, Germany, Holland, Italy, and many other.  I can truthfully tell you that if you ask ANY Air Force personnel who is the best intercept squadron in the U.S.A.F. they will ALL tell you it is the First Flight Squadron out of Langley, VA.  Please contact me regarding these outright lies that the military is expecting you to accept.  I have had enough of the military lies to the civilian population concerning anything.  I am willing to relate to you any and all information that I can concerning military procedures and practicies as long as they don&#39;t pertain to National Security (of course), and since the miltary has said that U.F.O.&#39;s are NOT a matter of National Security, that leaves me quite a bit of leeway.  Please contact me as soon as possible.  Thank you<n>

Went to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After picking up 2 tons of hay at a farm south of Mica mountain we started home. It must have been between 8 nd 8:30pm. While driving down farm roads (no street lights or house light) we spotted a bright light in the sky. It was at about 45 degrees off the horizon. I don&#39;t know the directions as the roads turn around the mountain. It appeared to be a bright white light with fuzzy edges, as though light was escaping around it. It moved too slow to me a metor and too fast to be a plane. My friend said do you see that light and I said Yes, He said it&#39;s probably a meteor and I said no it&#39;s moving too slow. By the end of our conversation the object decended from the sky behind some tall pine trees (I could see the shadow) and to the ground or a valley below. I could not see where it ended up. There was no explosion and no sound. I looked in the newspaper and watched tv to see if there was a plane crash and there was none.<n>

He said they were as high as the planes usually fly and did not appear to be coming down but kept flying at the same altitude the whole time he could see them.<n>

I saw lots of satelites and I also saw what I at first thought was a meteor shower. Tracking these meteors I could see however that they were changing direction at 45 degree angles. Meteors don&#39;t do that do they?<n> <n><n> <n><n> To pick up on what I said above I went back to my hotel room and poked my head outside to see if these &#34;meteors&#34; were still coming down. I saw one that was especially brilliant and looked to be 3 separate lights in triangle formation but moving very fast at a very high altitude. The lights went from east to west and veered sharply at about 45d ascension. By veered I mean the lights changed to a new straight line direction virtually instantaneously. I have never seen anything behave like this before and am curious whether meteors or any man made craft is capable of behaving in this manner. I went outside again hoping to see more but with no luck. This may or may not be significant but the west side of the island where these objects appeared to change direction is the Barking Sands Pacific Missle Range Facility. So this phenomenon could be explained as some military activity. I don&#39;t know. Please do not use my email address or name. Thank You.<n>

It was seen in the southern sky flying west to east faster than commercial aircraft are normally observed in this same area. The object flew perfectly straight and then suddenly and with incredible speed made a wide right turn to the southeast and increased altitude until it disappeared into the very high clouds. A commerial aircraft flew over from east to west a minute or so later and was much slower and lower than the object.(it is very common to see commercial aircraft in this area flying in both directions-we are located between St Louis and KC airports-aircraft are near cruising altitude/speed as they fly over us). I am a police officer with 15 years experience and often look at the sky and the aircraft that fly over as I relax in the evening.

At the stop light we observed, in the northwest sky a very bright white light that was rectangular in shape, heading in a westerly direction.  It was observed between one power line and it approximately filled that space. The lenght was approximately three to four times the width.  It did not appear to be moving but instead the rotation of the earth covered it with a small dark cloud for about 8 to 10 seconds, and then as the earth continued to move it went behind the mountain.  The sky had dark small clouds and the sun was not shinning.  Where there were no clouds the sky was a dull bluish gray.  The front of the object appeared to be flat and as we looked towards the end of the object the bright white grew fainter and the end looked some what like a thinning tail.  It&#39;s trajectory appeared to be flat and parelell with the earth.  The overall size of the object was about one third of a full moon.  Ini! tially, we thought it was a contrail, however, the size was too large, it was too bright a white, and it did not dissapate.<n>

I cannot remember the exact date of my sighting; however I know that it was Fall because it was football season. I was sitting in the bleachers before the start of a football game.  There was one set of bleachers that faced the football field, and behind the football field was a forest.  It was early evening, and there was still plenty of sunlight, not a cloud in the sky.  Out of nowhere a greenish ball of bright light appeared just above the tree line and was perfectly still. It was a solid light, not blinking or anything.  After approx. 10–15 seconds, the ball of light shot off to the right faster than I have ever seen anything move.  It moved faster than anything man made could even come close to matching.  From time to time I still talk about it with other former classmates who also witnessed it.  It is my one and only encounter, and I have never formally reported it.  It is something I will never forget and I can still picture it in vivid detail.<n>

It\&#39;s the first and last time I\&#39;ve ever seen a UFO.  I was at the Cleveland National Air Show, and even though I\&#39;m not sure of the exact date, I KNOW it was Labor Day weekend.  It was the last time the B-2 Bomber (awesome!) did a fly-by here, which I feel could be a key to this incident.  The incident occurred early in the show when the Golden Knights were enroute for their act.  I distinctly remember watching their plane slowly zigzagging at 9 o\&#39;clock to reach the proper height for their jump.  It was a perfectly clear, warm sunny day, without a cloud in the sky ANYWHERE, which I found amazing in itself!  (Being in Cleveland, totally clear weather seldom occurs).  For some reason I looked straight up at 12 o\&#39;clock and saw a clear grouping of 6-7 white orbs close to each other but not in a specific pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was seven because I remember thinking it was an odd number.  I was with my ex-husband at the time and because it was early in the show, there wasn\&#39;t anyone else sitting close to us (it figures). We were not on the main grounds of the show but at a nearby outdoor restaurant upper deck.  This sighting was NOT clouds!!!  I called my husband\&#39;s attention to it at the time, and he was kind of freaked out and admitted he thought it was a UFO.  This was a macho man whose middle name is \&#34;denial.\&#34;  He didn&#39;t want to talk about it afterwords.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, all they did was hover for about 30 minutes more or less and I remember watching them slowly fade into nothing.  There was no sharp movement or changing colors, etc.  I did not see them around for the B-2 flyby, however, which was about 2 hours later.  That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I get up very early to go to work. Just a few days ago as I was leaving my trailer, I noticed a strange light coming from the field across the road. I thought it was a big truck, or something but I soon realized it was not. It was a strange object that just glowed and moved around the edge of the woods. Now I have never seen anything like this before, and I had always hoped that I would, but dang if I didn&#39;t nearly go in my pants when that thing started moving toward my trailer. It hovered over head for about 3 minutes, changing colors every few seconds. I can tell you it made no sound, but I could feel the heat coming off that thing. I just stood there, scared to death! Suddenly there was no light, and it looked to be metallic and about 35 feet across. I am not sure what color, because It was so bright before my eyes could not adjust. It shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. I nearly passed out. I could not even go into work that day. All I could do was sit on the couch and shotgun budweisers till I passed out. I still get scared when I think of what happened. I am really scared it might come back. I have had the runs ever since I saw it. Do you suppose I was abducted? I need some help! I had to tell somebody, but I have been too scared. I have not been sleeping, or eating, or living since that morning. I am sure with time, I will adjust. Thanks for listening. ((name deleted))<n>

Aprx 4:30am EDT.  Stargazing several miles west of Wadsworth, OH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve read and heard about sightings for years, and now, a first for me, I can&#39;t say it was an &#39;IFO&#39;, so that leaves this as a &#39;UFO&#39; for me. I was stargazing with my friend, early Wednesday morning, Sep 1st. At one point while I was walking from my car to the telescope, I noticed low, in the eastern horizon, a rather large bright orange ball of light (like a street lamp in color). At first, I thought it might be an airplane or helicopter &#39;headlight&#39;. But orange?  Quickly, I grabbed and aimed the telescope at the object, which appeared not to be moving. Looking into the eyepiece revealed 2 orange balls of light, one slightly larger than the other. Then all of a sudden, while I&#39;m looking at these lights through the telescope, they &#39;turn off&#39;!  It&#39;s gone.  There&#39;s nothing there.  If it was an airplane or helicopter, where are the other &#39;marking&#39; or tail lights? While my friend thinks it may have been an airplane or helicopter, he couldn&#39;t say what it was. Did anyone else see this around here?<n>

It was my freshman year in college and I went to play some &#34;midnight&#34; basketball with some friends.  The basketball courts where we were had enough lights for us to play.  We were playing a full court game, when all of a sudden everyone playing basketball stopped and looked at the night sky.  We saw a white tiny light.  At first I thought it was a shooting start, but as it was soaring though the sky it stopped for a couple seconds, moved from left to right, and then shot right back from where it started and then disappeared.  Someone stated that it may have been a satellite, but whatever it was, it scared the shit out of us cause we took off running back to the dorms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
