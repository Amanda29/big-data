It was a cold, clear, crisp night with very little cloud cover.  The only clouds I remember were high altitude wispy clouds sparsely scattered.  There was light enough from the moon to be able to walk in the field without worry of stumbling or getting hurt tripping over things.  It was late November I remember but cant be sure exactly of the date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were far enough away from town so we didn&#39;t have any light pollution.  The sky was amazing that night for skywatching.  To the northwest we could see the grand island airport tower light rotating from blue to white as it spun.  From our position I observed a craft that had red and white running lights.  It hovered like a helicopter and must have been between 10 to 20 miles to our north and perhaps at a 45 degree angle from us.  It hovered and moved similar to a helicopter for a minute or so.  It stopped moving and started to change colors.  It turned from blinking red and white to solid blue then purple to red then blue.  It was very bright like strobes.  I knew by the way the colors shifted that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or other aircraft that could be in our area.  It was too far away to make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned solid bright white and started to make perfect horizontal patterns across the sky at extremely high speeds. It traveled almost three quarters of the horizon in less than a second and did this at least eight times .  When it stopped to travel the opposite direction it did so abruptly without delay .  When it finished its horizontal travel it hovered in the general area of its position .  It changed colors like it had previously for around 30 seconds .   It then started to travel vertically in the same fashion it had during its horizontal movement.   Extremely fast and stopping abruptly.   The g forces had to be extreme.  It moved in perfectly straight lines.  After about 8 movements up and down it hovered in its original position for maybe 10 seconds and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been to many airshows and have always been an aircraft buff.  I have never seen anything like that object before that night or since.  My friend who was there is a mechanic for Cessna experimental.   We discussed this sighting and have come to a conclusion that it was something that couldn&#39;t have been manned considering the speed and g force involved.  It also made no sound from the time we first saw it to the time it shot into the upper atmosphere out of sight.  No sonic booms, no engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/27/94 22:00|Blanchester|OH|Triangle|2-3 minutes|triangular shaped object over SW Ohio, moving very slowly and completely silent|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61126.html|2|ndxe199411| triangular shaped object over SW Ohio, moving very slowly and completely silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were returning from dropping our son off at his mother&#39;s house in Midland Ohio. It was somewhere around 10pm in late November or mid December, probably 1994. We decided to take a short-cut over the back roads through the cornfields just outside of Blanchester Ohio. It was very dark, no street lights and no moon, and I noticed some lights approaching us over the cornfields from my left. At first I thought it was a low flying aircraft but it was moving very slowly. I took a second glance at it and noticed that there were three white lights in a triangular formation (one in the front and two to the rear). The lights did not blink and there were no red or blue lights, only white. I was intriqued by the fact that it seemed so close to the ground it must have been coming in for a landing, but I didn&#39;t know of any airports close by. Thinking that it must have been in trouble and was attempting a landing in the cornfield, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out to take a closer look. My wife followed. By this time it was crossing the road in front of us. It was and equilateral triangle and appeared to be the size of a small jet flying very low. From our perspective it was about five inches long in the sky. It was a very quiet night... no tree frogs, no crickets and no traffic.... the object made absolutely no sound. We watched it fly over and off into the distance. We live in a flight path and I have seen all sorts of aircraft fly over at all times of the day, It wasn&#39;t like any aircraft I had ever seen. I had thought at the time that it must have been an hang glider, but why would anyone be flying a hang glider in Blanchester Ohio after dark and in the middle of winter? Maybe it was an experimental aircraft from Wright Patterson? It wasn&#39;t until years later, when I heard of eyewitnesses in Belgium seeing the same sort of objects around the same time that I realized what we had seen. While I have always believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations, I! have al ways been very skeptical when it comes to eyewitness accounts. I&#39;m still not certain that this was extraterrestrial but I am certain that it wasn&#39;t like anything I had ever seen before. I have seen all sorts of aircraft (military and civillian), I have seen flares dropped from aircraft, I have seen blue flaming meteorites and hundreds of &#34;shooting stars&#34;, I have seen durigables and hot air balloons, I have seen high altitude weather baloons, I have seen satilites.... planets.... and comets.  The thing we saw that night wasn&#39;t like anything I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was not moveing at that time. About two minutes passed and it darted rightback to the left very fast. It went down behind the pines and back up and left a snake like trail. I saw a blue green flash in the center and it split in two objects. Clowds moved in   and I lost the object.

My friend and I saw something wierd in the sky. It was a light blue frisbee looking object. It had some kind of shiny force field around it. The object kept flying around in the same area going left to right and so on like it was looking for something. Then it started to fly in circles for several seconds. Then suddenly it stopped for about 3 seconds and then it just disappeared.<n>

Then saw 2 red lights behind it forming a tiangle shape. 1/8 mile away white light stopped probing and 2 smaller red lights appeared behind each red light forming 2 more triangles. The craft &#34;floated&#34; with no sound over my house moving vary slowly. Approx. 100&#39; wide and 300&#39; long at an altitude of approx. 200&#39;. It was huge. Could make out boomerang shaped metalic edges at the corners as it passed. Witnessed by me and my wife the unit then flew north approx. 2 miles and began to turn to the left. It made a 180 deg. turn and changed shape half way into 3 red lights moving in a hoizontal manor. The craft did a complete about face and headed back toward us. 3 red lights parrallel to the ground. Then the right light moved upward and the left light moved down as if the craft was roling. The lights then stopped in a vertical manor and continued on it&#39;s path toward us. THAT WAS ENOUGH!!! We hid in our house terrified at what we were seeing. About 15 min. went by before I could look outside. It was gone. We have not seen anything since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

If anything the object was pyramidal in shape and towering into the sky.   It was just on the other side of the overpass, to the right of the highway and starting to cross over, I drove under the overpass and slowed my car and pulled to the side of the road, just underneath the object.   It was 5-10 feet above my head and my sunroof was wide open,  If I stood up It felt like I could touch it.  I turned off my car and sat there in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I noticed the almost lack of sound, but that’s not it, there was like a hum (not my engine fan) or almost a vibration to it, a heavy feel. It was moving at a slow pace and spanned the width of the highway which was 6 lanes with median and was triangular from the bottom, so it was like a pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on it were not bright, meaning there were no spotlights on, or headlights, more like little lights – LED like, it was definitely metal and had detailing beyond my vocabulary to describe, but I will try; flat metallic-almost grey-black- it seem almost circuit like with lights, and grooves  at least at the  outer perimeter–edging the pyramid with sharp corners.  But it wasn’t deep grooved almost flat like.  The center seemed more flat and less lit. (ok to give the best reference from todays’ sci fi- like a far away view of a borg cube)   But my best view was what was above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over the highway and some of the trees and I couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were sitting in the vehicle conversing prior to ending our social engagement.  In the middle of a sentence a bright green light illuminated our surroundings.  The source of this light was unidentified, since the roof of the vehicle obstructed our view, however it appeared to be comming from above our location.  I clearly recall feeling like our vehicle was close to the center of this projected light, because I noticed a clearly defined break in the green light line on the background of the white walled residential houses.  The light was so bright that everything inside the vehicle and outside the vehicle seemed visually permiated.  The light remained constant for about three(3) seconds and then discontinued.  We both looked at each other speechless for a few seconds, then slowly asking each other what was that.  Approximately four(4) or five(5) seconds later the light re-illuminated our surroundings once again.  The duration was again, approximately three(3) seconds.  And again, the light was green with clearly defined line boundries on the white background of the near by houses.  This time I immediatly rolled down the window to see if there was some kind of aircraft.  We did not see any evidence of aircraft,any evidence of audio noise, or any remaining physical evidence of the event.  The closest way to describe the event was like a very very bright spot light someplace directly above the vehicle, but the light we saw was extremely bright, all consumming, and uniform in content.  I revisited the location many times after and could find no logical explanation for the events that took place.  I am a professional investigator of 11 years (currently) and am one of two credable witnesses.  I also noticed that on 02/15/03 in Virginia Beach a similar event was recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting that he attempt to provide a precise date for the event, if possible.  We observe that his sighting occurred at the approximate time of the annual Leonid meteor shower, but his description does not seem consistent with a typical meteor, unless it had been moving directly toward the witness.  If the event occurred in another year, we believe we may know what it was he observed.  PD))<n>
11/15/94 21:00|Atlanta|GA|Light|apprx" 20 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Oval shaped bright light.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29582.html|10|ndxe199411| Oval shaped bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw similar in Georgia a few years ago. Mine was, I thought the moon until I realized it was moving horizontally right at the tops of the trees very slowly. It moved from the left side of my property to in front (I lived on a hill in a very rural area of Georgia). Impossible to tell how close or how large it was. Couldn&#39;t have been far or I couldn&#39;t have seen it thru the trees. Was also about 9pm at night, clear night in November. I did call a UFO org and a very nice fellow came up from Atlanta to talk to me, he took notes but came to no conclusion. Didn&#39;t dare call the local cops since I could just guess their reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the thing came around to the front I was so creeped out I went inside. I just didn&#39;t like the looks of it and I was isolated and alone there on the property. No neighbors within sight or hailing distance and 1000 acres of lumber company land to my right (where it was heading).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Memory gets less trustworthy thru the years of course but I would guess it was about the size of a quarter held at arms length. What the rising moon would look like at any rate, pale, no flashing lights or sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Updated information to above sighting report below:  It was in Banks county Georgia, I&#39;m about 50 miles above Atlanta.  I had gone out to bring the cats in, around 9:00 in November, clear as a bell outside and saw this thing thru the trees. I thought &#39;oh how lovely the moon is&#39; until I realized it was moving horizontally and not at all in the right place for the moon, I of course said something like &#39;oh s*&#39; and just stood there in total amazement and watched it very slowly circle my property from the left of my house to the front, across the pasture.. The trees were bare so I could see it clearly and it stayed right at basically the same level. You are right it was too big for a helicopter and a solid softly glowing object, no flashing lights no noise, So not a blimp and too close to the trees for that also.....I wracked my brain trying to come up with some sort of perfectly ordinary object and failed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why is it they are so creepy? You mention that too. When it came around to the front of my house I went inside, I honestly felt I didn&#39;t want to be around if it got closer. I don&#39;t worry about airplanes and I wasn&#39;t nervous living out in the boonies by myself (humans would be my major worry there), but that thing made me nervous after that, about wandering around at night. On one hand though you want to see it again because you just can&#39;t believe its not something known, and perhaps the second time it might reveal itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enclose a picture of approximately where it was when I went inside, it was about to go into the trees to the right and I figured I would either lose sight of it or it would move toward me. In reviewing this picture it was probably more the size of a dime held at arms length rather than a quarter...at any rate MUCH too big to be a star....hmmm swamp gas maybe....but what the heck is swamp gas ;-)  Don&#39;t forget me if you get some ideas, and God Bless for taking those sightings. Its important to get them down and believe me it helps to discuss these weird things with someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank this witness for her report, as i very much appreciate you sending it into me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

I normally got their about 3 am and waited for daylight.  I was turned around looking behind me and when I turned back around I seen lights. Just like light beams under water, the beams were very concentrated and defined. The beams were white.   Once a beam came out it stayed on and didn&#39;t move.  It started up and to the left of me.   One beam after another came on and the row of lights came down at an angle.   After a few seconds I was shined by one of the beams.  Their was no sound. I held my hand up to block the light and all of a sudden all of the lights turned red at the same time.  I was shined by the red lights for what felt like 10-20 seconds.  Then, all at once, all the lights turned off. Up in the middle of the sky I seen 2 humps that I thought was one object. It sat their without moving for about a minute, it glowed white and had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, one side/hump/object, in a swift! , smooth, steady, deliberate speed from beginning to end, went streight down until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. The other object remained motionless for about another minute.  Then the second object did the same streight up until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The event was followed by some sounds of animals fighting in the woods where the first craft went down.  I never seen them again. At daybreak I ran for it.  I tried to rationalize it as game wardens or drug hunters that seen my heat signal, but I don&#39;t believe any of that.  There was no blinking lights, they glowed white, no sound, to close together, and movement was to smooth (no speeding up or slowing down, just swift, one speed movement), they didn&#39;t fly across the sky (streight up, streight down until out if sight and within seconds).  My sky view was massive.  I was in the corner of a field to my left and a valley with cleared tember to my right.  I have always wondered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyway, we were all sitting there at the top of the mountain talking enjoying the view looking at the stars, which seem so close.  We saw an object in the sky that had like rectangle lights that were set up in a circluar motion and when one light went off the other one lit up.  It would move from the left side of the sky to the right side of the sky with then seconds.

We started looking at stars and we saw a little ship come out of a large one and one flew overhead and hovered while we got his mom and brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were walking to my house (he lives down the street) when we stopped to look at the moon.  My friend was at the time around 11 and I was 13.  We had been friends since he was in Kindergarten.  I was starting my fascination with outer space around that age. We started looking at stars and naming them, then he spotted one above and to the left of the north star that was somewhat bright (but very far away like a plane would be).  This &#34;star&#34; was keeping it&#39;s possition in the sky, but what was weird about it was that another star with a much lower magnitude seemed to come out of the larger one and travel about 4 degrees across the sky and stay there for about 5 minutes.  After that, it simply went back to where it came from.  I never considered that part of the sighting because it was too far away to tell what it really was.  What I consider the sighting is explained below. After seeing the strange star-like pinpoints across the sky, we began looking for more to see if it was an isolated phenomena.  We continued to walk and look when strait down the road between the rows of suburban houses and over the top of the circle&#39;s trees (the circle being at the end of the short road we live on) was a very bright light, my guess being with about -5 or -6 was just sitting there.  At first it didn&#39;t click in my head because there&#39;s usually red lights in that part of the sky anyway because of power lines in the field.  Then I realized the light wasn&#39;t red, it was a white light.  We were now halfway down the road, standing in awe at the 3-way intersection and stared at the light.  I looked to my friend and asked him what he thought it was, and when I looked back I saw that it doubled in size.  It was coming at us, straight down the road.  We thought it was a helicopter, so we ran back to his house like we were fugitives (we always pretended like that).  When we got to his driveway, it was almost directly overhead and still no sound was coming from it.  I took charge and told him to get his mom (I knew without an older witness that no one would believe us).  He ran inside yelling and his little brother came running out, followed by my friend and his mom.  Now the diamond-shaped craft was directly overhead and hovering like a copter. The rest of the description gets blurry now, I believe there were 4 lights on bottom, the 2 sides being white or dull yellow, the front and back being red. As far as I can remember, it was only there for us to regret not having a camera, then it tilted up at about a 30-35 degree angle and zipped away above his house pretty quickly. The only way I remember this many details about it is because I immediatley wrote it all down in my journal when I got home because I didn&#39;t want to take the chance of forgetting it, or having warped memories about it later.<n>

I was walking with my best friend from my house to his house in a subdivision outside of town.  We stopped in the middle of the street to look for shooting stars.  We found a few lights in the far distance that looked like airplanes without the flashing lights, but their behavior was strange.  The first one we found while looking to the north.  It moved a few degrees through the sky then stopped. A smaller light came from inside of it and went the same distance from its parent.  After a minute it returned to its parent and it continued to fly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to look around and we saw a bright white light over the eastern tree line.  At first we just assumed it was a light on a tower, but after walking a bit more then turning around again it was noticeably brighter.  We stared at it as it got bigger and bigger until we realized it wasn’t growing, it was approaching.  We ran westward down the street to my friend’s driveway, just a few hundred feet away. By the time we got there the object was above the street coming toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend to run inside and find a camera.  He ran inside screaming and his 5 year old brother came running outside to see what was going on.  A few seconds behind him was their mother who was in her late thirties.  My friend came back out without a camera to see what the object was doing.  By this time it was hovering directly above us at the height of a two story house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering above us long enough for us to discuss it’s attributes.  It was a black triangle shape with four lights, 3 white and one red.  The white lights were at the corners and the red light was centered on it’s underside.  There was a low humming sound, but nothing more.  No wind, no engine noise, and no movement.  We knew it couldn’t be an airplane because it was hovering and we knew it wasn’t a helicopter because it was almost completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes of hovering it simply tilted up slightly, probably about 25 degrees, and flew away at a very fast speed heading straight west above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests  that date of incident may be approximate.

It was above the trees, not really high up, maybe like a high kite can go.  It was perfectly round and was solid light grey exept for a thick band, almost like a belt, that went around it horizontally.  This band looked like it was made out of metal, and it had round green and red lights on it.  The craft slowly moved across the sky, and I lost it behind the apartment buildings. This whole thing lasted about 30 seconds, and was also seen by the other person at the bus stop.  He didn&#39;t know what it was either.  I know the date and time because I had researched this topic before and so documented it on my clipboard.<n>

I heard several cars zooming down the highway by my house so I went outside to investigate.  I headed back into my house and as I looked up in the sky towards the west I saw a triangular shaped object heading east high in the sky (appeared to be as high as a jet).   The object had two red lights and one green light.  It didn’t make any sound and moved slowly.  Then it stopped.   For about a minute it just hovered before changing directions and heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excited, and scared, I went to the casino (where my parents were) and told them that they had to come home because of what I had seen.  The object was gone when we returned.  However, we drove up and down some of the nearby dirt roads.  We saw nothing, but as we were returning home, about a half mile from our house up in the sky above a nearby farm was the object again.  It hovered up in the sky for a few seconds before rotating into another direction and disappearing.   I was sixteen years old at the time of the sighting, but it scared me enough that I ended up sleeping on the floor in my parents room next to their bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

11/5/94 14:00|Hwy I-40 (west of Flagstaff)|AZ|Oval|1 minute|The object was observed by myself and my wife while we were traveling west on I-40.|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08443.html|21|ndxe199411| The object was observed by myself and my wife while we were traveling west on I-40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling west on I-40. When we reached the junction where the high desert decends to the low desert we observed to our right (N.W.) an Oval object hovering in the sky approximately 1/2 mile from us. We were decending from the high desert plateau. I estimate our elevation when we first saw the UFO was approx. 3500&#39; and the UFO was about level with us but hovering over the low desert.  Our view of it when we first saw it was at eye level. It appeared when we first saw it to be Oval and reflecting the sunlight.  We did not see any identifying marks on the object.  Its&#39; initial appearence was very similar to the numerous UFO&#39;s seen over Mexico City in recent years.  However, as it moved away it appeared to elongate to more of a Cigar shape before it was lost from our view.<n>

Appeared to dip down into the trees. It&#39;s incredible light made no reflection onto us or the groud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I both saw the thing. It made no sound and it traveled very fast. My brother became scared when I questioned what it was and asked him why wasn&#39;t it making a sound. He then told me for us to get in the house because it knows what we are thinking. When he said this, it dissapeared as if to suddenly go blank. I then fell to the ground and we tried to walk-crawl into the house. We were very scared.I forgot to mention it was only about 200&#39; away from us. We  were very close to the thing.<n>

Suddenly the light shot up to high altitude instantaneously, then came directly at them. Passed at a slight tangent to them but was clearly visible. A perfect saucer shape, with bubble center surrounded by a white gas that gave it a haloed effect. 400-500 ft up, 1/4 mile distant.Filled a 3X9 scope.  the entire event lasted from 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two brothers have hunted the entire area and are familiar with it all.Sitting in their truck above the McLaughlin Gold Mine, where one was employed, they could observe the entire skyline for many miles from the ridgetop.The glow from the lights at the mine was visible below them.  In the distance they both noticed a bright white light.They both thought it was the light from a helicopter coming to the mine as happened occasionally.They watched it for approximately ten minutes when suddenly it literally &#39;jumped&#39; up to a much higher altitude and then proceeded to come directly at them.This was their first sighting and they both describe the event as extremely frightening!They thought the object was coming for at them specifically and they were in a panic.It came at them and veered to a slight tangent from a northwesterly direction.As it got closer they could clearly see the object as it passed within 1/4 mile at an altitude of 400-500 feet.It was a perfect saucer shape with a bubble in the middle and what appeared to be windows in the bubble.The light turned out to be a white gaseous appearing cloud that surrounded the entire craft but did not obscure it in any way.It filled the entire viewfield of a 3X9 variable scope.  The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a &#39;puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.  One of the brothers walked right up to it.  It was a drizzly day.The object appeared at first to be shiny black water. As the younger brother,(30&#39;s) approached it, the older one had a bad feeling.He told his brother not to get near it and as it seemed to be growing they ran to their truck and left.Another trip to the area will be made soon.Since this materials was in an open area near a ridgetop, we hypothesize it to be some sort of spill,byproduct or waste material from an unknown vehicle or craft. Perhaps fuel related.They kept these sightings to themselves out of concern fror what others might think until I told them about this internet site and they agreed to be interviewed.I will further describe the next sighting in another report and this and the ohter will be labeled the &#34;Dunn&#34; Sightings.<n>

My friends, one a corporate manager with his firm  &amp; the other a retired well respected farmer, said we must tell someone.  But after the object was gone we decided to tell no-one in fear of what would be said about us.  We seldom speak of the incident and when we do it is in privacy between us. This is the first time anyone of us has spoken up.  It WAS real.  We all had similar S/S weeks folling the incident as well of which I will not discuss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do wish there was a legitimate and sincere authority I could talk to about this without fear of reprocussion as more happened that I can say here.
