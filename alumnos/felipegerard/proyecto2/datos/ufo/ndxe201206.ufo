At first they were bright and then started to dim down and shot five different directions very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they came back went together for about three seconds and broke in five again.  The trees blew like a forty-mile an hour wind and lighting shot across the sky one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left for about ten minutes and three returned and started circling again but no wind this time everything was still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people across the street came out of their house and saw the same thing I saw. It was scary. It reminded me of close encounters somewhat the speed they had. I tried to take a picture with my phone each time the picture was black and all the other pictures in the phone but two. I then got my digital camera and took pictures and all the pictures were black.<n>

Thought it was a star, then it moved upward. moved from due south to due north.  After 10 seconds of flight the light dimmed and went dark.  I could make out the shape because of the moon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent and moved very fast.<n>

I thought it was a fireworks flare someone shot but it did not burn out just started to come my way.  I ran to get my camera on tripod and was glad it was still there when I came back.  I focused in on it and caught a few seconds of it before my camera went out of focus as it climbed into the clouds and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing which I did not notice until I viewed the film, was a light similar to the one that I had centered in the film is off to the right lower corner of the frame.  Thing is I was trying to zoom in on the center light just as it went out of focus, but the light in the right hand corner stays constant and even quickly moved out of frame just after the main light moves up into the cloud and up and over the city.  It was about 11:30 pm on June 30,2012 just a few minutes ago.  It doesn&#39;t seem I explained enough what seems strange to me, what I mean to get across is how can the light in the right hand corner stay constant when I am zooming in on the center object.  Seems to me it should go out of focus just as the center object did.  Then strangely enough it moves out of frame with the characteristics of a ufo.<n>

That is what I said when I concluded that it was not just another piece of space debris or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the balcony, doing my usual observation of the night sky, as it was a clear beautiful night. The moon was high and bright, and there were fireworks going off at multiple points in the horizon, as people were already beginning to celebrate Canada day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my scan of the night sky, I happened to notice what appeared to be a bright star, that I could have sworn was not there just a few seconds ago.  As I observed, it gradual became bigger and brighter. It then began to lose its luminosity, as it was moving north.  I was thinking it was a piece of space debris, as satellites have the same glow as they travel across the night sky, in a dead straight line, at a constant speed.  It soon came clear to me that it in fact was not a piece of space debris, as the object came to a stop, and headed back south. After all these years of soar necks, and countless time spent scouring the night sky for any form of activity, other than planes and satellites, it finally happened-  I was observing an unidentified flying object in space.  I finally was observing a UFO! In my immediate excitement, I called my wife to come out to the balcony and see what I was seeing. By the time she came out, it was gradually fading out as it moved further south.  We were both observing it until it had completely faded out of sight.  I knew it was not because of any clouds, as the immediate surrounding stars were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 to 2 minutes later, I finally saw the object travelling northbound again.  It maintained its level of luminosity, and rather than travelling on a straight path, was what I can best describe as swerving erratically left to right.  I followed it until it was no longer visible from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am indeed very excited to have experienced my first UFO sighting. I hope my wife and me were not the only ones to have seen it.<n>

Several witnesses, 3 more lappea<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I first thought I saw was some kind of firework that was floating across the sky.  It was followed by 4 others and they had the exact same path which would have made it impossible to be a firework of some kind.  It appeared to be no further that 10 - 15 houses away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I very clearly saw what I saw.  They appeared to be upright cylinders 2-3 long, bright orange&#39; almost as if on fire. Each one that followed the other was equal distant from each other, and traveled the same path.  It was quiet out except for the sounds of a raccoon in the woods.  If these were a man made object, I would have heard a propeller, or propellant of some sort.  Nothing, I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take pictures with my iPhone, but even at that close distance is was too much for the IPhone to handle.  I did get pictures of it, but they look like dots.   After the 5 had come towards my house and then moved over the mountain, I stood outside completely dumbfounded by what I! had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was expecting other people in the neighborhood to be coming out of their houses as excited as I was.  No one.  Unbelievable.  I guess from my perspective I could see them, but if they were directly over your house, you wouldn&#39;t.  I waited and hopefully watched for about another 5 minutes, and 2 more appeared from the same area, taking about the same path as the others.  I called into my house and three others came out to see the tail end of then second of the two that had just come.  No explanations, nothing.  I again listened very closely for the sounds of a propeller, or propellant, nothing.  There were no sounds of overhead airplanes or helicopters.  Nothing else but sounds of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all waited around for another minute os so. And nothing else.  My wife had been upstairs sleeping with our granddaughter, and I was hesitant to call her In the beginning, for fear of waking my granddaughter.  After the 6th and 7th appeared and departed as the ! first 5, I continued to wait for more.  I went back into the ho! use and quietly told my wife what I had just seen.  She had wondered where I had been all of this time.  She was asking, what was it.  I had no idea.  I went back outside, hoping for one more sighting , and Wow, an 8th was appearing.  I went into the house a yelled up to my wife, &amp;quot;there&#39;s another, come down&amp;quot;.  She did, as well as the other 3 witnesses that I called earlier.  Everybody else saw the tail end of the 8th unknown object.  This ones path was a little further away but in the same area, and took a similar path up towards the mountain.  Wow, exciting, but puzzling.<n>

I pulled the car over on Pleasant Street and both of us got out to observe them more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights looked to be the size of soccer or smaller basketballs from where we were standing.  They were traveling in a straight line, one behind the other left to right.  There was absolutely no sound at all from them that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one separated from the other two and the light slowly dimmed from view.  The remaining two continued going in a Northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the first one (if it was the first one or perhaps another one) came back around (we did not witness it coming back around as we were in the process of getting out of the car; it was just there again)and continued to follow the other two in the same direction.  We watched until the lights on all three slowly dimmed and then all three disappeared.  The duration of this was probably 2-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the FAA Flight Service Station (my wife went on line to try to see who we should call when we got home to report what we saw) and spoke to a gentleman who assisted us. He was going to report this sighting to his superiors and gave us the wind velocity information we understood that you may want.  He also gave us the number to report our UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called at 11:40 p.m., no answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman from FAA called back and left your web site for us to contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the Doppler Radar Operation:  Wind velocity up to 10,000 feet – Direct observation of winds:  2,000 feet -	2.70  @ 10 knots   3,000 feet -	2.70  @  20 knots  4,000 feet -  2.80  @  20 knots  5,000 feet -  3.00  @  20 knots  6,000 feet -  3.10  @  25 knots  7,000 feet -  3.20  @  25 knots  8,000 feet  -  3.10  @  25 knots  9,000 feet  -  3.30  @  25 knots  10,000  no observation  About 9:52 p.m. 3.40  @  30 knots  On Monday, July 2 we called the Utica Police Department and asked if there were any reports of unidentified sightings in that area.  We spoke to an officer who said several complaints had come in about fireworks in that vicinity going off.  After listening to us he felt confident in claiming that what we saw were fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully we have to disagree with him.  We know what we saw.  Having witnessed countless firework displays over the last 60 years, neither one of us have seen anything resembling what we witnessed (unless something new is out there that explodes silently into perfect round balls and continues to hold it’s shape, color and follows in a straight line until it dims out after 2-4 minutes).<n>

Acton, IN<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left my house and was just turning onto interstate 74.  Right when I turned onto the interstate ramp I noticed a bright reddish yellow light out in front possibly about 1000 yards.  I thought it was just a plane at first but from the moment I saw it something didn’t look quite right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued down the interstate I kept watching the object the best I could while driving.  I realized the object was slowly moving to the east directly over the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the object and went under I stuck my head out the window to get a better look and it looked like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was 200ft in the air when I passed under it.  It was glowing a steady red and the top part seemed to have a little yellow almost like sticking out of it.  I never saw it blink one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed the constant color which almost seemed to look like some kind of energy ball.  I couldn’t believe what I just saw so I exited on the Acton rd. exit and came back down the other side of the interstate heading east and the object was still there just hovering in one spot now.  It was hovering about 15ft south of the interstate above a home that is built underground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited the interstate again and could still see the object.  As I continued down the road directly south of the interstate I could still see the object now moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to move up and then disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up my brother to go back and look at it but it was already gone.  I always had a feeling that these light ufos were real and now I definitely believe it.<n>

It was traveling across the sky parallel to the ground at a high altitude.  It was moving faster than an airplane but not as fast as a meteor, which was my first thought as to an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just on fire, a bright orange, but presented no trail or tail common with large meteors and was not in a falling flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to retrieve my phone to videotape the object but was unfortunately unable to locate the object upon returning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite strange.<n>

Viewed with 8X binoculars - the image was very clear - an orange globe with a bright spot in the lower center - very much like what you would see if viewing a large hot air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the object was moving north - again not sure about speed becuase distance was not known - it was moving very fast and we watched it as it moved - it was not a plane or helocoptor - very familiar with these objects being in the service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object passed over a fishing vessel and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total flight started south of Jax Beach - again not sure about distance as it was dark but it had to be far as there was no sound.  The ships visible were probably about 8-10 miles offshore - I can see about 18 miles to the horizon from my vantage point 180 feet above the sand.  The center light or flame seemed to pulse and the orange globe pulsed with the center flame or light.<n>

The fireworks were about to begin.  We were sitting next to the dam overlooking the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes after the test firework went off.  We saw this bright glowing orange, yellow, reddish orb, disc fly up in the horizon.  It was miles in the distant horizon.  It was ascending at a steady pace traveling west to southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise was heard.  No flickering lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to travel in a SE direction.  It shut off.  We thought it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately fixed our sights on it again, and it was totally black.  Still traveling at a the same rate of speed torwads the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all thought then this was not a plane or a helicopter. Because planes or helicopters cannot just turn their light off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to take pictures of it with our phone cameras.  Was able to zoom in real good.  The orange orb/disc if clear in sky.<n>

It moved slowly over us and disappeared after that every night just before 8 I went outside to see if I could se it again but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went on a site of ufo&#39;s and there was an exact picture of what we saw, 2 lights with a wide space between them.  I&#39;m not saying its a ufo but I&#39;m thinking that and I don&#39;t want to be on tv or I don&#39;t want any one to come and ask me about it cause there are people that doesn&#39;t believe in ufos but I do and my grandfather who passed away came to fetch us when I was about 7 years old and as we were driving from Standeton to Newcastle (South Africa) me my brother my grandfather and my grandmother saw a big round green looked like a green round light slowly flew over the car and it was gone. Me my father and brother went fishing I was in gr 3 when we saw a green triangle and n red circle far over the water and it looked like they were chasing each other and then it was gone.  So ja we saw lots of weird stuff but I know people are very skeptic and so I just thought I would share this with u good luck in finding something everyday  I&#39;m on the look out for something strange and nothing yet.

It only took a second from when I noticed it until it had stopped then began moving west along the same horizontal height as where it has stopped it was at this time I started taking pictures, it took the object less then, I’d say 20 sec to travel from stopping point to out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leave roughly a straight distance of 20 mile from a navy air base and can take pictures of all sorts of military planes and government planes too, but no pictures will compare to this UFO.  Exactly 14 minutes later there became this grey streak where the UFO came down at an angle, and then the only way I can describe where the UFO stopped before moving west is a grey sonic boom looking cloud in just that spot though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, I am a very open minded person I see no reason why E.T.s can’t exist if we do, I have a good clue of air crafts not only because I lived near a military base for 20 years but I have also spent 2 ½ years in the military. I have noticed an increase in UFO activity in the last year or two.<n>

There had just been a horrible thunder and electrical storm. We lost power and I was sitting,reading by candle light alone in the living room.  Thinking I heard people talking outside, I went to the door to see what damage there was (and who was talking). Instead I was amazed to see this ball of orange/red glowing light. It was mid sky and desending slowly. It was close enough for me to see rings of color, white inside,yellow,and orange with a glow of red.  In less than a minute it disappeared behind the tree/building line.  I waited for an explosion or something but nothing happened. It appeared to be landing or was very close to the homes. It made no noise, there were no street, home or business lights on anywhere during, before or after this time as we had a massive power failure that last for days. After it disappeared I waited for a couple of minutes and ran upstairs to tell my son. I didnt get a pic b! ecause I wouldnt have had enough time but a few days later I began searching the internet for someone else who may have seen it. On the 4th day I found 2 different videos taken from separate areas/people in my state. The first one was exactly what I had seen. I was thrilled to see it and to know I wasnt the only one who witnessed this(these?)that night. The second video was really remarkable as well. The colors from both of the videos and what I saw were the same. Circles of color, white, yellow, orange with a red glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((deleted--50&#39;s)) year old currently disabled woman.I used to be a Business Development Manager for ((deleted)) companies.

I had my window down and didn&#39;t hear any sound. There were no blinking lights like a normal airplane. Just a very steady light. I tried to take a video with my phone, but I&#39;m not sure it showed up, since it was so dark. It was a very dark orange/red color and faded out when it was about straight in front of me, or just slightly to the right of the highway. It didn&#39;t seem very high in the air. I&#39;d say about the same altitude that a small private plane would fly. Seemed to high and steady/smooth to be a flare or some sort of long-lasting fireworks. I&#39;ll be interested to hear if anyone else reports anything, since there are a ton of people camping at the lake. I would imagine a lot of people had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By the time I was able to safely pull over and look, only two lights remained.  The seemed to be moving slowly or they were a far distance away.  One seemed to grow bigger as it got &amp;quot;closer.&amp;quot;  Suddenly one disappeared (like the other four), then one reappeared shortly after quite far from where the other disappeared.  The remaining orb of the first two looked as if it was disappearing, but then it just changed to a bluish color that matched the night sky and made it look like a star.  The other orb moved slowly and then shortly disappeared after the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew over our heads as we were all staring up at it my neighbor yells out here comes another one it flew in the first ones exact path. Both were silent and the only noise we heard was the fan from my air in the house and crackle of the bonfire. They were flying at a much slower pace than an airplane. I could tell they were rather close to the ground but could not judge an aproximate distance. The globes seemed to be about the size of a soccer ball from our distance though. They were headed southwest, they took a slight curve to the west about a mile after passing over us. Both than stopped and hovered in location once they had gotten what seemed to me about five to ten miles away. The one in lead was on the bottom right and started to sway left and right and than moved upwards towards the tailing light as they got closer the lead than faded out. The tail li! ght than hovered for around another fifteen  seconds until it faded out as well. My neighbor tried to capture video of it and her phone died seconds after pointing it towards the globes. Her battery was fully charged and has never had problems with phone battery in past.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/29/12 22:33|Seattle|WA|Light|4 minutes|I saw about 8-9 red-orange lights hover over the Eastside of Seattle and change formations from triangles and lines before disappearing|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90245.html|52|ndxe201206| I saw about 8-9 red-orange lights hover over the Eastside of Seattle and change formations from triangles and lines before disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting Friday June 29, 2012 at 22:33-22:37 Seattle, WA – Looking to the East from Lake Union towards Lake Washington/ Bellevue/Kirkland area  Ok, so I was standing with a friend on their balcony overlooking  Lake Union to the East with a 180° view of Seattle from southern University of Washington campus to the North East of downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. It was about 22:33pm on Friday June 29,2012 and while we were talking I was looking at the view and I looked at my friend (who had his back to the view in the east) for about 4sec, when I looked back up behind him I had seen that three red/orange lights (about twice the size and brightness of the star cluster of Sirius on a clear winter night) were sitting in a large equilateral triangular formation over (what looked like from northern Capitol Hill to the junction of I-5 and SR-520 East). As we watched (which the whole duration of the event was over a period of approximately 4min) the triangle started to move slowly to the north an upwards (from my perspective it would be approximately 1mph). As the triangle formation of red/orange lights moved, another light ! of the same color (red/orange), size, and brightness appeared about 450meters up and 300 meters to the north of the triangle appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light began to slowly move north at around 5mph (from my perspective) and a greater speed to the east towards Kirkland before slowly fading out. As this occurred, four lights of the same original intensity and color as the initial triangle (which at this point was still in formation) of lights began to appear from behind Capitol Hill to the east and appeared in a straight line, one after, another (and these moved up quickly (from my perspective 10-15mph)  before slowing to a stop) in a perfectly straight line (which would bisect the lower southern corner of the triangular formations roughly 45° angle if drawn through the four new lights, connecting to the bottom , southern corner light, and through the equilateral triangle itself). As the four new lights were appearing, the triangular formation began to form into a line perpendicular with the horizon. What was the top light of the triangle began to move into the original spot of the light which hovered about the fir! st triangular formation before disappearing. This light then moved in the same direction and speed as the light before it had before slowly disappearing in the north, but mainly east (east towards Houghton and as far north as the University of Washington campus). The new four lights that had come up in a line to the bottom, southern corner of the triangular formation began to move upwards at approximately (from my perspective about 5mph). As these lights moved upwards, the top ones would take the spot of the others before it and would hover in a single spot before moving slightly north to the east and slowly fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last four lights had moved upwards and the first four had pretty much disappeared in the distance by now (It was about 22:36) when the first of the four new lights moved into the upper position to the north east. The three lights below it then went into a small equilateral triangle formation (within approximately less than 100meters of each other). These three lights then moved into another formation forming a perpendicular line with the horizon before gradually moving up and to the north east before fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel crazy writing this, I believe in UFOs but my friend doesn’t but neither of us is sure what we saw. We watch airplanes (both commercial and military) helicopters come in for landing and move across the city skyline every night but never have we seen anything like this. The lights did not blink like airplane lights would and they were more orange than red. But they weren’t to be mistaken with airplane headlights either. Airplane headlights are a white/yellow light and accompanied with the green, red, and white wing and taillights. I have never seen any aircrafts fly like this and make these formations and possess these lights. Airplanes which are able to hover in the way which these lights/possible crafts did are extremely loud and can be heard from miles away. There was no sound accompanying these lights in the sky. I know what I saw, I can’t explain what it was but I don’t think it was normal. I hope my descriptions of my sighting can be understood and can help. By th! e time we really believed that this was for sure an unusual sighting and set up the camera to take a photo, the lights had faded too much in order to get a quality photo of them. I called the National Weather Service here in Seattle and they reported that the winds were coming in from the south at the time and area of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were flying about as fast as a regular aircraft and were going the same direction as the wind.  They were not very high, probably as high as most helicopters fly over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were only a few seconds apart and I could see them both at the same time. The first one stayed a constant orange colour, but the second one was randomly changing colour from orange to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not make any sound, and they did not change direction.  I watched them for about a minuet before they went behind some trees.  There was one aircraft present, it was higher in the sky and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a sighting in Leamington, Ontario (just east of Kingsville) on June 23 2012, and the man took a picture:<n> <n><n> http://www.theweathernetwork.com/your_weather/details/620/6800080/5/caon0350/plpcities/787/&amp;#commentposition<n> <n><n> <n><n> His picture looks just like the two I saw.<n>

After watching the stars for a while, I went to get my binoculars to have a better look at the movers.  At about 22:20 my wife pointed out a very fast mover which looked reddish,  directly above us heading east.  I was able to look at it with the binoculars and saw there were actually 4 sharp, evenly spaced, lights close together on the trailing edge of whatever it was.  It seemed like the back of an extremely fast moving jet but made no sound.  I lost sight of it as it made it&#39;s way east.<n>

It was very large...about 200 feet long and the bundle of lights were going from one end to the other.   With the horizon it was at a 40 degree angle.   Maybe moving about 50 mph.  The background was brush and the UFO was about 1 mile from an oil rig.   I was observing the rig and UFO in the same view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Objects hovered for a period and then ascended into the clouds with no trace of their light left behind or reappearing below the clouds.

I looked up and saw dark twilight coming on and I could see the moon thru the trees then I saw a bright orange yellow sphere silently trans-versing the sky, it was smooth in movement and very straight, from right to left on it&#39;s travel. At the point I saw it, it was at the 7o&#39;clock position as the Moon is at 12 o&#39;clock. It never wavered and there are very few dim stars appearing as it&#39;s getting darker, at count only saw 5 stars. I tried to take a cell phone photo, but it was to far away and it didn&#39;t seem to appear in the photos, will download to see better. Will submit if I have anything. I figured it might be a VERY large or Close Satellite or even The Space Station with the Sun Shining Upon it...I am still excited to have seen it, it was VERY VERY BRIGHT. UFO? hopefully!! But with the array of Satellites up there, it was probably one of um.. :D<n>

The footage shows a helicopter pouring chemicals onto a fire on a hillside in dense smoke, and suddenly from the lower left of the screen, a white light streaks by from the lower left of the screen diagonally to the upper right of the screen, past the helicopter, and out of the lens view.  Initially, it appears to be a single light, but later appears as 2 lights, but it&#39;s hard to tell if this is a second object, or just part of the original object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The film appears to be shot from another helicopter from a considerable distance, and the object appears to be moving too fast to be a bird, and since it is partially obscured by smoke as it emerges, it seems too far away to be a bug or dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have access to the footage, but maybe the producers at the Ed Show can steer you in the right direction.  This footage appeared on the last 2 minutes of the June 29th edition of MSNBC&#39;s &#39;Ed Show&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As usual I was watching aircraft land while talking to a customer on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed an odd bright reflection in the air over a mountain about 20 miles south of town. It appeared that the morning sun was reflecting just perfectly off an aircraft.  But, as the craft travelled northwest the bright reflection dulled and I could clearly see 3 distinct circular objects traveling well under the commercial aircraft lanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the person I was on the phone with what I was looking at with the typical &amp;quot;whatever&amp;quot; answer!  I told a coworker to take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then grabbed a pair of binoculars and looked at the craft.  She said the 3 circles are all connected and that we were looking at a satellite.  I laughed because the craft was maybe 10-15 thousand feet up and wasn&#39;t descending it was moving slowly and smoothly across the sky.  I grabbed my phone and tried to record it but by the time I trie! d to zoom in it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a former USAF and federal agent and I&#39;ve seen thousands of aircraft.

It appeared to be above the tree line and move slowly in an eastern direction.  The city where I live is located in the urban Los Angeles area.  The &amp;quot;fireball&amp;quot; moved slowly and at that time I went outside to get a better view.   As I did, I noticed the fireball started to diminish in size although it was still moving slowly and heading in a southeast direction towards the mountains.  It gradually got smaller until it appeared to be the size of a dot and then totally &amp;quot;go out&amp;quot; however, I could still detect some sort of craft traveling in a southeast direction.  At no time did I detect any sound.<n>

There was no apparent movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any indications once it faded of running lights like those on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was a pilot had turned on his landing lights but the way it faded on then faded off is not indictive of that.

It was moving very quickly and silently to the east word pattern.  I looked over to my daughter to see if she saw it also.  She did but my son didn&#39;t.<n>

The blue color was at the center of the object and red lights on the periphery. I called my son ,who was in the car,to show him the sighting(even I could not believe what I was seeing) and he confirmed it. I realized that I have seen a UFO. I went to my next door neighbor but noone answered the door bell. I took out my phone to call the police but it was frozen ane will not work. I got into my car and continued to my sister&#39;s house and we saw the object more clearly; circular and ahead in the sky and appearing to descend. i ran qickly to the door of ny sister&#39;s house but the object was gone when she came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought maybe a plane on fire but no flames  just red ball I thought maybe something falling like a meteor etc  but it just kept moving a nice steady speed and no fire trail etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went behind some trees I walked to the road  and got a clear view and watched it until it disappeared into the horizon, this all took app: 60 sec  from the top of my house until it disappeared, this took place over a rural setting<n>

I even mapped the geographical coordinates of where we were laying. I and another witness were at 38.32238,-8172043 laying on a set of monkey bars behind a school both facing northeast. I noticed the object first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a yellowish glow high in the sky and I made a joke about how that star looked like it was moving. Upon further investigation I noticed it had been moving. From what I could see it was flying around the same elevation as most aircraft were that night. The night was clear and no cloud coverage at all. There were a lot of other aircraft and one aircraft even flew right into the yellow glowing object, however it looked as if it passed over top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no particular flight pattern and moved erratically. Based on surrounding aircraft I would assume it flew at over a 600 miles per hour and would stop and switch directions quickly. It moved in every direction, left to right, up and down, and they weren’t always constant flight patterns. They would also fly from left to right and then slowly sweep upward in a curved motion.  There were multiple other aircraft that were all easily identified even when they were flying at a higher altitude and this flight pattern matched no aircraft possible in the area and had no hazard lights to let you know that it was a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred 6/28/12 from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30 pm. We watched the object move to many different areas of the sky. We actually looked up and placed it to be flying around the Hercules constellation from where we were laying. I took great care to include all accurate details and did have  a witness. This is my first sighting of an object like this, and I’m sure it was no meteor (there was a meteor shower) and I’m positive it was no local aircraft I’ve ever viewed. I tried to film it on my iPhone, unfortunately the ambient light from the light pole wouldn’t allow it to focus and concentrate on the beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was too far away to determine a shape, but it was definitely highly illuminated. We even wondered while watching it how the aircraft could not notice or see this or maybe they had. There was a very unusual amount of air traffic that night too from what I observed, especially for the time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very high up above our meadow were 20 (maybe more) triangular objects.  They kind of looked like birds from a distance, but birds don’t fly that high.  One by one, they “flew” off toward the south.  I took a picture of them, but you have to enlarge it in order to see the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was either hovering or possibly moving at a very slow speed. It gave off what looked like a flickering or irregular blinking light that may have been a reflection from the sun. We watched it for about 5 minutes, before we passed under some trees and couldn&#39;t see it anymore after that. I don&#39;t know if it disappeared or if it just moved to an angle where it could no longer be seen by us. Never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was extrememly far away and I was unsure of the distance.  I stood for approx. 5 minutes staring at it wondering what it was and I noticed that it didn&#39;t move, but it was &#34;twinkling&#34; which indicated to me that it was rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs to my apartment and got my camera and my husband so he can see it too.  I put my 75/300 mm lens on my camera and started taking pictures of this thing.  I took pictures for about 15 minutes, then realized I was going to be late for work.  My husband and I stood for about 10 more minutes or so and stared at it while we hypothesized about what it could be.  Right before I got into my car, my husband gasped and he said, &#34;OMG, it disappeared!&#34;   When I turned back to look at it again, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was, but I know that objects don&#39;t stay in one place for 30 minutes when they are in the sky.<n>

This light did not seem to come from a single point source, but reminded us of heat lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the initial burst of light was dome-like or rounded.  It seemed as though it was fairly far away, perhaps ten to twenty miles and it appeared directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It filled a large portion of the sky in front of us, I would estimate 30 to 45 degrees of my field of vision.   Thus, the spread of the light would have been at least 5.2 miles across and as much as 15.7 miles across.  In searching for a more descriptive color, my wife and I both agreed on neon green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light kept this dome-like shape for a few seconds and then shrank in size while simultaneously changing shape, converging at the center of the ground in the shape of a farm silo.  It then disappeared.  We ne! ver actually saw anything that would have been considered an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are in our mid forties.  I am a college professor and my wife is a stay at home mother.  We are both educated (doctorate and masters degrees respectively).  Neither of us has seen what we would consider a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is twelve years old and a good student.  I have two other children aged 10 and 6 who were in the car, but asleep at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were &#34;blown away&#34; by what we saw.  Neither of us have ever seen anything remotely like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night (once we arrived home around 12:30 a.m.) and the next day we looked for any information that might explain what we saw and could find nothing.<n>

We were located at our home approximately 2 blocks south, and 2 blocks east of the intersection of 51 &amp; Sheridan Road, in Tulsa, OK.  I was in bed, she called me out excitedly.  As I came outside, and walked to the end of our driveway and looked due south, she said look at that.. it looked like two strobe lights in the sky the lower left and upper right lights were intermittently flashing, red, blue, red, red, blue, white, and the flashing pattern was in sync for about 10 seconds my wife said.  She walked to the house called me, I came out and saw them stationary with NO sound.  The objects were at least a few miles in the air about 40degrees up from our vantage point at the end of the driveway.  I came outside saw them stationary... then they two objects started spreading apart... I immediately ran back inside to get my video camera and my $5K Canon 5DMark II digital slr camera! , and tried to take a video... as I got back outside (while my wife kept them in sight), they started moving to the east, south east at about 70-80 miles per hour, and I tried to setup my video camera to catch them... however couldn&#39;t focus on anything... I got my SLR camera out and changed lenses to my 70-200... and tried to get a 1080P hd movie going... but couldn&#39;t focus on anything... by the time I had the video going... they were at least 6-8 miles away... in less than 2-3 minutes. I had to walk south down our street to view them through the tree line.. and could still make out the blue, red, blue, red, white, blue, red, alternating flashing....  my wife was videoing and trying to see anything while I continued to try to take some time delayed stills to see if I could amplify the ambient light but couldn&#39;t.  I was outside watching the flashing until My eyes could barely make out a faint white flashing of 2-3 objects... in the far distance.  This all occurred within abo! ut 6 minutes!!   This is my wife and our 3rd sighting in the l! ast 3 mo nths now.  Last one in Arkansas, and 3 months ago directly above our home at 51 &amp; Sheridan... what is going on?

As we were in close proximity to the airport I initially thought it was some sort of airplane or helicopter, however the light was very unlike any aircraft I am familiar with. I had my girlfriend pull the car over to the side of the road and we both witnessed this very strange, bright, shimmering firelight hovering in the northern sky. After a couple of minutes she continued driving east down Highway 6 as I remained fixated on the object through her window (which places the object essentially due north of Iowa City). As we crossed over the Iowa River on Highway 6 the object suddenly faded and vanished into nothing. I have no explanation for what I have seen tonight and I am utterly dumbfounded, so much so that I felt compelled to file this report in hopes that there is some explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked her if she was talking about the radio tower in the distance. She said no and we got up to look out the back window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out there was a red/orange light rising from the horizon strait up. I know it was strait up because the light never got smaller or larger it stayed at about ¼” all the way till it hit the roofline and I could not see it any more. (This took about 45 seconds to rise to this height.) My wife decided to look out the side window and there it was now moving northeast towards the east side of Cleveland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got to the window (had to get back out of bed) it was about ½ way across the sky we watched it for about another 7 seconds getting smaller and smaller until it was so far away we could not see it any more. (Total from the point my wife got to the window until it was out of sight was about 25 seconds tops. And the distance between the back and side windows is about 15 feet and might take about 5 seconds to move between with the obstacles) Now to be completely honest with my feelings about the fact I cannot say what this was I do not believe in ET’s/aliens. I think it would be incredibly cool for another race to come to earth and tell us that we are headed in the wrong direction and we better fix our ways or they will. Even leave some of their race here to show the retared people of world what we are doing wrong. Get rid of our bombs/weapons and show us a better way. But I am a Christian who believes God made us in his image and we are his greatest creation and I will believe in aliens when I actually see one in person or they declassify real pictures of a real spacecraft. But I will say that it was an unexplainable object moving in the sky from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was first spotted from the northern end of the boardwalk when i was exiting Surfside pier.  The object was hovering high above the ocean but from my perspective from the boardwalk, it looked as high as the ferris wheel. The object didn&#39;t seem to move.  I stared at the object as I was walking south on the boardwalk towards Mariners Landing pier.  When I entered mariners landing pier, if you put a square around the ferris wheel, the object was at the top right corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went on a ride and when I got off the, the object was gone.<n>

What I thought was a star flashed about five times and took off and disappeared.  Also, in the span of two and half hours that night we also witnessed  what looked to be a satellite in the sky except it was moving at an incredible speed and blinked very brightly about three times then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/27/12 23:00|Rocklin|CA|Light|30 minutes|Flashing Red Llight Over Rocklin, Ca|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90186.html|93|ndxe201206| Flashing Red Llight Over Rocklin, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the same lights several times in the past to weeks.  They are in the NW sky from my address.  Sometimes there are 4-5 lights, last night there were 2.  One was white, the other was amber and would turn red and start flashing.  The red flashing light was most visible and would flash and slowly and drift horizontally from side to side making it difficult to video.  Last night, at one point, a commercial jet flew towards the red flashing light.  The light moved over and became very small, and after the jet flew by, the light got bigger again and started flashing red. This light flashes red for a minute or so, stops and becomes amber, and slowly builds up to flashing red again.  I have seen this light in the night sky over the past two weeks as I am taking my dog out before I go to bed.  I&#39;ve worked in aviation in the military and know this is not a helicopter, blimp, or airplane.  It makes no noise and has no flight path.  It&#39;s like it&#39;s just hangin! g out.  It&#39;s color is not super bright.  It&#39;s red like a stop light.  And, it&#39;s not a solid red.  I can see lines through the color and it&#39;s shape is not a circle or orb, it&#39;s shape is very interesting, almost like a winged creature.  Like a giant firefly.  There is definitely something going on that cannot be explained.  I hesitated to report this.  I don&#39;t know why others are not seeing this as it is very visible. One other point, it alternates it&#39;s flash with the other white light that I am also seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was obviously not a star though because it was moving very rapidly in circles and zig zag patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some times the object would move in a clockwise manner and then in a counter clockwise direction. Some times it would stop moving in a circle and it would star zig zagging very erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my daughter if I was seeing things and she said &amp;quot;no, I see it also&amp;quot;. Then I thought may be I am freaking her out so I asked her to tell me which.way it would move and she described its movements to me exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still very confused and puzzled by the whole event. I wonder if it was space junk reflecting sun light back at me or the Hubble or the Space Station but I don&#39;t think any of those can move like this thing did. It was fast but didn&#39;t move in a linear way as I said it would zig zag. Even when it moved in circles it was erratic.  It would also speed up and slow down and move back and forth.  Could it have been a drone? May be the Government has flight technology that we are not yet aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/27/12 22:45|Hamburg|PA|Unknown|10 minutes|3 steady white lights with flashing red and green lights over Berks County, Pa.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90191.html|95|ndxe201206| 3 steady white lights with flashing red and green lights over Berks County, Pa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night of June 27th, 2012 at around 10:45 P.M. I went outside for a cigarette and to watch the stars as I do several times every night when I spotted what I thought was a plane.  I was facing west and this thing was hovering about 35 to 40 degrees off the horizon and seemed closer than an aircraft should be (maybe about a quarter mile away if not closer).  But, the more I stared at it I noticed that it had 3 horizontal white lights in a straight line with red and green lights underneath flashing at a very fast rate.  The 3 white lights did not blink and I could see them lit the entire time and remained in a straight line.  The object was moving slowly but strangely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to grab my binoculars and came back out and the object was still hovering in about the same spot but, doing a circular motion and moving up and down and sideways.  I focused the binoculars on it and played with the zoom in and out trying to get a clear look when I noticed the 3 white lights started to turn vertically and then kept turning until it did a 360 degree turn.  This is when I went inside and told my husband to come outside.  He tried using the binoculars and even went inside to get his hunting spotting scope but could not get a perfect view of it since we have a light on a pole close to our deck which makes it harder to see the sky.  He still thought it was a strange sight and not a plane. I had a better view of it since I was a little further away from that pole lamp. We watched it for several minutes before it finally took off slowly and finally went behind a tree where we could still see some white lights through the leaves before it finally d! isappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode must have lasted about 10 minutes and I could never get a clear view of the body of the object because the green and red lights were flashing so bright and fast (and I was shaking a bit)  but it seemed to have a dark (maybe black, gray or silver) body.  I could not tell the shape of the body but if I had to guess it appeared to be cigar or disc shape.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.  Every night I watch the planes, stars, planets, satellites and occasionally shooting stars in the sky and am very familiar with objects in the night sky but this was a new experience for me.  It was both exciting and a bit scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My sister and I spot the lights south of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First one light that looks like a fireball which has a smoke trail rising. Then that fireball emits 3 smaller fireballs like an explosion/firework but it doesn’t look like a firework. They dissipate and another fireball, the same size as the first, lights up not too far from the first. The first goes out and then lights up again after about 5 min. I took some video but it is very shaky because we did not stop the car. The fireballs stay stationary in the sky and are too high to be burning off a tower like a gas release at a dump. But that is what I thought at first.  I have been reading others accounts of a similar sighting in the same spot, which makes me believe it has a reasonable explanation that no one has cared to investigate. I know I haven’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most reasonable seems to be related to some air base that, I have read, is in the area. Not sure what it would be but it is probably related to that.  I am curious but not curious enough to drive back there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 years ago I saw a similar light in the sky and my parents told me not to worry about it. Not really sure the relevance of that. Just thought of it. If anyone knows what the lights are I hope you post it somewhere on the internet so we all can google it and find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 4 brightly shining spherical craft in a vertical straight line solid in color and brightness drifting higher into the sky while dimming immediately to at least 3/4 the intensity. This happened in a matter of seconds and i stopped my friend mid sentence to have him see what i was seeing. They continued drifting higher and farther away towards the right, when they began to make an obtuse triangle shape.The lowest object drifted straight away from us while the other three went the other direction. At this point they were blinking red in color in a random sequence, they would all stay lit at different intervals from each other and would emit light for different amounts of time each time they did light up. They did this and drift! ed higher into the atmosphere until they vanished from sight. There was no sound, no smoke, and other air craft from John Wayne airport were still flying as if routine. I tried to take a video with my phone but only came up with some audio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed bright sphere orange with a bright yellow center, almost as if a plane, or even a helicopter started to ignite into a fireball. It slowly became larger, although it seemed to get closer in distance rather then thinking it was increasing in size, but it doubled it&#39;s shape and visibility. It reached it&#39;s highest point in the sky and the ball stood still, lasting 2 minutes, glowing very bright similar to fire. This object had no internal movement and froze at the time that I witnessed this, while taking 3 fast pictures with my cell phone camera. It appeard to dim down a touch after those couple of minutes and somewhat looked as it was in motion straight backwards in the direction it arrived from. Viosible in Northwest corner of the sky very close from my location. I arrived home in 1 minute prior to witnessing, yelled out of the car ! window to my father to look, as we watched it fade into literally nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The head light faded out slowly as they moved in perfect sequence. A minute after those two disappeared from view a massive triangle shaped 3 point light came from the horizon. We captured the video and my whole neighborhood saw it.  They went by slowly and again the front light faded and then all 3 of the eventually. About 30 minutes later we kept gazing and we saw individual lights zig zagging back and fourth. Also it looked like airplanes where chasing them and herding them up like cattle. Almost looked like a star wars battle in the sky with 15 to 20 smaller lights that moved at super fast speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He went outside to bring in 4 empty trash cans and upon reaching the street he saw a baseball size sphere of blue light that traveled in a straight line through the woods on the other side of the street. Initially the object was about 1 block away and moving towards and in front of him. It flew past him and seemed to be moving fairly constantly and he said rough estimate of 15 mph. After watching this for a couple of seconds fear set in, hair stood on end and feeling some shock he started back for the house. He dropped the cans in hand and started to head back up the driveway but then this damned thing appears right by his head and he swipes his hand at it and misses. He swipes his hand at it again and he says he hit it and it hit the ground with a thud. He felt a temperature change when his hand made contact but he ! couldn&#39;t tell if it was hot or cold. He says it vibrated on the ground and then disappeared. [I&#39;m not clear on exactly how this event ended. I need to talk further with him]. I know this sounds crazy but I do believe him. My son is an impressive person and highly regarded both professionally and in college. He was shaken by this so I know something real happened. I am wondering if its possible this was ball lightning or if anyone else has had a similar experience. Thanks for any feedback you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then turned right trying to find a detour. I had just mentioned how good of time we were making bc i looked at the clock it was 8:00. We came upon a very dark wooded area in the road. My mom said wow that is really dark. That is the last thing either of us remember. Then next thing we knew we looked at the clock, it was 8:30. It literally felt like seconds before it was 8:00! My 21 month old daughter had been fussy right before the woods, but was now very quiet. The dogs had been panting but were now still and quiet. Everything was earily quiet! We felt very disoriented and realized we were miles from where we originally were and in the totally wrong direction. Based on my memory and my good sense of direction, and my mothers knowledge of the area it made no sense to be where we were.  I then noticed a burning bump in the! back of my head behind my right ear. My mother felt very numb and extremely disoriented. We both felt as though we had a sunburn, a hot, tight feeling on our faces. She then noticed a bump in her head in the SAME spot. They looked like fresh needle marks. We drove to my mothers house in Seaford in shock and disbelief of what just happened. Since being home we have experienced headaches, neck aches, and feeling shakey. However, the swelling behind the ear has gone down on both of us. I was unable to find a mark on my daughter. We are upstanding citizens and this is NOT a hoax! Something very strange happened to us tonight, something we will never forget. We are thankful we had each other to share our experience with bc it defies logic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am not sure off hand of the exact date but I know it was at the end of the month and on a Saturday early evening when it is still very light outside with daylight being summertime.  My husband who is an aviation engineer and I were both in front of our home.  My husband was near the side of the house shearing the shrubbery and I was sitting on the garden bench we have out front near the lawn with my dog.  I looked to my left past our neighbors house and I see two silver objects in the sky.  Both were the same shape, flattish, long and disk shaped.  This is not my first time seeing UFO objects and my husband being a skeptic, I decided to wait a few moments to see if they were just airplanes or whatnot. We do live below a flight path.  After approximately 2 minutes of these objects just sitting there, I then call to my husband and tell him to quickly come here. I point to them and he then sits at the curb in fro! nt of our home and tells me to get the binoculars.  I hurried inside and came right out with them.  He looks through the binoculars at them and by this time they have moved more to the right, one is higher than the other, and they are at a diagonal position one from the other.  He gives the binoculars to me and helps me to know just where I should hold them to see the objects.  What I saw was amazing as they looked to be spinning incredibly fast yet not moving.  Hard to explain, you would have to see them.  Also there seemed to be a red tinge at the bottom of both objects.  After looking what I felt to be long enough, I then give the binoculars back to my husband.  After looking for about another minute, he informs me that they both just disappeared.  He is skeptic.  I am not.  His explanation is that they are unlike anything that he has ever seen before.   This will sound unbelievable and strange, but I had a strong feeling that I would see a UFO four hours before.  And this had happened to me when I was younger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was laying on my back on the beach with my wife next to me when I saw what looked like a star in the sky. I noticed that the object was below the clouds. I realized that the object was not a star and I got the binoculars which I had with me and sighted in the object. Wow, I had a clear view of a silver object which looked like two balls stuck together.  I told my wife about it and she also was able to see it with the binoculars.  We watched it for over an hour as it hovered over the beach.  About 3:00 pm the object began getting smaller. I belive it was rising.  There were no clouds near the object at this time.  About ten minutes later the object began moving westward towards the sun.  I was not able to follow it any longer due to the brightness of the sun.<n>

Sahara Blvd. in broad daylight.  I stopped my car to watch it pass over our store and received some light skin burns to the left side of my face and lips.  It was pulsing with a bright white light in the center of the ship flying very low maybe only 75 ft above our building.  Suddenly 3 military helicopters appeared over our building dropped down right out of the sky in hot pursuit of the object which sped on towards NE Las Vegas and disappeared on the horizon.  Migs were observed scrambling overhead.  The same thing was observed by a friend of mine also proceeding down Sahara Blvd to work.  I am a college professor and he is a military officer and both of us saw the same thing.  When I asked him what he thought. he said, &amp;quot; That object the helicopters were following was not from this world&amp;quot; .  He is very aware what sort of flying vehicles the military has and I am in agreement. This occurred on June 27th 10am in las Vegas, nv at Sahara and Jones avenues .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We originally posted this report, but in error.

A minute later he says what is that? I say where? he says in front of the car, and about twenty feet in front of the car were two lights shaped like two cylinders about three inches long with a glow around them and one on top of the other with about two inches between them. I start walking towards them with my arm outstrethed trying to touch them the lights did not move they were completely still until I seemed to get too close and they disapeared and in a blink of an eye and they were ten feet away. I walked towards them again trying to touch them and they disapeared again and were ten feet away again. My buddy got out of the car and laughed and said, it must be a reflection off of my glas! ses, and I said but I can see them too and in a blink of an eye they were off onto the drivers side of the car and in a flash they were in front of us again and in a blink of an eye they were off on the drivers side of the car again and then they were gone. I know this was not a bug or insect because bugs and insects are not in two pieces, they do not light up and stay motionless they fly, not disapear and reappear ten feet away. The only thing I have ever seen that moves as fast as these things did is a hummingbird and this was not a bird, a hummingbird will move even while staying in one place and they are not in two pieces and they do not light up. I don&#39;t know if this was a small UFO but, I have never seem anything as strange or move as fast as these things did. When you looked at these lights you were mesmerized you could not take your eyes off of them, they looked like a hologram but they were very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/27/12 02:15|Seattle|WA|Egg|15 minutes|lights started appearing out of nowhere.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90159.html|115|ndxe201206| lights started appearing out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on patrol last night at my job in downtown Seattle, and just doing a routine rove around my building when strangely enough something caught my eye in the sky. As i looked up into the night shy for about 5 to ten minutes a bright flash appeared dead center in the sky witch kinda freaked me out, I have always believed in UFO&#39;s I have just never witness it in person until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i remained glued to the clear night sky and as soon as my eye&#39;s started to focus in on the stars there it was (first one) a faint redish yellow object appeared it had to be 80 or 90 thousand feet in the air way higher than any airplane I&#39;ve seen before but it was traveling pretty fast no sound was heard and slowly vanished. At this point i was kinda freaked out but excited that i saw this. 5 minutes later as i continued to look around in the sky another (second one) this one was kinda scary as it was very close could of been approx 4 - 500 feet from where i was standing it was really bight, the color of light was a hyper white blue amber color and was descending to the street level really quick. Again there was no sound coming from it and out of nowhere it suddenly vanished behind the building that was about 2 blocks from our building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I hope someone else witnessed that too as i couldn&#39;t of been the only one that saw this. Almost instantly after witnessing that I was about to head back inside my building and saw what i still cant figure out what to actually call it (third one?.) Three green blips of light occurred right above that where I saw the bright light descend down behind the building. Kind of like a connect the dots type of motion is the best way to describe the event - Fist one flashed top, bottom left, then bottom right. Like i said before I have never witnessed anything this strange ever while working here in my 10 years, last night was definitely an eye opener. I will have my camera with me from this point forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The three lights were connected by some beefy metal frame (?) with no visible cockpit. At times it followed us from behind, right above the freeway, then along side to the east of the freeway, at no more than 300 yards away from us, hovering at our driving speed of ~80mph.  We were the only sedan on the freeway, but there were plenty of trucks on lane #2. I am sure that many of the truckers have also seen it,<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights were extremely bright, unlike LED or halogen or any light source that I am familiar with, and would hover to the front of us at probably 2-300mph, then immediately turn 180 degree, shine the three lights directly at us, and traveling in reverse at 80-90mph.  It would than just glide over to the east of us, and while hovering next to us, it was completely silent, unlike a regular plane or jet, which would have made a loud jet engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights later turned into nine smaller lights with red/orange/blue/greenish color, all moving in uniform, as if it splits into three UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would then immediately merge back into 3 large bright lights, hovering mainly on the east side of hwy 5.  The UFO flew next to us for almost five miles until we reached W Ness Ave (exit 385) before it flew south and disappeared into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wish we had a video camera.  After seeing other similar youtube videos, I am glad we were not seeing things.<n>

And I was amazed at how filled the sky was with stars. I followed one shooting star as it went down.  Then noticed a bright light that moved quickly out of view. It was a large ball of bright white light that flew below the tree line north of Mingus Mountain Campground from west to east, towards the radio towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not bounce around, and its intensity seemed constant.  Until it disappeared behind a ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size is hard to estimate.

Over the last year,  early in the morning  when the skies are clear I have witnessed individual lights moving in a pattern inconsistent with any satellites; usually diagonal across the sky instead of North to South or East to West.  Some of the objects are brighter than any stars and do not blink. Some blink very brightly without a consistent pattern.  What is most puzzling is that I have followed these objects across the sky and then suddenly there is an intense flash and it disappears.  It reminds me of Star Trek when a ship jumps to light speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I have worked in IT Security, Legal and Compliance for many very large corporations for the past 22 years.<n>
6/27/12|Nampa|ID|||Three UFO's into one very low to ground above my house.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92198.html|119|ndxe201206| Three UFO&#39;s into one very low to ground above my house<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Over My House<n> <n><n> <n><n> In late June 2012 about a week before the fourth (sic) my friend yelled for me to come outside.  There was obvious panic in her voice so I rushed down the stairs to see what was wrong. Not knowing I would forever lose my skepticism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried downstairs and out to the west facing front of my home.  My friend was on step up to her vehicle and pointing southward and her mom was standing in the middle of my yard dumbfounded as I was about to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Streaking up from the south were three various colored orbs some distance part and bounding over themselves.  A group of dolphins racing ahead of a boat is best possible description I could use to describe the incredible orbs. I have never been so exillerated and frightened in my life. And never did my flight or fight instinct kick in harder then that moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three orbs varied in color from white,to blue, to green, and a pinkish red.  They had a subtle pulse as they flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurred to my that arming myself was dumb and so was running so I took out my iphone and began to shoot video.  As I was getting phone out from pocket the three orbs seemed to morph into a single shape.  The entire time spinning in a barrel style roll.  The lights from the orb even elongated like a water balloon stretching.  Then they slowed down and began to hover in a non-standard almost wish-washy way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my phone on then and I&#39;ll let the video I will attach say the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note I do mention a helicopter about 2 minutes into video and I was referring to the chopper that is almost always in the sky by the highway near my home.  And my friend was on phone to husband as she explained what we were seeing.  He suggested many things but none were possibilities and my comment referred to there conversation as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the best part is in the last 30 seconds of video<n>

The next second the beam changed to a white light.  At the time I thought it was a helicopter.  I kept driving towards it, and saw it had a blue and red flashing lights.  When I approached it, I stopped the car to take a picture, only to figure out my camera wasn&#39;t in the car, so I don&#39;t have proof.  It was a VERY HUGE triangle with one blue, one red, and one white light on each points, silently hovering  approximately two hundred feet over some trees, and a farmhouse on the south side of the road, directly on my left. It stayed there silent and motionless, but I became to scared to stick around so I started driving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/26/12 23:30|Fresno|CA|Sphere|20 seconds|Object being chased by 2 fighter jets|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90215.html|121|ndxe201206| June 26, 2012 – 23:30 pm (approx. time) Weather: Clear sky, no clouds, half moon to east (Not visible to me) Sky view (degrees) est: 120 – north/south, 90 – east/west Fresno, CA (Northeast)   Object being chased by 2 fighter jets  At approximately 11:30 pm on June 28, 2012, I let my dogs out to do their nightly business.  As usual, I went out with them to look at the stars.  I was just getting ready to go back inside when I heard a louder than usual jet engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see two military fighters flying in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed.  They appeared to be at about 10 to 12 thousand feet (estimated).  I am not sure how fast they were going. Certainly not above mach I, but close, maybe.  They were in a slight climb as they passed almost directly overhead.  All of their navigational lights and strobes were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just in front of the fighters (approximately one quarter of a mile), I saw a single, pale, greenish/white, spherical light that was about the size of a ballpoint pen tip.  It was pulling away, slightly, from the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later, the object executed a slight climbing right turn to the southwest, and accelerated, increasing the distance from the fighters as they turned to follow it. At that point, the object disappeared (winked out).  The jets continued to the southwest until I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds from the time I first saw the jets until the object winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is unusual to see any aircraft flying north to south at the altitude I observed, because of the proximity to Fresno Air Terminal, and the traffic patterns.  Though, at 11:30 pm, there is almost no air traffic at all.  Also, the Air National Guard is based at FAT, and they tend to keep noise levels at a minimum over the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Information Technology Analyst, and a private pilot, and have lived in Fresno, CA for more than sixty years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was unusual since it blinked in an abnormal pattern. It was brightly blinking.  A it traveled across the sky I stepped off of my porch tp watch this object cross the sky in a due north western direction. As it got closer to me I noticed that it didn&#39;t look nothing like an airplane.  It was diamond shape.Airplanes usually have those red and blue lights flashing on them. This was a continuous white flashing light crossing the sky. I watched it for as long as I could and even walked over towards my neighbors house to keep it in sight. It was moving fast unlike the two objects I saw earlier. For as low as it was there was a slight sound to it that should&#39;ve been louder like the airplane flying over me now. at 23:34 heading into the eastern direction. I can hear that plane loud and clear. But the objec! t in question I could barely even hear and it was lower than the one heading east. They didn&#39;t even blink the same. The object in question was very bright. It blinked rapidly with only white lights. I don;t know what it was, but it wasn&#39;t a normal airlines plane. And it wasn&#39;t no meteorite either. And if you say it was a weather balloon then I&#39;m a monkey&#39;s uncle. That&#39;s how serious I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I saw a bright light that resembled Venus only brighter.  I gazed at object for about ten seconds and slowly like a dimmer switch reduced to nothing.  It never moved. There weren&#39;t any clouds  in the sky. However I kept looking to see if the light would return, but it didn&#39;t. I described it to my girlfriend lying beside me, but would be awkward for her to view.<n>

One was heading due north. I noticed it out of the side of my eye even though it was a extremely faint light. There were no blinkking lights on it. Neither one of them. ASn airplane flew just in front of the first one and lept goin heading east. The plane flew higher than most planes but it was still closer than this object.  Both objects to be exact. I watched this object for about 40 seconds and then lost track of it.  I scanned the sky and found another extremely faint light traveling due south off to the righ of where the original spotted light was. I don&#39;t wear glasses and I could still see this light even though it was very faint. That&#39;s why I knew that these two objects weren&#39;t traveling in our atmosphere. It was way fainter than the International Space Station would appear in the sky. Besides I don&#39;t think the ISS would travel in two opposite directions. The time was 10:35 p.m. Venus is much brighter than what ! they were. But these were white lights with no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I continued to watch it move through the sky in a northernly direction it became very bright and was orange in color.  I jokingly told my friend who was also on the deck that there was a ufo.  He moved over next to me a saw the bright orange object continue to move across the horizon through the sky and then vanish over the trees.  The orange object was moving fairly slowly and was quite large relative to other objects in the sky.  It left no trail.  It made no noise.  There was a slight undulation to the path of the object as it moved through the sky. Movement was parallel to the horizon.<n>

It didnt make any sound and had to be a very long distance away from earth! What ever it was it was big and fast! I know a little about jets and how fast they travel across the sky this thing was every bit of mach 2 or faster!  The way it disapeared was very unnatural i live in a flight path so i know what planes look like at nite this was for certain not anything from this earth!! It was seen on top of chalkville mtn rd close to walmart if there is anyway to search the radar history and post up any info id love to check back and see what you guys have found..

My step dad has an app on his cell phone the shows where the ISS and all sats are at any given time so he checked where the known Sats and ISS where. ISS did not pass over for another 2 minutes. The object was moving from east to west We then watched the orange glowing light disapear. We then watched ISS pass at the right time over the other side of the horizon from west to east or in that general area. Also no sound was made. This was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was moving straight from east to west.  The object looked like it was about kite level.  About the distance that I sees the hawks fly.  The object was orange in color, and was flickering in a slower than flame pattern.  The bottom part of the object was almost rectangle shaped at the bottom base and was highlighted with a little red around the edges.  The upper area of the object was almost a lighter orange but had no outline. AND NO SOUND AT ALL!  I have seen the sky lanterns and weather balloon images and it was definitely more alive. Almost organic looking... it looked like it had a slight chug momentum almost like a swimming stroke. It was on an east to west path and then just dissipated almost like in to the clouds.  But it was a cloud free night.  I have just started having strange urges to look in to this stuff like the nephi! lim and angles and I have never even thought about looking into the sky.  I have had a strange feeling in my heart the last few days and it is so strange I happened to see this with 2 other people.  The strangest is that we just found out my wife was pregnant and we were breaking the news the moment the object showed up… I had heard recently that if you use the name of Jesus it would leave so I prayed aloud, “In the name of the lord Jesus Christ I rebuke you”. And it started to vanish.  IT DID INDEED FEEL EVIL.<n>

It was going slower than a plain, headed towards the Henty train station and then another one following it but this time it was going for the Henty water tanks and then two more these ones were going for the Henty field days site and Holbrook way.   I didn’t  actually have a camera on me at the time but if someone gave me an A4 sheet of paper, I’d be able to draw them.

It was a consistent bright ultra white light that traveled at a very consistent speed.  There were no flashing markers, and absolutely no sound at all.  I could compare it against other aircraft in the sky but it did not act like any commercial airplane.  The duration took about 3 minutes to travel across the sky until I lost it to the trees so not horizon to horizon.  Maybe a satellite or an airplane?<n>

He saw this during breakfast on his way to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was behind Mc Donald&#39;s in the parking lot at Allen Dale eating a ham biscuit.  I was supposed to meet fellow employees at Mc Donalds before going to work.  They were late and I was eating alone.   It was approx 5:30am and it was still dark.  When I noticed a ball of flame shoot over the mountain.  It shot in a straight line then zig zagged and disappeared going south east to south west over top of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was directly over the US government installation BAE systems (an aeronautical defense company) located in Kingsport. BAE systems was formerly known as Holston Defense.    The Fireball was the size of a soccer ball in the sky and compared to normal sized stars it did not fit the usual description. It was very large with a piercing bright white and phosphorous glow. The sighting only lasted for a few seconds. I didn&#39;t hear anything, and it was too big to be compared to a typical shooting star. It did not travel down towards the earth, but instead It traveled horizontal and then zig zagged until it disappeared.   I do not believe it was a shooting star simply because it did not travel in the expected path of something entering into the earths atmosphere, and it was unusually large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then continued on to work and did not mention it until this evening around 10pm<n>

It had been raining very hard and very windy due to Tropical Storm Debbie. When I opened the door I expected to have to use the umbrella but it had stopped raining. I walked the dog around my cul-de-sac and directly across the street from my house to the west above the tree line was  very bright deep orange lights. I was trying to figure out what I was looking at and I was mesmerized by the light. It was not high in the sky or was it far away. As I was looking at this light it was intensifying with a back &amp; forth movement. I went into the house still trying to wrap my brain around what I had just seen. Later that morning my dog was in the yard and was barking loudly at 2 baby owls sitting on my back fence. My husband grabed his phone &amp; took a picture of them. He watched them later fly into our Palm Tree where they stayed for 2 days. On 6/28/2012 he took pictures of them and I sent those on to you Mr. Davenpor! t. I had told a close friend about what I saw and then I tried to report it to the local news networks but they said that it wasn&#39;t newsworthy. I beg to differ....Then on the morning of 6/28/2012 on GMA at 7:30 there was a report by Robin Roberts and George Stepanopolis  about UFO sightings and my friend then called that what I had told her 2 days ago was being verified in different states.  From then on I have been trying to process what I have seen and know to be real. We are not alone.  Since the sighting or encounter I have been feeling very anxious because I do not feel free to discuss this .  I am certain about what I have seen. My dog saw it also because he used to love to go out and walk but now he will not go past the driveway. He turns around and wants to go back into the house. He also stands behind the heavy wood Door and barks at nothing? I feel like I have expierenced something so very special but on the other hand it makes me feel like we have absolutely no cont! rol over anything. Thank YouUFO<n>

Both patterns  met in the middle and two lights occasionally tailed off, with one light chasing after the other.  No beams of light were visible from the ground and the source was not determined.  This was witnessed by residents, a PP&amp;L utility worker, and multiple police officers.  A resident even called this in to 911.<n>

I looked up and I saw five reddish lights moving from west to east in a linear formation. My cousin was talking to the rest of my family on her cell phone, and encouraged them to come out of the house and see the strange occurrence. Many family members came out the front door I previously exited and looked towards the sky to see two of the remaining lights. The lights seemed to disappear in order of most eastern (first) to the most western (last).  Once the lights disappeared presumably into the clouds, as I recall, there was significant cloud cover (enough to obscure the moon but thin enough to still allow some light to shine through).  I saw few if any stars in the sky, which made the red lights much more noticeable. So it seemed the lights were travelling below the clouds.  I was certain that they were moving to the east as their pathway took them behind a tree (from my vantage point) indicating movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, after some hesitation, I decided to go on my walk and ultimately stopped at a nearby park, overlooking Lake Erie. I sat on the bench to rest and observe the lightning on the northern horizon. Then I was surprised to see a single red light almost identical the previous lights I had seen was rising from the east until it stopped abruptly. It seemed to flicker for a moment and then disappeared without perceivably moving. From that point, I walked home and prepared for bed.<n>

She was still skeptical it was the moon because the color of the full moon reflected off the object (because it was metallic) but I pointed out that the moon couldn&#39;t have been in that position or moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure what I&#39;d seen that night, but the next morning (in the separate report I just sent in) I was in the car with my aunt driving on the highway in Lee (same town, completely different area) and saw, without a reasonable doubt, the exact same flying object or model of object I&#39;d seen the night before in the same town!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell it was metallic, rectangular, and the same size as it had been the night before, but I saw it in both full daylight sun and at night, so I was able to fully confirm that it was metallic, rectangular, flying too fast for a normal aircraft, and roughly the size of a bed but maybe thicker?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

I looked up in the sky for some reason and saw a bright light moving at a fast rate of speed.  The sky was black and there were stars shining but this light was different.  Almost white hot- and moving.  At first I thought maybe it was a plane or weather object but there were not flashing red or blue lights.  Then there was another slower moving less bright light going in the opposite direction of the first bright light.  I ran inside to get my father but when we stepped back out both lights were gone and only the regular stars were visible.  My father mentioned it could be the satellite station but to me it looked like a huge ball of white light traveling at a high rate of speed.  I am wondering if anyone else witnessed this event tonight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

A glowing orange/red object appeared over the beach around 6th street. There was no noise comming from the object and it did not seem to have a solid shape.  My 14 year old son saw it first and he called my attention to it.  We were on the boardwalk and the object was over the beach near the ocean.  We could not determine the distance between us and the object. There were people on the beach and the object looked like it was over their heads but they did not seem to see it. I belive the object was farther behind them.  The object was moving slowly upwards for about five minutes, then it stopped rising and went out over the ocean against the wind. We watched it for about another five minutes before it was out of our sight.<n>

I was driving on Rt 18 heading south and as I came closer I noticed these dark winged objects would reflect a bright metallic  silver light every so often, mainly when changing direction.The part that reflected was sperical in shape.  They didn&#39;t move fast,about the same movement as a hawk would only would move down, bank, then move sharply upward.I could see horizontal wings but they had smaller verticle wings on the ends of them. I pulled into a parking lot to get a better veiw and noticed one was not visible.  I got my camera and took a few shots of the one, but it was moving away south towards Spotswood and may be too hard to make out.  (Have to get film developed)  The one that was left was moving agaist the wind, so it wasn&#39;t a baloon as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

There was like a haze around the entire object but the center was a very bright white.  It looked like a bright star with an outline where wings should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling slowly enough at first that I thought it was an aircraft.  I slowed down to keep the object in sight and realized that there was no jet stream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights.  There was no sound.  The angle of ascent was not like a plane, as it was climbing at a near 90 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I reached the last stretch of highway, before reaching hwy. 14, with the jail in sight,the object was moving S.E. and upward at an incredible speed and just disappeared.  I figured that it disappeared very high in the sky, but, if I had been standing right under it and looking up, I think the last place I would have seen the object would have been right around the post office area on Hwy. 26 or Milton Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed this craft it seemed to be traveling at an angle of about 60-70 degrees then rapidly changed to about 80-85 degrees on acceleration.  The last impression I had of this craft was a glowing rectangle, outlined black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting Ive had of UFO craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first was unreported in the winter of 1975 or 1976.  My cousin was with me as well and the space craft was literally hovering over us and the top of a now dead Oak tree, for approximately five minutes.  There are questions about time displacement I have been struggling with for years about that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I bring that up is because although the crafts style was very much different, the flight behavior was very similiar.  They both had a gradual acceleration and then &amp;quot;poof&amp;quot;, outta sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was scouting the sky for more planes I saw what looked a star in the sky suddenly moved straight north to what I thought was Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im totally stunned by what I just seen and told my son to look and he saw the same thing, it was to far away to be a plane.  I quickly downloaded the google star map app and pointed to the area where I saw the UFO move and my app said it was Antares. The object flew up to Antares and never moved past it as far as I could tell.  I am totally excited to see this event happen and hope someone else out there seen it too.<n>

As it got closer I noticed it looked as if it had some sort of spotlight that I saw shine twice. It did not shine down on the ground from where I was at but I did see the light in the air. No lights were blinking on the aircraft and it was not making any noise that we could hear. As it flew by the light that was only shining, in what I believed to be the front of the craft, lit up enough that I saw it was a grayish color and appeared to be a disk shape with something on top.  A couple of days before this we had seen another light like this one and didn&#39;t really know what is was. However it was not flying as low as this one.  When I mentioned this to my daughter and her friend they has seen a strange light also on the other side of town.  This area has also been experiencing some electrical power outages in a neighboring community.  After seeing this it made me wonder if they could be related. I have never seen anything like this and have no idea what it is. It scared me and I hope to not see it again but felt it should be reported.<n>

I had to look twice as it was very noticeable and more than a mile away along a very large, continueous mountain range.  Speed estimated at aprox. 120 mph and increasing at a constant rate in a very strait and horizontal path.  This was on a clear and very hot day and just south of Sunflower Arizona. I was down touring and adventuring as i am from Edmonton Alberta Canada.<n>

I am sure nobody will believe my story, but i have to tell it anyway. I do not care about getting famous or gaining anything from this. People have to know what i saw. NO i do not use drugs,i was not drunk, and i normally don´t belive in ghost ,UFOs or God(even if my mother is a priest). I have to see things before i belive in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time i saw a UFO was when i was 15 years old and was walking home around 22:00 pm. I started to feel that it was strange that no street lights was on,no cars,no people, no lights in the windows, even the Gas station was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally at this time here in Umeå the area is full of life. but not tonight..i was totally alone, it was like time itself stopt, or i walked into some sort of twilight zone. I cant realy explain it any better. I look up into the sky and i saw this Disk come down from the sky(it was not in a straight line) more like it made a turn towards me and then it came down lower and lower towards me and then hovering ontop of me. If i had a snowball in my hand i would be able to throw it at the UFO, thats how close to it i was.  i just stood there looking at it like i was frozen or something.. i was not scared or anything but i could not move. it had lights under it and it did not make any sound what so ever. All i can say is that it was deffinitly NOT made by humans, the technology is way past anything we could dream about. it was gray/black/silver color. And someone was sitting inside it. I am not sure what they did but they returned exactly the same way they came down from..exactly! the same path down and up, the same curve. it had soft acceleration in beginning a few hundred meters and then it jumped lightspeed or something into the sky and dissapered. I have no idea if they abdukted me or something but i have had a strange electric place in my neck were dust seem to be drawn to. and for some reason i always BIP when i go thrue airport security and they cant understand why..and no i did not tell them about a crazy UFO story...because then they would not let me on the plane..thinking i am a crazy person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2:e disk was seen this morning at around 01:35 am in the same city but different part of the city. I was out walking home from a friends house (10 min from my apartment) and i feel a pain in my neck, i see this BIG UFO above me, same theme,shape,color,lights,no sound. same feeling of time stop.no lights on outside, no lights on inside apartments or houses. no people ,no cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i see the UFO fly away again. i have no memory of abduktion or getting beamed up or down or anything like that. why is this hapening to me? Today i feel strange, i am so hott in temperature, i dont feel sick, its ..something else. yes its a hot sommerday outside but i am still super hott after a cold shower. i have ice cube bags on me and temperature is 40 C. And dust seem to fly towards my neck. i think some shit is in there also. like a metall tiny thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant stop thinking ..its like my head is filled with stuff/thoughts i cant controll, it keeps repeting over and over. its like a message that saying there is a war amongst the alien races and we happen to be in the middle of it or close to the front lines or something like that. But we humans are no threat to anyone because of our low technology. i guess they see us as a bunch of retarded children busy blowing each other up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont do drugs and i never have, i am not drunk, i am a normal guy. i am not crazy but i feel i am about to go crazy soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like people to know this story, i would like to be x-rayed and checked for metall stuff, i would like to be hypnotized to remember everything i saw, and yes i am ok with getting hocked up to a lie detektor. I am telling the truth here. !  I have to stop typing now because i am burning up.  !<n>

We turned off our black lights and started looking up.  The objects in the sky were going from left to right, and making 90 degree turns.  Several glowing lights were seen moving towards the big dipper.  I dont have the camera equipment to look up that high, and my camera phone proved unsuccessful.  At one point it appeared to look like a laser fight in the sky that lasted for about 5 minutes then it all stopped.  It was scary enough for my son to have bad dreams regarding what we saw, and to have him not wanting to be alone or by himself at anytime today.  I just am not sure what it was that we saw, but am positive it wasnt any type of plane or anything similar.  Please come down and sit on the lake with the lights out...and prove to me we are not crazy.  Thanks so much.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I both saw a silver (looked somewhat shiny) travelling at high rate of speed from north to south above a  mountain right in front of us.  It was definitely not a plane and it travelled so fast that we just stared at each other then said the same thing, Oh my god we just saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Creature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 24 I had a feeling in my mind and body that I was seeing something that night. I tried explaining the feeling to my bestfriend... I told her that I&#39;d show her what I had contact with 4 years ago. Something in me told me that I had to take her home, so I did. After I get home, I sit in my backyard until my other friend and his two friends come over. He also had contact with these ships 4 years ago. I can&#39;t explain it but once he got there, I give it 15 minutes. We see a triangle craft flashing lights at us TO MY MUSIC that was playing on my phone! I was lost in thought! I was going to take a picture but It moved away from sight. We decided to go to the spot 5 minutes from my house to be in the middle of nowhere to check the skies. We park beside a field of corn stock and the ship comes. But it moves across the sky slow. We get into the car to get closer, but it begins to leave. I stop the driver and I get out. It appears in another location, MAYBE over t! he Mississippi river. It sat there and opened the bottom hatch and a BEAM OF LIGHT shots down to the ground below it!!!! It slowly moves after that and another ship appears on the opposite side and they are slowly moving towards one another. Then they stop and flash red lights at us... Like it was a warning of some sort. Distracting us the whole time, we did not notice that they dropped something and whatever it was, IT CAME CLOSE TO US! Me and one other HEARD THE GROWL like noise. I looked in the tall field of corn and on top of that there was a white orb being followed by a red one, on ground level! It was maybe two car lenghts away from us. We left because of the growl and There is more, but it&#39;s strange signs. I have a feeling I will see more tonight. I don&#39;t know what to do, and there isn&#39;t really anyone to speak to about it because NOBODY will believe anything like this. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;ve been followed for years but every 4 years something has happened. 8 years! ago i was abducted. 4 years ago i had my first ufo sky event.! this ye ar, i got very close to something they released. I&#39;m afraid and I&#39;m not sleeping. I hope you believe this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/24/12 23:22|Johnstown|OH|Fireball|3-3 1/2 minutes|Bright Orange Ball of Light appeared suddenly|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90804.html|169|ndxe201206| Bright Orange Ball of Light appeared suddenly<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:22 PM, on June 24, 2012 a bright orange light suddenly appeared  in the sky from the South. The day had been sunny and warm, with the temps in the high 80’s, that evening we had no breeze, it was very still.  We had some light cloud cover from a “dry” cold front which was moving in sometime for early morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were watching TV in our Family Room.  I happen to look out and up and it appeared out of nowhere through the light, thin clouds, just above the roof of our house. Immediately I asked my husband if he’d seen it and told him, you’ve got to see this.  I quickly jumped out of my chair, and ran out our front door, with my husband right behind me.  It took us seconds, maybe 15 seconds at the most maybe, to get from the chair inside, out into the front yard.  It had changed from taking a straight line North direction in between the time it took for us to get out into our  front yard, by then it had had already taken a NE direction away from us toward Johnstown.  It moved very quickly and appeared to be already halfway at a distance away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright orange molten ball of light, glowing with orange energy waves which were pulsating from the top of  it.  A gas line exploded several years ago a little ways up on the main street we live off of, this object was just as bright or brighter orange than that, the evening the gas line exploded.  My husband told me it appeared to be large to him. We never seen anything like it before.  We knew everything it was not.  It was not a meteor, it had no tail, it was not moving fast enough to be a meteor.  It was not pulsating bright orange energy waves like a ”Chinese Lantern“ would.  It was not a stationary star, a shooting star or a falling star, there was a half moon that evening and it was just starting to rise in the west.   As it was moving away from us, it never made any noise, or sound, it was totally  silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this object heading ! away from us, there was a small plane in the sky at the same t! ime.  We heard a small airplane which was heading toward us from the North moving in a Southerly direction, it had the normal appearance of  an airplane with the white headlight and a blinking red~blue marking lights.  It is very common and something we’ve become very familiar with from evening airplane traffic.   We have constant airplane traffic both day and night, from private and commercial aircraft, going to and fro from Port Columbus.  We watched the object until it disappeared.  Our encounter lasted approximately 3-3 1/2 minutes<n>

The red lights seemed to be on the outside of the objects and it was difficult to tell the shape of them because of the distance away from us. These objects seemed to fly evenly spaced apart but not really in any sort of formation. We watched as we were traveling and then pulled off the road at Alderbrook Resort. We saw the 4 objects disappear into the sky and seem to become dim, white lights in the background. Within about 30 seconds 2 more objects appeared flying in the same direction as the others. One soon disappeared, becoming a dim, white light near where the other 4 were. The 6th object traveled further on away from the others heading north east. Within a minute or so it also disappeared into the sky appearing to be a dim, white light in the background. While our vehicle was stopped one of us got out and! was not able to hear any sounds coming from the objects. The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from the time we spotted the red lighted objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked up, and high above we saw something shoot by quickly, out of nowhere, and vanished in a few seconds, maybey two seconds. It was fast, but we saw its shape and color. It was a long streak like a teardrop, and while it shot by, we saw it turn blue, then red. But I&#39;m mostly reporting this just to know if anyone else in the Houston area saw it that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a large, brightly lit object, with no other lights, as an airplane would have.  The object made no sound at all. I ran into the house to get our video camera.  By the time I returned, my wife informed me that I was too late, as the object had simply disappeared directly over our home.<n>

The light did not appear to be as high as an airplane would fly. It came from the north west and was heading south west. It flew over us, and as it passed us, we could not hear any sound. It continued heading south west, but all we could see was the bright white light. I thought it may be the landing lights of an airplane when it was heading at us, but when it went over us and continued on, the light never disappeared, and we never saw the flashing lights like an airplane.  Again, no sound. I watched the object fly past us until it was about to diappear behind some trees, then the light began to dim, then it just went out. There was no other lights that came on like a plane, it just disappeared. I watched for a bit and never saw any more lights from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to sit on the deck, and discuss the incident, we actually saw two more lights, each at separate times.

I have a Video of it on my cell phone but is all you really see is a light of a cingular color coming at us.  There where 4 of us and after it went over the house we ran out back and another one must have come up because it should have been way past us but the light was not even over the Condo yet.  There had to have been two.<n>

My brother saw the light first and pointed out a single bright white light flying extremely fast.  We watched it fly for almost 10 seconds then it disappeared in mid air. It was a solid bright white light and didn&#39;t have any flashing lights around it. There were commercial planes flying lower than the light at much slower speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June/23/2012, the night before, I was outside having a cigarette and I saw what I thought was a really bright star. As I was looking at it, a blue ball of light separate from the white light, circled the light clockwise until it met the point where it emerged then it disappeared. I will be out there tonight with a camera and video camera in case there&#39;s another.<n>

But from North to South in direction. The ISS and this object were visible at the same time and almost crossed paths at about 80 degrees WNW-SE. No noise was heard and it disappeared at about 70 degrees South, before the ISS disappeared out of site. It appeared to be very high and lasted about 40 seconds.  But not a meteor.  Too slow for a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The object appeared to travel about the speed of a passenger jet. I observed the object for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, then changed positions so I could see it over the roof of my house. I then observed the object for approximately 5 to 10 more seconds until the object slowly dimmed and faded away. The object did not accelerate away, it&#39;s light just dimmed slowly until it couldn&#39;t be seen.(dimming process approximately 3 seconds) The object appeared to be slightly lower than other aircraft I observed this night (I had seen some passenger jets later on in the night), but this object was only one solid bright green/yellow light. No blinking lights as with passenger jets. It was a very clear night. The only object in the sky that was brighter was the 1/5 to 1/4 cresent moon in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spend alot of that time looking at the stars. Tonight I just happened to look up and see a white light that at first I thought was a meteor, but soon realized it was moving too slow. Much faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen but too slow for a meteor. I watched it for about 4 seconds before it was obscured by trees. It stayed solid white (no strobes) and stayed the same brighness the whole time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat for about ten minutes trying to figure out what it could have been. I finally decided it had to be a piece of space debris re entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up to go inside when I saw another much brighter light traveling in the same direction (east). It was moving much slower. Closer to the speed of a plane. It appeared to be lower or bigger. It was also solid white with no strobes. It was bright enough that I could see it through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say the second was a plane but there were no strobes and the light never changed in brightness the entire time I watched it (approx. 30 seconds)<n>

I live on Valliant on a corner house. A metalic spherical object just appeared in the direction I was looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round in shape and pulsating as it got brighter the pulsating looked to be faster. I was looking up at about 30 degrees. I called over the person that just pulled up at the neighbors house to see it and in the time it took her to walk across the street it faded out like a light being turned off and all the sudden it was gone just like that. As we stood there and I was pointing at where it was it re-appeared lower because it flew out farther from me in a North Eastern direction. The lady saw it again as it got brighter for about a minute and stayed stationary in one spot. The girl came out from the house and the lady I was standing with called her over. By the time she got across the street it faded out again and disappeared.It again re-appeared further out as it was going in the NE direction. We all saw it as it started moving a tiny bit and made a short little white broken up comtrail behind it that was kind of broken up then stopped as the trail stopped behind it and sat stationary again then faded out and disappered in the same position it sat stationary. I got two pictures of it when it was at it&#39;s furthest away when I ran up stairs to see if I could see it over the houses.I was talking to my mom on my phone and didnt think at the time it was at it&#39;s closest to take a picture of it with my phone (DUMB ME I KNOW). This is the second sighting I have had, the first one was shapped differently. I don&#39;t know if our military has any drones that disappear before your eyes that are small. In relative size to a start if you put them side by side it looked to be about 5-8 times bigger then a star. It looked to be about a half mile from my home the first time and about 200 - 300 feet above the house across the street! I don&#39;t have a program that does spell ch! eck so sorry if some words are wrong. I type fast too!<n>
6/24/12 20:00|Smyrna|TN|Light|3 minutes|Stationary light looked like a star or planet moved across the sky and turned into what looked like a cigar shaped craft|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90082.html|184|ndxe201206| Stationary light looked like a star or planet moved across the sky and turned into what looked like a cigar shaped craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and me were leaving from Smyrna, TN heading toward Murfreesboro, TN on Murfreesboro Road (that part of the road changes names but it&#39;s all still Murfreesboro Road). It was around 8 pm June.24.2012 we were still in Smyrna and had just gotten off the ramp by the Nissan plant heading toward where Florence Rd crosses over. *I&#39;m being specific for anyone else who witnessed this in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a single bright light in the sky which we thought was a star or planet (I was sure of that) because it was just sitting there not moving at all and it looked like any other typical star/planet that you&#39;d see on any given night. As I was driving (maybe 2 or 3 miles later) my daughter said it looks like it&#39;s moving, I said it could be us driving and it just looks that way. But then to me it did look like it was slightly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden it began to travel across the sky and downward, gaining speed. I said what the hell? Then I started thinking it was a meteor but I couldn&#39;t figure out why it was sitting in the sky like that? After it went from the left to right side of the road and was headed more downward I then pulled over (I was about a quarter mile past Florence Rd). The bright light went out and some smaller lights appeared around it and I could now see a long dark cigar shaped object. It slowed down almost barely moving to a complete stop for about 10 seconds and the lights were changing around the object (changing as in where they were located and from flashing to not flashing) all appeared to be small white lights and then took off again with great speed which I have never seen a plane do and went out of sight just that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to think of what this was, but after cycling though rational explanations I am left with none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone had to of seen this besides us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object when the bright light went out was very large, we couldn&#39;t see the object before that because the light was very bright. I didn&#39;t see any wings and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I&#39;d like to point out: 1. It was stationary and looked like a star/planet nothing unusual about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. It then moved very fast across and downward falling like a meteor would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. The bright light went out and we could see a long dark object with no wings or sound and smaller lights appeared around it. It looked like a mist/veil type glow was around it. Maybe a thin cloud? 4. It hovered, traveled very fast,moved slow and came to a complete stop (things which a plane,star,planet,meteor does NOT do! At least I have never seen anything have movements or abilites like this.<n>

Object appeared to hover or move very slowly in distance. It did not appear to be a blimp (irregular shape, didn&#39;t reflect any sunlight). Traffic was moving slow, so there was some time to observe it, but I eventually lost it as it was somewhat low on horizon. I should note that there was an Giants-A&#39;s baseball game going on in Oakland at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the western sky like I usually do and noticed a light which at first glance I thought was a twinkling star.  Then I noticed it was too bright to be a star and appeared to be moving in a small figure eight motion.  I also saw a few flashes that appeared to be orange smoke.  This really surprised me because I was under the impression that this was very far away.  I then noticed a smaller light that appeared to come from the first.  This light was moving east and flashing infrequently.  It would flash a few times then was out of site until it flashed again at a significant distance from the last flashes.  As this light got about halfway across my field of vision 5 to 6 more of these small flashing lights appeared and moved out of my field of vision in every direction.   After these lights were gone a larger &amp;quot;craft&amp;quot; which I originally thought was a plane came into view.  It had a flash! ing light like any plane does but I noticed the whole side of the craft was lit.  I could clearly see the shape to be what I can only describe as a disc or saucer viewed from the side.  I watched this craft moving west towards the original light and it slowly dimmed out after it passed the original light.  The original light was still in the sky when I went back inside.<n>

Two of them moved further east or dropped below the horizon and the third high up light, then moved from the east upwards towards the north/northwest passing overhead just to the north of where I was standing. It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, listened for a sound and there was not any. All of these objects definitely looked as if they were control movements.  Tried to get my tablet/camera up and running but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I say a light appear in the sky to the southwest so I looked up all that I saw was stars and one really big bright star.  I figured I saw nothing about 10 seconds later I looked back at the bright star to notice a small dull light appear below it then it started moving north.  I told my friends to come look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 2 seconds later another small light appeared just under where the first one appeared and started on the same direction.  Then another appeared just above the big bright star that started on the same path.  Me and three of my friends watched for maybe 20 seconds as the lights moved together at a slow speed when we noticed the big bright star move to the south at a little bit of a faster pace then the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light moved across the sky for another 20 seconds then stopped the move pack southwest and up and disappeared in less then a second.

Still in football terms in moved about 10-30 more yards away at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no noise, there was 4-5 of them.  They were all separate and were aout 2-3 minutes apart.  They didn&#39;t all go due north.  Some went Northeast some went Northwest, some North.<n>

We believed at this point that it was the International Space Station since it seemed to be moving at about the same speed.  Before the object was directly overhead it faded out like when viewing satellites. Once it was directly overhead it became brighter and we could see a dark grey oval silhouette with a single orange light on the back.  It kept moving until it was out of site. It was hard to gage the actual size but it seemed big.  There was no sound and there were no other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed.

After a minute she came in the house and called me to tell me there was something in the sky. I found that very odd and ran down the stairs to go outside to check it out. There were ten or more red-orange orbs in the sky. My mother told me that there were even more  before she called me. Very strange. My brother followed me, and I went to call my father. By the time he got there, about all of them had &#39;disappeared&#39; except one, which stayed there for a prolonged period of time before disappearing. I reported this also here:<n> <n><n> http://www.ufostalker.com/ufostalker/UFO+Sighting+in+Nanticoke+Pennsylvania+United+States+on+June+10th+2012/39163, and I&#39;ve found that there were other people in the area who have witnessed this.

As it traveled north, you could see changes in cloud around the object and finall it burnt and there was nothing more<n>

My wife and I were walking our dogs in a field a couple miles West of Santa Rosa. My wife had stopped to watch the sky and called for me to look at something. She asked if an object moving across the sky was a jet or not. She had been watching it for quite a while before mentioning it to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a light much too large to be a high flying aircraft. Rather than being a small pinpoint, it was maybe the equivalent of 1/8&amp;quot;-1/4&amp;quot; at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was South and slightly West of us heading roughly East. I would estimate it was about 25-30 degrees from the horizon. I assumed it to be an aircraft at first because there is an air traffic lane that comes in off the ocean about due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a strange color somewhat like a high pressure sodium light. The intensity sort of &amp;quot;undulated&amp;quot;, but we could see no strobes. There was no sound. The other odd thing was the flight path. It didn&#39;t seem to travel in a smooth straight trajectory. It sort of bobbled around on it&#39;s path. Also, it climbed steadily and got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. It disappeared about 45-50 degrees from the horizon and about Southeast of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately two minutes later, my wife spoke out about another one. This one was farther West when I saw it than the previous object, and much lower. Lower to the point I thought it might have just taken off from a nearby airport, but there are no airports West of Santa Rosa.   We observed this light follow a similar path to the Southwest climbing rapidly in an undulating trajectory until it disappeared in the same spot as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 11:15 I was looking at the sky and noticed an unusually bright orange light approaching us from the south.  I called to my husband to look and said “That’s not a plane is it?”  It kept getting higher and closer and then changed direction and quickly started going to the east where it then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few  minutes later we both saw another very large, bright orange light low coming up from  the horizon in the west.   It seemed to come towards us (we were east of it) and then rapidly ascended to the east at  the same location where we saw the other one and  disappeared also. They both seemed to have some sort of pulsing movement in the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all.  When we saw the 2nd one I had an urge to hide as I thought it was coming toward us but it went up instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 nights ago at the same place, probably more around 11:00pm, we also saw what we thought was a satellite moving rapidly across the sky from south to north (we are familiar with satellites and the space station moving across the sky as well as what planes and helicopters look like)  as we were watching,  it gave a big bright flash of white light and was gone! I don’t know what the heck is going on in the sky here right now but I’m keeping my eyes open and my wits about me!<n>

The triangle also moved faster than an aircraft would. I know this because I have lived near an airport my whole life, and this was not an aircraft of U.S.A.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved for about 5 minutes and got dimmer and dimmer and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw this four more times and they were moving at different speeds. This occurred in a span of about one hour. There were several planes in the area that seemed to be tracking it. It was a very clear night so it couldn&#39;t have went into cloud cover. Two of us observed the same phenomenon with one object two nights before in Bennington, Vermont.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a sixty-year old woman and mentally stable. I&#39;ve never seen or reported anything like this before. My companions were a forty-tree old woman, a twenty-one year old woman and a twenty-two year old woman. All of sound mind.

I ran as fast as i could towards the parking lot and the whole way running down the boardwalk the chirping just got louder and more intense, it was so loud. when i finally hit the parking lot and i got to my car there was one man on a phone sitting in the parking lot but there was no chirping anymore and when we looked up at the sky all the stars were gone. not one star in the sky. when we got home we noticed just one in the sk! y, just floating, which we saw hours later still in the same s! pot. thi s was my first experience ever seeing anything like this. i have NO idea what was on the beach, literally on land. but all the little lights in the sky were mostly over the ocean and there were so many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My friends kept giving me a lot of shit because I was laying down just looking at the stars.  I love looking for satellites and shooting stars.  Any time from 23:00-23:30 a very bright circular light flew above us.  Standing up it was at about a 70 degree angle, so not right above us but not in the distance by any means.  I was watching it for a few seconds thinking it was a plane. I quickly realized at the altitude and how bright the lights were we should have easily seen flashing lights.  Once I saw this I yelled at everyone else to tell me what it was.  Their first reaction was a plane.  I told them if it was wouldn&#39;t there be flashing lights. They starting staring at it and we all knew it was not a plane! We watched it go threw the sky for awhile in a straight path. It started to raise and the light started to dim. So we thought it could be a plane rising in the sky. The light ended up comp! letely disappearing but where it disappeared at there is no way a plane would no longer be seen. Especially how bright it initially was. I fully believe 100% that we saw a UFO! I am the type of person who gets skeptic about this but I know it was nothing else other than a UFO!<n>

At first it looked to me as if it was a large meteor.  Right before I opened my mouth to give that answer to my wife it stopped in the clounds and began to wobble a little to the left and right.  The movements were very speratic.  Then it stopped and stood completely still in the clouds for a little over a minute.  The object then did a couple more small wobbles back and forth and the light sputtered out. And it seemed to slowely travel away from us and faded into the clouds.  We continued to sit and observe the general direction of the sky for another 15 minutes with nothing else to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object seemed to be engulfed in flames.  The color was a semi bright yellow at the bottom blending into a light orange towards the top.  It reminded me of a candle flame or a meteor.  When we first viewed the object it seemed to have a fire trail greatly resembling a meteor but much larger and closer then I have seen before.  Upon slowing down and stopping in mid air it held the colors in a flickering fashion the entire viewing time until it fizzled out.  Much like a match at the end of the stick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects general shape appeared to look alot like the general depicted view of a UFO flying saucer.  It was a rather blurry outline due to the color and its position in the clouds.  The base was saucer-like in appearance with a larger dome shape in the top.  The size of the object appeared to be about two 747 passenger jets stacked on top of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night before my sister and I had seen something and she saw it and didn&#39;t know what it was, this time she said it was a plane, but I trust my judgement more than hers.

I was getting into my truck. I called to my wife who was moving a car out of the driveway. I thought at first it was an aircraft engine fire, yellow flames, almost like a campfire in the sky. The fire light went to about 45 degrees past us then flamed out.  About thirty seconds later I noticed a second ball of light(firelight) approach from the same direction.  It too move passed us then flamed out. I went into the house and told my daughter to go out and look and a third went past and went farther west then flamed out.  Suddenly a fourth ball of fire approached at about the same path and it burned out just above us.  My daughter noted at that time that all of the dogs in the neighborhood began to bark. Immediately after the fourth burnout a fifth approached and also burned out above us, about thirty seconds later all of the dogs quit barking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These appeared to be lower than normal airplane traffic and above the helicopter that transfers from one hospital to another several times a week.

As we were looking at that one, 2 more appeared flying side by side.  The one on the left almost hit the one on the right, crossed each other, realigned and flew over the house and disappeared.  We filmed the three of them and missed the first one.  The color of the objects was orange/red.

Each one showed up after the other, and took separate turns to fly for about three minutes south-east across the sky, sometimes disappearing for an enitre thirty seconds, or going dimmer or brighter.  We could have stayed and witnessed many more, as they seemed to be making regular rounds, but we were in a public pool after closing, and had to leave before being seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were moving fast, and may or may not have been blue or sometimes orange.

As we turned around facing west we saw an orangish-red light as big as a low flying plane  traveling in the sky headed eastward in a straight line.  There was no sound.  There were no flashing lights, just a constant glow.  As it got just past our heads the light flickered and then it disappeared.  At first I thought it must have gone behind clouds, but, we could clearly see all the stars in the night time sky in that area. My husband says that he could see a dark spot in the middle, like a hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was heading out to get some takeout at Taco Bell when I saw two lights in the sky.  I assumed they were two military helicopters with their spot lights on because of the formation they were in however I had my window down and there was no sound.  These lights were much larger than a star or planet however smaller than the moon.   They were in the Northeastern sky heading south.  After turning on a different street I lost sight of them however with such heavy cloud cover due to an approaching storm, I assumed they went into the clouds.   On my way home I noticed these lights again when I turned onto Michigan Avenue this time in the northwestern sky however these three lights were in a triangular shaped form or I should say they formed a triangle.  There were three separate lights though.   In the southwestern s! ky I started to see several single lights heading from the southwest towards the three triangular forming lights so they were heading northeast.   As I approached Church Street still heading south, I noticed that these lights were still there but this time I could see one over the treetops and it looked like a flickering flame in the shape of a ball.  I was say a red and yellow fireball with a yellow circular glow around it.  I saw several people watching these lights and taking pictures.   When I got home, I alerted my parents, and they came out with me to watch them now they were in the Northeastern and heading northeastern.   They formed a zigzagged line with the exception of three more created a triangular formation.  I checked the weather per the directions of the report and it stated that the winds were 10-15 MPH W/NW.   Not sure what these were but wanted to alert someone seeing I have not heard anything on the news.   The picture of the fireballs in the report examp! le is very similar to what I saw moving in the sky.  Being an ! amateur astronomer, meaning a novice, I do know what stars, galaxies, satellites, planets and other celestial bodies look like.  These were nothing like anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/23/12 22:00|Duluth|MN|Sphere|20 minutes|12-15 globes of light hovering above the northern hillside.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90099.html|229|ndxe201206| 12-15 globes of light hovering above the northern hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon walking out the front door of my home (with my daughter and wife, to send my wife off to work) which faces north, I identified that, about a mile away and above the wooded hilltop, there were 12-15 globes of light slowly changing colors from reddish orange to light orange, hovering above the hill moving slowly in no specific pattern. They were hovering and slowly moving vertically and horizontally. During the initial 5 minutes of my observation, the 3 lights that were closer to the hilltop seemed to flash a bluish bolt of light down beneath them onto the hilltop. This flash of bluish light seemed to happen instantaneously and looked to be focused beneath them and onto the hilltop itself. This happened several times from the closest orbs (there were about 3 of them that were close to the hilltop, the rest were above them, hovering and moving around in the sky and the globes of light emitting the bluish flashes of light seemed to finish the intermittent b! luish flashing  in the span of about 5-10 minutes. These objects began to fade into the clouds two and three at a time.  The whole process took about 20 minutes until all the lights were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard no noise and noticed that the two orbs were keeping the same distance apart from each other and moving in the same south eastern direction across the sky.  I managed to get my phone out in time to capture the tail end of the two objects and showed my wife.  The quality of the video doesn&#39;t do it justice, but it serves to prove what I saw.  I have found several other videos on YouTube of the same thing!  What are they?  I know they weren&#39;t airplanes.  I am familiar with what an airplane looks like at night (blinking lights, often white with smaller blue or red lights on the wings).  These were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw in my left view as I was making the turn a round object hovering low and flying at a low speed.  The object stopped in mud air and suddenly its entire button was lit up with bright light.  This happened while I was making the right turn. I do not know how many people saw it, but I assume it was seen by others as well as the area was relatively busy. I could not hear any noises from inside my car as all my can windows were up.  This was the first time in my whole life that I observed something like that. If our military has a technology like that, it would be really neat.  However, I doubt it that the object was man made, since it was flying with no lights on at night and suddunly stopped and put its bright lights on from the bottom of the object.  I could see any Colorado as it was dark.  Its lights were very white bright ! and all of them came out at once in a matter if a second.<n>

We were 15 miles north of the Michigan Indiana state line and approximately 1 mile east of Lake Michigan. We saw in the south sky two oval shaped objects that appeared to be communicating with each other. The objects were approximately a mile apart and 1-2 miles high in the sky. They were hovering perfectly still and glowed as a very dim orange color. After 4-5 minutes one of them moved off at a casually leisure pace (southward) and turned off its lights. The other one hung around for a few additional minutes with its lights still on (still glowing) and then moved off in a different direction inland from Lake Michigan. Its lights then went off. Both crafts glowed dim firefly plasma like color (orange)<n>

It was very late and my husband and I were in bed (as were all the kids) ...we lived in liberty at the time in the middle of the woods (and old campground and we turned the main lodge into a house.)  We were woken up by a bright light shining on the side of the house our bedroom was on and coming through our window it lit up most of the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is ex military and is not only trained himself but has trained his dog very well and that dog obeys him no matter what they are going to do (hunting etc.)  So he throws some gear on and tries to go outside to see who is shining a light on our house but the dog refuses to leave the laundry room to the point where my husband was trying to pull him out by his collar and he wouldn&#39;t go with straight fear in his eyes.  My husband decided to come back in, lock back up and get the phone ready for the police.  He shined his flashlight out the window back at the light hoping if it was some punk kids with a spotlight they would realize were not some abandoned lodge they can party at and there were people living in our house but the light didn&#39;t budge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we realized the light was coming from somewhere in the trees (about halfway up a full grown pine tree) and we were a little nervous because this area is so heavily wooded there&#39;s no way it could be some punk halfway up a tree with a spotlight powerful enough to light up the whole side of our house that bright.  We watching this light for almost 2 hours still debating calling the police but not wanting to sound insane if the light was gone when they got there then it just started turning....stayed right where it was but the light turned 180 degrees (still in the middle of the trees) and &#34;drove&#34; straight through them just like it was a car on a road and there was not 100 trees blocking its way....we watched until everything was dark again.  We didn&#39;t end up sleeping that night and the next day went out and looked for any sign of anything but came up blank...everyone we told thought we were crazy so we stopped talking about it but I feel the need to share!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/22/12 23:30|Menomonie|WI|Fireball|1 minute|Fluorescent green, glowing, football-sized obeject falling from the sky|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89976.html|250|ndxe201206| Fluorescent green, glowing, football-sized obeject falling from the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, two boys and I were driving west on Highway 29 from Menomonie on June 22, 2012.  Near 11:30pm, we were approaching the intersection of County Road N when my husband and I saw a spherical green glowing, football-sized object falling from the sky. It clearly was not a falling star, but had many comparable characteristics as one. However, it was much larger, very close to us, glowing a very bright fluorescent green and was shaped like a large football.  We thought it was falling slowly for having been falling for what presumed to be a long distance from the sky. It may have fallen in the marsh area on the south side of 29. Neither of us had ever seen anything like this before.  When researching what this may have been, I was surprised to have found this website containing so many accounts of similar stories near where we experienced this. Could this have been a piece of a meteor?  Or what would you suspect this to be?<n>

They appeared in sequence crossing from northwest to southeast in this pattern: five together in a triangular shape, followed by a pair and another pair and, finally, a single light.  They were distinctly orange, moving rapidly, but not apparently at terrifically high speed; there was a complete absence of sound.  After they passed over us, they disappeared – apparently accelerating away soundlessly.  In relation to other objects in the night sky, they were much larger than stars, and seemed large for their elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandson was able to use a digital camera, not a cell phone, to record most of the event.  We have uploaded the 2 minute, 13 second video to a laptop computer.  I will submit that file soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within an hour we saw about sixteen satellites all moving in the normal north to south or south to north direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were a little amazed to see two objects (dim points of light) that looked to be satellites moving across the sky from northwest to southeast. They were moving together in what looked to be perfect synchronization.  Having seen the International Space Station earlier we knew that it couldn’t be that. I have never seen two satellites move together like that. They appeared to be about an inch apart (as seen from our point of view).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It did not look like a satellite or a comet or asteroid. It certainly did not resemble an airplane in the sky.  It seemed to me that it was not in earth orbit but fairly close. It was moving at a fast pace but not as fast as comet or something like that.  It was definitely moving faster than satellite and it was brighter than any star in the sky.  The light was strong and consistent it had no flashes or other colors on it.  I heard no sound at all coming from it.  It was traveling in a straight line at first.  then a few mins later it just disappeared in a matter of seconds.  It stopped moving across the sky and looked like it was moving away from us and intense speed.  It was compleaty gone in a matter of seconds.<n>

At approximately 10:30, I saw a ball of light travel across the sky.  The light was white and seemed to be traveling SE but then turned South.  As it turned it got much smaller and changed to an amber color. I tried to take a photo but it shows only black.  I was not able to access the camera until the object had changed direction and gotten much smaller. My husband saw a similar object with several other people approximately 2 weeks ago.  It was in Fairmont, WV between the hours of 9 and 11.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking toward the eves of the house waiting for bats to fly out so we could patch up the hole they had found.  It was just starting to get dark and my husband pointed to the sky on the side of the house.  We saw this dark black object approaching towards us about 2 -3 telephone poles high above the tree tops.  I’d say this object was about ¼ mile away or closer when first seen.  I asked what it was and he said he didn’t know.  It made no sound at all and moved very slow..slower than a bird.  It was moving in a perfectly straight path right in front of us and kept going until it disappeared behind trees blocking our view.  There was no detail to this object and its shape is something I don’t even know how to describe.  It was a big mass about the size between a man and a car. It looked very bulky.  It wasn’t balloons, a bird, or anything I! have ever seen in my life.  This object was very visible against the sky and there was plenty of light still to determine this was not anything we have seen before. We had about 2 minutes of looking at this thing and the way it moved in such a perfect straight line..and its size while making no noise really bothers me!!  We are both college educated and never expected or looked to see anything of this nature.  After looking on line I found a you tube video that shows exactly what we saw..It’s the video of the flying Mexican humanoid.  I don’t believe in witches or flying people but that is exactly what we saw that night, I don’t know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was down but it was still light out. The stars were very visible.  I saw what looked like a burning piece of paper floating off to the left of the direction I was heading.  What I saw was bright orange, almost oval shaped. I pulled over so I could focus on it better. It moved slowly heading east. From my perspective it seemed to be the size of a baseball compared to a typical star. This object disappeared quite quickly, though I did witness its movement for about a minute. I managed to get video of it only briefly, however the camera is a cell phone. Needless to say the quality is poor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed, coming from the south at a hign altitue, a glowing light, as if a flame, bu not an aircraft. It was moving quickly. but not a a very high altitude.  My estimate is about 10 - 15,00 feet.  It was moving quickly, as if a plane at about 35,000+ would move.  As it got closer, it was moving directly at me, south to north, as appeared to be a hot-air balloon, but moveing WAY too fat for that.  As it moved overhead, it was silent and it looked like a balloon with a flame under it, but very high.  I took two pictures with my iPhone, both show a cigar or banana-shaped flame/fire when I look at it close up.  As I went through my house to call my wife and look at it out the back (north side), it was no longer bright.  It&#39;s as if the lights/flame had gone out, but you could still see it&#39;s dark shape against the sky.  My wife said that it looked like a cigar to her.  It did to me at that time, as well.  It was still moving ver! y quickly and faded away as it moved north.  Being a flight/plane enthusiast, I immediately looked at flight traffic over my area on flightaware.com.  For the first time EVEr, it was blank.  No flight traffic showed up on either Midway or O&#39;hare airport&#39;s radar screen.  Now, I have been viewing flightaware.com air traffic for a long time and I have never had a blank screen.  Also, all flight traffic from Midway Airport, which had been flying over my house on approach to the airport at the time of the sighting, just stopped.  It ended very quickly.  No more jets.  Very strange.  During this entire eposide, there was no sound associated with the object at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no light of its own, but appeared to be reflecting light from the sunset. It was very far away and I could not make out a definite shape. It flew straight down then took a sudden turn to the south across the skyline for a great distance and then quickly turned west and disappeared across the mountains into CA. This object was definitely maneuvering, moving extremely fast and appeared to maintain a constant speed. Compared to aircraft I see frequently, this object had to be traveling several thousand miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept looking at the lights and I said, &#34;its a bird, is it a plane.&#34;   Mi wife said:&amp;quot;I know what you are looking at. You better look where you drive and I will look at the lights.&amp;quot; I said:&amp;quot;yes, and when you say wow, it will be too late!&amp;quot; Just as I said that, the middle light dimmed, left and right lights alternately blinked on and off and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On further reflection, I realized it was very near or above the Turkey Point nuclear reactor, which fits the profile of many other sightings.<n>

The sphere continued to move north east and appeared to pulse and finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Event lasted about 2 seconds and looked as if something had burned up entering our atmosphere.  It could have been a meteorite or a satellite?  Brightest when first seen, headed down to the horizon and appeared to be something burning out as the light was very brilliant at first and then dimmed and went out.  It resembled one of those fireworks that are so bright and fall to the ground and extinguish on the way down…other than the light being orange in color, headed towards the ground at a much greater speed than gravity, clearly much farther away and brighter than I had ever seen...including the light from the magnesium in the firework I described. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Shortly after stepping out we looked up and noticed a bright light overhead. It appeared higher in altitude than an airplane, yet was too bright to be a satellite. It was moving quickly and steadily in a SSE direction. It did so for approximately 30 seconds. We watched the light and there was a period where one of us thought that the light was an airplane because it was witnessed that there was a blue and a red light on the right side. The light then changed to a bluish light and remained that way for only a few seconds. It then changed to a red light and became noticeably smaller and dimmer. It was that way for another few seconds and then disappeared. Another light not quite as bright appeared and flew for approximately 5 seconds across its path then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

If you were to lay a one dimensional triangle down where all three points were laying against the ground this is how it was moving from South to North.  It was no higher that 300-600 feet above us and crossed directly over us once the light changed we began driving I was in awe and told my friend to look up and when she saw them she stopped the car and climbed up through the sunroof to see them.  We had plenty of time to take photos, yet it was hard to get an a shot that would come out as awesome as they were in person.  This flat triangular shape bean to turn in a 360 degree rotation with the pointer flame/light tumbling first, and it did this 3 or 4 times.  It began ! to level out once it crossed over Hwy 67 North and then suddenly after crossing over the top point of the triangle was flickering more rapidly and then it vanished, along with the second and third.  One at a time, in a 5 second interval.  I&#39;d say when we started the angle at which we were looking was at a 45 degree and it slowly became 90 degrees and directly over head where we were looking up underneath.  As it past over us I noticed that there was some material that connected each light together along the outside edges. I couldn&#39;t see anything in the middle of the shape it appeared hollow.  I did see that the lights were causing whatever material that was keeping them together to reflect and honestly it looked like what spiderwebs look like under a brief flash of a flash like at night.  They didn&#39;t seem to make any sound, and were kind of pretty.  I do think that they were somewhat intelligent and it looked like they were showing off, once other cars stopped to watch.  On! e car coming from a side country road actually drove off the r! oad and onto some railroad tracks that run alongside the highway.  Yes these tracks are still in use and we did call the police department because the car actually bottomed out on the tracks.  I notice they jumped out and kept looking though, which should demonstrate how awesome and unusual these lights were.  It seems as though this is something that is happening all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not a visible craft in any form but looked like a star or planet that could move it was completley  silent which also made it unusual seeing we are near O&#39;hare and I though it maybe a plane but there were no flashing green and red lights  it was circular and made no noise like the planes do we see planes in our yard at 1000 ft and 30,000 ft all the time i this was not even close to the way they look. It was not a satellite because it slowed down and curved we seee them quite often and they are much smalle! r and have a constant path across the sky. My wife and I are not ufo believers and are not telling our neighbors because I always said I thought UFO&#39;s are bullshit and dont want to look stupid but I googled how to report ufos and here i am I wanted to report in hopes somebody else in our schaumburg,IL area saw it.<n>

We had left a restaraunt and got on the interstate to go back to my house and within like 15 minutes of being on the interstate, I look out my window(i was in the backseat of the car on the left side) and I see this odd bright glowing thing.  Thats the only way i can describe it. It was in the shape of a triangle and there were bright lights on all three corners of this thing.  The oddest thing was that there was a more dimmer light coming from the center of it and i couldnt tell where the source of the light was coming from.  I yelled at my mom who was in the front seat.   as soon as she looked to see it it was gone but she did tell me that she saw it.To say the least i have felt very strange eversince.<n>

I thought I was dreaming. Then it did not move off slow it took off so fast with the others with it.  I am close to the AFB but I did not think we had Planes that could just sit in the sky in one place. If I had not looked up I would have not knowing they were there. After it was gone, I ran inside to grab the camera and came back out, then I noticed I was scared had a hard time sleeping.

I often look out my back window at an intriguing light that I see in the distance regularly.  Sometimes it is there, other times it is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, it was there, so I watched it out my deck door.  As I watched it, it started moving closer, and fast.  It came al the way to my neightbor&#39;s house, two doors down.  It hovered over the tree.  It was a huge blue starlight orb.  It had fuzzy edges that almost appeared as a fiberoptic matter.  It stayed over the tree. It made no sounds.  It didn&#39;t really &#34;flash lights,&#34; but the whole item appeared as one HUGE light orb...with twinkly edges. It was about the size of the top of the massive tree.  When it started moving, I ran to look out of my front window.  My visibility is awful, and I didn&#39;t see it, but I did see the reflection of flashing lights on the house across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw what appeared to be a bunch of lights, similar the this one in the distance, all moving jaggedly--there were about 5 others straight ahead and small and distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, the tree top was a bit brown, and not green like the rest of the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if this is related, or not--but this morning, my garage door closed itself.  Also, I had a V-shape in dust on my hood and strange handprints all over my car--not sure if this was related, or not--when you see what I saw, you begin to believe in anything being possible.  I took pics of the dust marks on my car...I will email them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I googled the sighting, but found no others like mine--however, there was a helicopter (this afternoon)hovering in the same path as the object was last night, over the tree and where it came from.<n>

IFO Incident (identified flying object) a.  on the night of june 21, 2012 I went out at night because I see things where I am all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen one up close up, in march so I now know without a doubt they are here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I wavered in the wind, for I am where windmills are. the wind gusts were up to 35mph blowing at their usual direction, from west to east in the palm springs-morongo valley wind pass.  It was an Exceptionally windy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had almost decided I needed to get out of the wind, one of the stars I had been looking at, Seemed to flash.  Lately I am used to this too because so many plantes are around and making Strange flashes that show all colors of rainbows the more I look.   I noticed this star was not in the Night sky the night before, because as it was my birthday, I had made a point to go out and notice Where the stars were because they are in the same position as the day I was born.  This star Was not there.  As I looked to my right, I noticed a lot of planes really high up, then a plane Caught my eye back to the left, which Is over the southeastern portion of hwy 111 off the Hwy 10.  It is virtually desolate and one goes many miles through the middle of the desert To get to palm springs.  The plane seemed to be flashing really bright when I realized it Was the star. It looked like it had actually turned on. The plane looked like it was going to go right into this star, when I realized it was so high up that the plane was just a tiny dot in proportion to the immese size of this perfectly round looking planet/star.  Immediately, my mind knew it was Just another planet making the wild color show, when low and behold, it flashed bright red! Like a flashlight in the sky! The whole planet,star lit up! Then it flashed to white so fast It was like someone playing with the on off switch, from clear white to red. As it was blowing My mind, just for half a second I looked over to my right where I thought I saw something, But then my left peripheral saw something come out of the planet/star.  As I looked  back to the planet/star, an ifo craft had shot out of it and flew straight up and then over to The east, in it’s curvy straight way until it disappeared from being so high and going so fast straight to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then I looked at the planet/star and it had started moving to it’s northwest at the moment The craft launched. The wind was gusting from west to east.  It then moved very very slowly northwest then went straight west, into the horizon.  I had time to go get my camera but was too excited to get it to work.  This all took like 15 minutes for it to cruise out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flashed red to white the whole time like it wasn’t worried about being seen, yet where it was is in the Middle of the big desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well There is an airport about 40 miles from here so there is alot of traffic in the sky.  Anyway, as I was on my way I saw an object in the sky that seemed to be motionless with a bright white light and two otherlights that where less bright than the white one. I could tell what color the two light where apart from  the bright white one well in was there in it&#39;s spot in the sky untill it faded away.  On my way back about a block from my home I saw another object that looked exactley like the one I just discribed but closer.  I figured it was just an airplane.

I went and posted up in my back yard right after that and opened my beer and continued to look up in the night sky and noticed an orb.  I see these every night if I feel like looking for them.  It drifted in one direction untill it fated away.  Then 3 minutes later it was back drifting in the oposit direction untill it faded. 3 or 4 minutes after that I went in to relax my leg...<n>

I observe the sky every cloudless night as I walk my dog.  I&#39;m very familiar with low altitude local air traffic (near RDU) as well as high altitude eastern seaboard traffic.  I also know how to spot reflections from low orbit satellites near the daylight terminator in the hours after sunset.  In fact looking for them is a casual hobby of mine and I&#39;ve seen countless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However over the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve seen what appeared to be two satellites on two different nights behave in a way I&#39;ve not seen before.  The first time I wrote it off as a fluke.  When I saw it a second time it got me questioning that maybe they weren&#39;t satellites at all but something very much more peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first event was a point of light almost directly overheard in a northerly direction.  I&#39;ve observed that one aspect of satellite sunlight reflections versus aircraft lamp illumination is that reflections tend to have a blueish hue, almost starlight quality, where lamps are more yellowish.  I look for almost invisible points of blueish light moving at speeds very much faster than air traffic would be at an altitude where the running lamps would be equally dim.  Another aspect I look for is a gradual steady brightening and fading of the light, versus abrupt changes in brightness that would be caused by lamps being masked by the structure of a passing aircraft.  In this case the point of light met all of the above qualifications.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However as we (my wife and I) were watching the light over a period of about 15 seconds waiting for it to fade away it suddenly flared with a much brighter yellowish light for about 3 seconds then equally suddenly went completely dark with no trace.  During the 3 second period it seemed to stop completely, at least that was my perception.  But I dismissed that as just being a side effect of being spellbound by something I hadn&#39;t seen before.  Convinced it was a satellite from the start we both gasped and even joked that it must&#39;ve been a flying saucer engaging its hyperdrive and blasting out of sight.  We were amused at the spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then last night, again while walking our dog, we saw it again.  This time it was in a southerly direction but otherwise the circumstance were nearly identical.  An almost imperceptible blueish light moving at high speed relative to its apparently altitude just like any other satellite.  However we saw it flare again and much the same way.  Again it was for about 3 seconds but it seemed to be even brighter this time.  This time I realized that it was actually brighter than the forward lights of an approaching airliner.  We are in one of the approach paths to RDU so I&#39;m very familiar with that.  It was very brilliant.  In fact I estimate it was brighter than any other natural or man made night sky object would be except the moon.  Unlike the first sighting though it didn&#39;t completely disappear after the flare.  It returned back to the dim blueish light but then seemed to &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; across the sky.  Instead of fading out gradually in a straight line it seemed to jump ! forward and side to side by small amounts as it faded.  I have to confess the skipping was my perception but I&#39;m not 100% sure it was the case.  The flare was bright enough that it may have affected my focused night sight.  But again it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m no longer 100% convinced what we saw were satellites due to this flaring behavior.  One time, maybe.  But twice in such close date proximity just makes it seem very unlikely.  If it was a satellite it seems that it must&#39;ve been the same one to behave in the same way.  It would&#39;ve had to have had some surface area large enough to reflect enough sunlight from 250+ miles away to make it so bright and we would have had to have been lucky enough to see it just when it was overhead and just when it was pointed just right to witness it flare on two different uncoordinated occasions.  Again seems unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look forward to seeing this thing again or finding an explanation!<n>

They got bright and dimmed immediately and followed the airliners then disapeared.  We could confirm it was NOT falling stars and it could not have been satellites.  The 7 of us just couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  The lights were traveling much faster than a regular commercial jet would travel.  The first thought I had was it could have been military jet fighters but that was ruled out as we had a recent vet of the Us Military confirm they were not fighter jets.<n>

I moved much quicker than an airliner as I’ve seen these across the sky almost every night.  The white light may have been a satellite?  The satellites that I’ve noticed in the past seem to move similar to this but are not as bright as this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It took the object about 15-25 seconds to cross the moon.  It was &#34;massive&#34; the end of the upside down v was very long, compared to the size of the moon in my binoculars it looked like an estimated 1/10 the size of the moon roughly.  It appeared to be extremely close to the moons surface as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like it in my life and never saw it again just that one time.  The shape was solid, there was no wings, flaps, etc. and I saw it very well with my binoculars.  An object that looked like the letter V but u! pside down and very large, near the end points of the bottom of the object looked sharp and very elongated.  I remember shortly after this sighting I made a post on abovetopsecret and only one other person says he saw the exact same thing as me but nobody else and I have not found anything else about it online.  Can provide more information if you contact me.  I drew an exact duplicate picture and report with exact date and time on paper but would have to find it.  Will get it if you request it.<n>

He was sitting in front of a window that faces South East. The craft was singular in shape. When he notified the rest of the family my first son and second son watched the craft split into two separate crafts. One was cigar shaped the other was circular. The cigar shaped craft took off at blinding speed from a near stop still to the South East. The Circular craft continued what looked like in excess of 200 mph to the North East. I did have a HD camera but when I was attempting to focus on the craft no more than a quarter to a half mile away I must have hit the stop recording button.  I had this craft focused perfectly in my view finder and had I not been so stupid or excited you would have had a smoking gun for certain.  The object that was cigar shaped was at least a 100 feet long, shiny metallic with a bright white light that flashed very slowly from dim to bright.  But most of the time this was visi! ble we did not really catch too much on how much it was pulsating because it was more of a blur as it took off to the South East.  Both objects were around 500 feet to perhaps nearly a thousand feet in the air.  The other circular craft was about 50 feet in diameter that pulsated White but I was able in the camera to see it flash color from pinks to orange to red to very bright white.  The cigar shaped craft was visible for ten seconds or less but the circular object was visible for about four minutes.<n>

Observed for several minutes but gone when I re<n> <n><n> <n><n> SF Bay Area - I stepped out on my patio at approximately 0125 hours Pacific time and was just looking around the sky since I&#39;m up all night listening to the radio online.  I saw what I thought at first was an passenger airplane until I noticed that it was not moving AT ALL.  It was just hanging in the sky motionless. I watched it for approximately one minute to confirm it was not moving... then went inside and grabbed my bino&#39;s.  I got a clear look at a craft which had 3 bright white lights. It was an elongated oval with the 3 bright lights spaced evenly on it.  I could make out an outline of the oval as well. I watched it for several minutes with my Bino&#39;s and it remained motionless in the sky.  The best way that I can describe the lights is as if seeing an auto&#39;s headlights thru a slight fog.  This allowed me to see the outline of the object without the lights being too bright to do so. The object was dull gray in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed at my luck so I went inside to grab my camera or video recorder but both had dead batteries. I was only inside about 30 seconds... I went back outside to see it again and this time it was gone... not a trace. No man-made aircfaft could disappear from the sky that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had been inside a slight low cloud cover which was moving briskly due to fast cold winds tonight. From where I was, the pan of the Big Dipper was behind this cloud cover and could NOT be seen through it. The cloud cover was there, and moving fast, the entire time I viewed this object... and like I said, the object was slightly inside the clouds but not deep inside because I could see it easily. After going inside for the camera the object was GONE but the clouds were still moving fast. When the cloud cover past completely I could easily see the entire Big Dipper but there was nothing else there that could have been the the craft... so I know for sure it was NOT any star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can provide a sketch via fax if you want one.

Object brightness slowly varied [not consistently though] over 20 seconds to 30 intervals from full brightness to invisibility [could not see it in the 20x80 either], then slowly brightening again over 20 to 30 secs.  Color varied from light orange to medium orange.  Object was a little fuzzy, even though 20x80 binocs were in sharp focus (which I checked a couple times; binoculars have separate left and right eye focus.)  Addendum:  There&#39;s a lot of air traffic in the Bay area; there&#39;s the SF airport and the Oakland airport.  I see all kinds of planes, and they always have blinking lights associated with them, Nor are they a steady light orange color with no additional blinking lights.  The object was higher than the general [incoming/outgoing] air traffic.  Object finally disappeared behind a hill in my foreground.  At full brightness, it was about like Venus or Jupiter, but light orange in color. At it&#39;s dimmest, it was not visible at all even when viewing through the 20x80 binoculars.  There was no noticable change in elevation, nor was there any sudden changes of position or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible conclusion:  internally lit blimp, though this might be unlikely since, a) there were no navigation lights that I could discern b) it was operating so close to Oakland airport [class C] and San Francisco airport [class B].<n> <n><n> <n><n> The images I sent to you are direct copies from the camera&#39;s card.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 736: deliberate streak to obtain more light information 739: about to fade from view 742: brightest part of brightness cycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 743: about half way through brightness cycle<n>

I do not know for how long it was there, but I do not believe I initially saw it, and that I noticed it and it was brighter than the surrounding stars. As it caught my eye the craft moved rapidly upward and climbed higher. As it went higher the orb disappeared, then reappeared, before disappearing completely. During these quick seconds this orb made no sound. This was peculiar; but what was more puzzling was that I noticed three aircraft in the area flying around almost as if trying to observe the orb. These aircraft made the distinct sounds of planes. Even more bewildering was that two of these aircraft appeared to be heading right towards one another as if they were going to collide, but passed within 500-600 feet of each other. These two aircraft flew in the same area, but lower, than the orb which I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside in my back patio with my son who is in excellent health and 18 yrs of age.  I am 56 yrs of age and slightly near sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright star at the base of the big dipper and was trying to place it in the sky from my novice astronomy knowledge.  At first is was stationary like a star then began to move southward. Just as I said there should be nothing there it began to move over head to the south. I said to my son we should hear engine signature soon but none was heard.  He commented that there are no navigation lights on it and I said that&#39;s impossible.  I thought an aircraft was on apprach with landing lights but it was not headed east to Toronto or to WaterlooWellington Airports but to Hamilton which is at least 100 kms away.  Then I new it was an UFO since there was no deflection or change in brightness as if it was bright all around it.  There was no air traffic that we could tel! l and I ran to get my binoculars while my son spotted for me.  When I came back outside, he said it had just disappeared. He said it diminished in size rapidly and it was as if the very bright white light that had been emmitting from it grew very small and disappeared.  We both surmized that it accelerated at high speeed to space.  The light was quite clear, extremely bright and pure white in colour.  Its intensity did not pulse nor did it blink, just a consistent magnitude and colour.  As soon as it disappeared there was air traffic moving from west to east at approximately FL7, 7,000 feet and descending to Toronto. We saw at least one aircraft flying the opposite direction, east to west, also. So, at least 4 aircraft in all as soon as the UFO disappeared.<n>

I&#39;m not a UFO chaser but did just see something strange in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking out the garbage and off to the south of my house I saw a light that caught my eye.  It travelled north for about 1 minute.  It was about as high as a low flying plane and it disappeared before it should have left my sight.  It moved very steadily and in a straight line.  The only way to describe it is it looked like an emergency road flare flying across the sky.  It was red and steady but it flickered a bit and was moving quickly.  It went over my street, right above me then as it went past, it was gone.  I&#39;ve seen flares shot that float to earth on the little parachutes and it looked exactly like that except it was moving fast and in a forward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were able to see it until it traveled out of sight. A few of us insist the object seemed to simply vanish while some of us think it flew beyond distance of our sight. It appeared to gain some altitude as it went along.  There was no sound we could hear, and there was no diminishing of the color or brightness, and no apparent trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying lower than a plane would, and we live fairly close to the airport.<n>

I was looking at the stars and noticed a very bright star at about 30 degrees off the horizon straight south.  It looked about 5 times larger and brighter than the next brightest star in the sky.  It looked like it was moving very slowly to the west and then a flashing light that appeared to be a plane passed a few degrees below it going east.  At that point the bright star seemed to reverse course for a very brief period and then dimmed out at about the speed you would see a light on a dimmer go dark, not instantly.  It was then completely gone.  Perfectly clear night.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 10 seconds.  I watched the area of the sky for another 10 minutes or so and never saw anything else.  If I didn’t see the movement, which was very minimal, I would think I had just witnessed a star go supernova.  Although, I have no idea if that would dim out that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I passed Jim’s Chinese Restaurant on Del Monte Avenue next to Cardinalli’s used car lot on Broadway in Seaside. I parked my truck on the side of the street containing the restaurant (across the street from the Dunes Bar). I exited from my truck. As I turned to make my way to Jim’s, I saw in the air above the Dunes Bar what appeared to be four large, burning, pumpkin-shaped balls (for lack of a better description) hovering stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing balls in question soon revealed themselves to be anchored to a huge object in the shape of an isosceles triangle (approximately the size of a battleship). Three of the glowing balls were attached to the base of the triangle, while another appeared at the point (nose) of the object. The object soon began to move, following the uphill path of Broadway (southeasterly direction), cutting through the fog before disappearing into a cloudbank. As the object disappeared, I spoke to a black gentleman standing across the street from me: he, too, had seen the tail end of the object as it vanished, but he hadn’t acquired any footage of the event on his cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called my friend Brian D. on my cell phone as I made my way back down Broadway towards Jose’s Mexican Restaurant across the street (near the Commerce Center). Proprietor Jose himself was standing outside and watering his lawn at the time, and I asked Jose if he had seen the object—he denied it. But just as I asked the question (with Brian still on the phone with me), the object reappeared in the sky directly above us. I urged Jose to get footage of the object with his cell phone, and he immediately began recording—however, he was reluctant to move from the cover of the streetlight above him. At that point, I raced over to the Dunes Bar and urged the customers inside to come out and see this object for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, a crowd of approximately a dozen people formed on the street outside the Dunes Bar. One of the onlookers took a look at the object and voiced the opinion “Aw, man, it’s only a glider.” No sooner did he say this than the object shifted position and actually stood on its nose (still in midair) in front of all the witnesses (who were heard gasping simultaneously by Brian, still in contact on my phone).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft (for that’s exactly what it was) then straightened out and resumed its journey up Broadway towards the same cloudbank in full view of everybody. The cloudbank itself seemed to be only half the size of the craft and did not appear to be capable of completely concealing the object—nevertheless, as the craft entered the cloudbank it seemed to “phase” itself completely out of view and did not re-emerge from the other side of the cloudbank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last time I saw the craft that evening. After saying goodbye to Brian, I immediately called the local police, who denied any knowledge of any unusual aerial activity in the area. They informed me that I was not going to be able to call the airport tower to confirm any of this and eventually requested that I refrain from calling them again. They did, however, provide me with the phone number of the UFO Center (206) 722-3000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian D. later informed me that a total of six armed helicopters took off from the nearby naval base and appeared in the vicinity of the opposite side of the cloudbank previously described, circling the area with searchlights for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, June 21st (after my conversation with the UFO Center) I returned to Jose’s Mexican Restaurant to request the footage he had acquired the previous night. I gave him the assurance of the UFO Center that he would remain the sole copyright holder and owner of the footage. Jose himself, however, was not at the restaurant—a contentious young man working there demanded to know my business with him before he would tell me where to find him. I explained the story to the best of my ability and repeated the assurance that no harm would come to Jose or to his footage—and that the sharing of said footage could be extremely beneficial to him in the future. The man then told me that Jose was at his other restaurant on Cannery Row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several hours later, I finally reached Jose at his restaurant—unfortunately for the both of us, Jose seemed to have “forgotten” exactly how to use his own SmartPhone and retrieve the footage in question. With Jose’s apologies, I returned to the previous restaurant empty-handed. There, a young woman also in the employ of Jose’s Mexican Restaurant quietly informed me that the other man had reached Jose ahead of me and told him to refuse to give up the valuable footage to anybody—that I was merely a profiteer seeking to rip him off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true and accurate account of the events of June 20th and 21st 2012, and I am prepared to submit to any form of lie detector test or any other proofs of veracity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  Christopher R.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 22, 2012<n>

There was a weather system moving from the south to the north. The leading edge of the system had broken up into small clouds creating small gaps of clear sky.  I saw what  I thought was an airliner.  I realized this object was moving to fast to be a passenger plane.  However it was at approximately the same height as a high fling airliner, somewhere in the 25000 ft range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was white. It was triangular shaped.  The leading point was farther away from the the 2 aft points making an elongated triangle. This object was moving very fast defiantly not fast enough to be an airliner.  There was no sound.  The light was very good.  The sun was at a great angle to reflect off the object while being behind the clouds of the weather system.  There was no trail or aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a enthusiast of military air craft. I know the difference in shape of most military air craft.  This was not a fighter jet.  This was not an F-117 or B2 bomber. I have  a physical every year and my eye sight is checked at that time.  It has been checked at 20-10 vision.  This is better then 20-20. I can see very well. If I had to guess I would say this object was man made.  I would say it is a lifting body possibly a space plane, a plane capable of flying from ground to orbit to back.  I would guess it is the new spy plane to replace the SR-71 blackbird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They were over a forested area that has minimal air traffic.  They ascended at a steep angle, going from approximately 2,000 feet to 8,000 feet in about a minute and a half, with a slight wavering motion at times. Both of the lights went into a thin layer of clouds and disappeared. The cloud layer was thin enough that the lights should have been easily visible a couple seconds after passing through, but both disappeared in the same manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed a continous bright shade of white during the entire incident and didn&#39;t appear to be reflecting light from the sun, but were rather self-illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The circle object (we thought to be a high altitude bird we thought was riding the wind) was silently stationary at a high altitude. Every once and a while it would move away from it&#39;s location, then return. The objects size was was that of an un-popped popcorn kernel held at arms length. A co-worker and I were curious as to what type of bird it was, so he went to get binoculars. As he returned with the binoculars the craft, definitely not bird took off at a high speed heading west, into the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting, 6/20, took place at the same location as I as walking to my car for my lunch break. I thought I saw an object move, east to west, at a very high speed. As I focused in and found the object in the eastern sky it was the same size, and shape craft moving silently, no con-trails, towards my and co-workers location. I asked my co-worker &amp;quot;remember that thing that was in the storm the other day?&amp;quot; and he responded with &amp;quot;yeah, that white thing up there?&amp;quot;. I could not tell if the object was white, or was reflective, but I couldnt seem to focus on it completely. As we watched the object as it went stationary and I told him to go inside and grab the binoculars. As he went the object once again silently started heading east at a slow speed. I tracked the object for about 2-3 minutes as it got smaller and smaller. I took my eyes off it for a brief moment and it disappeared completely. At the rate of speed it was moving it would not have had enough! time to get completely out of eye sight and was no where near the horizon when I lost it. We panned the skies with the binoculars for a few minutes to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will continue to update on this craft as it seems to have an interest in that location, although it is no place special at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Personally being a pilot for several years I judge the lights if normal sized to give me an estimate of having been roughly 1,000 - 1,500 feet above the ground.  It had four white lights on the bottom in a square pattern with a reddish tented front light.  It was completely silent and moved very very slowly, again I estimate the speed to have been in the proximity of 13 knots give or take a few.  I am not suggesting it to be extraterrestrial, but in all my years of been involved with aviat! ion, I have never seen anything like it past the stealth bomber if I had to compare, and never completely silent or able to move so slowly it seemed to defy gravity. Amazing equipment no matter the origin!<n>

There was no noise at all, no wind, and it was about 1am.  We were very intrigued by this and really want to know what it was.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before but it was really cool.

It seemed to be quite close at this point (within a mile).  I watched to make sure it was a helicopter, but it showed no signs of it, and made no noise.

This object was not a perfect circle, but rather glowing without a perfect edge.  I don&#39;t remeber how it started, but just remember seeing it straight across from where I was standing.  This light was very bright and very distinct in the 11pm night sky.  From my perspective it was about 2 inches above the horizon, and about 3/4 of a mile away.  From my perspective this light object was about the size of my pinky fingernail.  For about 30 seconds this object moved from left to right just above the horizon.  It moved in a very straight line faster than a small airplane.  In fact, about double the speed of a small airplane, given the above perspective.  We both saw this at the same time, and both agreed this was something we couldn&#39;t  really understand.  After watching this light object in awe, it totally disappeared into the black cloudless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We excitedly continued to walk and talk about this for the next 15 minutes.  All of the sudden, we see the same looking light the same distances away.  It was sitting perfectly still as we tried to decipher its earthly name.  We kept an eye on it as we walked a few minutes, and it starts to move from right to left.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  We had no feelings of fear, but rather excitement.  After we passed a small tree, this object was nowhere to be found.  We have never seen anything like this in our lives.  For the record it was about 70-75* F , and there was a sight breeze.  Also there was a feeling of electricity in the air that night.<n>

These &#34;stars&#34; appear to be very high up and cross great portions of the sky in a matter of seconds.  This has been consistently observed on clear nights and at varying times (9:30PM - 3:30AM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first incident was on 6/10 at approximately 3:30AM. I witnesses two distant white &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; moving SE in the sky on paths where it appeared they could meet.  After about 15 seconds, they appeared to almost meet.  One turned very bright white as it stopped for a couple seconds and headed directly N across the entire sky in approximately 30 seconds before disappearing in to the horizon.  There were no erratic flight paths observed, just a short stop and a 90 degree change in flight.  The other &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; maintained its path and was also lost in to the horizon. I can honestly rule out meteors or satellites by the distance, speed, no tracking lights, and directional flight/color change of the &#34;stars.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident on 6/19 was similar, but involved two moving &#34;stars&#34; at separate times.  The first was seen flying E to W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later I witnessed the second.  This was a very distant &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; that flew S to N and either stopped or disappear directly S of the big dipper.  I did not see it continue past that area in the sky.  I maintained observation of the area, and approximately 5 minutes later witnessed the &#34;star&#34; reappear from the same area and cross the sky heading N in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this on other nights and witnessed identified aircraft (shape,sound, tracking lights) flying toward or away from the Quad City Airport at a low altitude as a  &#34;star&#34; flew far far above, but in a similar relative direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; are so distant that they can likely be observed in other states.  Just scale the sky facing W where the big dipper is to your right, observe S, and you will be able to see this for yourself!  Some times, I have seen movement within seconds of being outside!  It will take a very high powered camera to record this activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of satellites, we wonder?  PD)  )<n>

They were in the shape of a backwards triangle at first then when it got closer to us you could see that it was actually in the shape of a diamond.  This whole time my friend was taping the craft and then asked me to take over the camera for him.  I zoomed in as far as the camera would let me to try and make out the shape of the object and when i zoomed back out i could see that it was hovering over us for quite some time.  I want to know what this was because it scared the life out of us all..  And of course the only sounds that you could hear are the frogs, the campfire that we had going and also our voices talking to let people know that we did not turn the volume off.<n>

The flying object looked like a cross, with the green lights overlapping the red lights.  The green lights on the object looked similar to the LED lights you see on car headlights.  The object was about 1.5 miles up in the sky.  The object did not make any jet or plane engine noise, and was hovering slowly.  It was completely silent.   When I noticed it I was at this position: 45.473362,-122.719876.   As a reference I could cover the flying object with my thumb which is about 0.75 cm.   There was an airplane northeast, about half a mile away from the flying object, but the airplane did not seem to be chasing the object.   The object seemed like it was hovering slowly above me so I ran to my car.<n>

I cannot tell you why all I can say is they transmitt data. I will have them for two years in my home.  The night they were installed I got a feeling of an energy so much I got up out of bed and went out my back door.  At first, nothing seemed out of order. So I just thought I was having insomnia.  I went to the chair at my small table in the dark and sat for a minute, then glancing to the sky realized it&#39;s back!  The hair stood up on the back of my neck and I understood what the ENERGY is. Back in 1997 approx. I was in the front of my home mowing my lawn Just as it was getting dark. I happened too look up and saw a large BLACK BLANKET in the sky&amp;lt;it had a slight wrinkle every so often.  Now I am talking blacker than the background of the sky.  Then looking from my home on this street 4 miles from where I live now, at the same time and over the Sangabriel mountains and at the same time their wa! s a large off in the distance round glowing round ball throwing off smaller round balls.  My nieghbors all came out and looked and I called the Sheriff. they arrived one black lady sheriff and I believe a female white driving.  They too looked and just said they could not explaine what we were seeing.  A Black Floating Blanket.  So they left. my niehgbors all went in i watched for two hours went in to get a cup of coffee, then when I came back out it was gone. my sighting at my new home of one year just happened after these black boxes were placed in my home and on the 19th of June 2012 it was back! I pretended I did not see the blanket in the sky although, I felt scared this time.  I just watched from the corner of my eye and it was as though it new of my presence.  Just the feeling I got. It was there an hour I went to the back door pretending not to see it and went to bed.  I peeked out later it was gone.<n>

I looked up down the street and saw a red light in the sky thinking it was a flare.  So I watched it for about a minute and noticed it wasn&#39;t falling or leaving a smoke trail like a flare would.  I grabed my phone to record it thinking it was a bit odd and watched it move higher and higher.  Then it ended up flying towards me and right over me until it was out of sight due the the roof blocking the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a red orb floating in the sky.  More like a flare that didn&#39;t shimmer. It didn&#39;t have a single flashing light like all aircraft have.  There was some cloud cover in the sky and this light was under the clouds.  It didn&#39;t make a single noise as it flew over me.   A plane flew by short after and the lights on it wasn&#39;t as bright as the UFO, the plane made noise, and was a bit slower as it flied by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what to make of this. I searched on google to see if there was a similar sighing and I found one that was exactly the same as mine.  The only difference was that the other sighting had 3 UFO&#39;s and mine was only 1.  I don&#39;t have any pictures, but like I said above, I made a video.

It was a very bright white light which was about the size of Venus in the evening sky but at a much lower altitude.  My first impression was a satellite but it was much too low in altitude.  I would estimate 20,000 feet or less but moved in a straight line and was very silent.  Wind was less than 5 mph from the southwest and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really got my attention is the fact that I live in a very rural area with many cattle and at this time of night it is very common to hear cows bawling or mooing and there are ALWAYS frogs croaking.  It was dead silent the whole time I witnessed the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars from my pickup and found the light and at that time also noticed it had a orange/red non blinking narrow cylinder type protrusion coming out the bottom of the white light.  The protrusion was about 10% the size of the main light but 3 times the length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then rapidly increased speed and quickly disappeared in the distance.  It did always continue on a straight line trajectory but again it was lower in the sky than say a commercial jet and a much larger mass of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of disappearing the usual chorus of frogs started.  The light itself did not emit any noise nor did it ever blink or really change intensity.

I work at night and often go out to pray or muse under the stars. The first strange occurance was a couple weeks ago. I see planes a lot. They are colored and blink and easy to identify. Something came over that was a straight white light. Not blinking. Very bright. No noise heading in a straight line south to north. Due north and NOT west or east in any way. I watched it from one end of the sky to the other. North of us a couple hours drive is an airforce base with stealth fighters and bombers. I assumed it was one of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next occurance was Monday June 18, 2012. Once again I was out praying and in the tradition of the early church fathers I face due east. In front of me a very large red or orange fireball fell from the sky. I see shooting stars every once in awhile but this was odd because of it&#39;s size and color. I finished praying and got up and turned around when another fell due west of where I had been kneeling. The exact same size and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third thing I would report is probably nothing. I assume they are satelites but the amount of them are getting ridiculous. I see the occasional satelite. Usually dull white travelling at a decent pace across the sky. Sometimes they shine a bit brighter for a few seconds and then dull down again before disappearing. Over the last week when out praying I have noticed a very large amount of these things. Usually I&#39;d see one every couple nights or so but tonight I seen four in one spot. Two travelling one direction and two the other on north/south trajectories. Two almost crossed on top of each other. I have been noticing a continual flow of these in the same pathway across the sky for the last week to two weeks. Tonight I counted, a dozen or so. Way more than any other times and I&#39;ve been watching the sky in my nightly prayer for several years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Luminosity was brilliant on each occasion.  The first seen object (19th June) travelled in a West to East direction (in bound above Gozo island across Mellieha Bay (Malta).  The floowing objects (19th &amp; 20th June 2012) were stationary over Gozo Island (not on the incoming civilian aircraft landing path to Malta International Airport) before moving off in a Northly direction out to sea at a rapid speed. The height of &#39;fireballs&#39; was very difficult to estimate.  Speed much faster than any type of civilian aircraft. There was no engine noise heard whatsoever.  There were no flashing aircraft red/green/white lights. The brilliance of the &#39;fireballs remained&#39; constant. The estimated distance covered from point of first visual sighting to point of disappearing from view was a! pproximately fifteen miles in less than five minutes. On each three nights/early morning numerous witnesses &#39;tourists andlocals&#39; watched the &#39;firballs&#39; travelling across the sky.  The &#39;fireballs&#39; seemed to be at first diamond shaped and intermitently split into a group of three seperate &#39;fireballs moving together at equal distand (to the human eye approximately 2.5 centimetres apart) and several moments later re-joined into a whole object.  The &#39;fireballs were observed by my wife and I from our roof top garden in Mellieha, Malta.  We are not UFO and have no interest as such in the subject. At first we thought the lights were approaching aircraft to land at Malta International airport, We are used to observning normal aircraft coming and going from the Malta international airport. The objects (fireballs) were not usual civilian aircaft and they moved as tough under intelligent control and certainly were not caused by natural weather conditions, weather ballons, chinese lanterns! , fireworks or any other &#39;ridiculous&#39; explanations. If uiindee! d the se en objects were military aircraft, they were exceptionally quiet and very luminous in the night sky, which was cloudless. There wss no wind and the breeze was travelling (East to West) in the opposite direction against the movement of the objects. The ambient temperature was approximatly twenty six degree&#39;s centigrade on each night of the sighting with an avergae 58 % humidity measurement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time these strange lights have been reported. However, there has been and are seen (usually innthe night sky but some day time &#39;disc&#39; sighting have also have been observed) increasing sightings being observed over the island of Malta and neighbouring Sicily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I immediately ran back inside to get her and her brother to come see what i was looking at, because I couldnt believe my eyes.  Immediately after they walked outside and looked up, they too were astonished at the site.  The lights were moving in unisome, but sort of changed shapes to make these different amoebic forms as it went across the night sky in a Northwest direction.  I&#39;m very much a pessimist and non-believer in the extra-terrestrial, but after tonight, I have no idea what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it thinking it was a plane as we have had a big fire and a lot of air traffic lately.  The aircraft seemed to be hovering in one place just below the clouds and smoke from the fire, and not moving. I was watching it for a good ten minutes and it would disappear behind nothing, then reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my exit in Carr Colorado and pulled off of the road on the off ramp.  The shape of it almost looked rectangle but i really couldnt tell.  It then made a falling move with a tail kind of like a shooting star and then it split into twoand formed balls of light.  One directly above the other.  It was not a plane, and it was not dark so I knew it was not a star.  I took a picture and you can barely see it, and I alsofilmed it but you couldnt see it then either really.  I was just too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top ball of light eventually disappeared and the bottom seemed to take off g! oing west and and got really small as I went west to get closer and a better picture but it got really small like it was traveling west so I figured it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving back east towards my work I noticed 3 people were looking at the sky where I had been so I slowed down and asked them if they saw it.They said they see weird stuff in the sky all of the time.  I started driving again and got onto highway 85 and looked back over where I had seen it, and it was there again. Same size and same position.  Might have been the weirdest thing I have ever seen. I can not explain it. It changed shape a few times by size. I would love to know if anyone else saw this. I dont think it was a plane because there were several more and they did not look like this. I was trying to debunk what it could be like the bright light was from the angle of the plane and windows from the sun, but no way was it a plane. I dont know if there is a way to download this picture or video on here fro! m my phone, but if someone wants to see it i will have it on m! y phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe there is some kind of software to zoom an inhance it.

Faster than any satellite I’ve seen and I’ve seen a few satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to blink about four or five times curving around the earth, than it looked like it went straight out away from earth then disappeared.  This was a very bright bluish light when it blinked on and was very, very fast.  I was the only one out of my friends who saw it but when we looked out horizon to the the beach we saw a yellowish light that was blinking on and off and it then stayed lit and moved to the left of us then it stopped and was zigzagging and looked like it was coming at us and then it appeared to turn around and disappear into the night sky.  The second UFO looked like it might have had a tail on it also.  Then we all got scared and left the beach cause we were really freaked out.<n>

The Big Dipper is in the northwest sky to my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw this new star adjacent to Big Dipper, I focused and watched intently.  For approximately three to five seconds   It appeared stationary then started moving toward me in a south easterly direction.  It was the same brightness and size of the other Big Dipper stars.  It flew relatively slowly across the sky and was easy to track.  I watched it for 30 seconds and watched it fade out after it crossed California&#39;s central valley and approached Sierra Nevada mountains or above Auburn, California.  I noticed It had some bulk to it as It got closer and overhead, like a square with rounded corners but still looking like a star.  Looked at my watch after fade out, 12:01 AM June 18, 2012.<n>

I routinely see two stars on a diagonal line in the southwest sky each evening and, when I glanced up into the sky, I thought I saw these stars in a new position.  But I was in error; the &#39;stars&#39; were visibly two pink or purple lights, approximately two to three inches apart (using my fingers as a measuring instrument), one directly behind the other.  The lights didn&#39;t blink, but they weren&#39;t constant, either.  They appeared to pulsate, and the lights were rather dim.  From the moment I first noticed them, their transit took approximately twenty to thirty seconds.  I couldn&#39;t detect any shape of aircraft, there was no sound, and visibility was very good - no clouds or other distractions were in view.  Given the precision with which the lights were following one another, I originally thought they might be emanating from one craft.  But the second light suddenly picked up speed and either &#39;joined&#39; the first light or flew frightening close to the first light as its &#39;wingman&#39;.  I have no way of determining the altitude these craft were flying but, given the clear night, lack of sound and inability to detect any shape behind the lights, I would assume they were flying at a very high altitude.  And if this is the case, they were indeed traveling at an enormous rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live a few miles from O&#39;Hare International Airport, and my family and I are accustomed to seeing aircraft in their final approach and take-off from the airport every five minutes or so almost constantly.   The sky was quite busy tonight with inbound/outbound aircraft, but these hazy pink orbs were not coming from O&#39;Hare, nor were they headed toward the airport.  Their flight plan was very obviously in contrast to any local aircraft traffic in this area, and could very well have posed a hazard to navigation for the surrounding pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not helicopters, flares, ultralights or any other aircraft known to me.  I am unaware of pink or purple lights used on any commercial or private aircraft, nor am I aware of any FAA regulations permitting such colors to be used within extremely close proximity to the nation&#39;s second-busiest airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much like to uncover exactly what these lights were.  I am a veteran Navy intelligence officer and have two combat deployments to my credit.  I have over sixteen years worth of experience with a wide array of aircraft, and yet I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

It is not known if they are in the sky tonight as rain and clouds have moved into our area 06/22/2012,the Eastern Coast of Miramichi,New Brunswick, Atlantic Canada. The objects were seen by many people in this area as well as video taped on different nights by different people. Some are fast moving others are slower and appear to be mimicing stars as well as shadowing the planes/jets that are traveling past; they often travel in pairs and change course at times. They are appearing every 3-7 min&#39;s and take roughly 45-90sec to travel past and get beyond our line of vision. There is an object that emmits a  Blue flickering light which varies from very bright to very dim and travels at a higher altitude than the others. There is also another one that has a solid red glowing light source which seem to be alot further up in the sky and seem ! to travel alone and it also changed direction. Most are moving past the handle of the &amp;quot;Big Dipper&amp;quot; They do not appear to be satellites as they travel faster and change direction at times;  some travel at such a fast speed that it is beyond beleif while the brightness and low altitudes at which some pass by are truly unbeleivable and the black shadow that appears to be the starting or beginning point at which they are appearing from is not familiar too anyone who witnesses it. The first object seen appeared to be a low flying helicopter with it&#39;s search light on but as it moved closer there was no sound and it appeared too freefall downward for several meters then advance forward  freefall/advance/freefall... it repeated this way of moving for several minutes until it was very close...someone lit a cigarette and the flame from the lighter seemed to make are presence noticable it then accelerated to a very high speed and quickly was out of our sight the other dim wh! ite lights were out all night and with the exception of maybe ! 3 or 4 a ll moved in the direction of the &amp;quot;Big Dipper&amp;quot; and seemed to alter their course as not to go through the &amp;quot;Big Dipper&amp;quot; but along side of it this course change is what further inforces my beleif that what we were seeing could not be satellites. These sightings were on a nightly basis with the exception of the one that looked like the helicopter which was out only the first night and the others were seen for 7 days in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/17/12 21:45|Wilmington|OH|Unknown|5 minutes|Linear Light Area in the Sky|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89925.html|381|ndxe201206| Linear Light Area in the Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me!  Then I looked at my dashboard to see if something on there could be causing a reflection on the windshield for what I was viewing. After determining neither one of those things was happening and observing the sky for several minutes I cannot explain what I saw.  I am only reporting this because of a report on Filer&#39;s Weekly e~mailer which shows a similar pic to what I saw received yesterday.  It was a definite light area in the sky that had clear linear boundaries.  It was a patch, very large of an inestimably large lighter area in, that was so large I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  Instead of stopping and watching it longer, I turned at the traffic light when it changed to green and didn&#39;t look back.  I couldn&#39;t accept what was happening and must have denied to myself that it was real and didn&#39;t look back or think about it anymore.  It was like my mind shut off!  Filer&#39;s Files shows a pic of wha! t I saw and it spread across a wide linear exact area of the sky, which was a lighter color.  it was ahead of a storm front which I had been observing for perhaps a half an hour as I was proceeding from New Vienna on Antioch Rd. off the Rte 28 turn off heading North West.  This was on Sunday nite last.  I was watching the sky for some time as the storm front was moving from East to West which I thought was highly unusual and I couldn&#39;t remember seeing that phenomenon before, since my memory was noting how unusual that was.  In front of the storm front as I got in front of it heading due North after entering U.S. 73 is when I observed this strange patch in the sky!  I couldn&#39;t even begin to estimate its size, but it was huge.  For some reason my human mind couldn&#39;t accept or deal with it and I must have gone into denial and decided subconsciously to ignore it!  As I write this I am realizing how much it must have disturbed me to review this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we got half way down our street we noticed a low flying object with 8-10 bright, white lights and 1 red light (on the end).  The object looked triangular.  There was no sound.  As we pulled into the driveway we stopped to watch it just above the tree line.  The object turned “on a dime” and at a high rate of speed took off in a different direction and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I watched it, the light faded until it could no longer be seen.  The whole event was very short (about 6 seconds) yet certainly grasped my attention.<n>

It was approximately 9pm, and it has just gotten dark. There was no cloud cover, so both stars and other planes could be seen in the sky quite clearly. This object appeared as a bright red light, fairly large and round compared to any other flying craft I have ever seen. It moved in a straight forward motion without flashing any lights. It seemed to be traveling faster than any plane or jet I have ever seen, but did not have any similarity to a shooting star, and it was not going down or up. These unique attributes caught my eye, but the real surprise was when the object suddenly vaporized into thin air. Again, there were no clouds in the sky, so it was quite surprising to see this bright object suddenly disappear with no trailing off or fading into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only time I could say that I have witnessed what appeared to be a UFO. There was no other significance to this event, at least nothing that was apparent to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took this video (on my phone) the next night when just one UFO appeared at the same time, and hung around for 15 minutes.  On both occasions, the objects emitted white, green and red slow pulsing light.  They object in this video moves from side to side across the sky and at times soars high above the mountains in the distance.  It&#39;s hard to see just how bright the light is from this video, but the objects really shone when at their brightest then fade to almost disappear before glowing again.  I estimate the UFO is about a mile away from where I filmed this, which should be close enough to hear some sound from a conventional aircraft, but there was complete silence.  This is the video link on YouTube:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ozPrVqc4dc.<n>
6/17/12 20:41|Xenia|OH|Rectangle|3 minutes|I noticed none of these objects while filming and my gut  tells me there was some external   'influence'  which did so.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90386.html|387|ndxe201206| I noticed none of these objects while filming and my gut  tells me there was some external   &#39;influence&#39;  which did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 17th of this year at 20:41hrs I stepped outside work to take some video of some very strange looking clouds. I panned back and forth, accross  the horizon, covering west, north and east. I did this a couple times, focusing on the clouds, roughly pointed at about 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most impressive cloud was a towering cloud with a very strange feature on top. I really cannot decribe it, but the three minutes of video capture it well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually took two seperate videos; one lasting about two minutes and twenty seconds(20:41hrs) and a second lasting about one minute(21:00hrs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During filming I noticed nothing other then the clouds I was filming, although I think I can recall some strange sun-light rays, beaming accross the sky which seemed to &#39;smear&#39; the clouds which it covered. Once again, the video can tell it best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best as I can recall, it was about two days later(6/19/2012) when I decided to use the footage as a medium for my music(guitar).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After creating what really is just an artistic hobby of mine, I titled the video &#34;Fire Clouds,&#34; and posted on a popular video viewing site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really liked the way the music amd video complimented each other and I was watching it repeatedly to get a good &#39;feel&#39; of it because I thoght I might re-make it with some improvements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing it 7-8 times I noticed what appeared to be a metalic disc at 1min:49 seconds into the video.  t was at about 45degrees and seemed to either create a cloud-like mist(putting it at about 100 yards away) or it was partly behind a cloud (putting it quite far).  It had a dome on the bottom and I could see part of one on top.   I would estimate its size at either 30 feet in diameter or 300 feet, depending on which distance it actually was from me.  Once again, the video shows this clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further inspection, I noticed a huge rectangular-shaped object partly sticking out from the clouds. Above was all on the first video and on the second I could see this second object moving away to the east but in second video it had rotated some 90degrees, displaying its book-shape appearance.  Large rectangular windows can barely be made out along the top front and top side edges(see video).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the easternly sky came into view, two more objects can be seen hovering above (but in the distance, not right above) a restaurant. Both were at about 35degrees above the horizon.  Both were right along the roof-line of the restaurant but obviously some distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object on the left side was pizza-box shaped with a dome-like structure on top.  This object appeared to be cloaked but could be seen well enough throgh its firey-cloud-like disguise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one on the right was triangle shaped and had a different cloaked appearence.  The light seemed to be smeared-out, making it diffivult to see well.(see video) I also noticed a large  tube-shaped cloud in the video, seen while filming due-west, torwards the setting sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending three videos along with this report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1)  A video which focuses on the rectangular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2) An un-interrupted look at  entire 2min+ long video<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3) The video &amp;quot;Fire Clouds&amp;quot;(My created video where objects were spotted)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankyou.<n>

Metallic colored crafts with the suns reflection shining off of some, amazing.  Some were in a cluster formation, others wre flying in sets of twos and threes, the remaining was just like roaming behind.  Most of the witnesses was saying wow you see what I&#39;m seeing, remarkable. I have seen my fair share of U.F.O.&#39;s in the recent past but not of that magnitude.  What was really on the back of that truck in Washington D.C?  makes you ponder.<n>

Directly across the street from the brewery, I saw what I initially thought was a smaller red hot air balloon moving slowly over the bank (don&#39;t know the name of the bank).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it move away from the bank, I noticed the sun shining on it and saw that it was metallic.  It was heading south at first, then changed direction in front of me and started heading east, gaining both speed and altitude.  It was only about 50-60 yards away from me when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend to come out of the brewery to see it too, but by the time she came out, it sped up and was almost completely out of sight.<n>

As I’m staring at them I noticed to my left was an object flashing red, blue and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first initial thought was an airplane because it was moving from left to right just like one.  I go back to staring at the lights at the ranch looking for any awkward movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set my binoculars down to look for the airplane and to my surprise it was in the same spot that I had seen it last, so now I look at it more careful and I noticed that it was flashing more like strobe light and not like an airplane, and that’s when realized this is not airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked at it with the binoculars and noticed it would get smaller and then bigger, I also saw it moving up and down left and right but not in that sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then I decide to tell my girlfriend I’m looking at a UFO, she didn’t believe me and demand that I went back to bed.

I believe that my life-long interest of aviation however, has given me the ability to observe and determine the differences between conventional and non-conventional aircraft in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 02:05, Atlantic Standard Time, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, when I stepped outside and into my back yard to have a smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the stars, as I often do, when they’re visible. That’s when I saw one of the stars moving at a fairly high rate of speed, South-East to North-West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I thought this to be a shooting star at first but the rate at which it moved through the air seemed too slow to be that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, to my astonishment, I noticed that the object was emitting a pulsating white light that engulfed it approximately every four seconds. The pulsations were also smooth. That is to say that it was like a dimmer switch being turned completely up, then back down again, to the almost off position. This dimmer effect would last about a second and a half between intervals. The object pulsated like that three times as it traveled across most of my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emitted no sound even though it was completely silent in my neighbourhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the object had not done what it did next, I wouldn’t have been able to guess its size or its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object moved to the far left of my view, it suddenly made an extremely sharp right-hand turn, North-East. No aircraft that I’m aware of could make such a turn at the apparent rate the object was traveling. I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then disappeared into a nearby cloud.  I waited for it to emerge but it didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately ten seconds later, and to the right (South-East) of the cloud, there appeared a tremendous white flash, as if from a giant camera.  It was not lightning.  It was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud appeared to be fifteen hundred to, two thousand feet from the ground and so I believe that the object was moving at a similar altitude as, it did not appear to change altitude during this observation.  I will admit that I do not know how far from my position the cloud was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, I should have been able to hear something if this was a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t hear a thing.<n>

This was after 202 merges but before the exits for 76.  There was light cloud coverage.  From the left there was a strange light pattern in the sky.  I brushed it off as a bar having a search light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that the angle of the light beams was parallel to the ground, horizontal.  This confused me and as I looked closer I realized it wasn&#39;t one light but two, like a light house. The two light beams were radiation at 180 degree angles from each other and both moving in a 360 spin, seeming to come from the same point within the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beams of light were very thick and seemed to go on for many miles in each direction, the light cloud coverage illuminating with the light and showing the beam very clearly.  I brushed this off as I knew there is a small airstrip in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I google searched what I saw and found a similar report on this website so I thought I would put this information out there.  This struck me as unusual because the light source seemed to be coming from a fixed position and the beams of light were undeniably moving at a set rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only explanation I could come up with is that it was a search helicopter that was in a spin, but this lasted the entire time I was within sight of it, and it never seemed to change elevation (and had two beams).  The best description is that it looked like someone had put a very large light house inside the cloud.<n>

It was coming from the Southeast and heading northward. It stayed on a direct path with no turns or pauses.  It was the only flying object that was in the sky at the time.   We watched this object for about a minute.  It was flying quite fast, but not as fast as a meteor, but not as slow as an airplane would.  This orange glow did not change in any shape, form or color. No sound was emitted in the evening quiet.  It just flew by over the blackness of the night sky, and headed North to Northwest and then it was gone.<n>

I watched the light move across the sky in a fluid motion for approximately 6 seconds at a rate of speed estimated to be twice that of a commercial jet. At that point, the light flashed once (again white) and I watched the light shoot away at an extremely high rate of speed. The light did not disappear, but appeared like a tracer being shot out of a military weapon till I quickly lost sight of it behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had though initially I was viewing a satellite (which I have seen before and could recognize), but when it flashed and shot off, I was stunned. I am at a loss to explain what I saw and in the process of contacting our local airport to see if they have any explanations or if there is any radar data to support what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I hear anything back from the airport, I will follow up with you also. Thanks again for your hard work and efforts!<n>

By the time I turned the corner, now heading north, we both saw that now there were only two lights side by side. We were on the east side of the State Capitol building now facing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were stationary at about 40 degrees above the horizon.   And we did not hear any noise.  After parking the car and a quick look for my camera, there was only one left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one lingered on for a bit more (5 seconds) then I was able to see it moving away heading east south east at a fast pace (another 4-5 seconds until I couldn’t see it any more.)

There are very few people in the park at that time because they close the parking lot and you need to park on a side street and walk into the park.  It was a cool damp misty sort of night with clouds and lots of layers of atmosphere.  We saw these dancing lights in the sky and at first tried to explain it--maybe strobe lights or reflections of some kind but nothing made sense.  The lights would start from one source, then spread out and dance around and then return to the source light. The whole sky had a different quality to it, almost like a magnetic type of storm.  This went on for 5-10 minutes, then the lights returned to their source point. I could still see where they were, it was a slight glow in the clouds, but they stayed there and stopped dancing. I had the feeling it knew we were watching.  The source light was still there when we left the park.  We ! have been back to the park several times since, but have not encountered those conditions or seen the lights again.<n>

A small plane coming from the north actually change course to either avoid it or to get a better view.  At this time the craft changed corse and dropped down below the tree line.<n>

He (being an ufo skeptic) was the one who first spotted them and he said they looked &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot;. There were 2 sets of 3 amber lights flying in unison.  The amber lights were in a line with a blinking light underneath the center one.  They were directly overhead when first spotted then traveled due East. They stayed in the same position the entire sighting, one in front, the other following directly behind and there was no sound.  I observed them through binoculars and couldn&#39;t make out any solid craft but the lights were definitely amber.  We observed them until they faded from sight.<n>

I had no intention of reporting my experiences until I received the Coast to Coast AM e-mail update on the June 20, 2012 show dealing with red-orange-yellow spherical UFO’s.   This is exactly the type of UFO I experienced all three times and the C2C show inspired me to report my experiences to NUFORC.  I did not have any way or chance to video any of these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting was my very first experience and it happened approximately 11:15 pm about 10 miles north of Syracuse , NY on August 30, 2011.  I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and watched the object approximately 10 minutes until it “disappeared” instantly.  It was moving very slowly overhead at maybe 2000 feet from NW to NE moving maybe a quarter of a mile along a straight path at constant altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all.  It appeared to be “pulsing” from red-orange and some yellow, kind of like a “glowing” ball almost like “fire”.  It was hard to estimate the size of the object  but it was larger than the lights of a landing aircraft or helicopter and much larger than when Venus was very visible this spring. (2012)   I KNOW it was NOT an aircraft, planet, balloon, flare, parachute or star.  I wonder if it could have been a secret military drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following two sightings were essentially “identical” to the first in the appearance and characteristics of the objects.  The second sighting occurred on June 14, 2012 at approximately 8:45pm in  Oswego, NY.    The object moved in a straight line NW to N. I observed it for about one minute and it moved out of site...it did not disappear. The last sighting was June 16, 2012 about 10:15 pm also in Oswego, NY.  It moved in a straight path S to N over the roof of my house I estimate at 2000 feet.  No sound and VERY slow and we observed it for about 5 minutes when it “disappeared” instantly. I KNOW it was not an aircraft, balloon or satellite .<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one difference in this object over the first two. I wear glasses and the object was so bright that it seemed to cause “ radiant spikes” from the general spherical shape. I took my glasses off and these “spikes” disappeared and I was able to make out a king of pulsing between the spherical shape to a kind of cubical-elongated shape. This made me think of a military drone of some kind.   I have no idea what my 3 UFO’s were other than “unidentified.”<n>

There was still some light from the setting sun allowing a small portion of the sky to still be visible.  We live a few miles north of Zanesville, Ohio.  We heard some neighbors shooting off fireworks, so we went out to see. We looked to the west and saw one bright circular orange object moving from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was one the rockets from the fireworks that had yet to burn itself out, mind you the fireworks had stopped going off at this point.   But it stayed lit and moved in a straight line, perfectly smooth. It appeared to be low in altitude and moved from south to north. It would estimate that it was between 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a little bigger and brighter than Venus.  My first reaction was that this was the ISS space station, because the object seemed to match the speed and was not flickering in any way.   But we looked it up and saw that the station was over the Atlantic ocean, which means it would have been on the eastern horizon moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled out my phone and took a video of the object.  It was already halfway across the sky when we got out there. It lasted 1:30 -2 minutes tops.  As it moved farther away, it appeared to dim, and then completely disappeared, my guess is that it went behind a cloud.  But the clouds appeared to be cirrus, meaning they were quite high in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up the weather for our area and saw that the wind speeds were calm (less than 5mph) and SSE.  So the wind was blowing the same direction as the object.<n>

Brighter than a plane would be and as it started to fade, I really paid attention. It had a light on it that was revolving around the outside until it finally disappeared. Never seen anything like it before.  We then started to drive and saw another one within a minute.  Stopped to watch and it, too, disappeared (traveling east to west). Didn&#39;t see the revolving light this time, however, it was not directly overhead as the first one had been.  Within 30 seconds, we spotted the 3rd orane orb coming from the south and trav! eling across the sky to the North, slightly west. What in the world are these things?  We were thinking maybe a new firework that has some amazing fading quality and can travel across the sky at the same height without falling before fading.  I also read about the chinese lanterns.  Not totally convinced, but maybe.  All three seemed to be traveling about the height of a local, lower flying plane and horizontally across the sky.  Can&#39;t wait to find out what they are!<n>

As we waited for traffic light to change, we noticed 6 dull orange, but bright lights round lights, low in the sky, flying in a zig-zag formation. These lights were not flashing, just glowing. Past them in the distance were 2 more, then 2 more appeared further back, it was quite unusual and unsettling.  They appeared to be coming from the Northeast, flying along the west side of the Delaware River, going down toward Middletown and Dover.  We rolled down the windows to listen for their engine sounds, but heard nothing. We thought we were being invaded.  very creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE RED BRIGHT LIGHT HAD NO OTHER COLOR THEN IT BEING RED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT THEN STARTED TO DIM AND THERE WAS NO MORE FIREBALL LOOKING LIGHT TO IT, THE RED LIGHT BECAME REALLY SMALL AND SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT, IT ALSO HAD A TRANSPARENT ILLUSION AND WE WERE ALL ABLE TO SEE A OVAL SHAPE OUTLINE THAT MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH THE BLACK SKY THROUGH IT. (FLAT TO SIDE WAYS) IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBJECT WAS BLENDING IN WITH THE NIGHT SKY. THEN THE RED LIGHTS FADED AWAY AND IT DISAPPEARED.  THIS OBJECT HAD NO SOUND AT ALL, IT BEING SO CLOSE. VERY STRANGE!

I forgot about them then saw an email from a fellow co-worker at MSP airport who sent an email to our co-workers at the airport asking about the two lights flying across the sky.

As I am recording I look at my phone screen and notice the there are two more smaller orange/red orbs that could not be seen with the naked eye.  All three obs formed a triangle together.  They were floating there was no noticeable movement.  My friend pulled up so I stopped recording. Later that evening I pulled my phone out to show what I had recorded and the video wasn&#39;t there anymore.<n>

I immediately saw a large stationary bright light in the WNW sky.  I initially thought it was a police helicopter search light pointed directly in my direction, then realized there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then thought it was a local shooting fireworks but there was no explosion.  I called for my wife to see.  She came out immediately and we thought it was a flare on a small parachute as it was pulsating and seemed to glow between red and orange, moving slowly to the SW.  I said to her, &#34;There is no wind.&#34; as we have a small weather station with an anemometer, it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not lose altitude and maintained about a 45 degree angle then began to get smaller and turned to the west maintaining the same altitude.  We watched it for about 2 minutes as it got smaller and it appeared to be moving west out over the Gulf of Mexico from our position until it eventually disappeared.  The entire sighting lasted about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  My wife describes the light as a fireball type of light, where I would say a pulsating ball of light.<n>

It came from the Southwest, then made a turn to the North and proceeded until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Buckeye and have seen lights over the south for several years, but these are more yellow in color and don&#39;t move across the sky, they just hang there and disappear and reappear for anywhere between a few minutes or sometimes almost an hour.  Luke AFB says they are flares, but they don&#39;t look anything like the flares that I saw that Luke has released.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, around 10:00PM my kids came in and got me out of bed and said they were back.  One would appear follow the same path, then disappear.  A few minutes later another one would appear and do the same thing.  We live where there are numerous flight a day come over our house including the F-16&#39;s from Luke, these lights were like none of these and didn&#39;t follow any flight pattern that I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter took video, with her digital camera, the shots aren&#39;t the best and her hands were not steady, but it definitely shows the light.  This happened about four times after 10, then stopped and we went in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what these were, but definitely not planes, jets, balloons, etc.... Nothing that I have ever seen.  I guess that makes them Unidentified Flying Objects.<n>

Around 28 Celsius, almost no clouds. All of a sudden, we noticed an white spherical object that seemed to be about right above us.  It moved erratically for around 20 seconds (back and forth, in circle)and then seemingly acquired a steady high velocity (no apparent acceleration; so it must have been extremely fast)and went north-east.  Didn&#39;t see anything after that.  Perspective might have been wrong, but it seemed to be at an altitude of around 1 Km, maybe more; but not much more, because there was a line plane nearby and it was obviously much higher than the object. Judging by the looks of it, the object&#39;s speed must have been of several hundred Km/h.  If my estimation of the height is correct, the object must have been around 5-20 meters in diameter. We didn&#39;t hear a sound.  The object didn&#39;t seem to emit any light. It looked like a dull white sphere to us, but it&#39;s possible it was of slightly different! shape.  It didn&#39;t emit anything like flames, smoke or any distortion, like an animal, a plane or a balloon would.  This leaves 2 possibilities to me: one, a UFO, and two, a rather strange atmospheric anomaly.  One thing is for sure, I had never seen anything like it in my life.<n>

It appeared to be high in altitude, we could see aircraft crossing our line of sight, the light was appeared to be at the same altitude.

There was no moon, a thin, high cloud cover we’d had at sunset had by then completely dissipated, leaving a cloudless sky. Winds were calm with the occasional light gust from the N (according to weather station MC9837, closest to our home:  http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=MC9837&amp;month=6&amp;day=15&amp;year=2012)  My wife and I are amateur stargazers and I had just finished drift-aligning our 203mm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in preparation for some DSLR astrophotography. My wife was visually observing Messier 13, the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, and I was readying my Vixen flip mirror camera mount. I happened to look up and saw two orange-ish/amber lights passing almost directly overhead, just south of the zenith and very near the star Arcturus, in a southwesterly direction and seemingly in a line approximating NE to SW. I did not notice them until after they were to the west of the meridian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our view of the sky is limited by trees surrounding our property, and we only have a clear view 60 degrees above the horizon to W, 15 degrees above the horizon to N, 30 degrees above the horizon to E (but with a large tree partially obstructing as high as 50 degrees to the NE), and about 20 degrees above the horizon to S. Thus, my view of those first two objects ended very soon after I saw them as they disappeared behind the tall trees to the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my wife’s attention with an exclamation along the lines of “what the hell was that?”, and when she looked up from the telescope, since it was pointing ENE at Hercules, she noticed an amber object through the trees just rising above our neighbor’s roof line (about 15 degrees above the horizon from that orientation) almost exactly NE. We soon saw a second such object, same color, and slightly to the north of the first. Our view of these objects was intermittent as they passed behind tree limbs, but the entire time we observed them we could see them climbing higher in the sky, passing just north of the star Vega, as they appeared to approach. As they cleared the tree we could see them clearly, although they simply appeared to be featureless orbs of light, larger than a point source (therefore unlike a star), but smaller by far than the disc of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these objects passed the meridian on a general SW heading, one of them seemed to fade, then briefly brighten, then fade out completely before the other one, whose apparent brightness hadn’t varied, disappeared from view behind the trees to the SW. The entire transit, from the moment we first observed them until they were lost to view due to the trees to our west, took about 30 to 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost as soon as the pair of objects passed overhead we saw 2 more such amber lights moving through the trees, originating at almost the identical spot where we saw the first pair, and also travelling SW at about the same rate. They were soon joined by a third amber light a bit to their north. All three of these objects tracked somewhat further north than the first set of objects, but still travelling from NE to SW and at the same apparent speed as the earlier objects (transiting in about the same amount of time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued seeing objects such as these appear above the roofline to our NE, watched them arc overhead, sometimes in pairs, sometimes singly, sometimes in threes, for the next 10 or so minutes. In all, I would say we saw at least 15 distinct objects, all of them tracking from NE to SW, some further N, but most nearly overhead. A few of the objects we initially detected above the roof line (at least 3) disappeared completely before clearing the tree and emerging in clear sky. Another one, in an initial group of three, faded out and then re-appeared as its companions crossed the meridian to the W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apparent rate at which all of the objects arced across the sky did not seem to vary.  They all took about the same amount of time to cross our field of view. It is impossible to estimate the altitude of these objects without having any referent to their actual size. None of them showed any type of blinking navigation or anti-collision lights as do aircraft.  We could not detect any sound from their passing; no noise of engine, no whoosh of air, nothing.  I was able to capture some short video of a couple of these objects, but the capture was made using a handheld cell phone, and so is of poor quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll close by saying that my wife and I both hold advanced degrees.  She is a Professor and I am a research scientist, with over 40 peer reviewed publications as either first or contributing author.  We are sober, intelligent and well-educated individuals who stand to lose respect and credibility by making claims of UFO sightings.  Yet, that is exactly what we saw.  These objects flew across the sky, and they are completely unidentified.  We can’t speak to their origin, but neither one of us has ever seen anything like them.<n>
6/15/12 22:40|Chateauguay (Canada)|QC|Triangle|3 hours?|I encountered three "people" who walked into a light pulsing space-craft.|6/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110353.html|451|ndxe201206| I encountered three &#34;people&#34; who walked into a light pulsing space-craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving down the Chemin-Saint Bernard road on my way to the store I saw, in the distance, what appeared to me to be Police sirens (on the right side side of the road (opposite the train bridge).  I slowed down figuring that there must be Police up ahead, maybe an accident etc... as I approached the two bridges and slowed down (both are full sized but only one allows for cars the other one is part of a walking path) I noticed that there were three people all dressed in tight black clothing leaning on the rail of the bridge looking at whatever it was that the Police were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put on my hazards and pulled over to the side. I got out of the car and approached the onlookers. I took a look myself and didn&#39;t see anything except the flashing lights directly ahead, which appeared to me now a little less like &#34;flashing lights&#34; and more akin to &#34;pulsing lights.&#34;  I turned to the man on my left and asked him &#34;what happened?&#34; the man turned, looked at me, said nothing and then turned his head back to it&#39;s original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note 1: They all had dark hair and eyes)  I then leaned forward to see if one of the other two would answer my question and, nothing. One member of the trio was a female and she had shoulder length dark hair. It was also then that I noticed that the skin of their faces was a little odd. It reminded me of what a woman looks like when she puts on a little too much foundation. I didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, I was much more curious as to what the Police were doing down there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note 2: There were two males and one female. The two males appeared like Caucasian men and the woman looked like a South-East Asian. Maybe even Mulatto. Another thing I didn&#39;t really notice at the time was that their chins were a little bit more &#39;pointy&#39; than usual and all of them had the same chin.)  (Note 3: Their clothing was, in retrospect, very... VERY tight,  it was almost as if their clothing was &#39;painted on&#39; rather than being actual clothing. Their pants were like tight cargo pants but had three big pockets across the length of the leg rather than one. The males and Female both dressed alike.)  I wanted to get a better look so I left them and headed to the other bridge via the walking path. When I looked down from the second bridge I saw a Delta shaped object that was &#34;pulsing&#34; red and blue light. The craft itself looked black and very smooth/shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I started to breath a little heavy ... slowly starting to take in what I may be looking at. I have never seen anything like it. The craft itself was about the length of an average tow-truck and about 30 ft wide at the widest area. The craft was silent and made no noise. It also didn&#39;t seem to have much impact on the water it was floating above (probably hovering at 2-4 ft tops).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at this thing I heard some rattle and rocks being moved around. I looked to my left and saw one of the &#34;people&#34; coming down from the other &#39;path&#39; (this path is to the left of where I was and is not as clean cut) I shouted to him &#34;You have to see this!&#34; he didn&#39;t even acknowledge me and kept walking to the other side and down towards the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note 4: These &#34;people&#34; were not aggressive. They seemed not only to not acknowledge me except for a brief look, but, did not even seem the slight bit concerned that I was looking at whatever I was looking at. They walked very calmly. Even when it was obvious that I was about to put two and two together. It was like they did not care.)  A few moments later the other two started walking the same path and very calmly headed towards the shore. When they were all assembled below the bridge they started walking towards the craft, female first, and then walking INTO the craft. No doors (at least that I could see/hear) they walked into the craft as if walking through a wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulsing lights stopped. The craft then started moving (it also began to emit a faint buzzing sound that was somewhat... hypnotic).  The craft then switched on a pale blue light underneath it and then started to accelerate slowly to about 35 KM/H towards the Saint-Lawrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to panic! I had been within a foot of whatever they were. Maybe they would come back for me? Maybe there were others on the way!?  I ran back through the path that I had came through, got into my car, jumped into the seat and after a few tries finally got the key into the ignition and took off down the road (turning into Rene-Levesque street). About 5 minutes later... Still breathing hard with a heart that still felt like it was going to burst from out of my chest I got off the road and parked in a parking lot. I took my cellphone from the hand-rest ... I wanted to call a buddy of mine and tell him what had just happened, maybe meet up for coffee... I just really didn&#39;t want to go back home!  (Note 5: I don&#39;t remember turning my engine off when I pulled over, but I might have.)  Anyways I looked at the lock screen and it read &#34;1:57 A.M.&#34; That was IMPOSSIBLE, the whole experience only lasted at max 15-20 minutes! I looked at my watch (digital) which said that it was 11:08 P.M, I toggled my cars display and the car also said the same (it actually read 11:09 P.M)  I drove to Tim Horton&#39;s and their clock said 2:05 A.M  *If 3 hours really did pass I have no recollection of what happened during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *I do not believe that I was abducted. I have no memories, no physical scars and no headaches etc. I feel perfectly fine, a little shook I guess, but, fine.<n>

Seen by 7 people<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy nigh with no stars, planet, or moon in site.  My brother, sister, and dad were enjoying a Father&#39;s Day dinner from our gazebo on my deck which faces the south but has a view to the west and east.  What I figured about 10:20pm my sister and brother had gone inside and when they came back out to the deck my brother turned to his left and yelled, &#34;What is that?!?&#34;  My initial thought was a a plane but I will look.  From inside my gazebo I leaned down to see and saw 3 very large orange lights hovering in a triangle formation silently in the sky to our west.  My dad and I quickly exited the gazebo and joined my sister and brother to run down to the yard to get a better view.  That&#39;s when I noticed there were 4 and they were in a diamond shape.   I called my neighbor over who was outside with her granddaughter and her friend.  They joined us and we all watched for about 30 seconds as one by one they seemed to ascend into the clouds.  By the time ! we saw them hovering the whole event was about a minute and a half.  I&#39;m sure they were there longer as they seemed to just be hanging out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to report this to my local newspaper to see if anyone else reported anything.  I did try to get a video with my phone but even on the clearest night with the moon shining bright the images are very difficult to see if at all. I did get one pinpoint size on camera but I was shaking and running to much to get any more focused. I was more interested in watching with my eyes, not trying to focus my camera.<n>
6/15/12 22:15|Three Rivers|MI|Fireball|5 - 10 minutes|We saw 5 to 6 orange glowing UFO's traveling in a row about 30 seconds apart across the highway.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90075.html|455|ndxe201206| We saw 5 to 6 orange glowing UFO&#39;s traveling in a row about 30 seconds apart across the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:15 pm, Friday, June 15th, 2012 my wife and I were traveling south in our car on Highway US 131 in Three Rivers, Michigan. The sun was just disappearing to the west as it was dark to the east. I noticed a bright light object in the sky to my left (east) as I was driving. The immediate thought was to see if the light was from the top of a tower such as a cell phone tower and to see if it blinked like one. The object did not blink and the bright light of the object was moving closer toward us. Then I thought that it might be an airplane since it was moving. I realized that it was not an airplane because it didn&#39;t have the small classic lights or blinking lights (red or white) that you see from an airplane in the sky. As the object traveled closer, I realized that the object consisted of a bright fire-like orange glow. I immediately found the closest side street off of the highway and parked my car. My wife stayed in the car but I grabbed my cell phone! , got out of the car and walked toward were the UFO was traveling overhead of us. I used my iPhone 4s to take pictures and a video of the UFO. While recording the object in video mode, my wife yelled out to me from the car that another one was coming over the trees. I moved my camera to record the other similar UFO. There were approximately 3 more bright fire-like orange glowing objects traveling across the highway in succession. A total of 5-6 UFO&#39;s seemed to be following each other in a pattern of about 30 seconds apart and were about 500 feet or more into the night sky above. I believe that each UFO was about the size of a very small house. The UFO&#39;s did not make any sound but just seem to glide effortlessly across the sky. I was simply amazed and in awe of how big and bright they were. Each one of the UFO&#39;s flew almost directly over us toward the west and disappeared over the trees and into the clouds. They seem to have come from over the trees and through clouds on the! other side (east side) of the highway. This is a first time I! &#39;ve seen a UFO. I showed my Dad the footage I obtained and he told us that that was the same object he saw last year Memorial Day weekend. Although the bright orange glowing UFO my Dad saw traveled downward toward him and his friends and suddenly, at a very high rate of speed, changed directions at about 45 degrees and disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I crossed into Hillsdale, I looked to my left (east) and noticed a large, glowing orange sphere.  I orginally took it for the moon and thought it was odd to be located in that part of the sky.  As I turned east onto Washington Avenue, I noticed another flaming ball in the sky.  I thought they both were helicopters (despite the orange glow) and opened my window to hear the rotors.  I heard nothing.  I pulled onto my street and then into my driveway.  Getting out of my car, I returned to the street and looked up.  There were now three glowing, orange balls in a triangular formation in the northern sky. I called to a guest who was going into my home. As a retired police officer, I thought he might have an idea as to what the objects were. We watched them together. The objects appeared  not to be moving and maintained this formation for 3 solid minutes as we discussed what! they could be.  We then called to the others to come out and see, as we did the intensity began to diminish from orange to white and eventually faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My wife and mother an sister inlaw all noticed the object also. It sat still then came slowly at us , it dropped to about 1,500 ft because we could see if was about half way below the top of the mountain moving west. The object changed shape from round to oblong and back to round and changing colors from red to orange. Whatever this thing was stopped directly over my house and hovered. We all got out of the car and looked at it , it was silent and very still. After a few minutes it shrunk down in size and moved north east and a unknown speed. It was just to small to judge its speed. We saw this same object over the same exact area about 5 years ago this time. it did exactly the same thing and then moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/15/12 21:00|Huntington|NY|Light|1-2 years|Strange lights in the sky that move and follow me, and weird experiences.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103014.html|462|ndxe201206| Strange lights in the sky that move and follow me, and weird experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is (possible abductions story and) UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I was born in Phoenix Arizona, went to a performing arts high school.  I did well there and graduated.  My family moved to Huntington Station, NY. Now we live in Huntington, NY.  I still live with my parents and I’m 21 going to college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lost track but I have been seeing weird lights in the sky at night (not every night) that move on their own will, and sometimes to my will, which sometimes flash with a sort of personality or speaking manner for a year and a half to two years now since after these experiences:  I thought I might have been in danger because I couldn’t sleep for three days in a row because I was shaking or my bed shook every time I was about to fall asleep and so I then went to the hospital.  The doctor told me I was hallucinating.  I sought psychiatric help and was put on anti-psychotics because they thought I had shizo-affective disorder.  I’ve been on medications for over a year and a half now and none of the medications I was put on or am on now helped in any way so that helps prove that I wasn’t hallucinating.  I have no family history of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder although I do have a family history of paranormal activity.  None of which were thought to be with aliens (tha! t I know of,) but a few times when I was younger I realized that I had scars on my skin that seemed to have been a healing from cut (which they mysteriously disappeared later on.) I even showed my mother them and I had no explanation for where they came from or how it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this one day I was listening to my first iPod touch on shuffle.  The songs would very often come up relevant to what I was doing or thinking at that moment.  The same songs even began to play over and over again which is odd for a 1,500 song playlist (the device was not on repeat mode.)  Later at night I came home and started looking up the lyrics to the songs I was listening to at that moment because I thought I was being communicated to from a higher being.  After hours of listening and reading it seemed the lyrics were being changed on the websites.  I eventually felt changes and weird sensations going on in my head, and after about 6-10 hours of this, with occasional breaks, I was dyslexic and felt an emotional void of darkness (I was not on - or had been on - any drugs.)  Sometimes between the songs I would hear a weird clicking sound or noises that didn’t happen before.  In the morning I went downstairs and then threw up in the trash can because of how sick it made me.  The next song had written in the lyrics, “Wow really you threw up?”  A song or two later it told me to kill myself in which I was about to but didn’t.  I later looked up the same lyrics and none of the edits were there.  Just to clarify I didn’t have that episode of insomnia until maybe a month after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that week I was up in my room when it sounded like cabinets downstairs were opening and closing. As I was going down the stairs it stopped.  Another day that week I was lying down and I heard this strange hovering-like sound. It sounded like it was right above my house.  On a different day I was in my room looking outside the window hoping to see this light I thought might be a UFO.  I saw it and then got bored.  Later I was not looking at my window and my room lit up with this passing green light.  After I went to the hospital I was sent to an inpatient hospital to be watched.  During the middle of my stay there I was looking out the window to see if the UFO was there.  It was and the whole time I was watching it it was getting closer and until it was just about to go over my head to where I couldn’t see it it kind of sparkled a whole bunch on the bottom of the craft with orange lights.  By that time I was hearing a cute girly voice that said, “what was that?” just as it flew! over my head displaying the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a while after the “mind screw” I was very sensitive to sounds and my jaw started moving on its own in ways I’m incapable of doing (before I was on medications so it wasn’t a side-effect from them.)  Eventually the noises stopped, in which the noises where from my surroundings like tapping on the car window or tapping on my ceiling or crackling of which were in synchronicity with my thoughts, and I started to hear this voice which developed from what I thought it was.  I still hear the voice and there was no difference of it being on the medications since.  The voice definitely has a conscience of its own because it says words that I have never heard in my life or at least words that I might not have heard since I can remember.  I hear this voice most of the day shortly after waking up to when I go to bed.  Now the voice is loving and reassuring.  It started happening again lately that I sometimes shake when I’m about to fall asleep but now I eventually am able to fall asleep and I can still feel my bed moving sometimes (just in a more evasive fashion.)   Just to point out my friend saw the moving light in the sky once and acknowledged my claim.  I’ve been told it’s just a satellite but I can’t agree because sometimes I see more than one at a time and it’s too often.  Usually they’re orange and about the same size as a star, but stars don’t flicker rapidly, change color, and move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost done… I see these strange a light in my room (when the lights have been turned off which is usually blue or white) or lights in the “forestry” behind my house sometimes at night which are yellow or red and may move as if in a swiping manner, and sometimes I see white lights when I close my eyes which are like sparks that linger and then sort of “shut.” Although I see lights behind my eyelids it doesn’t mean I don’t see them externally as well. Seeing them behind my eyelids are only recent and they don’t move unlike the ones I think are UFOs or whatever it is that’s in the “forestry.” The last note is that I have seen a large black eyeball on the ceiling of my room in the last house for a split second after I had shut my eyes for a brief moment. It then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this is experience. I knew nothing of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings before any of this happened to me but only of the sci-fi stuff you see on television. None of what I have experienced is from those shows or movies of which I have seen. I did do research afterwards and found some common traits people shared with alien contact. There are many songs I have now found that share some similarities to my experiences and makes me believe in them even more. I should mention that my dogs would hide and be frightened at times, whining and barking at things when there wasn&#39;t anything going on, not even a storm or noises that we could hear. I apologize if this is a waste of your time..<n>

We were in an automobile, the weather was clear, when from the Northeast going to the Southwest a white ball of light flew over our heads at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball was flying at perhaps five times tree height. It was going at a level line with the tree line not at an angle with the ground. It was perfectly round and about 20 feet in diameter.  It was a very white light going at a speed at least that of a jet.  We watched it for only about five seconds.  It had no flame or tail in back of it.  There was no lightning or bad weather, skies were clear.  We both saw it.  It did light the area around it reflecting light off of the trees.  Again it did not change elevation like a meteor would.<n>

The sun went down but the sky was still blue.  I looked up and saw one light very high in the sky.  The one light hovered and then in the blink of an eye there was another on beside it.  The two lights then flew over each other and went in opposite directions.  We watched them disappear into the distance and then in the original spot another light appeared.   This light hovered and appeared to swing back and forth and then moved away and disappeared.  Then another light appeared it hovered without moving and we watched until the light went completely out. It just went out like a light switch.  It was the brightest light of all lights we saw and when it went out we were amazed.  About a minute later we saw one more light hovering lower than the previous lights but it too just disappeared.  We had not been drinking or smoking anything and there were no clouds in the sky and there were no stars yet. The sky was still blue.<n>

As you might guess the sighting occurred at my flying field, the club name is Amidair..part of MAAC..  As my type of flying « «  a mix of 3D and precision » » require steady concentration I prefer to fly alone, so I usually get to the field very early 05:45 get set up and usually do several flight in a row before the crowd gets there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That morning the sky had several patches of gray clouds and I was doing my usual bag of tricks with my plane, and after I did a rolling circle I notice that some thing was occupying a previous empty spot in the shy at around 2 o’clock, honestly, I must admit that I had the feeling of being watch..  I also had the feeling that it was closer to me then the other clouds, we all know that doing a distance evaluation of object in the sky is very difficult since there is no point of reference, as a remote pilot like me, it’s some thing you learn the hard way as you think that your plane is in front of the three just to see it disappear in the back of it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I’m flying my plane and with time my brain send me a few red flag so I get really interested and I want to take a good look at it so I go in an easy flying mode, doing some long and slow climbing that give me a few good five seconds to stare at it.  The more I look at it the greater my interest grew and the harder it was to fly my plane..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was very surreal, basically it had a center mass with 3 long point sticking out, if I remember well one was at 12 o’clock one at 4 oc and one at 8 oc.  The surreal part was that it was camouflage &#39;&#39;same color&#39;&#39; like the other cloud with a wad of cloud around the spike and center mass so I never saw any metal or hard surfaces just a 3 spoke cloud… now I remember thinking ’’ that’s the proof.. 3 point clouds don’t exist.. so I kept flying in a survival mode so I could keep my eyes on it up to the time that it did start ’’  I guess’’ to move away from me, I say I guess… because with the same outside look, it just shrink smaller and smaller.  So if it was going away from me it must have done it in a very.. straight line with me, if it did, that denote some intelligence that it knew that I was looking at it and try to confuse me by not having a lateral movement, I looked at it until it totally disappear then I scan the sky for a moving object, I do think that I saw some th! ing reflecting the sun doing a small curve but I’m not sure..<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, while I was still flying my remote plane.. 2 big 747 did a very… low fly by right over my head, it seam that they where coming from a take off from the Mirabel airport that is fairly close to my flying field..  They both appear far in front of me, going to my right did a long u turn, came over my head, it was so low that I got uncomfortable flying my plane.. the first pass was right over my flying field the second was a bit wider to my back..  I’ve been a member of this club for a few years now, we see our fare share of real plane passing over our field on approach to Mirabel airport, we have what I call the FedEx express that come in like a clock in the morning,  We also see a special 4 turbine engine plane with a fifth turbine engine, strap to the right or the cockpit , for testing purposes I guess, but never I saw a 747 or two for the matter at such a low altitude..   What crossed my mind for the 747 is that the government is doing some monitoring on ufo, that seems to have.. from what I can read, a weakness for airport traffic..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there you go.. I now can dye happy because I finally saw one; too bad it took me so long to realize it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/15/12 04:58|Fremont|CA|Circle|10-15 minutes|Golden UFO Sphere in the Sky|6/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89704.html|467|ndxe201206| Golden UFO Sphere in the Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard having a cigarette between the hours of 430-515am on June 15th 2012.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a roundish bright golden light coming over the mountain by the radio antenna&#39;s.   I watched it flying then suddenly stop in mid air.  It proceeded to stay there for about a minute then took off towards the south and disappeared.  There was no sound coming from the object like you would hear if it was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so excited to see this phenomenon I got on my Facebook page and mentioned it and how bummed out I didn&#39;t get it on video.  I continued to watch that part of the sky and mountain area for a while longer.  Suddenly a rainbow colored light appeared on the mountain.  The rainbow colors reminded me of a prism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared out of nowhere.  It was like a light that was turned on except it illuminated a large part of the mountain with rainbow prism like colors.  The roundish rainbow colored object rose about 100-200 feet off the ground then proceeded at a slow pace northbound along the bottom of the mountain.  The object stopped turned bright golden color and rose quite rapidly straight up and hovered in the air glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my cell phone at this time as it hovered in the air to record a video.  I posted the video on YouTube at<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/9Oh_M32WdBw<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video I tried to get some reference points like the moon and another plane that happened to be flying over at the time of filming.  Neither plane nor object interacted with each other.  I continued to film the object until it started flying southbound out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in this area since childhood and fully aware that I live over the flight path of 3 major airports. I know the difference between a plane, helicopter, hang-glider, para-sailing, etc.  I was asked (was it a Chinese lantern)  Oh not even close. The size of the object on the ground was huge. Chinese lanterns don&#39;t come in sizes of mansions that I am aware of.  There isn&#39;t even a helicopter the size of this object I witnessed.<n>

As i walk out the door i look to my left i saw three diffrent color lights over the tree tops red,blue and white just motions less with no sound and i kept looking i saw a shape like oval object that the lights was on the lights was not bright and one light appered on side in and on and off it was white I watch it for about ten minutes before vanished.<n>

Several people on the internet were discussing them.  They were aligned in a diagonal pattern.  The first and second one had the most activity.  They were blinking red, green, blue, and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally, you would see red emitted from underneath.  They appeared to be spinning. There were not close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed for a long time.  During this time 2 orbs of very bright white light appeared moved quickly and disappeared.  One hovered for approximately 15 seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night was as clear as the previous one; however, theses objects were no longer there.<n>

It was in the shape of a triangle and had a bluish tint to it and after it watching it for about 20 minutes, it disappeared and a whitish/blue &#34;unknown&#34; in the shape of a fireball appeared and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I believe in Extraterrestrials and are curious about it but to see something like this with your own eyes is very creepy.<n>

I needed to put the chickens away for the night and was pretty late with the chore, usually they are put to bed right after dusk, but i was late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t help but stop and look at the stars for a little while before walking back home up the driveway. then this light was there and was nothing like i have seen before. i see planes going to Bellingham and planes going in all directions from there and from Anacortes also, so i know what the planes look like, even if there is no sound. this was no plane. solid light. i know what satellites look like too because i like watching them skim by. but this thing was big and really bright and was in control. I dont know, mabe it was the ISS or something. It was NOT a plane or a hellicopter, and seemed too big to just be in orbit. real odd.<n>

As we watched the objects broke the triangle formation and proceeded to form a straight line across the sky traveling in unison with each other to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that the object in the front of the line gave a couple of bright pulses and would fade out only to be replaced by another one in the back of the line. This occured several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was with me said that the objects weren&#39;t far away and I should drive to get closer(I couldn&#39;t judge their distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got into the car and proceeded an eighth of a mile up the boulevard and he was right, they wre right above us.  We got out of the car and looked directly up and there they were silently floating over us about 1000 feet up. They were perfect spheres with a bright gold center that was like a welding arc.  The light didn&#39;t travel outside of the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flashed out one by one I realized they were still there, only they were now dimly lit specks of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all turned direction and were heading back over the port of Providence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this now because I saw the report of another person about the same thing on that night in the same area.  He mustve just caught the tail end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m so glad I found this sight, I feel relieved and validated.<n>

Cranston, RI (Edgewood section).  I was inside and walking up my stairs when a bright light caught my eye outside the window.  I looked out and saw two very bright, large, fireballs moving across the sky, one some distance behind the other.  They seemed to be travelling the same path, at the same speed, as if one was following the other and they were moving from away from my house, towards the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, I thought they could not be planes.  They were both very bright – their interior color was white/gold and the outer part of the balls was bright red, with a star-like, flaming appearance.  They did not look in any  way how planes look in a night sky – no flashing lights, only one glowing ball, as opposed to several small lights, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because they appeared so unusual, I wondered if the thick glass of my window was distorting the light and causing the flame-like appearance and the color separation of the white/gold and red.  I went downstairs to a window that I could open that does not have a screen in it, and the balls looked exactly the same – bright white/gold interiors and red flame-like edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to move on the same path, away from me, toward the southwest, one behind the other, and then the one in the front and furthest away from me just disappeared from view (as opposed to fading away as it got further and further away.)  Then the second one disappeared.<n>

I do not know the altitude that they are flying at, but they seem to be at a medium height and make no sound I can detect even after they pass overhead.  I used to live in northern metro Detroit where there was lots of air traffic and I always heard jets overhead, we also still hear jets overhead sometimes but this recent night the one aircraft that flew over that was silent was followed by another craft that I could not make out the shape of, but the second craft blinked a super bright white light.  It was kind of strange, I am sure these are some type of military craft.<n>

Lower than airplanes I see around here, or at least appeared low.  It looked like fire. Not really blinking, but sizzling would maybe describe it best. It was moving fast like if were an airplane, but would&#39;ve had to be a low flying airplane.  I was at one side of the barn Znd yelled to my Freind at the other end for her to look up.  She said&amp;quot;that&#39;s weird, what is that&amp;quot;.  I ran to her end to watch it, but it appeared to be smaller and s little more faint. Like it wasobing up or fading out. It looked like a flame about to die.  There was not one sound coming from the sky, nothing. It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched airplanes fly Around after that, a which looked Md sounded like airplanes, even with them being much further away and much higher, I could hear them.  This orange light was moving west, towards the gulf. It looked like a flame from a hot air balloon ( the best thing I can think to describe it).  My Freind said it was much to fast for that.

We live outside of town, in a small neighborhood, with a wooded pasture directly behind our back yard. The temperature was warm and humid. There was no wind. It was very clear and starry out. My friend and were having coffee,talking when her face looked shocked and she began to point behind me, saying &amp;quot;what&#39;s that?&amp;quot; I turned around and in the north east horizon were at least, twenty-five to thirty, bright, orange glowing globes. At first they appeared to be floating. There was no sound. They were in a shape of the letter &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; but sideways. We started to scream for my son and my husband. We ran in the house as my son was coming out. At this time they appeared to be moving from south west to north east. My son and my friend both tried to take pictures with their phones. It was as though the orbs were moving, but still floating- suspended- just above the tree lines. I! ran back in the house to get my husband. He grabbed his binoculars. We all went to the front of the house and stood in the drive way. By this time the &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; formation had started to disappear, first the &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; part then the &amp;quot;tail&amp;quot; began to move out of a line and the orbs were moving,individually. My husband watched these with his binoculars until they seem to just float behind the trees. He described to us that there were no flashing lights, but they just seemed to glow. He said &amp;quot;There were no oustanding features, they looked like bright, orange pumpkins to him&amp;quot; We started to get in the car and see if we could follow them,as it seemed they did not go away, but just floated out of our sight. We went back to the deck and discussed what we saw. We decided to call the police to see if anyone had reported seeing these.  The police got our address, ask if we were okay, and told us that they had not had any reports at that time.  I have meant to! call back this week to see if anyone else did call that night! . I am a 47 year old preschool teacher, my friend is a high school counselor, my husband is a 47 year old plant manager, and my son who witnessed this too is 27.  I cannot explain what we saw, none of us can. We all agree it could not have been a plane, or helicopters because there were so many and they seemed to be close together, with no sound.  But as my son said&amp;quot; I have seen it with my own eyes,now I am a believer.&amp;quot; I am not a crazy, dramatic person, but I know what we saw was real( a real something) and I will never forget it as long as I live!<n>

I was shooting with a wide angle of 18mm and caught a digital image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A white one over the cloud and a red one to the right of the cloud.<n>

I thought maybe it was fire works so I continued looking around to see if there was more but I saw none, the light reminded me of a shooting star, seemed to have a tail light when it disappeared, fireworks do not just disappear like that, was a weird experience for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were at a red light on the corner of Linden &amp; Beecher Rd.  I looked up in the sky and coming from the south eash and heading north west was a HUGE fireball looking things going through the sky.  It changed colors a couple time, but was mostly a aqua greenish blue color.  The sky was clear, except for the path of this fireball.  It seemed to be traveling behind the only clouds in the sky and shortly after it went out of sight, the clouds faded away as well.  The object kind of looked like a roman candle, but it wasn&#39;t going vertical, it was going horizontal and it was descending as it went across the sky.  No way was it a firework.  It was also about 2&amp;quot; in diameter as it went across the sky.  I mean it was LARGE.  No firework could have done this unless someone fired it from a helicopter over 10k feet and even then.... it would be so small like a spec.  This was huge!  My first time eve! r seeing anything like this.  It is something I will always remember it for as long as I live.<n>

The were visible for approx. 5 seconds, then disappeared. No sound, no trails, no movement...only sequences of large, bright orange lights appearing and disappearing.

When it first appeared it was 1 then the  2nd one appeared and as soon as it appeared the first one faded out and soon after the 2nd one faded out both in about 10 - 15 seconds.  I asked my wife did she see that and she said yes, what was it? I stated I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in about 3 minutes later in the south eastern sky it appeared again but this time it was 3 lights..  One and as soon as the second was lit then the third.  Then the first faded, then the second, then third.  Again, back to the eastern sky in about 5 minutes the two appeared the same way as previous and then fading back out.  Then about 5 minutes later back to the south eastern sky 4 appeared the same fashion as 3 and fading out just the same.  My son and stepson came out and seen the last 4 and are now wearing my wife and I out with questions and we have no answers so we turn to the web and see that several responses have been posted over the past few years in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though we live about 8 miles south from MYR airport and the 2 planes I seen was more towards north of the glowing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel the same in being lucky in seeing this with my family and experiencing the sight.<n>
6/14/12 20:15|Dana Point|CA|Changing|25 minutes|Large erratically moving object over Dana Point, CA|6/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89589.html|492|ndxe201206| Large erratically moving object over Dana Point, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spotted a large bright light out my driver’s side window while heading out of Dana Point, Ca, towards Interstate 5 on ramps.  It seemed to be turning towards me at the time and was at about my 10 o&#39;clock.  The light it was emanating was reminiscent of the light from Venus in early morning.  My first reaction was that it was unusual but then I considered the possibility that it was a helicopter or airplane. It’s movements changed from stationary to large dramatic circular motions.  The light would also change from small (appeared to be 3 small lights) to one big wide and much brighter light.  I tried to find a good place to stop but could not so I hoped on the 5 north and pulled off on the next exit.  I watched it in my rear view mirror the whole time.  I pulled to the end of a dead end street and attempted to get some video of the object.  There was another person parked not far from where I stopped.  I watched it continue to bounce and dance in strange patterns with its ever changing brightness and altitude. I filmed with my camera phone zoomed in as far as it could go.  Unfortunately it does freeze several times but the movement is still apparent. I was approximately 1 mile north of where I first spotted it.  As I was heading back to my car the other car that was parked pulled up and the gentleman had a video camera.  He addressed me by saying, “ what the hell is that thing?”   I told him I didn&#39;t know but that I thought it almost looked like a kite with lights attached.  He pointed out that it was really large as it was clearly viewable from over a mile away.  He said he was heading south to attempt to get a better view. I did the same and got on the 5 south back towards Dana Point.  I watched it carefully and its movement became incredibly dramatic with major altitude and brightness shifts.  It made a sudden drop in altitude and I lost sight of it behind a concrete wall on the freeway just before I was exiting.  It did not reappear.<n>

Thought it was a plane, but they came back.  Thought maybe it was a planet, but there was more than one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three other individuals were on the beach standing on the shoreline looking up which led me to believe they saw it too.<n>

At first, I thought that it was a star, but when I looked carefully at it, I noticed that it was moving.   But still I ignored because I thought that it was an aeroplane as where I live, many planes fly over my apartment’s buildings.  I kept walking.  There was no one around and even some of the street lights weren&#39;t lit, it was quite dark.  Then, I just suddenly heard a loud sound like something flew right behind me.  So I looked back and saw that the object had come a little near from its earlier position and was flying in circles and some kind of pattern like it first went vertically down at great speed (almost like it was floating) and then, it flew in a semi-circle upwards from left and then from right and it kept doing this for some time. I felt very strange, I can’t describe the feeling.  It was a strange feeling watching it; I just couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.  After stopping for a few seconds, it emitted a flash and just disappeared.  I hadn&#39;t shared this info with anyone since then, not even my parents or my family.  I thought they would think that I&#39;ve started having hallucinations or I&#39;ve gone mentally sick and also I wasn&#39;t sure what I had just experienced and seen.  I haven’t seen that thing since then.<n>

This was suggested by my friend who at one point was pursuing a degree in aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started about 11PM.  I was taking the trash out for our weekly pickup.  When I took the first trash bags out I noticed immediately to the north (orientation of our driveway) that there was an aircraft (almost looked higher, but could have maintained altitude) coming directly at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell it was moving slow so I went back in and got my second load of trash bags, but this time I decided to wait to watch this thing fly over.  It had strobes that resembled a normal airplane, but had some other funky strobes.  The bottom of the craft was lit up and it was gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft had to be flying under 500Ft in altitude.  I can tell that it was lower than any prop airplane I have seen  in the area.  It took the craft about 30sec to fly the length of my property which isn&#39;t even 150yds in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew immediately overhead and made no sound.  I took a short movie as it was leaving the town, which turned out okay.  Nothing special, shows some strobes, but no other l! ights that I could see with the naked eye.  It took the plane another 4min (approx) to fly out of site.  I noticed it turned to the east for a split second, then back south, and then it appeared the lights just stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will double check in the AM once there is daylight with my angle that I was standing at that it couldn&#39;t have gone behind a building.  I&#39;m a confident that it did not go behind anything however.  If an admin wishes to contact me for the video I can send the youtube link.<n>

During the first moments of observing this object, I was carefully trying to figure out what it could be.  There were no strobe lights on it and no other colored lights, and it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought that it could be someone on a self-propelled hang glider with a light attatched to it, or even a hot air balloon; until I noticed the object almost come to a complete stand still in the sky with no loss in elevation.  Right at that moment out of the corner of my eye, from the right side, I noticed a second similar object moving quickly towards the first object that was hovering. It looked like the first object had waited for the second one to catch up.  Right when they got closer together, they both began to rise in unison. It was right at that time that the Buffalo Airport was landing planes and without realizing it at first, these two objects were in the glide path of the jet that was about to land. The pilot of the landing jet had to see these two objects as they were in his direct line of sight while he was landing.  The Buffalo tower must have seen them also.  So these two round glowing balls of light rose up to get out of the way of the incoming jet.  As the jet passed underneath them, they continued to rise at a high rate of speed; disappearing in seconds.  These two object had intelligent motion.  First, one slowed down and waited for the other; then they rose up to get out of the way of an oncoming jet, then they ascended at rate of speed never seen before into the night sky.  No aircraft, glider, hellicopter, or balloon could have did what I seen these two objects do.<n>

One directly over top the other. they appeared suddenly from seemly no where lasting several seconds, then like a switch was thrown disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly after that the same strange glowing spheres appeared, this time 3 of them in a triangle.  One over the other with one to the left forming a triangle.  Lasting a few seconds then disappearing all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later two appeared side by side (looked like orange/red headlights) at just above the ocean horizon.  These two lasted 10-15 seconds, then disappeared.  There were several people in chairs on the beach that witnessed it.  After this twinkling white lights were seen at the same point on the horizon moving back &amp; forth up &amp; down rapidly. These lasted several minutes.  Many on the beach thought they could be military.  We didn&#39;t hear any aircraft.   We saw a very similar I incident in Pawleys Island in May 2010 and reported it on this site.<n>

They would appear for approximately thirty seconds before almost what seemed to be a fading out effect.  The single lights kept appearing about a minute or two apart, at this point they have started slowly move towards Gulf Shores. After a few minutes the light disappeared all together and then a much larger object appeared with five or six lights( which were flashing) appeared, this larger one appeared twice.  After the last time this one showed up we saw a falling star and the lights stopped.  About an hour later I saw another single orange light more towards Gulf Shores and it stayed for about thirty seconds or more and then it moved a little to the west at a 90 degree angle and faded out.

One was heading west, the other heading east toward Lake St. Clair.  This was over St. Clair Shores / Grosse Point Woods, MI.  They were very shiny, white, and appeared to have a dark non-reflective band around the middle.  We saw the one slowly turn southbound, then head west again.  The other remained heading east.  Definitely cylindrical with no wings and super reflective. Even at 8pm, it was still very bright and sunny.  They made no sound and left no trails of any kind.  We watched them for what felt  like 3 to 5 minutes until they were out of sight.  Within minutes of seeing these two things, an orange coast guard helicopter circled over the area, coincidentally or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just assumed they are some kind of experimental craft or drones as we are in close proximity to Selfridge ANGB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this YouTube video taken by someone else, somewhere else, of EXACTLY what we saw up in the sky.

I was looking up at the stars and I sometimes do.  I noticed an airplane descending towards Buffalo, NY.  The airplane was brightly flashing and clear, but still high up in the sky to where I could not make out the shape of the plane, but it was obviously a plane due to the speed, straight forward direction it was flying and colors flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was looking at this airplane I noticed another moving object farther to the right.  At first I thought it was a huge star because it was very twinkly.  I realized it was moving.  It appears to be significantly higher up then the airplane.  I can’t make out the shape but I would describe it as a fuzzy ball of light or sparkling star…that’s the best I can do, it is really high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped further away from the light on in the backyard to get a better view and still clearly see that the object is moving. It appears to hover in a one spot for a few seconds and then dart back and forth quickly, zigzag, move forward then backward and then quickly forward for 15 seconds and then zing zag again and dart around.  It does not resemble the movement of any airplane I’ve ever seen, does not look like a helicopter or any air craft that I’m familiar with.  I called somebody out of the house to take a look.  They watched with me for almost a full minute and thought it was military night training for some type of aircraft.  I continued watching for 15 minutes and brought the dog inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back out and found the object after looking for about 10-15 seconds.  It continues to hover for a few seconds and then dart around.  It reminds me of floating, and is just all together odd looking.  I have no idea what it is, but thought I should report it.  It’s really far up there and very easy to miss unless you’re staring at the sky which I was. I don’t have a telescope,  I don’t know where my camcorder is and my camera batters are dead, so I apologize.  I’m sure it’s still going now!  There is only one object.  I looked around that part of the sky and couldn’t find any more.  It’s a white color/light.  I have never seen a ufo before, reported one or anything like that.  I have zero experience with this.  Thanks.<n>

I had a pair of binoculars in my car so I quickly grabbed them.  We both observed it until it disappeared behind some clouds and we couldnt see it any longer. We went to his house and played video games and came outside to smoke a cigarette and we saw a glowing orange ball about 2 miles away from us.  We weren&#39;t very surprised to be honest.  We actually see this type of craft around his house all the time,  the only difference with this time is we saw 16 crafts.  They didn&#39;t all look alike though, and they were not all out at the same time.  One of the orange crafts appeared to eject a an object that had red flashing lights on it. I recognized this craft as one of the triangle type ufos that have three lights on the bottom of it.  It got close enough to us to where i could tell that it was not an airplane because there was no noise.  After that, one of the orange crafts got close enough for me to ! see the outline of the craft.  It was disk shaped, just like your standard UFO.  I was even able to make out what appeared to be an observation deck.  However i was not able to see any beings through it even with my binoculars.  There weren&#39;t more than three craft in the air at a time, so we could very well have seen the same craft more than once.  But we saw 16 ufos in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The trail was glowing and readily visible from within the clouds as well.  When it began transitioning in color from orange to red I went back to my house (at this point I was only a minute away from home) in order to retrieve my camera and take photographs of this event.  By the time I got my camera set up the trail had shifted in color from red to green and blue.  I snapped several pictures of the event then left for work.

I live in Omaha Nebraska.  I looked into the northwest sky and had noticed an orange and red light high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell how high in the sky it was.  It looked like it was the size of Venus when it was viewable in May 2012,  But it was too low in the sky to be Venus.  To gauge the distance I would have to say it was, at least from my perspective, least five miles northwest of my corner of 19th and Douglas st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at it it would pulse orange and red. Sometimes it would flash a bright white light.  It just hovered in the sky motionless.  After walking three blocks west on Douglas which took about 10 minutes in a casual walk, I had noticed a bright red light, a much smaller light, had flew from the south and flew in an arch over the orange and red light and I had lost track of it.  After that happened about 15 minutes later I saw two red lights flying side by side heading east.  I could hear a helicopter flying around behind me but I could not see it.  I saw the red lights that flew together as they passed over my head.  They did not blink or flash they were at a constant glow.  The red was like the color of crimson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the red orange light in the sky still motionless.  I watched it for about 15 more minutes and there was no movement, I could still hear helicopters, but they were not close to the object as I could tell.  I walked back to my apartment, which took about 10 minutes and went to the roof of my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are eleven floors on my building and I went to the roof, which opens at 5am.  I went to the roof to see if I could still see this light.  It was still there.  From higher up I could see that it was far too low in the sky to be celestial.  The sun was starting to come up and it was harder to see but it was still there.  I cant quite gauge the distance from me it was, but if I may submit a photo showing the building and where it was in the sky in relation to the building it would be easier for me to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly moved northwest and slowly disappeared from sight.

It appears to have taken off from a platform in the bright spot referred to as Kuiper Crater, though further observations conclude it is not just a crater. The brightest trail moving up, or north, and to the right seems to have been produced by the ship. Though, the bright spot is producing a great deal of clouds moving out in an array as if steam were being generated, possibly through geothermal sources. The craft could merely have funneled through it&#39;s movements. a cloudy path of steam as it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship has detail on the top of it&#39;s hull, showing a symmetric pattern near the outer circular shape.

They were silent and when the objects were north of us, we couldn&#39;t see the lights anymore, just a black orb.  It appeared they were flying at a fairly low altitude about the speed of a propeller plane.  There was a helicopter flying in the same direction, lower than the lights.   We also saw these lights Sunday night, May 20,2012.<n>
6/11/12 21:29|Yerevan (Armenia)|||6-7 minues|At least 2 objs, possibly emitting in UV range, by camera in night sky over Yerevan.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, we believe.  PD))|6/14/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89561.html|543|ndxe201206| At least two objects, possibly emitting light in UV range, are captured by camera in night sky over Yerevan, Armenia<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late in the evening of June 11 my son took photos of night Yerevan from a hill. When he then transferred the photos from camera to computer, he noticed that camera captured something in the sky that he did not notice when taking the photos. On two of the photographs this “thing” looks like a “falling star”. On other two photographs (taken after the first ones) the object seems to be closer, its shape is unclear, probably the object itself is not visible, but it has a bright blue “tale” of conic form, reminding exhaust flame of a missile&#34;  When I examined the full-size photos, I discovered that there is a second object in the upper middle part of the photos – its blue “tail” is visible. The orientation of the two are different. Then, near the first (bright) object, a small blue stripe may be distinguished (marked by an arrow on enlarged fragments of the photos), indicating that probably there is a third object farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures have been taken with 1-2 minutes intervals between them. The exact times are: 21:29, 21:30, 21:31, 21:33, 21:34, 21:34, 21:35, 21:37, Yerevan time (UTC/GMT +4 hours). The photos are taken with long exposition time (10 s for the first two shots and 5 s for the rest), without a tripod (that is why some of them are quite blurred). The camera is Panasonic Lumix DMC-Z50. I have made some processing of the enlarged fragment with the second (farther) object (Curve adjustment in Photoshop) to make the object more distinguishable. However, if you look at the screen in a dark room, the object is visible without any adjustment on a full-size photo (this is how I discovered it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can see some yellow-white bright spots that are above the city, but these are of no interest - there is a high mountain behind the city (mount Ararat), and these are the lights of settlements on the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing which is very important, is that when my son was staking the photos of the city, he did not notice the objects. He noticed the objects only when he was looking at the photos afterwards. Either he was too busy with making the photographs of buildings, or... the objects were hardly visible for a human eye! (not so bright to catch the attention). The second assumption is supported also by the fact that there were many people at the spot, who also did not notice the objects. Initially this seemed very strange to me, but then I made some search and found, that modern digital cameras are sensitive to UV light, and they catch it as blue (this is the case also with Lumix DMC-Z50 - that is why it is recommended to use a UV-filter when shooting outdoors in sunny weather, otherwise the images will have blue haze). So, from all these I assume, that the blue &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot; of the objects we see on the photos were indeed in UV range, and were invisible, or almost invisibl! e, for humans. It is the camera properties, perhaps, together with long exposition time and high intensity of UV radiation from the objects, that made it possible to see the blue &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot; on the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on I found another UFO report that supports this assumption: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88222.html (a blue moving spot appeared on the photos of the sky but was not visible to photographer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, since the objects were not observed &amp;quot;in real time&amp;quot;, we, unfortunately, cannot say anything about their trajectory, when and where from exactly they appeared (though this can be guessed from the first photos, where the object is smaller and(?) farther), and when and, most importantly, how they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there would be only one object, then I would probably be sure that this is a kind of rocket or missile or jet plane, but, in my opinion, the fact that there are more than one objects (with different orientations) makes this unlikely.  For the same reason (the presence of the second object), it is, in my opinion, unlikely that this is a kind &amp;quot;light reflection&amp;quot; (from what and how?), as many people told me.  Next, the presence of air wave (I am not sure that &amp;quot;air wave&amp;quot; is the correct term though) in front of the object (if we assume that the blue part is the &amp;quot;tail&amp;quot;), which is visible probably because of heating (or ionization?) of the air, suggests that the object moves in the atmosphere with high speed.  But, from the other hand, we see it almost in the same position in the sky on the two photos taken approximately at one minute interval.  This can be, in my opinion, if the object is very far from the observer.  And hence, it (they) should be huge i! n size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, we believe.  PD))<n>

First I thought it was an airplane, however, during the time I observed there was no red signalling light (which planes usually have).  The object was a star like dot, moving from the northern to southern part of the sky above Sarajevo.  Its trajectory was not falling, so I assume it could not be a meteor.  The most interesting detail was that object was moving not in a straight line, but it had modified straight line trajectory with zig-zag movement all the way. after five to ten minutes of observation, the object dissapeared (either because of partial clouds ove southern part of sky which minimize visibility, or because of other reason).  Anyway, I don&#39;t believe it is natural object, or a plane, mostly because of its trajectory.<n>

The 2 lights hover like helicopters but have weird flight patterns.  We have seen them go from 2 into 1 then back into 2.  There lights will get very bright and then go dim and then to nothing, then back to bright.  They move all different ways. But pretty much stay in one area. They are lower than the starts, more on the horizon, and you have to be in an open area to see them.  One night one of the lights went away, and it looked like a plane was coming over to the other light that was still there.  When it approached the light it did 4 90 degree turns (in a square) and then started to hover with the other light.  They are very strange, and they are out almost every night.<n>

It was low in the sky like a plane that was going to land in a mile or less,and seem to be traveling about the same speed as a plane.

Thinking they were just stars, we somewhat ignored them.  Looking back a moment later, we noticed they had moved.  We called my boyfriend out to watch with us.  At this time, we all discussed what we thought they might be. (Both my roommate and boyfriend are or have been in the military recently).  We ruled out the possibility of helicopters due to how perfectly still they sat, and for how long.  The colors of them should not have been visible at night from the distance we were at as well.  Watching for a few more minutes, we noticed a third object of the same size and color moving down to the other two.  They appeared to be flashing different colors at the same time, but were mainly the redish orange.  One object appeared to have been spraying a liquid (looked like water, but sparkled.  Roommate describes it as &#34;plasma&#34;).  Then, the objects came to form a perfect triangle.  We unfortunately went inside for a brief few minutes. Upon returning outside, the objects were gone and have not returned since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date shown is approximate.  PD))<n>

This gives you an idea of how bright and close this was as I was only a mile at the most from the hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked again, I noticed that it was glowing orange and yellow kind of like a large fire ball, I was actually amazed when I saw this as an option, as this is how I&#39;ve been describing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again and noticed that there were now 3 in a triangle formation, seemingly hovering.  I grabbed my phone and my friend did the same, as we looked up again, they&#39;re were now 8, 9,10 a growing number, reaching somewhere between 10 and 20 and no longer seemed to be in formation, but spreading out as they headed west and went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if this could have been a meteor shower? i don&#39;t know what else could explain this??<n>

When we crossed to Route 8 we saw some odd bright orange lights in the sky.  Almost directly over head.  After the first 5 or so that we noticed we decided to pull over so we did not get into an accident.  We stopped on Perkins street to get out and watch the &amp;quot;show&amp;quot;.  the came in groups of 5-10.  all going the same direction at the same speed.   We were under them at this point.  We would think it was over but then another wave would go over head. My husband and I thought maybe wedding balloons luminaries but no lights were flickering and they were not floating.  these lights were steady moving pretty fast...  not meandering like a balloon in the wind---there was not any wind that night.  We could see other people &amp;quot;rubbernecking&amp;quot;, 1 other guy stopped and we all watcehd together.  it was really amazing and scary at the same time.<n>

One was directly behind the other over the neighbors garage at about 1 o&#39;clock.  I heard no noise or motor like a plane, jet, or helicopter.  I yelled to my husband to look and he ran closer and attempted to take a picture with his cell phone.  The 2 red lights were followed by another red light as it flew and came into view over the garage followed by a white light.  It appeared as though they were flying one behind the other in equal distance.  One by one they disappeared from my view because of the street tree line and I did not see where they went from there.<n>

It was a ball of fire under a big bright ball and they descended and then went back up into space disappearing one by one.  We only had our phones and were only able to take a picture of the last fireball that was leaving.  We were all in shock and even though I had had a couple of drinks, everyone else was 100% sober.

There were a lot of other cars waiting at the traffic light, and this sight was not something subtle or difficult to see.  It was very clear and visible, so I’m thinking there are other people who witnessed this event.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.

I thought it&#39;s too far to be able to see the flashing but when they got closer almost half a mile a way from where we were siting i realized that the lights still were not flashing and the objects were flying very slow from the distance to be a plane.  I then realized it was not a plane and then thought it could be a foreign object so I took a picture and then one by one the lights disappeared.<n>

I was so excited and decided to take photos of the sky.  I have taken 5 photos and in two I found a strange blue/green circle type of shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be the moon, but if you look at the second pic, you will see that it moved from the right hand side of the sun to the left.   I took all 5 photos within 5 seconds so it was moving really quick. Could it possible be a satellite?  I am very curious and this is why I decided to report it.  Hopefully you have an answer.<n>

It was moving from south to north and then dimmed down to a small redish light and then disappeared all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked into our yard and to the west just above our house was the same bluish orb again.  It was slowly moving to the east now and seemed to jump back and forth zig zaging as it moved.  We watched this for about 30 min until it went behind some trees and we were unable to see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also when it was about midway across the sky we heard a neighbor yell look at that.  Not sure where the neighbor was but it was extreamly quit that night and you could hear a pin drop so not sure if they were close to us or not but it sounded like they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time my wife looked up into the sky and said look at them all.  Just above us south of the blusish orb were what looked like thousands of stars moving in all different dire! ctions.  They seemed to be following this cloud formation that was moving north.  What was odd was there was no wind that night and you could not hear anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said if it was a plane we would hear it and also planes flash.  Just as quickly as those lights apeared they all seemed to disapear.  I made the comment I think there moving with the clouds.

I exited my vehicle and watched as it crossed the sky when suddenly two more lights just like it entered my plane of view.  They were moving at similar speeds and in the same direction.  These lights were followed by more; a set of three, one more behind it.  If these were crafts, this was a fleet.

From my view point it looked to be no more than 200ft from the ground and stayed at that position for about a minute and a half.  The lite was flickering... kinda what you would see from a candle but was much more intense, and the colors were a bright orange,red and a bluish green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My lady and I often look at the nite sky and from where we live at out in the middle of a corn field we can really enjoy the open skies without anything nearby restricting our view.  So after about a minute of watching this I call to her to come outside and take a look.  It had seemed odd that it wasn&#39;t changing position at all, that and how very intensely bright they were.  It is not often that there is not a b! reeze in this area... the wind is a constant.  My first thoughts were that of one of those oriental sky lanterns but like I said the lights were much to bright to be a flame from one of those and if it were that or of a balloon I believe it would have a steady climb rather than just staying in a fixed position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after my lady came out to observe this with me the object began to rise, I&#39;d say close to 400 to 500ft the lights quit.  It wasn&#39;t a dwindle or a slow fade, they ended immediately.  I say they and lights but all 3 colors were coming from one fixed spot.  I live very close to the Marion municipal airport and get to see planes coming in and out every day but there really isn&#39;t very much traffic at nite. The Marion hospital has a green and white chopper that is often seen coming from the far north east traveling towards a slight west by south west towards Kokomo and its engines are quite recognizable.  What I was seeing could not be heard from my location.  If it were! a plane coming in or out I believe it was insanely low and it! seemed to be only 3 to 4 miles north of us... if it were a plane at that distance we would be able to see the wing and tail strobes.  The lights didn&#39;t blink or strobe, they were a constant, but had shifted from one color to the next in no pattern that could be identified.  As far as I know, flares fired from the ground rise and fall.  Flares from a aircraft fall. Never seen a flare stay in one spot for over a minute and then rise.  Very odd indeed... odd enough that here I am writing this!<n>

I had been outside looking at the stars.  The sky was dark, clear of clouds, and the moon hadn’t risen yet.  I came back into the house and sat in the recliner to watch television.  I am looking at the TV right next to the full sliding screen door to the open porch directly in front of me.  The view of the sky from where I am setting is jet black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a red circle appeared. It was large not small like a star.  I’ve never seen anything like this in the sky.  The color was like a dark red ripe strawberry.  As I ran out onto the porch it changed right in front  of my eye’s.  There was a orange red deep crescent thicker in the middle and tapering at each upward point .  There were two perfect circles watermelon colored  above each point of the crescent. It was moving in a vertical position horizontally  across the sky.  The size of the circles were like the size of a pencil eraser compared to a star ,and the depth of the crescent was at least  three times as long as the circle’s size.  Next there appears  a  frame of light yellow gold in the shape  of an elliptical with the circles midway of the yellow gold frame there appears to be cup like indentations on right and left top, outlined by the yellow gold frame.  The frame appears to be equal in height above the circles as the orange red crescent is below.  The size is now ! much larger now. There is nothing visible in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is slowly moving behind the treetops , the tree is approximately 40-50 feet tall.  I can see light   Through the trees.  The glimpses I can see it seems to have changed position .  I can see it more horizontal to the ground with white in the center.  At this point it definitely looks like a craft.  It’s gone behind a taller tree and all I can see is light coming through the tree for a couple of seconds. Then I see it again this time clearer.  I see two  bright  white large rounded cylinder shaped protrusions in the center  with a deep red circle on either side.  It is tilting toward me as it passes from behind the tree. It seems extremely close like two hundred feet or less, and its large.  Now it suddenly turned and I see four white rounded cylinder shapes sticking up from one side giving it a somewhat shape of a crown or tiara.   At this point I realize that this object is not  making a sound !!!   I turned and ran as fast as I could into the house to get a camera and ran out the back door to the front yard , but by the time I got out there it was gone.  I so much wish I would have just stayed there watching .  At least I saw what I saw  and it was the most spectacular thing I’ve ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place 30 seconds or less , with the object only being clearly visible  for 5-10 seconds.  The object first appeared in the southern sky moving in a northeastern direction.  It was visible to me in the area of the old Beloit Hospital off Olympian Blvd. Beloit, Wisconsin. 10:45 pm Friday June 8-2012TT<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and eloquent in her description of the object.

I overheard him say what&#39;s that?  I didn think anything of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He hung up and I heard him come through the door.  He was in a rush and yelled for me to come outside.  We live in the country so our vision of the night sky is phenomenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceed to run out doors on our front step. I saw what he was pointing at immidiantly.  It was a red ball which at first I said oh that&#39;s mars.  Then as I watched the object glide across the sky I realized that was a UFO.  It turned from red to orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my parents and when I came out it  disappeared.  My husband said that when he watched it fade away it looked as if it was leaving out of our solar system.  We have not seen anything since.<n>

In the middle of an argument, she got my full attention by questioning the source of a light approaching our direction.  As it got closer it appeared to be in the shape of a green orb traveling on the ground with a small, bright light following maybe 5 feet above the green orb.  The shade of green was flourescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a strip of land behind the fence of my backyard which runs parallel to my house, which is where the subject was moving.  The situation was very strange because the object was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s even more strange is the fact that my dog was sitting next to the fence facing me and my girlfriend (and my house) and did not sense whatever was behind it and considering the time of night there are no other loud noises outside to counteract against the movement of the object behind my dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly behind my dog was a big bush (the bush is behind the fence) and a clear spot right after the bush until th! eres another bush, however the point is that there is a perfectly clear spot where I can see the object is going to come out.  When the object finally reached that point I could see clearly that this wasn&#39;t an orb but a tall, linky body that was glowing green from head to toe.  The object was so bright, from when we initially saw it, that it could only be identified as a blob of light.  The subject then continued down the strip of land (following underneath the powerlines) until it reached the elementary school playground.  Obviously you can see the playground from my backyard, however here I saw an array of lights moving frantically in an oval movement and then the array of lights formed back into the original green flourescent light and it zipped off into a nearby trail at an astounding rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A period of approximately 5 minutes went by until we spotted the bright light that was initially trailing behind the orb above all the tall brush (about 13-15 feet high).  It was approaching our line of vision again just the opposite way this time, however this time it was making a strange vibrating sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it got about 30-40 yards from my girlfriend and I, we headed for the front of my house because this thing approaching us sounded unpleasant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly had seen enough and knew that it was nothing human and I did not want to stick around and possibly get hurt.<n>

It would move slightly to the right and then slightly to the left like it was trying to avoid cloud cover.  It hovered in the same spot for about ten minutes and then just slowly went east up into the clouds.  We went to the boardwalk again the next night around the same time and there it was again in the same exact spot doing the same exact thing! Everyone walking on the beach that night since it was the weekend and there were a lot of people would just stop and stare at it. Some even took pictures. You can tell it definately wasn&#39;t a plane because of its sizeand color and planes were flying by it!<n>

We observed and noted the Big Dipper constellation. I then noticed a bluish light a bit larger in size than the stars making up the Big Dipper. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and confirmed she did as well. We both observed this light move from East to West over Sacramento. It blinked on and off about every 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible clouds at all. This ruled out the blinking of the object to be from passing behind clouds. We heard no sounds at all overhead. The object moved from just under the handle of the Big Dipper to above the star Arcturus in about 20 seconds. We were able to figure out that it was Arcturus using the Google Sky Map app on my girlfriends phone. It then continued across the sky another 10 seconds and then changed direction in a right angle turn that appeared to head downwards as if coming to an abrupt stop and then descending. The object appeared to descend for about 5 seconds and then disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time durations are based on the blinking interval that seemed to again be every 5 seconds. The object was nearly invisible to the naked eye and would only be seen every 5 seconds when it emitted a bright blink or flash that was bluish in color. It was like tracking a firefly flying across your backyard. I noted the time of the event after first seeing the object by checking my watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a full 11 minutes before the ISS was supposed to transit the sky at 3:46am for that Lat and Long as confirmed by spaceweather.com. I do not believe it was the space station. There were no meteor showers anticipated for the evening either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen &amp;quot;shooting stars&amp;quot; and this did not match what I have seen during meteor showers. There were no other colored lights such as red to indicate this was a commercial or military aircraft. I may be tempted to believe this was a satellite except for the sharp stop and direction changed we observed in addition to the bright flash it made every 5 seconds as it transited the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Having seen orange orbs in the past and knowing what to look for, I knew it might be something out of the ordinary, so I stopped to observe the object before entering my house.  I watched for about 30 seconds, noticing that it was absolutely motionless.  Then after this duration, it began to move slowly from left to right, right to left, then left to right again, much like a leaf or feather would fall toward the ground.  The object then continued on a perfectly straight line due south beyond the horizon and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted an ad in the open forum at Craigslist in an attempt to get others who might have seen the object around that same time, but no one has yet stepped forward, other than to ridicule. If others in State College and surrounding areas have seen the object on the night in question, I&#39;d like to be put in contact with them to discuss the sighting. I prefer to be contacted by e-mail.<n>

I could see a large bright solid white light up in the sky north of me.  It was no problem seeing this orb, but I couldn’t see anything else (stars) through the window.  I stood still to see if it was moving or not, and sure enough it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out my sliding back door right next to my kitchen, and watched it.  I could now notice some stars, but there were some clouds out as well.  I kept my eye on this orb, as it seemed to move from north to south.  Then all of the sudden, it slowly faded away in about 4-5 seconds. I watched this orb for about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the skies after that to see if it would come back.  I noticed a fairly close group of stars in the northern sky, when one of the “stars” that had been motionless for the past couple of minutes, started moving northeast and then faded away in about 4-5 seconds just like the last object I witnessed.  This took about 15 seconds from the time it started moving until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these orbs in the sky for the past couple years now, and that is why I continue looking at the sky at night.<n>

There was no noise or wind, it just passed over us.  It passed through some clouds and re-emerged as it passed over head.  I got up and ran to the side of my home and watched as disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no lights, no sound, was a dull grey color and shaped like a huge boomerang; if I had guess as to the objects size-maybe as long as an aircraft carrier.  I watch the international space station fly over all the time; this was much closer to the Earth and moved at least five times faster.  It was not bright like the space station.  I saw it from the ground looking up, so I have no idea how tall it was, but it was wider than my house-much wider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not expect anyone to believe me, because other than seeing lights moving through the night sky like the international space station.  I’ve never seen anything this big, or so low, so I’ve never believed any of the reports of flying saucers.  I am wondering though, if anyone else saw what I saw on 6/7/12 at around 11 pm EST. in Michigan heading in a northerly direction?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your time.<n>

6/7/12 22:28|Phoenix|AZ|Triangle|5 minutes|Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix|6/8/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89447.html|634|ndxe201206| Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object consisted of three large orange lights, formed in a rather straight line (although the center light seemed to be slightly lower the other two, but only by a hair). Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large; much much larger than any aircraft I’ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea’s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west; three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn’t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange; 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm’s length); 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I’ve ever seen before; and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I’d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped a photo, but it is extremely blurry.<n>

The other observer, my fiancé, doesn’t study aviation, but has learned quite a bit during my long evening lectures on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were returning home from getting takeout and commenting on the stars as we typically do.  We have not had good weather for stargazing in the last several weeks and we just had some cumulus clouds blotting the sky making the stars look crystal clear in most of the sky.  There were light winds coming from the South-Southeast and the humidity was around 70%.  The temperature was also around 60°F.  As we were pulling in to my yard (serves as a driveway) facing due south, we both instantly saw an extremely bright light due south.  From our vantage point, the light was about 70° - 80° off the horizon.  Again, this light was extremely bright.  It instantly grabbed your attention and stood out from the stars very well.  We both exited the car and started studying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately started to look for signs of an aircraft.  There was no strobe, beacon, or position lights.  Just one solid bright white light.  There was no size, shape, or definition to the light. Although at times, the light seemed to move back n’ forth getting dimmer than brighter, like some type of oscillation movement from side to side.  Because I could not see any other details than this light, it’s intensity is the only identifier of altitude I had to work with.  Based on the intensity I assume the lights altitude to be approximately 800’ - 1,200’ AGL.  It just seemed to be extremely low, like very low.  At the time I had not thought about it because of the fear that started to set in, but there was absolutely no sound.  I have had many aircraft fly over my house and helicopters.  Anytime there is an aircraft at that approximate altitude flying over my house, my entire house will rumble.  There was no sound emitting from this craft/light, period.  It was completely silen! t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the light was slow if my altitude approximation is correct.  At most I could be off maybe + 1000’ AGL, and if that were the case, the light was still travelling at an extremely slow speed and altitude.  I would equate it’s speed similar to an rotorcraft in a very slow cruise configuration.  If it was an aircraft, then that is the only thing it could have been traveling at that slow of a speed (or a ballon).  It was travelling North by Northeast from our perspective at this slow rate of speed.  It was unusual though, because it was travelling not in a straight line, but as my fiancé describes it, “like it was going down steps.”  I reviewed the logs from other sightings and one on the west coast struck my attention when the author said that is was travelling like, “a falling leaf.”  I could use the falling leaf as a better description.  It seemed like it was “looking for something” or even “scanning an area.”  None of the movements were rapid, but rather, extremel! y docile and lethargic.  While viewing it I noticed several flashes of very bright light coming from directly behind me out of the Southwest.  They could be described to be like lightning, but there were no observed cumulonimbus clouds around that and no reports of lightning when I came inside and reviewed the current weather data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire sighting lasted for about 2.5 - 3 minutes at most and it really scared me.  My hairs were up and I felt defensive for both my fiancé and myself.  I have spent my life looking up and have never seen anything like it before.  I can rule out satellites as the light was entirely too bright and low and I obtained satellite information immediately after the sighting, and none were in that area.  I was trying to have a scientific approach for this and rule out as many possibilities as I could.  I have never seen any balloons fly over my house the entire time I have lived here (13-14 years).  It could not have been any conventional aircraft due to the lack of sounds, and there are only a small number of RC enthusiasts in the rural country area where I live and I am one of them (mostly old fashioned control line models in my area).  To the best of my knowledge, none of these people have the capabilities to do this type of flying in the middle of the night with an RC aircr! aft.  The sighting ended due to cloud cover in the Northeast, which  the light disappeared behind.  Realistically, the light probably travelled about 1-2 NM in the timeframe I viewed it, and was heading towards the largest city in my area, Uniontown.  My fiancé did say, “before it went behind the clouds, it seemed like there were a total of three lights that made up the entire light.”  I did not see this myself, but I may have ruined by night vision as I looked at my iPad screen to try and get pictures before we lost sight.  We had the iPad in the car, but I did not get it to take pictures because I was too scared to move.  I had an overwhelming sensation of fear as soon as I realized it wasn’t a plane or anything I had seen before.  If I would have used the iPad to take pictures, they would have yielded almost zero data or information, other than a grainy image of something that looked like a light. This is also the third weird light sighting in 3 weeks.  The other two wer! e not nearly as bright or low, but rather the opposite.  They ! were all outrageously high in the sky and moving at insane speeds.  This third sighting was definitive and scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also one other weird thing worth mentioning.  During the flight path of the light, it crossed the visual path I had with a star.  When it went in front of the star, it didn’t block out the star, but rather, it “wrapped” the view of the star around it.  It was almost transparent, but seemed to move the star until it was past it, then the star moved back.  A bending like effect which was rather startling.<n>

As she walked over to my side of the van &amp; eyed the object I was pointing at, it started to move straight up into the sky.  Then once it looked allot closer to the stars in the sky, (there were allot of stars out that night,the sky was very clear, &amp; their was a very very light breeze coming out of the west) it took off at a great speed in a Easterly direction.  Then it slowed down, started to zig-zag from right to left while continuing in a Easterly direction until it faded out of sight.

We pulled off the road as we immediately noticed a fireball in the area of Teton Village, WY moving straight up into the sky at a fair rate of speed.  At first, we thought it was something moving up the mountain but, realized it had traveled past the mountain, high into the night sky.  It was not a completely dark night at the time.  The fireball made a 90 degree turn and headed east.  Suddenly, the light went out and we watched the object free fall.  The object was much bigger than an airplane and it was falling freely, sort of wobbling about.  It seemed to be between Teton Village and the town of Jackson.  There were a few clouds in the sky and we watched it pass a couple of clouds until it got to a very dark cloud and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed on our way home, north on Highway 89.  Suddenly, a fireball was coming towards us! It was large and not very high in the sky.  In fact, it was not higher than the mountain we were driving next to.  There were several other vehicles on the road that had to be witnessing what we were.  As it passed over us, I could clearly see a fireball with a short trail of the fire behind it, lighting up the rear end of the object it was coming from.  The object was round; saucer shaped.  My daughter, being the passenger in the car and able to look longer than I; she saw several pink lights surrounding the fireball.  Ten to twenty pink lights surrounded the fireball object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled off the highway and phoned my parents as we continued to watch.  We had only gotten about 1 mile from my their home.   By the time the fireball had gotten in the vicinity of their home the fireball was high in the sky and again, the fireball went out.  We could not follow it any longer.<n>

We were heading west and we spotted an unusual object in the sky as it came in over the water just south of BDR (Sikorsky Airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading from the southwest to the northeast.  It looked like it came over Milford starting at the the Point Lookout area on Long Island Sound and was not travelling at any great speed.  It seemed to maintain level flight as it transited the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband pulled the car over on New Haven Avenue near the intersection of Buckingham Ave. and we both got out to watch the object as it cruised directly above us and we were joined by another passerby who saw the object and pulled over, but we did not get his name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object glowed orange and yellow, was round in shape and the light it cast was not a type of light I&#39;ve ever seen before; it was not bright like a landing light, but subdued and sort of pulsed yellow and orange.  There was no sound coming from it and there was no tail like you would see with a meteor or shooting star. It was pretty low too, when it finally disappeared into the clouds, they were scattered but looked between 2,000 and 3,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to estimate size, especially at night, but I can only compare it to that of a full moon compared to the stars, but I am sure that was because it was not at any great altitude.  The siting lasted about 5 minutes until the object disappeared into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a Cessna Dealer back in the 1980’s and worked at Sikorsky Airport where my husband was an air traffic controller.

Conditions were clear and cloudless, sky still midnite blue, not yet black, and not yet full of stars.  We paused in our labors to admire the high jet contrails in the eastern sky, which still glowed a bit, catching the last of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing East, the object appeared from the South, first one, then two, and finally three tiny but intensely bright red lights, so bright and pure red, they made me think of a laser&#39;s intensity.  These were NOT beams, but strobing point sources of a light wavelength so narrow it made me think of a red Helium- Neon or diode laser.  These were unlike any civilian or military running lights either of us had ever seen; nothing to indicate port, starboard, or leading edge.  They were arranged in a rough equilateral triangle, one corner either canted toward or away from us.  As we quickly ran through the possibilities, we told each other to remember as much detail as possible; this was something unique!  As the object soundlessly moved in a straight line from south to north, we each noted its appearance as it drifted over the contrails.  My wife&#39;s impression was of a vague solid triangular object with red strobes at each corner floating ABOVE the contrails, which would make it enormous.  My own impression was of a skeletal triangular structure with the same red lights at each corner, passing in front of them contrails, which would still render the object rather gigantic.  There was a rather large gap between each light, notable because all planes must maintain high altitude over the Sierras, and thus their running lights appear close together.<n>

We don&#39;t know exactly when they were gone because we had to go to formation and they were not able to be seen from where we form up at.

I had observed the object as I entered the south side of Pidcoke a few minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I thought it was just an airplane.  All I could see was a white light to the left side of the highway.  I noticed the object move to the right side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I barely passed the north side of Pidcoke, I saw the object much more clearly.  It moved back to the left side of the highway in a zig-zag motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I realized this was not an airplane.  It was a triangle-shaped craft with three very bright white lights underneath the craft.  The lights were so bright, that I could clearly make out the triangle shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was either moving very slow or virtually stationary in the air.  It was flying at a relatively low elevation.  The craft also had some sort of beam or scanning l! ight in the front of it that was moving back and forth in a horizontal motion at about a 45 degree angle from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed the craft, I looked back and it disappeared.  Pidcoke is a small town in between Copperas Cove and Gatesville.<n>

It had a bright, neon blue circle on the rear with a bright white light in the middle.  Along the side of the craft, it was glowing white.  The craft appeared oval to me but I saw it only for two seconds as it hovered, turned, then took off at a speed in which I cannot describe.  It was there, then a bright streak, and it was gone.  I am reporting this just 20 mins from the time it happened.  I actually called Channel 5 Eyewitness News in the Twin Cities area to see if anyone had seen what I did, but they had not.  I know aircraft and I understand propulsion, this was nothing that human beings are capable of doing, not hovering and taking off at this speed.  What I just saw was a UFO and Nobody, Nobody will convince me otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was out watching the sky with my binoculars.  I was looking at Mars in the western sky. I turned to the North to try and spot something I saw earlier.  In the NW sky I saw a bright white light, and seemed to be round like a star.  I thought it was a star until it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching with my binoculars, it traveled straight East. It moved slowly at first, then began to pick up speed, then slowed down.  It seemed to stop briefly, then continued on slowly.  It did this several times. Finally it moved slowly towards the horizon, disappearing from my view behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than the strange behavior mentioned above, I think it was a UFO since it made no noise.

The first object seen was moving in a direct path towards the north at a constant speed. The object seemed to be moving in a wandering manner and moving somewhat fast but it did not seem to be in a hurry; it almost looked like if it was surveying the sky.  The object was illusive, as it appeared to be a dot of light, almost as a planet would look like except that this light moved and it seemed way to large to be the light of an airplane or a planet.  The shape looked like an elongated sphere with three very faint and small lights on top lining up as if it was the tail of the aircraft or an antenna of some sort. There was no real sense of how fast it was really going and how far above from the ground it was traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also two or maybe three other lights that stood out from the rest of the stars. They were too large to be stars and maybe even to large to be planets. These lights were stationary and also had a reddish tone. My mother (The other witness) thought they seemed to also be elongated spheres of white light but with two faint and small spheres or dots of red light under the main and larger light sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it seemed as if a faint and radiating light emerged from the objects; to me, it looked like some kind of magnetic field or some kind of shield.<n>

Also it was too slow to be a plane.<n>

I can&#39;t remember what time it was, but I know the date was after December 2011, as that&#39;s when I got the camcorder used.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a line of horizontal lights close together just above the horizon.  I thought it was aircraft at first. But then a second line of lights rose just above the first line, moved slightly to the left, tilted slightly down to the left, and started shaking up and down.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, but it was gone by the time I got outside.  I dismissed it as an optical illusion and forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 5, 2012, just after 11 pm, I was standing on my front porch looking east when I noticed the same thing again.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, and that&#39;s when I remembered that I had seen this same thing before.  When I got outside and started filming, I was able to capture it, though it had apparently turned into a flashing orb hovering in the same location.  It never appeared to move and eventually just faded away.  The whole event lasted maybe 2 minutes.  It all happened in the same spot in the sky.  It was hovering 1/2 mile south of Ray Road and somewhere east of Alma School Road, though it&#39;s hard to tell how far away it was.  It was a clear night, the moon was bright and just past full, and was located about 15 degrees to the south and about 5 degrees above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I had seen this twice, and in the same part of the sky, I set my camcorder on a tripod, turned it on, and placed it on the porch around 11pm.  On June 15, 2012, I captured the object again, and this time from the start.  However, it only appears as the orb and does not first exhibit the line of lights as I had seen before.  Near the end of this second video, some lines are noticeable going into the object from the left and right side near the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has to be something explainable simply because it keeps appearing at the same time and in the same location.   Nobody else appears to be reporting it, and if I didn&#39;t have videos of it, I wouldn&#39;t be either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the sighting, indicated above, is approximate.

Some would pulsate once per 3 seconds and others would seem to stay bright, making them all seem to have their own brightness at any given time.  This could be due to cloud obscuration, but the sky was clear, for the most part, in the direction I was looking.  The lights appeared to gain in elevation, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights began &amp;quot;winking out&amp;quot; a few at a time, and before I was able to get my video camera going, there were only three left, and they quickly disappeared.

I checked several stations in the general area and they all reported minimal wind (between 0 and 4 mph), all in an easterly direction, during that time period.  Most of the graphs looked like the image I&#39;ve attached, named &#34;winds_06_05_2012.jpg&#34;.  The jet stream image I&#39;ve attached also indicates this easterly direction.  I&#39;ve attached the closest data point to the hour in which I reported the sighting (adjusted for UTC timezone).  However, the data for the hours before and after showed pretty much the same thing: the wind was minimal (between 0 and 60 knots), going in the same easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the video, you can tell there was not much wind where I was standing.  I am pretty sure the direction in which my camera was pointing was almost due south (I will validate this with a compass, as soon as I find one).  From the video, using the tree top as a static reference, you can see the lights moving to my right.  This would indicate the lights were moving, at least to some degree, to the west (against the direction of the wind).  I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was the most profound bright red-orange.  The shapes were oblong circles.  I would describe them as “Rings of Fire.”  Other witnesses to this event were my wife and two strangers in the street out in front of the house.<n>

MUST SEE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out to my back yard around 9 PM on June 5th, 2011.  As I stepped out, I noticed these strange lights in the sky.  I watched them for about 1 minute when i realized that they were moving (South) and were moving in groups.  First I noticed two, but as they moved along, more began to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my family to go outside with me to see it, and I was able to get one really good picture.  It was strange because the lights would sometimes stop, and appeared like massive stars but then continued to move.  We knew they weren&#39;t airplanes because they weren&#39;t flashing the normal red or blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they began to move further South, it seems as if they were disappearing into the sky and becoming stars.  You could still see them twinkle, but in groups they began to go further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one can explain what it is that we saw, and luckily I found this site.  I see that a lot of the sightings people have seen recently are a lot similar to what we have seen.  So i&#39;m hoping that some one finds some kind of answer as to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still amazed of what we saw and will never forget this moment! check out the pictures that I got.<n>

I live and work full time with my mother at her hotel.  I&#39;m a college student who spends her spare time with friends, my dog, or my amazing mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend was over the other night.  We were watching t.v. and had decided to go out on my porch to smoke a cigarette.  We sat on the step, I lit my cigarette, and looked upwards.  I saw what looked to be either a very bright white star or a planet.  The center was very bright and there was also a kind of halo of light surrounding it in the shape of a circle.  After watching for maybe one second I realized that it was moving towards my left (north).  My boyfriend had his eyes on the light as well.   He didn&#39;t have his glasses on so he couldn&#39;t see it as well as I could but he COULD tell that it was moving.  I thought it may have been a plane as I continued to watch it since I live relatively close to the Richmond Airport as well as the Hanover County Airport, but tried and failed to find the usual flashing red and blue lights or at least hear the engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the object stopped moving and the circular halo of light around the object seemed to become squished into more of an oval.  It quickly decreased in sized and seemed to be moving up and diagonally away from where I sat at maybe a 130 degree angle to make a rough estimation.  It went from a substantial and easily visible orb of light to the size of a pinhole in an unreasonably rapid rate and disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, my boyfriend did not have his glasses on at the moment but he could tell that the light that he&#39;d just seen had quickly disappeared.  From my awestruck reaction he could tell that I was somewhat uneasy but all in all, I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Came from the west flying east in a steady silent way, running parallel to Ventura blvd.  It had 4-8 red lights sporadically flashing in a vertical pattern, i couldn&#39;t tell if they were on the bottom or the side.  It was SILENT.  i tried to keep up with it on Moorpark but it was too fast and continued until it disappeared from my view.  It was VERY strange and exciting.  I couldn&#39;t really make out the shape of it other than it was so dark it blended in with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved hoizonal making no noise; we estimated it to be around 10 miles up, looked rectanglular in shape with both ends having a round hatch like opening, it was like you could see right through the  object, translucent, and it was 3 dimensional, you could see it had a front and bottom and 4 sides.  The front of it looked like fire shooting out of it; and running down the sides of it.  The entire object was glowing a yellow/reddish hue, very bright.  At first we thought it was an air balloon on fire but it kept a straight course, slowed down and seemed to then speed up and take off to the west.   Almost as if it was looking at us, there were four of us outside; one seeing it first and pointing it out to the others.<n>

It was in the south-west, and proceeded north east, over the ocean.  It was red, almost like an infrared light.  It moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was viewed by over a hundred eye witnesses on Point Pleasant Beach.  Attempts at photographing this anomaly were fruitless,  Several people around my family and myself attempted to photograph this object, while waiting for the fireworks, and could not capture it on cameras, i pods, i phones, etc....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background we observed was that over the Atlantic Ocean, via Point Pleasant Beach.  When we checked our gadgets to see if they were functioning properly, they photographed very well.  The only object we could not photograph was the infrared oval floating at a very slow speed, approximately 10-15 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved further out over the ocean, then disappeared.  It remained in our view for approximately five to ten minutes.  This o! bject surely had an effect on our electrical devises, as they would not work when pointed at this object.<n>

I cleaned the bathroom floor, then made a bowl of cereal.  I returned to our bedroom and placed the bowl of Corn Pops on my nightstand, then was compelled to go to the balcony.  I opened the balcony door and immediately went towards the south of it.  I saw a glowing orange ball.  It then turned white.  It came closer and closer.  It was in the shape of a ball.  I then turned to go back into the apartment to wake my husband and was hit by a bluish-white beam.  I then saw it hovering closely as it pulled away, slowly.  I ran to the bedroom to wake my husband who sleeps lightly all the time.  It took me five minutes approx.  to wake him.  I looked at the clock which read 02:38 am.  He finally woke up and came with me to the balcony to see what was no longer there. As we returned to our bedroom, my Corn Pops had turned to mush.  I checked on our child who was sleeping soundly,! then went to bed and tried to sleep.<n>

I glanced out my driver’s window and saw 5 very bright yellow-orange lights in the sky.  At first I believed them to be a very close aircraft but then the fourth light flew very fast under the third light. I was trying to drive and look at them which made the difficult for me to watch.  I then looked south in the sky and saw 4 other lights traveling south at average speed.  To my surprise, I looked back at the original 5 and they all but disappeared heading toward the moon.  They were just a very distant light. I hurried down my street and into the driveway and watched the last two head towards the moon and just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw but the lights we saw were too big and appeared far to bright to be aircraft. The color on them was odd as well.  At the rate they disappeared was far too fast to be any aircraft I am aware of.  The windows were down and I heard no odd noise, only traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t believe these lights were of this earth.<n>

There had to be more than 10 in the sky around the same area that night, which doesn&#39;t seem very safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I was crossing the bay farm bridge that I saw a triangular shaped aircraft swaying downward left and right like a leaf that I thought...something is seriously not right. I look around again and notice all the aircrafts I saw were either gone or my much much farther except for three above what I know as trash mountain (the gated off blonde grassy area on bay farm side near the bridge/bike path). They were far enough to only be perceived as lights but close enough to see them change colors from blue red purple orangish white.  They were all moving delicately and began to form a PERFECT triangle.  Then it began to move counterclockwise STILL keeping the perfect formation and STILL changing colors.  These color changes werent flashy or quick.  They were slow and almost faded into one another.  After the lights stopped turn they branched off one by one to form a perfect line with perfect spacing in between.  By that point I had to turn right and it was on the left ! side of the bridge so I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen small bright stars in the night sky that have the same color fading effect that i have not noticed before this year.  I usually see them in three as well, either creating an elongated line or decently distantanced triangle, but still very exact form from what I make of it.<n>

It was funny beacuse I was explaining the story of the bunny in the moon when we saw it coming and we freak out and everybody couldn&#39;t give an explanation of what it was.

One star or what i thought was a star started to move across the sky not in a straight line just casual roaming around the sky. I was sitting there staring at it when it got big and white then in an instant there was 5-6 BRIGHT BRIGHT huge white orbs just dancing across the night sky. I freaked out and ran inside to wake up my wife and get the cameras and ran back outside to see them still dancing all over the sky. i tried to use the camera on my phone to take pics but it was to dark. so i grabbed my wifes camera smart phone and yet it was still to dark to pick them up so i grabbed my digital camera and still couldnt get them. the orbs when the moved did not streak they would be as bright as any other star then get really big bright white then vanish and reappear dance around get really bright and vanish and reappear across the sky. there was no lights on them the way they moved like danc! ing around the stars. but the weirdest thing is the amount of distance they would blink, vanish what ever you want to call it, travel across the sky and then zig zag all over the sky.  My wife got to see the last two as i tried to tape it on my digital one flashed really bright white over the house then the other stayed the size of the other stars and zig zagged all over back and forth slowly working its way south, then they all just disappeared. we stood out in the yard looking at the sky for 15 more mins and they never came back. they emitted no other color but white they would start off the size of a star just zooming around the sky then they would get much much larger than any of the stars vanish and the reappear across the sky. I know it wasnt a airplane because you could see the planes flashing small tiny lights in the sky. it was almost fluid the way they moved across the sky. Im telling you they used up the whole sky zipping around oh they started from the north and ! were going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I also want to report that way back on june 6th in 2009 i and my son saw spheres over the kiawah river that keep appearing in either groups of up to to 4 or singular. one right outside by backyard no more then 100 ft for the biggest closest one.  but what i saw last night i found very strange. those animals were all going crazy and i know it was unusual.  when i went back out about 2+am or 3am, i didn&#39;t see that pulsating light anymore.  i&#39;ve seen some strange things out here at night.  i don&#39;t sleep well, so i often step out to view the stars otherwise, if i was sleeping i wouldn&#39;t have an idea of all the activity visible here at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I could not have watched this, “craft” move for more that three seconds, but one detail that stuck out to me was how bright and fuchsia the lights were.  I counted four lights in the shape of a rectangle surrounding several other smaller lights, although I did not make out the details of those as well.  Also, the fact that this, “craft” appeared out of nowhere in the night sky indicates that this could not have been any kind of civilian aircraft.<n>

Nothing seemed amiss as I walked to the park, watching the sky as I normally do.  Being an avid sky watcher I keep track of space weather catching meteor showers and aurora often at 46 deg. N (As I type now the aurora are flickering outside with a hazy white glow.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was out almost full and there was partial cloud cover to the south.  I noticed several planes and satellites seeing the tell tale signs, flashings lights and steady paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the south I saw an orange ball of light, it was bright and larger then the stars.  I waited for it to come in thinking it could be a planes spotlight coming directly at me.  Then two other orange lights started moving up from below horizon line and climbed up towards the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this was happening a fourth orange light appeared near the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They  started to  move erratically around  the first but not very fast and silently, until they reached formation.  The formation was a large sideways Y, there was a dot on each point and at the center where the lines meet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then began to glow very brightly, and I took off running home.  I got my girlfriend and we ran up to the deck and both watched as the lights moved about in front of passing clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I struggled to get my camera out, by the time I did two had vanished.  Now only the first and fourth remained.   I zoomed in and narrated as the first one stayed lit and the fourth faded in and out a few times but stayed in the same spot. I turned off the camera to save memory but did manage to get two of the four lights on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this the original disappeared, and I thought are we the only ones that saw this, then did they or it see us. In what to me seemed like a response to my thought, the lights on the neighbors porch started to strobe individually for about 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two lights are on the same circuit and are both controlled by one light switch, so this was very strange.  I then ! felt it best to go inside and lock up for the night.<n>

Looking east, they traveled from the southeast to the northeast at a VERY high speed.  They looked like stars, so I thought they might have been &#34;falling stars,&#34; but it would be extremely coincidental since there were two of them traveling at the same speed and similar flight pattern.  They were bright like an LED.  I felt like they were traveling too fast to be satellites or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually just disappeared slightly as if they were traveling right to left and then up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Object had several lights, some white/blue and others red.  Object shape was unidendifiable.  All we could see was several blinking lights, blinking from front to rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the object disapeared from sight a commercial airliner flew over head (our location is close to Pittsburgh Int Airport and less then 2 miles from the Flight 427 crash site)  the airliner was loud and slow moving and following the flight plan that we most regularily see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object was flying at a speed weve both never seen, was completely silent and flew a path that we have ! never seen airliners follow.

I live on the east end of town and there are many trees on my street so I couldn’t see anything but I am a block away from Pete’s Hill, a popular jogging trail with a full view of the city.  I went up on Pete’s Hill and saw the lights my friend was talking about. He was on the far west end of town but from the description he gave it didn’t take me long to see what he was talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four lights that were a reddish color and seemed to flicker a bit. They were in the shape of a “Y” or as my friend said, a triangle with another dot in the bottom center.  There seemed to be a fifth light (but very faint) slightly underneath the right side top of the ‘Y’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a couple of minutes and they slowly seemed to float away from each other. It was slow enough that it wasn’t very noticeable but I could tell that after a couple of minutes they were in slightly different positions from each other. They eventually got fainter until I could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to look up what they could be online but couldn’t find anything. My friend who saw them showed me this site today that listed a similar occurrence on the same day, so I thought I should post my experience. It is nice to know we weren’t alone in seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Entering the lot we noticed several people standing by their cars looking up at the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 3 rows we saw had 3 lights in a line.  As they moved across the sky more and more appeared and continued to move steadily.  I can&#39;t say how many there were before we noticed them but we saw at least 20 and when we went into the store they continued to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this but in looking online found pictures from many other places that were very much the same.<n>

It appeared to be following the triangle object.  Both started fading away in the distance after about 4 min or so.<n>

I  live in Cranberry Township, PA and it is a hilly area of Western PA.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon on fire.  As I looked it was followed by another.   I called my husband and we both grabbed cameras.   By the time the event was over, we observed about 10 of these orange fire balls go over.  They were headed in a straight line, flying ENE from Pittsburgh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We strung a few of our videos together and put two videos on YouTube.  One is labeled “Missiles over Pittsburgh 06/02/2012” is probably the best one.   The other “Cranberrytwpufo.qt”   A search in YouTube should bring them up quickly.  The Missile one has views from both my camera (I tried to do close-ups) and my husband’s cell phone video where he captured the things passing near the moon so you can get some perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were going fast, and we heard no sounds from them, although a helicopter did fly by while we were out filming.  I really think it was a jet squadron being moved, but maybe someone can look at the pictures and see if that makes sense.  We’ve all seen planes fly at night, but I’ve never seen 10 or so round glowing fireballs go over.   I suppose it is possible that up until now I’ve never seen a group of military jets fly across the night sky at high altitude on a mostly clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read a written description from someone driving in Kentucky at the exact same time that most closely describes what we saw.   In fact, numerous google searches for the evening of 06/02/2012 “ufos” turned up about 4 sightings that I would consider identical to ours.  They ranged from Illinois to New York, all occurring at the exact time (the one in Illinois is listed at 9:15p.m. CST).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I’d share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Once I stopped my car and got out, I could see there was an orange &#34;fire&#34; on one side of the cone shape; however, I am not sure if the orange was on the front or rear end of the moving objects.  There was no sound from them.  They moved in clusters that gradually broke up, as if they were being disbursed by the wind.  After the large group of them had moved nearly out of sight, there was one &#34;strangler&#34; that trailed along the same path.<n>

I saw what I thought was a new tower with several lights.  However, the tower seemed to have lights to spread at the top on both sides which made me curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the boys to look at it and they were amazed.  It appeared that the lights began to move. They were a red color and circular in shape.  They seemed to start spreading out in different directions and it was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived home and I went in to get my husband to come see.  There was only 1 or 2 left in the sky at that time, but he did see one.  My son and his friend said the others had moved to one spot in the sky behind a cloud and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the last one move toward the same area as the others, it seemed to flicker. It then reached the same area and dissappeared in as cloud and did not come out on the other side.  We of course wondered about airplanes but there would not be that many planes that close together or moving in different directions.   We also thought maybe helocopters, but did not think again that there would be that many that close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has any explanation, I would like to know it. Also, if anyone knows of any weather balloons or chinese lanterns in the area, I would like to know.  I&#39;ve never really thought of ufo&#39;s and think there must be a logical explanation, but so far I have none.  I tried to report to the local television station but they did not seem interested.  I also called the police station.  They were nice and polite but were equally inthused.  Please continue your investigation in my area. It is Salisbury, close to China Grove, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your time.<n>

I exited the house, and looked east, where my brother was pointing at something in the sky. Three orange fireballs were clearly visible moving in what appeared to be a southern trajectory, although it may have been southeast or southwest. The lights would have been near the eastern city limits of Billings Heights. As we watched the first three crossing the sky, more continued to come into view, as several large trees blocked part of the sky from our sight. I counted at least ten. Most of them seemed to be moving in a line with each other, althrough three of them formed an irregular triangle formation. At one point two of the orbs came close enough to eachother that they appeared to touch, before swirling around eachother for a moment. The lights all made their way across the sky, eventually fading into some cloud cover. The entire incident lasted less than 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights would best be described as orange fireballs. Their size was quite a bit larger than any star or planet would appear, and they were clearly visible even though night had not quite fallen and the sky was still fairly well lit. There only appeared to be the singular orange source of light for each light. There were no additional or blinking lights that might suggest an airplane or helicopter. They appeared to be flying lower than most airplanes would fly.<n>

Since I was driving, I could not get a clear uninterrupted look for more than a few seconds - but I kept looking up trying to determine if they were aircraft, hot air balloons, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving, I lost view of the diamond formation group of lights, but then saw a lower orange- red light that seemed to be moving across the sky at a steady pace with no blinking lights.  I passed a person on the side of the road that got out of her vehicle and was looking up in the sky at the direction if the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to drive I kept looking at the object out of my driver side window.  It seemed to be staying at the same distance  while I was driving - keeping  the view constant.   I had a person driving fast behind me and I couldn&#39;t slow down to get a better look.   I wish I did pull over to get a better look, as I had my camera with me (coming home from an event) and I kept trying to process what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sparked my search this morning on the Internet to see if anyone else saw something strange in the sky last night.  I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t the only one that saw something that was a little different than usual.<n>

There was absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a reflection from my TV onto the window at first. I then realized that it was in the sky. This orb seemed to be levitating.  It proceeded from south or south-east to north-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back inside after watching it a moment to grab binoculars.  On closer look, though it had traveled a considerable distance in just a short time, I was able to see green flashing lights.<n>

I witnessed 3 orange balls of light hovering over Tiger Mountain not in any specific formation but moving very slowly from side to side and up and down....again at a very deliberate pace.  I watched this for a minute or two when the orange light on the right side went dark and I could make out a dark object decending very slowly towards the mountain.  The other two lights just went away.  It was very dark by then but the image of the dark object decending very slowly caught my attention. I have lived here all my life and have never seen anything like this before and I am a skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/2/12 21:00|Beacon Rock State Park|WA|Sphere|20-30 minutes|Observed about 20 bright orange glowing lights at relatively fast rate of speed over Columbia River Gorge WA.|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89379.html|734|ndxe201206| Observed about 20 bright orange glowing lights at relatively fast rate of speed over Columbia River Gorge WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting  On June 2, 2012 I was camping with two friends at Beacon Rock State Park in Washington.  It is located on the Columbia River Gorge 35 miles east of Portland, Oregon.  At approximately 9pm we were walking west on the camp road to catch the trail to the restroom. I noticed some unusual orange glowing lights overhead and to our right which I pointed out to my friends.  The lights were tracking way above and slightly to the right of a power line cut through forested land.   There was no sound.  The initial lights I saw were clustered in a small group.  I didn’t count them but there were about 5 with a couple other ones trailing behind.  They were not symmetrically spaced. I observed about 18-20 of these orange glowing lights in a period of about 20 minutes.  After the initial cluster of lights, the ones that followed were singular and more spaced out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friends and I marveled at the lights, I recalled that my binoculars were in the car and ran back to get them. I also called another woman over from another campsite to observe the lights.  Through my binoculars I could see that the lights were perfectly round.  They were not solid colored orange but appeared to have grey shadows without a distinctive pattern.  They resembled brain matter. In the lower left quadrant of two of them, there appeared to be electrical activity like spidery lightening.  While the perimeters were perfectly round, some appeared to have noticeable grey colored fissures that ran out to the perimeter.  The only exceptions to the perfectly spherical lights were two that appeared to morph somewhat into elliptical shapes.  I don’t know if this could have been a distortion of my binoculars or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights came from west to east and were moving at a relatively fast rate.  They were much larger than a planet but smaller appearing than the moon.  They appeared to be at the altitude that a small plane would fly and the later ones followed one another along the same path.  A short distance after passing where I were standing, they ascended upward and disappeared.  There was cloud cover as they ascended so I couldn’t discern if they were hidden by the clouds, ascended out of sight or evaporated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home I checked with NOAA in Portland and found that the wind was coming from the west that night at about 10 mph at the surface.  Aloft to 3000’ the wind was blowing west to southwest at 15-20 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life and am splitting with curiosity to know what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in her description of the objects she, and her two camping companions, witnessed.  Please see a second report from another witness, who was in the same campground.  PD))<n>

It went in many directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after approximately 3 minutes, the light source mysteriously disappeared.  Even though the light disappeared, I was still able to see the minuscule black object moving around in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes I lost sight of the object. I am 100% positive this u.f.o was not a shooting star or an airplane.<n>

I believe there were a row of three and then a row of two. After that there were about a dozen more orange spheres in single file spaced far apart moving west to east. We kept thinking that the display was over and then another fireball would pop into view from the western sky. They were quite bright and moving faster than a small plane would.  They were gaining elevation at a low angle. They would eventually disappear. It is unclear whether they entered the cloudbank and were just no longer visible or perhaps burned out.<n>

First we saw three of the lights in a triangular formation, then a bunch more came in random spacing.  This lasted for about 5 minutes, then one-by-one, they faded off the horizon.  These WERE NOT aircraft or meteors (no sound), so what were these objects?  I don&#39;t think they were satellites, since they were too low in atmosphere, too large, too many grouped together, and red in color instead of bright white.  I called the local KCRG TV9 newsline shortly after this event, and they said they received other calls about these lighted objects.  What was it?  I tried to get a video, but my camera batteries were dead!<n>

Once we all started to watch them, there was around 7 of them that formed a v shape in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial cluster there were several more that would follow each other, one by one and sometimes in pairs.  We counted around 20 of them all together.  They were flying very high (about as high as a large plane would fly overhead right under the cloud cover.  They were completely silent and made no noise.  They were also moving incredibly fast.  Much faster than any plane that I have ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had binoculars and were able to look at them closer and they were spherical in nature, but their shape also would morph every once in awhile. I would describe it as a brain like shape that had a glowing nature to it like a campfire.  They glowed orange (from dark orange to lighter orange at the top) and pulsated like a beating heart.  Much like a glowing Chinese lantern, that floated effortlessly through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also had what looked like electricity waves that would move all around them (almost like they were coming from the brain like mass and being generated by it).  These also glowed a light yellow/orang-ish.  They would float above the tree line and right below the cloud line until they would reach a point in the sky and they would all of a sudden disappear, one right after the next once they hit this spot, and then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall this lasted about 15 mins for all of these to fly over our campground.<n>

I don&#39;t deserve a star like object moving from north to south in an irratic pattern flashing a bright light every few seconds.  like a bright camera flash!   I watched it until it disappeared .  I saw 2 star like objects not flashing heading in the opposite direction, and then that&#39;s when I noticed a second bright I was like object heading from north to south flashing every few seconds dim then bright up and down very strange. all together I saw 5 objects in the sky moving in different directions!<n>

I had passed O&#39;hare a couple miles back, when I noticed a rectangle in the NE sky similar to a drive-in movie screen.  At first I thought it was a new billboard and then I realized it was way far in the distance and very high in the sky, about 45 to 50 degrees above horizontal.  There was no visible support for the rectangle and the sky out over Lake Michigan was only slightly hazy.  I was about to point it out to my wife when traffic and buildings obscured my view for a quarter mile or so, and I was never able to catch sight of it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot and post this as a matter of interest. I realize there is at least one possible explanation, that of an aircraft towing a banner. Although this did not appear to be what I saw.<n>

I live in a wooded area and a fly zone.  But this was different.  The object didn&#39;t move at all. It stayed in the same place.  The airplanes move across the sky.  There were many bright little circles of white lights in the shape of a circle.  It wasn&#39;t a solid circle of light.  They would flash very brightly.  Sometimes they would change color.  Then at 3:00 AM they just disappeared.<n>

Ignoring it thinking it was a comet from the corner of my eye I seen it flash again.  It was very high up and continued at a steady velocity moving right of cepheus.  It was different from an aircraft or satellite because it would only light up with white light every 20-30 seconds and while doing so it would also glow for 3 seconds allowing me to make out the shape.<n>

A single, large red light was seen over the neighbor&#39;s horse pasture and community pond.  The object was silent and enveloped in a swirl of thin fog.  The red light shone steadily and did not fade, wink out, or move.  Because of the thin fog swirling around, the rays of light coming out of the red object was reminiscent of old illustrations of illumined beings stepping out of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just been looking out another window on the same side of the house, finished in that room and walked down the hall, past two other rooms to check on the window in the small bedroom.  That&#39;s when I saw it. In the no more than 12 seconds it took for me to walk from one bedroom to the next and open the drapes, it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in a stationary position, suspended at about 200 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about a minute.  As I watched this strange red object, I started to feel as though I was being hypnotized.  I felt a panic begin to envelop me, a growing fear of what it might do.  This is what really surprised me more than anything during this whole event, the fear of some unknown evil glowing red and watching my neighborhood.  I pulled myself away from the window, partly to share the news and partly to get away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran across the hall to inform other family members, then returned to resume my watch.  I went to a different room on the same floor to see if I might be able to see more than just the light, perhaps to see the definition of some larger shape.  Alas, when I looked out that window, the glowing red light had vanished. In the time I saw it, probably a minute and the less than a minute   I spent running from one room to another, it vanished.  The entire episode was concluded by 11:27pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other family members saw it.  For some time afterward, we looked out other windows, but did not see anything that could have been identified as the red light.  We did not go outdoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were: light breeze, slight drizzle, thin fog, damp air. No moon or stars were observed, which is not uncommon in Western Washington.  The cloud cover often obscures the night sky.  There were no traffic noises from the highway a half a mile away.  No night birds sang or dogs barked.  No airplanes or helicopters broke the still night air.  The only sound was the sound of frogs from the nearby pond.  Because of the drizzle, no backyard fires glowed in the neighborhood either. Everyone was indoors.  It was an usually quiet Friday night.<n>

Another 50 or so must have gone by, one following another in a slanted but straight line, as if afixed to a wing, but I could see stars through them so they must not have been attached to anything. My friends and I had the eerie feeling that they were observing us observing them.  My friends neighbor, an elderly lady came home and she observed the lights as well, he then went in his house to call out his sister who also came out and observed the lights. The lights went across the sky from North to South, once the lights reached the end of the horizon they seemed to &amp;quot;blink out&amp;quot;.  Once one blinked out, another would appear on the north side horizon.  After about 20 minutes of this the last light appeared and followed the rest, from the rear of the last light it seemed as if a corner of a wing could be seen, yet, invisible.  Over the years I&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s before, but never anything on this scale, the sheer number of the objects was staggering. This was a major event, and yet, nobody repoted it.  Execpt me.  Hopefully others will come forward about this.  Thank you.<n>

I stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Cheuneman Street and Hoffman Street.  I looked up into the sky and noticed something bright. The width was the size of a large school bus and the length was twice the size of that.  It was a cylinder shaped object with a bright iridescent orange color.  It was similar to the color of the orange hand that instructs pedestrians to stop at a crosswalk.  There appeared to be no windows or anything attached to this object.  There were flames coming from the bottom of this object blowing towards the SE direction the same length as the object, but it did not make any noise.  It was approximately six or seven stories high from the ground.  It remained in an upright position and sat in this location for ten seconds before traveling upward towards the East somewhat slowly, about the speed of an airplane in the sky.  I watched the orange colored ob! ject travel behind a cloud until it appeared to be grape in size and soon after disappeared.  I called the national weather service and I was informed that the wind was blowing 2 miles per hour in the SE direction on that day.<n>

My wife was able to video record most of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Others stopped to view the happening, which actually led to a multiple vehicle accident.  The objects where absolutely silent and sequentially disappeared at a certain point in the sky when they finally reached it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was NOT and airplane or helicopter!  Seemed to be far to high to be chinese lanterns.<n>
6/1/12 20:30|Arnold|MO|Triangle|5 minutes|Multiple UFO identified late evening in Arnold Missouri, exhibited no sound, moving in sync with eachother, multiple orbs, triangle|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89327.html|755|ndxe201206| Multiple UFO identified late evening in Anrold Missouri, exhibited no sound, moving in sync with each other, multiple orbs, triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of June 1st 2012 in Arnold Missouri sometime between 8:30pm and 10:00pm there were several UFOs witnessed by myself, my girlfriend, and 4 neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting first started with one object that was pointed out by my neighbor.  It looked like a helicopter that had 3 different lights blinking on the back, middle, and front, all blinking randomly.  We had thought it might have been a helicopter on fire.  It had a somewhat long oval shape and it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were observing the first object, my girlfriend, neighbor, and his mother accompanied me to the middle of the street to get a better view (because there was tree obstruction).  Once we got to the middle of the street we saw another set of objects (3) moving from left to right at the same speed and keeping the same distance from each other.  These objects however did not seem to be as close to us as the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the rest of the neighbors came out, and more objects kept coming into view. I wasn&#39;t sure if they were suddenly appearing or have been traveling for some time as the treeline was still obscuring some of the view.  The objects all had a white with orange tint to them.  They still seemed to have a blinking type of flickering to them in some way (similar to the first object sighted).  The objects all seemed to be independent of each other, but noticed near the end of the sighting ( where my video starts) one object pattern had the classic triangle shape.  It moved also at the same speed as the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects all seemed to have suddenly just went out at around the same area in the sky as they kept passing from left to right. (not sure of the cardinal directions)   No flickering, or fading, just suddenly gone.  However each light seemed to disappear right after one another. (which makes me think the triangle shape was not one craft)   The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes.   There was no sound. I cannot determine the height of the objects, but it seemed to be around the same altitude as any other normal aircraft. (which prompted me to think the first object was a helicopter as I am used to seeing lights in the sky at this distance with sound and the usual light patterns of normal aircraft.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a somewhat decent video capture from my iPhone 3G of the event that lasts approx 1:34 min.  I will be emailing this right away.<n>
6/1/12 20:30|Katy|TX|Other|10+ minutes|V-shaped light in sky|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89325.html|756|ndxe201206| V-shaped light in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took photos of a V shaped &amp;quot;fireball&amp;quot; thing in the Western  part of the sky yesterday. I thought it was Venus till I saw that it  was shaped like a V. I have several pics of it. I didn&#39;t take any  video because it was so small it would have just looked like a dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object was not moving very fast.  It was red/orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked like it was on fire. It might not have been moving at all,  but locked in orbit because it seemed to move with the rotation of  the sky. It was in the sky for at least 10min. The pictures I took  have all the exact times on them. After I took the photos I got out  my telescope which is a Celestron Powerseeker 114 EQ D=114mm  F1=900mm F/8 Model#21045  	I witnessed the object at about 8:30pm cst in the west about  20-30 degrees above the horizon. No apparent movement. Seemed to be  locked in geo stationary orbit. I will link my pictures and a video  I did asking for anyone with info about what it is to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PICTURES:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://brentnewton.deviantart.com/#/d5230mk  http://brentnewton.deviantart.com/#/d5230im http://brentnewton.deviantart.com/#/d52306q   http://brentnewton.deviantart.com/#/d52300y http://brentnewton.deviantart.com/#/d5226q7<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgzDtvkfIyU<n>
6/1/12 20:00|Tulsa|OK|Circle|20 seconds|Saw a glowing orange light traveling at constant speed and altitude no nav lights no sound.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92235.html|757|ndxe201206| saw a glowing orange light traveling at constant speed and altitude no nav lights no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heard you guys describe something I saw a couple month ago on coast to coast tonight.  I was standing with my mother talking outside by my car before I left their house and my mother said what do you think that is.  I looked up and saw a glowing orange circle traveling at a constant speed and making absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Now just so you know I am an aircraft mechanic and I work at Tulsa International Airport so I&#39;m used to seeing planes in the air.  This object had no navigational lights and was flying at approximatly 2000 ft and was close enough to us that if it was an airplane we would have heard it,  my parents live pretty much right under where the planes line up to land at Tulsa International when there is a prevailing south wind I checked at work the next day and the planes had been coming in from the north the night before because of a prevailing nothern wind so no planes should have been in the area.  I have worked on planes for 10 yrs and! have never seen anything remotely like this.  The object continued to fly north at constant speed and altitude until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/12 13:00|Cherry|MN|Triangle|5 seconds|Saw a Silver, Triangle shaped craft above my car, that sparkled from the rear and then disappeared.|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89328.html|758|ndxe201206| Saw a Silver, Triangle shaped craft above my car, that sparkled from the rear and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading West on Hwy 37, appx. 10 miles due East of Hibbing, a silver, multi-sided triangle (like a spire) appeared above my vehicle and was visible through the top edge of the windshield, around a mile high.  It looked to be about the size of a large fighter jet.  Clean, complete edging on the craft - No wings, tail, or any such things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, a blue and red sparkle came out of the rear, and the craft disappeared in a flash, also heading West.  My first thought was nothing mankind has created could travel this rapidly, as I had a full and unobstructed view of the horizon.  My second thought was that since it was gone in an instant, perhaps it entered another dimension.<n>

It looked like they were chasing each other. 1 of them got really bright as I was pointing at it, they would also have pulsing white lights on all of them.<n>
