There was a sound on the Car-radio, like many different Frequences, high pitch and low pitch, in harmony.  They flunked away ordinary Radiobroadcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And within three kilometers from the Great Golden Disc (1.250 meters in Diameter-golden light glowing)-hanging in between Windy Island and Mainland, perfectly still-it started with a foggy mist, at 20:02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this cleared a very great wessel hoovering completely still, violet thin lightnings underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:12 it was a Syncron-Extreme-white light,and a Hizzing Short sound,and it took of in Easterly direction, turning North, but unvisible-the only thing visible was a Square-shaped Ruby-Glittering Light Cloud, and then a Dark Blue Star in far North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The children on the beach have seen mist clear, and Cow and Birdwas Silenced.

11/17/71 21:00|Knox|NY|Disk|1 minute|UFO hovers above and shines a bright beam of light down on me|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62307.html|3|ndxe197111| UFO hovers above and shines a bright beam of light down on me<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was in the fall of 1972.  I was a Sgt. on sheriff patrol in Knox NY at the time.  It was around 8 or 9pm and it was dark out.  I pulled over to the side of Route 146 to relieve myself.  I was standing right next to my cop car and I heard a slight humming sound which I thought was my car radio.  I started to turn to enter my cop car when all of a sudden a very bight intense beam of light shown down on me.  It scared the heck out of me.  I tried to look up but the light was so bright I could hardly make out the shape of the object.  It was saucer shaped and from what I could estimate it was about 200-400 feet above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the intense beam of light turned off in a blink just like a flash light would and I could see the object shoot off at a very high rate of speed up out of sight.  It made little or no noise and left faster than anything I have ever seen or could possibly imagine at the time or now for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got a call on my cop radio from one of my Deputy officers I was in charge of and he told me to come to a woman&#39;s house who said she had seen a UFO a few minutes ago in Berne New York which was close to Knox.  I told my Deputy that I thought I might have just seen what she saw and decided to go check it out.  When I got to the woman&#39;s house her dogs were acting very strange.  They were crawling on their bellies with their tails between their legs and were trembling.  I have never seen dogs act like that.  She told me she had see a UFO hovering over her barns in the back yard and had seen them several times before that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I decided to contact the control tower at the Albany airport.  I asked them if they had tracked anything out of the ordinary and they replied &#34;no, but we&#39;ve received several other phone calls from people saying they saw UFOs as well.&#34;  The events were published in the Albany newspaper (I believe it was the Albany Times Union) shortly there after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not told many people about this except for my close family.  I don&#39;t want any media attention and anyone to bother me.  I saw what I saw and I know it was something strange and out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We spoke with the son of the source of this report, and the son seemed quite sober-minded, and credible, in our opinion.  The son works as an erstwhile UFO investigator.  Date above has been amended.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to make one correction to the report I filled with you regarding my Grandfather&#39;s UFO sighting.  He thought is was in the fall of 1972 but the correct date is November 8, 1971.  Can you make this correction before you post it in your data base?  It&#39;s too good of a sighting to not have the correct date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His name is ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
11/15/71 21:00|Lake Victor|TX|Sphere|5-8 Seconds|Large Bright Blue Ball of light at very low altitude.|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05197.html|4|ndxe197111| Large Bright Blue Ball of light at very low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I, all about 10 or 11 years old played a game where we hid from car headlights. We saw what at first we thought was headlights from a car shining on the surrounding buildings. Thinking it was car headlights (in our game)we turned quickly to see which direction it was coming from so that we could dodge the lights. We did see one car on a distant road, but it&#39;s lights were not pointing in our direction. Suddenly, a bright blue &#34;fireball&#34; (for lack of a better word) streaked across the sky. It had no distinct shape that we could recall, only a big blue ball of bright light. It could not have been more than 1000ft in the air above us and had a deafening roar. The event lasted no more than a few seconds as it roared across the sky. I would say from east to west. I had seen meteors by that age and knew it was not a meteor. This was a very intense light and was not from something burning up. It was a very brilliant light. I am not sure that it left any sort of trail, but I believe it did not. The event was reprted on the local news the that evening and UFO enthusiasts were out the next evening searching the skies with spotlights and such. I also remember that some car horns went off as it went by and someone talking of their car dying when it happened.<n>
11/12/71 16:45|Monterey Park|CA|Circle|3-5 minutes|Bluish white lights in the southeast at high altitude.|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12594.html|5|ndxe197111| Bluish white lights in the southeast at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First noticed stationary bluish white lights in daytime sky. Weather condictions were clear sky with haze. Objects viewed through 40 power telescope. Objects viewed through to telescope appeared to be circular in shape. One object seemed to appear coming from behind from other object. Viewing through telescope revealed  two objects at a lower altitude and five or six dim points of blue light at extremely high altitude. Objects disappeared from sight.<n>
11/1/71 11:20|Belo Horizonte-Minas Gerais (Brazil)||Cylinder|10 sec|Huge cilynder on Hills over Belo Horizonte City-Minas Gerais State- Brasil|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50932.html|6|ndxe197111| Huge cilynder on Hills over Belo Horizonte City-Minas Gerais State- Brasil<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was backing from university at night, walking in the middle of the streert, when, suddenly, appears in front of me , about 1.0 mile away , over the hills at the end of the street a very large flying object,moving not in a high speed. In front of it appears  also a lot of small lights( more than 15), surrounding it  in a perfect circle in front, and  spreading lights as they move. The clarity of the lights revealed the shape of the object: A huge cilynder, with a fixed reator ( it seams to be) and jet of fire spilled from it.The scene delays something between 8 to 10 secs, was very bright and clarify all over the hills . It takes the south direction passing by Nova Lima, Barbacena Cities. Two days after I red the notice on a  local news paper , sayng that at least two observers related itin Belo Horizonte City and also  did some observers from the the two cities  reported<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
