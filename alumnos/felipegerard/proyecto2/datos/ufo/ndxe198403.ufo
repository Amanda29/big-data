He asked me to draw a sketch/diagram of it and I did. He then invited me to talk about it on the Jeff Rense program.  They never heard a description like this before. Jeff Rense suggested that I send the report to you, that you have a huge database and could take one look at the diagram and know right away if anyone else ever reported a strange object like this.  I would love to know if anyone else ever has seen something like it.I didn&#39;t know how else to write to you except here on the report form. The following is my story.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I saw something strange when I was a little girl so here goes. I was 5/6 years old, I was sitting on the steps of my front porch cracking pecans (wearing a red dress, white sweater and bonnet that tied under my chin- this detail given due to vivid memory). It was windy.I believe it was around March. I looked up and saw this huge brown ball with spikes slowly passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound. No lights but this was in the daytime. As it passed overtop (well,went behind the very top of) a huge pecan tree in a neighbor&#39;s yard, I watched for it to come out on the other side of that tree as it should have, but it never did. I then went right inside and told our housekeeper/maid Lillie, yes she was like family, about what I had seen. She told me that it was probably one of those new airplanes from New York because they were always making new things up there in New York. Over the years, I always knew that I had seen this thing, reminding me of like a huge beechnut (or sweet gum) in the sky. Not anything like UFOs as I would come to hear of them, it wasn&#39;t shiny or metallic, not saucer like, no lights, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to check out photos on some of the UFO websites a couple of years ago to see if I could find anything that would remotely resemble what I had seen and was shocked when I did find it, well something so much like it but I really couldn&#39;t believe it. What I had always thought of as spikes were being referred to by some other witnesses as &#39;tentacles&#39;. Along with the photos of it, there was a drawing/diagram indicating how the tentacles lowered downward to land in standing position. So this strange part of it seemed to make more sense. The one I saw appeared to have more of the &#39;tentacles&#39; than the one in those photographs, also the one I saw appeared to have outline of a door. Those photos were taken in 73,Cocoyoc Mexico. (and my sighting was early 70s also)   After all these years I have done a sketch of my sighting (thanks to suggestion of Brian).When I showed this sketch photo to my mom for her opinion about the old neighborhood part, she said to me....&#39; you know that&#39;s probably significant that you are mentioning that there is the field behind the house.&#39; She then said &#39;you know there were 3 adults at the top of the hill one night that said they saw something hovering over the trees behind our house back there in that field&#39;...... and I&#39;m like &#39;Mom, you never told me that!, how old was I &#39;? I said, and she said I was probably just a baby.  I thought it was interesting piece of information to receive all these years later. Another thing, it was not until I began drawing that sketch, that it ever occurred to me, that there was a huge fruit field all around the neighborhood, imagine that. I&#39;m attaching a link to the sketch here and hope its acceptable, I&#39;m not sure how else to send it. Its here:  http://usera.imagecave.com/AmandaRose/mandaschildhoodufo.JPG  thank you so much,  sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>
3/27/84 23:00|Rosendale|NY|Circle|30 minutes|Mass sighting in 1984, two newspaper reports about it, police and other reputable peole also made reports.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42678.html|2|ndxe198403| Mass sighting in 1984, two newspaper reports about it, police and other reputable peole also made reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thirteen I believe, so it must have been around spring 1984.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been in bed. I woke up to alot of commotion, voices. I could hear my mother and brother speaking very animatedly. I walked out to our kitchen, and they were standing out on the porch. I looked out of the porch door, which faces west. I saw a family we were friendly with (they lived one town north of us) standing on the porch with my mom and brother, they were all talking to each other in an excited manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprised to see this family on our porch so late at night. They were all looking up into the sky. I walked out of the door and noticed as I was looking west, towards Route 32, that there were cars all stopped along the road, including police cars, ambulances and firetrucks. Everyone was outside of their cars and looking up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stepped onto the porch and turned to look southward, towards the Rondout Creek, I saw a large object in the sky above us. It is difficult for me to remember now, as this happened 21 years ago, but I recall lights, and black space between the lights, and an edge that wasn&#39;t distinct. I thought &#34;That&#39;s got way more lights than a plane.&#34; The lights were colorful and &#34;pulse-ey&#34; ( not entirely pulsating, but with a pulsating quality )   Also, The size of it was enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t make any noise, and it moved excrutiatingly slowly until it seemed to hover over the intersection of the Rondout Creek and Route 32. I could hear the family of friends that were with us telling my mom and brother that they had followed it, but I don&#39;t know from what direction they had followed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to move slowly northwards. Many people, including police and emergency personnel, jumped into their cars to follow it. My mom was eager for me to return to bed. The next day was a school day. That part always strikes me funny, because although I was very agitated about what I had seen, I didn&#39;t have any trouble going to sleep. The next day, at school I remember talking about it in class a few times, asking if other kids had seen or heard about it. Some had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that the next day The Kingston Daily Freeman reported a story about the sightings, because apparently they had started quite a bit south of us and continued up to the north, and alot of people were involved. Lots of policemen had made reports, along with other reputable citizens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the day after that The Kingston Daily Freeman reported that they had been told by military officials down in Newburgh that it had only been helicopters flying in formation. I remember thinking that that many helicopters would have made a huge amount of noise and wind. Everyone who was on my porch remarked about how quiet it was at the time we were watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago, we were at a gathering with the same family of friends who had stood out on our porch watching with us that evening. I said &#34; Hey, do you guys remember the UFO that everyone saw that time?&#34; They nodded, but no one remarked further and my mom seemed embarassed by my candor, so I didn&#39;t push the issue. Sometimes I wonder if it was a dream, but I know that the newspaper wrote about it twice after the fact, so I couldn&#39;t have just dreamt it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

3/27/84 20:00|Mettacahonts|NY|Formation|20 minutes|Slow moving football-field sized object caused traffic jams on rural Rt. 209 from Ellenville to Marbletown NY.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48881.html|3|ndxe198403| Slow moving football-field sized object caused traffic jams on rural Rt. 209 from Ellenville to Marbletown NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date of this event is approximate, but there were probably several hundred to a few thousand witnesses (I know of 5 witnesses myself) and there were reports in the Kingston (NY) Daily Freeman and also on the local television news WTZA 62.  I was 16 years old at the time, at home with my brother, 14 and mom, 43.  My dad, 53 had driven his mom, 75 to Napanoch and also Ellenville to shop for groceries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8 P.M. my mom got a phone call from my dad who was calling from a pay-phone at was then the Great American supermarket (next to what was then the Channel Master factory).  He told my mom that there was a very large object in the sky travelling very slowly and that many people were watching it in the parking lot and also cars were pulling off on the shoulder of Rt. 209 and getting out of their cars to look at it.  He said he first noticed it as it traveled northerly and appeared to be at a height of about 2000 feet as it cleared the Shawangunk mountains between Ellenville and Napanoch and appeared to be about 300 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad called on the phone because our home in Mettacahonts was about 12 miles north and the object was headed towards us.  He said to go outside and see if we could see it, so my brother and I went out on the back patio facing southwest towards Ellenville and we could see it, so we yelled out to my mom who was still on the phone and she told my dad we could see it (and he was still watching it from 12 miles away). My mom quickly came outside and saw it too, but there were some trees blocking the view, so we ran to a large field behind our property to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mettacahonts is elevated about 200 feet on the edge of the Catskill mountains with a view of about 50 miles of the Shawangunk ridge from south of Ellenville to north of Rosendale, and Rt. 209 runs parallel to the ridge following the Rondout creek.  We could see that the object was very large and had several white lights all around it.  There was no headlight like a plane or helicopter, and there was no red or blue light like some aircraft, and no flashing lights.  More importantly, there was absolutely no sound.  It was a dark night and calm, but with good visibility.  At that time there was only one light visible at night, from the Granite hotel in Kerhonkson, about 6 miles away.  The object seemed very low in the sky (below the top of the Shawangunk ridge) so it had to be lower than 1000 feet.  It also moved very, very slow.  It passed approximately over the Granite hotel and then took several minutes before it passed north of Mettacahonts road, so it&#39;s approximate speed was about 100 to 150 miles per hour.  We then watched as it went out of view somewhere towards Rosendale about 5 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt calm and it didn&#39;t seem scared at any time during the event.  Few words were said, partially because we were straining our ears to try to hear the object.  Normally, it was possible to hear cars travelling on Rt. 209 about 2 miles away.  But this night, there was no sound at all, so we definitely would have heard airplanes or helicopters if they came within 2 or 3 miles of our house as this object did.  Some news reports at the time indicated that it was only small aircraft flying in formation but there was no sound and the object maintained a steady speed and altitude over about a 10 or 15 minute time frame, so it could not be explained as several small aircraft gliding in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 minutes or an hour later my dad returned home (normally a 20 minute drive).  His mom did not want to talk about the event, but he told us that at one point she got very scared and asked him to get them out of the area as they followed the giant object towards a large field near the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch.  At that point the object passed directly overhead and he said he could hear a faint &#34;wooshing&#34; sound.  Then, as he tried to follow the object north on Rt. 209, he lost sight because the road had become completely clogged with cars.  Normally there was very little traffic at night on this rural road, but hundreds of cars had pulled onto the shoulder so they could get out and look.  But, after a while, the shoulders got full of cars and people began stopping their cars right in the highway.  It took nearly a half hour for the traffic to clear out after the object went out of sight.  Apparently the traffic jam was part of the reason it was so quiet that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The newspaper ran a few small stories both proving and disproving the theory of light aircraft flying in tight formation.  The television news had the story that same night. Sightings were reported to the station from towns all along the Rondout valley and Rt. 209 all the way to Kingston, 20 miles to the north of our home. An episode of the television show Unsolved Mysteries had a similar story out of Poughkeepsie, NY that occurred around the same time, so it may be possible that this was the same object we saw (Poughkeepsie is about 40 miles south of our home).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody in my family was drinking or using any drugs at the time of the sighting.  My dad was a manager in a factory, my mom was a secretary, my grandmother was an active 75 year old with a sharp mind who lived by herself until she was 92, my brother was a popular kid in school who liked sports, and I was a high-honor roll student in high school.  There were also many sheriffs and state troopers who had to see the object as they tried to clear the traffic jam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Saw it for 25min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In front of a friends house we saw a one large mass. In the sky approx one 1/4 of a mile from where we were standing. It was 200ft in the air. And looked longer than a football field. It made no noise. And it was going slow. During the duration of us observing it. It did not look like any plane i ever saw. I lived near an airforce base. So i know the thing we saw that night wasn&#39;t a plane nor helicopter!When it was moving the best way i can describe it. If you took a piece a graph paper and a pencil and a ruler. And connected the lines on the paper that&#39;s how it was flying. It turned on its lights white lights about 10 mins into us watching it. Then it shut off its lights. Then it glowed solid green. The shape of a cigar. Then it slowly went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

The object was so large it appeared to be a huge cluster a stars at first glance. As the object neared our location we pulled to the side of the road and got out to get a better view. This ship was extremely large and the most incredible sight i&#39;ve seen in my life. The ship moved at a steady pace approx 25mph. and did not deviate its speed. The altitude was approx. 700-800 ft. The ship had no set shape. There were hundreds of different shapes all over the entire mass which were covered with all white lights which seemed to be guides into the various shapes. The lights would softly glow and then receed into the various shapes at different intervals. Such a massive ship and there was no sound, it seemed to float over us.  There were 63 reported sightings of small ufo&#39;s of various colors and shapes reported to authorities all over the state of Maine on that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the witness arrange to have some of the other witnesses to the other events submit reports, as well.

It may have had another, smaller, triangular space craft suspended above it (two of us noticed that). It made no noise at first, until it flew directly over our heads--very low in the air, hovering.  Once it was dirctly above us, it made noise.  It had many lights on it, and many metal square and rectangular type shapes all over the bottom of it.  It was emense.  Then, it sped off over the opposite treeline across two fields and a road in AN INSTANT.  (we barely had time to turn our heads to see it disappear over the trees)<n>
3/9/84 20:15|Arvidsjaur (Sweden)||Disk|10 minutes|"Leadlight" with saucer behind.|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86983.html|9|ndxe198403| &#34;Leadlight&#34; with saucer behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a very old sighting. But it is more or less exactly what happened.  I was 16 years old and cyckling  to my familys home.The weather was about -10C,no wind and about a half meter snow beside the road.  A clear and dark evening.When I started to pass our neighbours house I noticed a &#34;lamp&#34; one house behind our house,at the other side of the street.  The light was about 1.5-2m above the roof.  I just thaught it was an odd and strange position for a light.It is when I go up in front of our garage I realize that the light is moving,around 0.5m each seconds.It is mowing parallel to the street in my direction.Description:never pulsating or changing in strength what you could see,25-30cm high,10cm breadth,the core is bright white a little less clear white out from the core and just at the end around weak yeallow.It could almost go for a street light except I didn´t see any glas,reflektor or anything else material,it´s just the light.It doesn´t seem to shine so long o! ut in the air.My eyes go from the light to the front door and back.It´s just when I decide to go and tell other about it,I can see in the glimse of my eye that more is lightened up 50m away.First I think that some smaller lights has been turned on.But when I focus at the object I realize that it somehow, even if I can´t see it,must have been brighter.Because another object is shown around 1m behind the &#34;lamp&#34; to the right.What I see is a surface about 1.5 m in diameter.  The color is very pale yellow but I think it´s the light doing that.Actually I think it is white in normal light.  Seems like solid metal like an old oiltank not like aluminium.It´s not a shiny metallic object.It´s also possible that the surface is not completly smooth.I can´t see anything like bults welded parts or markings. It´s just the surface in one peace and it looks brand new.  However I can see one thing.If I should describe it by it´s shape,I should say I say the under part of a saucer or more like a not ! so steep sour milk plate.I did see almost down to the bottom p! art(arou nd 1 m),but I belive that a lot of the upper part didn´t show.From front to back around I should say minimum 3 up to 5 m if it had this round shape like it seemed all around.It went at the same speed as the light so at that moment I thaught they were connected.After about 5 seconds I suddenly just see the light.I then got in and showed my parents and sisters boyfriend the light.It now pass the roof at the neighbour in front of us.Because it´s higher I think that the other object almost must touch the roof.It is so fascinating to see the light pass just like at an invisible road.It seems to go at the exact same hight(course) and doesn´t wobble at any time.When it goes from the next neighbour it suddenly change course 50 degrees from us(it was at collisioncourse with 2 trees 20m away) at the exact same time it starts to climb at the same speed or a little quicker.The light disappear from the eye at the next block 150 m up.2 evenings later I could see trees 30 m behind or neigh! bour house in front of us.I think that someone new that this was a very dark evening to &#34;hide&#34; the second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any sound from the objects.I clearly think that the light was very intelligent controlled. Today I belive that the light and &#34;saucer&#34; was 2 separate objects.It seems so since I could see the light all the time when the &#34;saucer&#34; should have blocked it at the end of the sighting and that it would have gone to close to the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don´t think anyone can tell me what I saw and for me this was the proof that UFO do exist.<n>

There were three bright white lights, one on each corner, with a bright silver metalic colored ring around each light that was spinning. The rings had slits in them. There was a small red light in the middle that floated down to the ground and back up. There was a strong blowing wind or breeze.. but no sound at all. Other people were pulling off the side of the road to watch it. We left as soon as we discovered that it wasn&#39;t anything we&#39;d ever seen before.
