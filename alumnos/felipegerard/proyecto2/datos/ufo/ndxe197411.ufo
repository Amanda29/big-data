Something made me look out the window across the woods behind our home.  A very large, red light was erratically bobbing up and down above the treetops heading west.  I grew up in an Air Force family all over the world, and have ridden with my father in small aircraft since I was four.  I know what aircraft look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incredible red light took its time about flying and I called my husband to come look.  After it had gone, I was just stunned and could not go to sleep.  I kept checking out the windows for anything unusual.  Then, coming down a hill about 500 yards behind my home was a very bright white light. Looked like someone was running down the hill toward my house.  Of course I woke up my husband .....who said...its probably just a hunter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later we hiked to the back of our property to just look around.  We found 3 burned areas in a pasture.Each was exactly the same size and  about 12 feet across with a badly burned little pine tree at the edge of one circle. Two circles were right together with only about 4 feet between, but the other was north and about 10 feet from the two.  The grass did not grow there for many years. We would walk back there from time to time just to stare at the bare circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year after this happened I was reading in the newspaper an account of a UFO sighting and was amazed that it too had bobbed up and down in the sky.  I knew what I saw was odd, but had never really thought of it as a UFO.  How I wished for pictures of those burned circles through all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was pregnant with daughter later born 2/16/75.  Saw two orange globes traveling from north to south in a flat trajectory.  They each had a windshield type configuration.  The globe behind was smaller.  They were approximately one hundred yards from me. I watched until they disappeared from view.  I have a BA in psychology and minor in economics.  I was married at the time of the sighting but have since divorced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/18/74 21:30|North Gower (Canada)|ON||5 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Bright flashing object with lights around the outside of it.|3/28/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35782.html|3|ndxe197411| Bright flashing object with lights around the outside of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Brian,  About 30 years ago on my parents farm about 4 miles out of North Gower on Century Road. It was late fall or early winter. I was coming back from putting straw down for our horses in the barn, I often looked up at the night sky to see the stars and the moon. This time it was around 9:30 p.m. I looked up at the sky towards the southwest and there was a kind of longish oval shaped object. It had bright flashing lights around the outside of it, there were white, red and green colored lights. It seemed to hover in one spot for about 5 minutes.While I was staring at this weird object it dawned on me this must be a UFO and I wondered if they knew I saw them or they saw me. A short while later it started to move and then just a flash of light and it was gone from sight. I wanted to tell someone really bad but waited about 5 years after and told my brother. I never told my parents as I knew they would never believe me. I met a farmer once from Montana who told me he saw a UFO also and he is the only person I know who ever told me he had seen one. Hope my recollection of events is ok, I pretty much remember it clearly as it is not something easily forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information Below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good Afternoon Brian,  1. - The location it took place was outside North Gower. North Gower is about 20 miles south of Ottawa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. - The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.The lights on the object were horizontally around the object and flashed in kind of a sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. - The object did not change shape.There was no sound heard during the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. - I am guessing 10,000 feet, hard to judge as it was dark at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. - I think I recall a whitish flash when it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. - That night it was very clear skies with stars out and quite cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. - There were no other aircraft that I could see in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps. Take care Brian  Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At about 9pm-10pm at Higgens Lake,MI I was up deer hunting with my son when we both observed an extremley bright light. It was the brightest light I had ever witnessed, it lit up the inside of the cabin just like daylight. It was hovering over the lake just above the tree tops. Everything was extremley still, almost like being in a vacum. I was extremley afraid and I told my son to put his head underneath his covers. I was afraid that whatever it was might be coming in to get us if it saw us. I to buried my head underneath the covers. After what seemed like a few minutes, I looked out the window and the object was gone.What bothers me is that we never discussed it the next morning with each other. Not untill recently have we discussed in depth what we witnessed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see son&#39;s report!!  PD))<n>

It disappeared very shortly as a national guard blackhawk was coming in for its training manuvers.  Since then we have heard more helicopters in the area which is rare out here.<n>
11/15/74 23:30|Van Nuys|CA|Teardrop|4 minutes|I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A "FALLING STAR" (A BRIGHT BALL OF LIGHT);JUST ABOVE THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.THE LIGHT JUST KEPT MOVING IN|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06132.html|6|ndxe197411| I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A &#34;FALLING STAR&#34; (A BRIGHT BALL OF LIGHT);JUST ABOVE THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.THE LIGHT JUST KEPT MOVING IN A HORIZONTAL TRAJECTORY (FROM SOUTH TO NORTH). I RAN INTO THE HOUSE. I WOKE UP MY BROTHER AND GRABBED MY FATHERS HAND HELD TELESCOPE. THE FLYING OBJECT WAS STILL CLEARLY VISIBLE TO US AS WE WENT OUTSIDE; I VIEWED THE OBJECT THROUGH THE SCOPE AND OBSERVED THE SHAPE( TEARDROPED).THE OBJECT WAS LEAVING A VAPOR(?) TRAIL BEHIND IT ABOUT ONE MILE LONG, IT&#39;S COLOR BEING SILVER.THE OBJECT MADE NO SOUND TO OUR EARS AND SHOWED NO PULSATING LIGHTS OF ANY KIND. THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT ITSELF WAS BLACK. THE MOST SPECTACULAR THING ABOUT IT WAS THE MASSIVE FRONT WINDOW HAVING A NON PULSATING BRIGHT GOLD LIGHT EMANATING FROM WITHIN!!!THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PASSENGER JET.THE SPEED WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 MPH.THE ALTITUDE WAS ABOUT A HALF MILE HIGH AND IT&#39;S FLIGHT PATH WAS STRAIGHT (FROM SOUTH TO NORTH) AND IT MAINTAINED THE SAME ALLTITUED<n> <n><n> <n><n> I GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF TEN.I WAS TWENTYTHREE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. I KNEW MANY OF THE IDENTIFIABLE AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AS WE LIVED ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE VAN NUYS AIRPORT.VAPOR TRAILS FROM &#34;NORMAL&#34; AIRCRAFT ARE WHITE IN COLOR AND CLOUDY,THE OBJECTS TRAIL WAS BRILLIANT (JUST AS A FALLING STAR TRAIL IS). THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT WAS TEARDROP WITH THE HUGE WINDOW BEING IN THE  FRONT AND THE &#34;LIGHT&#34; TRAIL COMING OFF THE POINTED PORTION (THE REAR OF THE OBJECT). MY UNCLE WAS EMPLOYED AT BURBANK AIRPORT AND INFORMED US HE HAD SEEN THE SAME OBJECT WE DID (11:30 P.PM.) ON THAT CLEAR NIGHT .THE NEXT MORNING ON THE LOCAL RADIO STATION IT WAS REPORTED &#34;THREE WHITTIER POLICEMEN SPOT U.F.O. OVER THE VALLEY!!! LATER IN MY LIFE I WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE PRESCOTT FIRE DEPT.(7.5 YEARS), AND I DID SEE THE TRIAGULAR OBJECT THAT HOVERED OVER PRESCOTT 2 YEARS AGO.<n>
11/15/74 22:00|Deland|FL|Light|8 to 10 seconds|Ultra-fast streaking soundless white light in the rural sky, car followed by dark shape in sky in same area.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72110.html|7|ndxe197411| Ultra-fast streaking soundless white light in the rural sky, car followed by dark shape in sky in same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1974, I was 20 years old, working as a correctional officer in Volusia County, Fl., outside of the county seat of Deland, at a correctional road camp/county road  maintenance facility that was actually closer to Daisy Lake than DeLand.  Myself and another county employee were standing outside having a smoke and talking,  facing north, toward the Ocala National Forest just across the highway from the road camp grounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were standing there, we both noticed a brilliant white light appearing over the treeline to the north, possibly a quarter mile off.  The light was streaking along almost due south in a perfectly straight line, emitting no sound at all, and trailing a perfectly formed &#39;tail&#39; that faded out in a very even, regular manner perhaps 70 feet behind the head.  It appeared to be no more than 200 feet up, yet it did not seem to illuminate the pine trees below it at first, then there were no trees for us to gauge by in the mid-part of the flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The visible portion of the sky, to us, was perhaps a mile and a quarter from the northern edge of the clearing we were in to the southern, and this object crossed that entire space in the space of 8 to 10 heartbeats, though we did not count it off while it happened.  We arrived at that number after comparing notes immediately afterward, when we were trying to comprehend whatever it was we had seen.  I do not know where that employee is, I actually only knew his first name, and that he was a heavy equipment operator for the County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the Ocala Nat&#39;l Forest starts just on the northern side of SR 44 and continues northward for about 50 miles, with an average width of 30 miles, and has no paved roads traversing it E to W for the first 25 miles.  There are a number of fire roads through it, and they are used by people who have cabins on the Wekiva River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which leads me to the second half of this sighting.  Fast forward to 1995, I have a lawn care business in the Orlando area, and one day I get to talking with a customer, an old school friend of my mother&#39;s, and I tell him about that night in late 1974 in rural Volusia County.  I share this with him because he was one of the lease holders for a cabin in the National Forest down by the river, and we had gone up to it to clear brush away in preparation for fire season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing when my encounter had occured, he shared an encounter with me from about that same time, though I think his was in October of 1974.  He and his family, wife and 3 kids, about 12 to 15 years old, were driving back up to the cabin over the rough dirt fire roads after having had dinner in DeLand that evening, when one of his kids almost screamed that there was something in the air over the car and behind a little way, keeping pace with them.  All 3 kids saw it through the rear window, though he and his wife did not.  He stated that it was with them for perhaps 30 seconds, and there was no mechanical failure or engine stalling during that time.  I asked him specifically, as by this time I had read a good deal about UFO&#39;s and knew that was one of the things that oftentimes accompanies near sightings.  I do know where this man is still, and can put you in touch with him if you like, but he&#39;s getting up in years now,  nearing 80, I would guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ties these two together is the year and time of year, and the fact that his cabin is only 1.5 miles away from my sighting as the crow flies, a little farther if you follow the river.  Also, the Ocala Nat&#39;l Forest plays a large, mute part in it, as I see it.  The area covered by it is vast, varied in land type, and largely inaccessible to anything but the most hardcore campers or hikers.  Look on Google Earth in Layers&gt;Gallery&gt;NASA&gt;Earth City Lights and you&#39;ll see, the forest is a large black smear through the central part of the state for miles and miles, offering plenty of secrecy and out of the way spots to land a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Round, bright white object hovers over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I were up deer hunting in the fall of what we think was the year 1974.We were at my grandmothers cottage which resided on the south end of Higgins Lake. Her cottage is about 80 feet from the shoreline.We were just about ready to go to bed when I noticed a very bright round object just sitting above the lake, about 40 feet off shore.At first glance I thought it might just be a full moon, or possibly someone out in a boat shinning a light at the cottage.The longer I watched it the more I realized it was nothing of the sort and I was a witness of something vey special.It was at about this moment that I looked at my father to see what his reaction was.The object was a very bright white light and round, it lit up the inside of the cottage. At this point I was so intrigued that I wanted to go outside to investigate it. I even had the thought that I would take my rifle with me. It was at this point that my dad told me to put my head down and try to go to sleep. Being only 17 years old I did what my father told me to do, I put my head down and I ended up falling asleep.It hasnt been untill recent years that my father and I have talked about the incident.I know this sounds a little strange that we have not spoke alot about it with each other untill now, but my parents are divorced, we did not see alot of each other then or now. When I finally brought the subject up with him at a family gathering I was amazed at what he said.He told me he felt extremely threatened by the object. That is why he told me to put my head down and go to sleep. He said he felt that it was his way of protecting me from what ever was out there. He also was pretending to go to sleep to relax me. He tells me after about 20 minutes he pulled his head out from under the blankets looked out the window and the object was finally gone.This object made no noise what so ever, but it has left a huge imprint on our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounds both sincere and credible to us.  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a crisp, cold, clear fall night. I walked out the back door to feed my dog, hurrying because it was cold and I didn&#39;t have a jacket.  I was maybe 20 feet from the house when something made me stop. (I&#39;m getting shivers just remembering this) I looked up in the sky and almost overhead, hovering in total silence, was a large saucer shaped craft.  It seemed close enough to reach out and touch, but of course it really wasn&#39;t. It had trapazoidal shaped white lights? Or windows of light?, that rotated around the craft, from left to right, skipping every other panel. The trapazoids were narrower at the top, wider at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just stood there staring at it in total shock I guess, for who knows how long. I remember screaming, dropping the dog food and running for the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I started running, it started moving, heading west at an extremely high rate of speed. Remember, I lived near Wright-Pat, had been to the Dayton Air Show, had seen fighter planes and the blue angels. I knew what a plane looked like in the sky. I had never seen anything moving at the speed this thing attained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I could get my father and air force uncle to the door, maybe a span of 20-30 seconds, it was nearly out of sight on the horizon. My uncle said he had never seen anything move so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wondered if anyone else saw anything in the sky that night in Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in life, I learned about Roswell, aliens, UFO&#39;s, and watched shows about Hanger 18 at Wright-Pat. I&#39;ve wondered if this was reverse technology in action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I just happened to be lying on a lounge chair looking up at the stars waiting for a friend to return home and there it was, a parallelogram, way up, very far 10-15 miles easy, probably stratosphere . It inverted itself and each time changed to the other color. I remember it being red green red green. I have to iterate that it was way up there. It appeared to me as 2 dimensional, as I only saw the outline of it’s shape. I did not see any substance within the lines of the shape. It appeared to be completely transparent.  It lasted what I consider a long time (30 seconds) because the tree line was relatively wide as I was in the middle of an open backyard and I caught it just as it came into sight from the east going to the west<n>

I at this time thought they were killing him and could not summon any courage to do anything but not move or be seen myself.  I thought that I could fight but there were three a seemed an eternity for me of what was my fate or what I should do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought of screaming and or jumping up a tackling one was the best idea I could think but I was petrified in fear and didn&#39;t have the courage.  Sure as shit they say the little bastard near my brother’s bed got up and walked around a came to me.  Let me get this straight to you this was like having a terrorist coming at you to do harm as far as I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He knelt and opened a strangely shaped box he was carrying at least for the 70&#39;s but still haven&#39;t seen anything like it today reached in the box to grab something.  I made a noise if I remember by accident and was beginning to cry an the &#34;man&#34; made a very unforgettable wince face ((hope you get)) maybe a grimace but the wrinkles curled and it was like he was yelled at for doing something wrong but during this time they did not speak although they looked like they were talking the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t really explain the unexplained but the one who stood in front of me the whole times head moved and pitched slightly from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway immediately after the grimace it was like a b-line to get out he closed the box immediately stood up an im telling you this was the icing on the cake they all moved like 1.  I mean it was like a the finest military coordination you have ever seen in unison they in stride not missing a beat filled out of my room abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With two more sliding into the rank from my parent’s room as they passed all together as one.  Anyway of course no one saw anything I didn’t move till light, told everyone and everyone didn’t believe yada yada same old story right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I assure anyone this was no dream and is not a situation where someone may feel confidant in saying I believe that he believes he saw something.  This was as real as anything; the sad part about it is that it really doesn’t matter.  An even if I could prove it, it wouldn’t matter anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The impression I received from my experience I had was loud and clear.  Uncompassionate beings that are weak but very methodical that do make mistakes.  If any true understanding from this country or other nations about this race and problem I would agree that it should better be left unsaid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate.

They made no noise, had no lights and ships flew side by side.  My husband and I walk right beneath them as they came over the house and down the long driveway to we got to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the U.F.O.&#39;s moved over the street they turned southward facing the Lake Pontchartrain, still side by side they took off at a great deal of speed.  I went inside and called the air base to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past two weeks I have been seeing U.F.O.&#39;s and may have had a close contact.

We were at the end of Spinny Hill road which was a quite council estate backing on to farm land. I lived about 100 yards from where the sighting took place.It was a cold and clear night with many stars visible,my freinds were struggling with the guy who was starting to get a bit heavy(we pushed him around in a wheelbarrow)when for some reason i dont know why, i looked up but instead of stars i saw a huge ring of red and green lights only a few feet above my head. iside the lights was a dark disk shape which was more of a shadow than a solid shape underneath there was a kind of dome but again it was just a kind of shape and not a solid object.It was perfectly still and totally silent, just sitting there.The whole thing was so big that it totally filled the sky. I could see  nothing else. I turned to my friends and said somthing like &#34;wow look at that&#34; but when i looked back there was nothing there. I just couldnt belive it. The whole thing only lasted  a few seconds but i will never forget it.My friends didnt see anything but it was there all the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness means a date of November 3rd, or March 11.

It looked like it was about to crash as it went straight downward just behind some trees that were three blocks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all and I thought it was a plane crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checking the news on television and newspapers there were no report of a plane crashing or any reports of this sighting.<n>

My brothers and I were listening on the CB radio (it was big back then). We heard a lot of excited chatter from people saying, &#34;My God, there&#39;s another one...&#34;  Lots of people were headed to the vocational technical center, adjacent to Oil City High School to get a better view. So, my brothers and I climbed into our family car and drove up to look too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was clearly three to four bright lights in the sky, seperated by many miles moving in odd geometric directions.  Almost as if &#34;dancing&#34; in the sky. It was a clear winter night and the stars were vivid. There were hundreds of wittnesses to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER told anyone about this. It so impacted my younger brother that he actually returned to Oil City to interview people for a book he wanted to author. He has the original taped interviews from several police officers who saw more (e.g. saucer shaped craft hovering above the Allegeheny River). He also has the notes from several other interviews.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother told me later after he began his research that the Air Force scrambled F-4&#39;s from Pittsburg to investigate (I don&#39;t know if that is factual, however).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was leaving our farm and goin on a date in town. I was 17 at the time and was going to meet my girlfriend. On the way up the gravel road I happened to notice on my left a light in the sky...not unusual really ecept this one was doing some very odd things...Odd enough for me to slow the car down and take a closer look. Another vehicle coming towards me also slowed down and I could see the people in side looking in the same direction as I as they passed...I stopped and they continued on..as the dust settled from the road I got a much better look at this craft. From my vantage point it was simply a VERY bright light light in the southern sky...it was not all that far off the ground and I noticed it suddenly throw an incredibly bright beam straight down to the ground..I thought then it was just perhaps a police helicopter. What told me different was the incredible flashes of color it suddenly began to give off...first a brilliant green fading into green then blue then yellow...not airplane lights...these were bright and faded from one to another and the speed in which they changed varied ...as I watched this thing..it stopped the beam of light it had in the fields below...and then it swiftly moved to the right....then up and then back down forming a triangle type flight path of about perhaps a mile in length...it was no more than a quarter or a half mile from my viewpoint butI figure but who can tell?....I got out of the car and I couldnt hear any sound from the direction of the object at all. As soon as it made the triangle manuver, it suddenly took off at a speed no conventional craft could attain and went straight to the horizon and disapeered. I had a wonderful view to the horizon and I would say it crossed about 20 miles in less than 5 seconds...I sat in my car amazed and completly happy...I had my first encounter with something I believe wasn&#39;t of this earth...and buddy, they got the SPEED!!! Im glad I finally got to tell someone off! iial about it..thank you Mr Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
11/1/74 20:00|Alpine|TX|Light|45 minutes|Mysterious lights in the sky around Alpine, Texas|1/27/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41601.html|22|ndxe197411| Mysterious lights in the sky around Alpine, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and two buddies (all college students) were at the edge of our small town, feeding my horse when we noticed a light in the sky, to our north at an approx. distance of 15 miles. We determined this by the objects proximity to a mountain in the same area. We noticed the light because it was moving all around but not going anywhere. It also caught our attention because there is normally very little aircraft activity in the area, due to its remote location. The light would also change colors every few minutes, from white to green and back. After observing for a few minutes, we noticed another object to our west at about the same distance, behaving in the same manner. We looked in all directions and noticed two more. One to the east and one to the south. These appeared a bit more distant. As for altitude, my guess is from 2,000 ft. for the closest two to ??? for the distant lights. Again, all were just hovering, then moving up and down, left and right. Very erratic. Finally, the lights just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my dorm and found my roomate was listening to his police scanner, as he was a part time ambulance driver. When I walked in, he asked if I had noticed any lights in the sky because the scanner chatter was all about mysterious lights between Alpine and Fort Davis. I told him &#34;yes&#34;, we had been observing them for almost and hour. On the scanner, we heard the Highway Patrol trying to get the Civil Air Patrol to send a plane out to the area to see if there was an aircraft in trouble. Only the light north of town was being investigated and it seemed they (autorities) were unaware of the other three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The scanner traffic concerning the event, finally died out and to my knowledge, nothing was done to investigate the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

At first, I thought it was a large object that was, more or less, a good distance away, until I noticed it&#39;s reflection in the water.  At that point, I realized that the object was about the size of a golf ball and about 100 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s color was white and reminded me of a small dim refridgerator light bulb. Suddenly, it stopped; hovered motionless for 3 minutes; then shot off in a parabolic arc upwards.  It started off away from me, then arced or curved upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the precise date in November 1974 is not known.
