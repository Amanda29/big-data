At the time our ages were between 23 and 30 years old. We were sleeping outside under the stars when we saw a light object travelling at a high rate of speed. It traversed the night sky from horizon to horizon in approx. 10 to 15 seconds, much faster than any plane or satellite any of us had ever seen. A few minutes later, it or another like it croosed the sky at a slightly different angle except it made an abrupt almost right-angle turn without losing or gaining speed. A few minutes after that another similar object was seen crossing but from a much different direction. When it was almost directly overhead, it came to a sudden stp. We tried to keep an eye one it, which was difficult in a sky full of stars. However it wasn&#39;t long when we noticed yet another similar object approaching from approx the same direction, but this one headed straight for the object that appeared stationary, then appeared to &#34;bounce&#34; off the object at about a 120 degree angle and keep right on going, without speeding up or slowing down. The stationary object never moved again, or at least it didn&#39;t before we all fell asleep. We all talked about it the next couple of days and we all agreed we had seen UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/20/75 16:30|Brewster|NY|Cylinder|5 sec.|Sometime during an August sunday afternoon, I spotted an object at the intersection of Rt. 684 and I84 at  Brewster, NY. This occurred|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16614.html|4|ndxe197508| Sometime during an August sunday afternoon, I spotted an object at the intersection of Rt. 684 and I84 at  Brewster, NY. This occurred in (I believe in 1975). I should add that the sky was perfectly clear. The object in question was in a stationary position above a stand of pine trees at the intersection of the two main traffic arteries. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 yards above the tops of the pines. As I noticed something in the air in close proximity , I thought to myself,  &#34;That&#39;s  just an airplane - Danbury Airport is just up the road&#34;. Turning towards my right (into the curve) I looked up again at the object with a deliberate intent of identifying the aircraft (I have always been fascinated by aircraft - and simply wanted to look at what I thought would be some variant of a Piper Cub). When I actually saw the craft, what I saw resembled a hovering 40-gallon oil drum -but I estimated it to be &#34;about the size of a contemporary Caldillac sedan&#34;. It had a series of three rings of blinking lights - the top revolving in one direction - the middle revolving in the opposite direction - the bottom going in the same direction as the top ring. I tried to maintain a &#34;back-to-the-road-back-to-the-thing&#34; visual contact - but at my last gaze - it simply vanished. You may think this is flight of fancy or mistaken identity, yet the next day, the sighting was FRONT PAGE news on the DANBURY NEWS TIMES newspaper. The article quoted a Danbury police officer who ran home after his shift an retrieved his video recoreder shortly after dusk  in an effort to videotape the movements of the object. This officer was an aquaintance of mine (since he had married a college acquaintance of mine) - his name is indelibly etched in my memory. I saw the video not long after the incident, and it simply showed a very shaky image of a &#34;spot&#34; of light. It seemed much as if you tried to take a video of Sirius with a rather shaky hand. Yet the fact remains that the sighting was confirmed by a credited news organization and a police officer. Anyone can scan the (well the way they did it then) microfisches of the NEWS-TIMES for 9/75 and find the reference, unless the material has been supressed. I had for years, kept a copy of the paper , but as time has gone by cannot find it at hand. I do know one thing is certain - that what I saw that day was NOT OF THIS EARTH<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Hovering over I-195 in Jackson, NJ. I saw them from a distance and thought they were helicopters because they were stationary. The closer I got to them they didn&#39;t move and were up maybe 100ft from the ground. As I drove under them I stopped my car. At that instant the 2 on either side went to the left and right horizontally and the one in the middle went straight up. With no sound they all accelerated out of site within a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was my first sighting. I had similar sightings in 1976 in NH and 1982 in CT.

Rest Area janitor coroborates sighting|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32419.html|7|ndxe197508| Triangular shaped craft spotted on highway outside of Fort Wayne.  Rest Area janitor coroborates sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving in my friend&#39;s pickup truck on the highway about 50 miles or so outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  It was a quiet night and no traffic on the road and we&#39;re just coasting along.  Suddenly, my friend pointed up at the sky.  &#34;My God,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#39;s a UFO.  Look up there.&#34;  I put my head out the window and sure enough, there was this big black triangular, maybe closer to a boomerang-shaped ship hovering directly overhead.  It was low, too. Maybe 40, 50, feet.  Not even as high up as a trapeze act act in a circus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the underside there was a bright red light on one side and a green light on the other side.  Both lights flashed alternately and kind of fast. There was no sound whatsoever.  Then all of a sudden, it swooped up at full speed from its stationary hovering positiion.  I mean, it didn&#39;t start slow and accelerate.  As soon as it moved it was already at full speed.  It went in a parabolic arc to a positiion about three miles away but much higher up in the sky, still in full sight and it was a clear night anyways.  So I never lost sight of the thing. It couldn&#39;t have taken more than two seconds maybe less to travel that tremendous distance.  Then it just stopped for a few microseconds and hovered there.  Then it flew really fast in a total reversal of direction and diappeared from sight.  I was dumbfounded as was my friend. We both knew there was no technology on Earth, and neither Russia nor America was anywhere close to the kind of maneuvering that we had just seen.  The silent hovering, the speed, the abrupt stop, no deceleration either, it just stopped dead, then the reversal of direction again at a phenominal speed, again no acceleration, it just took off at full speed, flew across the length of the sky and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We can never mention this to anyone,&#34; I said to my friend.  He agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both so rattled that we pulled into the first rest-area we came to.  As we got out of the truck, the little old guy, apparently the caretaker or  janitor, walked right over to us.  &#34;Well,&#34; he said, &#34;did you boys see the UFO?&#34;  My friend and I had just promised each other we wouldn&#39;t ever speak of it to anybody but here is this guy talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Yes,&#34; I said, I was really relieved that someone else had seen it. &#34;Did you see it, too?&#34;  &#34;Oh, Yeah,&#34; he said, &#34;Its been around here for a couple of hours now.  The sheriff was just here and he got a call. Went over to a local farm where they saw it flying around over their fields.&#34;  It was about 28 ago and I haven&#39;t mentioned it to very many people and the one&#39;s that I have mentiioned it to, either don&#39;t believe me or else tell me about their own experience.  But nobody else has the kind of corroboration that my friend and I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The saucer made no sound as it flew over Her house and headed north, after traveling several blocks at about 3 MPH it made a right angle turn to the west and accelerated towards the coast mountain range and then shot straight up at speeds beyond My describing.  It appeared to go into orbit in about 3 seconds.  The only other fact I can swear to is it looked exactly like the disc&#39;s Bob Lazar claimed to have worked on in area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We made camp half way through the journey. In the middle of the night, I became completely awake and looked up to my left. I saw a large disc shape craft that had what looked like portholes with, what looked like a ball of light going around it. When the light went around the back of the vehicle, the light could be seen glowing over the hull. I shook the girl I was hiking with and told her to look up in the sky. She lifted he head up and then plopped back down - not interested. As I continued to watch, I noticed there were about nine samller discs coming toward the larger disc at about the 2:00 height. They weren&#39;t lighted, but I could see them against the backdrop of stars. As they were nearly to the hull of the larger disc, it began to evaperate. As the smaller unlit disc entered into the are where the larger disc was, they disappeared from light also. We wouold also see disc shaped clouds over our heads while working on our ranch. It would often be windy and the disc shaped cloud was often close - about the height you to throw a ball - and wouold sit stationary, while the clouds were flying by. The perimeter of the disc shaped cloud was cleary defined and looked like it had energy radiating off of it. We were always happy to have them around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I walked into my yard at about 11 o&#39;clock when all of a sudden everything became extreamly bright. I looked up and witnessed a round,silent,brillantly lit silver object.It looked like as if it was the color of murcury.It was only about 50 feet max up in the air. The object had colored lights along the leading edge. The lights were not like regular fixxed lights but more like a molten color to color ring. The craft was directly above me so I had an extreamly perfect view of it.It&#39;s not something I imagined, I accually got my mother out to see it also ,but by the time I got her out to see it,it was moving off to our west.This is not something I talk about often,but it is something I remember as if it was yesterday.I don&#39;t know if anything happened that night to me but it is not my only experience.The craft was,I would have to say about at least 75 feet in diameter.I don&#39;t care who believes me but I would really like to go under hypnotism to find out happened on that occation&#34;and&#34;others.My other experiences are much more graffic.I know that there is much more to my story do to physical evidence that was left on my body.There was someone else there to prove my story on another occation also when I was accually left bleading.I sometimes feel a fobia when I am alone at night,and wonder if it is a sign of something happening,has happened,or will be happening?<n>

On its second stop, is when I stood at the edge of the porch and looked directly at it(I felt it must have known I was looking at it-becuase it stopped).

They were  elongated, triangular and three dimensional. They were utterly silent. The objects did not seem to have any orientation bias in their flight. They tumbled or flew in  any direction  as they tumbled on all axis’s. They seemed to have mass and were subject to momentum because turns appeared to be rounded  arcs instead of right angles. Starts and stops were linier and fluid. I had no way to judge scale but speeds were fast. Perhaps 5000 mph and I assume since there was no sonic booms, they were out of atmosphere.  They gave me the impression of water bugs  skating on the surface tension of water. They all shared the same colors of red, yellow and green and appeared as though they were backlit in some way. They flew back and forth in a small part of the sky  appearing to be separated into two groups and flying through each other’s positions almost like dog fighting but without any fire. Looked like they were playing.  The sighting lasted for about an hour. I never really thought much about it over the years but about 2 years ago, I saw one of the same craft spinning across the sky. Same altitude, same colors. This time it came over one horizon and disappeared over the other in a straight line. It was very fast and very high. I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I keep thinking about it every day and I am getting mildly obsessive about it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were also red running lights along the left hand side.  Since this object crossed our path at an angle, so we never saw the right hand side.

We have created an artificial date so that the case sorts to the year 1975.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was not from this Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About six years after discharge from military service,around 1974, and having ridden on many helicopters, my wife &amp; child and I were heading home from my parents house shortly after dark.  A distance of about 4 miles of country road.  We saw what appeared to be a chinook type helicopter hovering about 3-400 feet over a swampy area about 1-200 yards off the road.  An area I was quiet familiar with from hunting game in many times since my grandparents farm bordered this area on the North.  I remarked to my wife that this was indeed strange to see this sight and couldn&#39;t imagine what it could possibly be doing hovering there.  We got up opposite the craft on the highway, a somewhat remote country road and came to a halt.  We could clearly see what appeared to be rows of window lights and some colored lights like aircraft normally have at night (red etc).  I shut off the engine and lights and asked my wife to lower the window.  She complied and then the hair stood up on my neck because there was absolutely NO noise from this hovering craft 200 yards away.  I was shocked.  My military familiariety with helicopters told me that what we were seeing was definately real, and not a helicopter.  We were scared at what the craft might be, thinking UFO all the time.  I started the truck, peeled out, all the time my wife keept an eye on the craft.  We were only about 1/2 mile from our house and had a clear view even as we got out and into the house. I looked out of the East window of the kitchen, still viewing the craft and  I immediately called my parents who would be in direct line if the craft moved Easterly which it began doing. My parents ran outside of their house to see it but saw nothing.  It moved slowly Easterly for a few seconds then disappeared and was not seen again. We were all shaken by the event, and I to this day.  My mother related a story of a UFO sighting in that same general area that occurred when she was younger and living on the farm adjacent to our actual sighting.  The cows on my grandfathe! rs farm were frightened out of their wits by a craft seen by my grandfather when he went to the pasture to get them for milking.  Normally they would be at the barn on their own wanting to get milked but this day were scattered and bellering like crazy.  Grandfather never wanted to talk too much about what he saw that day except to say it was one of those UFO&#39;s.  Coincidence, anybody&#39;s guess.<n>

I immediately ran into the hours and got a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars. Through the binoculars I could see that the objects were very shiny and shaped like a top, with the pointed portion down. They were moving at a steady rate of speed, but not especially fast. There were no signs of any sort of contrail or vapor coming from them.  My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: &#34;They&#39;re tops, dad!&#34; she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large. I should also note that I am a newspaper reporter and something of a trained observer and trained to give fairly accurate descriptions of events.<n>

It was mid August 1975. I was watching over and taking care of chores at my stepfather and Mothers 22000 acre Beef cattle and Quarter horse ranch.  My stepdad had gone to our summer range at Greys lake Idaho to ride through the herd at that place.  The ranch where this event occurred is a remote Desert mountain ranch in northwestern Box Elder County, Utah.  There is not, nor ever has been any electricity at this&#34; Fort&#34; ranch.  It is isolated and even now quite primitive.  The 15th of August 1975 was very dry and very hot.  It was about 90 to 95 degrees F. at just before 12 midnite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was home, 80 miles to the east of where I was, she at our Logan Utah guest ranch, located on the Logan river..  The crickets at the Promontory Fort Ranch were chirping very rapidly outside the Bedroom window.  One can calculate about how hot it is by the speed that crickets chirp. that and I had inside-outside thermometers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying on the bed in the houses only bedroom reading a book.  The ranch cowdog  a Border collie was plopped down right next to me on the rug to the side of the bed.  I was reading by the propane powered lamp on the wall above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 22 years old at the time,and I had 20/10 vision in both eyes.  This ranch is located 20 miles south by southwest of Thiokol Chemical Corp, where several stages of Intercontinental missle boosters and their propellant was made for the United States air force in support of continental defense/strategic Nuclear weapon systems, and later on, the NASA space shuttle solid rocket boosters. (1950 to 2005)  Now known as ATK space  systems and related subsidararies<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crickets stopped chirping.  The dog started fidgeting.  The dog started whimpering then whining this eerie mournful, pitiful cry, it got intense.  The poor animal began to exhibit terror at someone or something that was approaching. absolutely panic stricken.  Then, it started to paw and dig into the wallpaper and plaster of the rooms corner.  It tore clear through to the lath and was frantically pawing to get through even that.  I could not hear any sound, except for the freaked- out dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the horses started to act up and they became terribly agitated.  The horses whinnied and snorted.  They squealed and stampeded around the round corral that they were in next to the barn.  The barn was south of the ranch house and slightly below the main house about 20 yards away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four saddle horses all of them geldings.  All of them gentle, with no previous signs of skittishness or jumpiness.  These working cow cutting horses were about as Bombproof, bullet proof dog-gentle-reliable as a mount could get.  At least before this incident.   They were desperately trying to get out of the corral and could not quite jump over the tall fence made of upright railroad ties.  I remember thinking that a rocky Mountain Cougar might be stalking my horses, so I retrieved all of t! he ranch weapons from their cache, loaded them and lay them squarely on the bed.  I short time earlier, maybe two months, a bobcat had been on the tin roof of the barn and had to be shot off, lest he sprang on the peafowl and chickens<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was another thing, none of the ranch chickens or peafowl seemed to be anywhere around and I didn&#39;t see the black cat that was usually hanging around the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was this light.  The light was a  bright red orange.  It was more than bright, it was intensely bright, it was shining in from through  the west window.  I went over to the window to look.  I was nervous and had a vague feeling of apprehension about the situation up to now, but then I saw it.  It was a saucer.  A FLYING SAUCER!  the damn thing was positioned a little over a block to the west of the house.  It shone bright red orange.  The light was just glowing right out of the steel skin or whatever metal it was.  This thing was hovering about four hundred feet in the air.  It floated silently. there were no rotors. There were no propellers.  There were no jet engines, no rocket thrusters or any visible means of how it moved.  I estimate that the craft was 300 feet in diameter.  It was fifty feet high and believe there was a dome or protrusion on top. I did not see any beings or creatures. there were no windows or portals visible. It looked exactly like the shape of two tin pie pans hooked together into classic science fiction  Flying Saucer shape.  The strong light that it emitted cast shadows from the cedar fence posts , the fence line, the sagebrush and the greasewood all around and under it.the entire desert alkalai floor was lit up bright as day under and around it .there was a large alfalfa haystack near where I first observed this ship .The haystack cast a large grotesque shadow by this things light.  Again, it made no sound, but its presence and possibly whatever emanated from it scared the hell out of the dog ,the horses and me! I was crying, sweating profusely , and ready to pee my pants all at once. what wa! s most terrifying to me was, as I looked upon it   I suddenly knew it was watching me and it was aware that   I was there. THE best description of what it was... and this is deeply ingrained upon me; a living machine. It didn&#39;t just strike me as being evil IT was evil. Malevolant not friendly or here to help mankind. also I just knew this thing was capable of killing with no qualms. I just knew this and other things about it, it communicated via telepathy , and I didn&#39;t like it. I didn&#39;t like it trespassing or being there at all and the living intelligent saucer read my mind enough to know that I would fight and resist  if I could. I may have been abducted . I do not think I was but I might have been. I don&#39;t know how long I stared at it maybe  a few minutes. suddenly it floated over the house and as it did, the tin roof on the barn and bunkhouse rattled and so did all the dishes in the pantry then it shot off to the southeast end of the ranch to the pasture we call the ros! ebushes .it is a boggy wetland of marshes cattails and deed we! t and dr y sand .     many wild rows of rosebushes grow there.it is on the shoreline of the great Salt Lake located on the north end of one arm of the lake. this Craft hovered above the rosebush pasture twelve mile southeast. It moved from overhead to the rosebushes in much less than half a seconds time. The next development was two U.S. Airforce Jets approached from the Northwest.  these two jets in formation flew over the house at 1210 a,m. so low that the jetwash stirred up dust in the yard after they went by.  Probably didn&#39;t help calm the horses down any as they passed either.  They were F-105 thunderchief Fighter bombers,  nuclear capable. before these heavy bombers got much past the house,  not even within 11 miles of the saucer, it shot right straight up and winked out. It didn&#39;t fade off into space, like you could see it fade away with distance, it reached  a speed around ten thousand feet above ground level and disappeared.  The fighters continued on around the west side of th! e lower promontory peninsula and drose up in altitude curving around the point toward Salt Lake City  or Ogdens Hill Air force base,and they too were gone.<n>

The first thing was the loud whooshing noise coming from the right side of the road.  It was dark and as I looked to the direction of the noise all the lights came on.  It was triangular or bell  shaped with the large side on the ground .  After just a few seconds it lifted off the ground and went straight up.  We watched it until it was out of sight.  The windows were of translucent type.  It was in a plowed field and about 25 feet back from the edge of the road.There was a fence around the field.    The lights were not of any particular  color, dull white.  Other passengers in the car noticed the weeds in the grass whipping around from the wind caused by the craft.  One person was a high school senior male, age 17, next was a   female age 16, next was a male age 14 and another male age 13. The lights were coming from inside the craft.  It had long oval windows near the top and appeared to be possibly 3 feet long.  I could see no other features of the craft except when it was light up, I could see the outline of it.<n>

What was peculiar about this object was that as it travelled across the sky, it would make two cicles around another (star)then travel in a straight line, make two circles around another (star) and so continued until I could no longer track the item because I had to blink since teh eyes become dry to dry to keep open.

The porch overlooked a wooded area that was approximately 150 yards away. A bright orange object appeared in front of the woods. It looked about 15 feet high and 15 feet wide. The object was round and made no noise. My friend ran inside to get a camera after watching it about a minute. I continued watching and all of a sudden it took off towards the sky. It moved at a rate of speed that was incredibly fast! It took off just seconds before my friend arrived with the camera. I am now 40 years old but I will never forget that experience. It was truly amazing and the object seemed to be able to hear and watch us. The object took off just before my friend arrived to take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I then noticed a point of light slowing descending toward the ground,it was perhaps 1 to 1.5 miles away.  I noticed it and commented about to my friend.  I thought it was strange for a aircraft to land in a corn field that surrounded the apartment building we were in that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I read in the local paper about the state patrol been called by a farmer who saw some bright lights on his land.

My Uncle is Professer ((name deleted)), he is in charge of ((name deleted)) Industries, Our largest particle accelerrater. The craft I saw was the most magnifescent sight I have ever witnessed. Their was no sound, but only a faint vibration, as the ship moved. I believe that they were looking for life forms, animal life forms. They had lights like a car but their ship could hover in the air. I could see the whole spacecraft and the top looked just like a cymbal from a drumset. It had ridgeds and no windows, that I determined on top. We were in the middle of Damrascotta Lake, and the ship moved torward the egde of the lake bed. It was beautiful , so much that I row the boat towards the craft. My sister and brother, 8 and 12 were getting very scared. Mind you, we were in a canoe. But I wanted to get a close- up of the U.F.O.  The technology was very advan- ced on the bottom of the craft. There were five to six rings of light counter revolving each other, with colored lights on the rim of the craft, which I believed were the cameras and other related items.

I glanced up at the night sky since it was a very clear night following a very warm day that August in the mid-1970s.  I saw this bright full green circular light that at first, appeared to be a star.  However, it seemed really very close as if it was only a few thousand feet high.  I estimate it was between 1500 and 3000 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was not a star, but couldn’t figure out what it was.  Momentarily, I began feeling kind of strange, almost as if I was being &#34;watched,&#34; however, I have no proof of this and realized it could have been my imagination.   There was no sound, except for the flowing creeks in the back yard.  The object was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, suddenly, it began to move very slowly toward the southeast.  It barely moved at first, and then it gradually increased in speed until it exponentially flew across the sky and over the Blue Mountains over NE Oregon, much faster than an airplane ever could.

It was undergo|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69128.html|32|ndxe197508| On August 5, 1975, at 6:31 P.M., while I was riding a bicycle, I stopped, along with my friend to watch a beautiful UFO. It was undergoing some changes in function. It was generating brownish-gray smoke back and forth among chambers/holes on its surface. The holes were about 12 inches in diameter each and formed a matrix (grid) pattern spaced 2 feet apart. In the first instance viewing the holes, there were about 25 holes (secont time: 20 holes, third time 9 holes). The craft was semi-egg-shaped, but perfectly oval, not irregular shaped not smallish on one end as with an actual egg). It was about 250 feet long and 150 feet in diameter, about the size of eight houses. It was at first about one-half mile high distant from me, and later moved on about a mile. It seemed very close and very plainly visible to me. It was travelling at the speed of about 20 mile per hour. The smoke was being transferred from each chamber hole to each other chamber hole (as if trying to hide the whole craft maybe, or to generate the propelling system function).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fine cloud or mist of semi-frozen gas, like frozen carbon monoxide or frozen oxygen, nitrogen, helium, amonia, hazy neon, or other gas covered most of the craft, but would be partly covering at an area of one percent of its total surface for one minute while the rest was covered. The uncovered surface measured about 50 feet in diameter on the first uncovering and 40 feet in diameter on the second uncovering. The third uncovering (each uncovering was actually a clearing and diminishing of the misty gas which hid that particular area)was much smaller around 15 feet in diameter. While the partly covered area was visible, I could clearly see the functionality of the craft and watch it while it underwent changes in the skin covering (part of the function of the propelling or the disguise, possibly both a propelling and a disguise). I was aware that I should stare and focus because I knew that it was an important event I was watching. If I had had a picture camera or video camera I would have had an opportunity to capture very intensly important images of the craft and its peculiarities. As I watched for about 4 minutes the craft moved over the intersection at Broad Rock Road and continued travelling but got very fast and left a white cirrus cloud as it went very quickly away. This was a very clear warm day, sunny, with some cirrus clouds around the area of the sky. The sky was blue. The temperature of the air was about 90 degrees fahrenheit. The object left a trail but not necessarily a trail that it had generated, but a cirrus cloud which might have existed with or without the craft. The clouds of smoke of which I have alluded to seemed to be generated for the purpose of causing the craft to be visible or invisible at will as if the craft could manifest itself at will. Or, possibly the craft was absorbing the earth-born water clouds for fuel of some other purpose. I include my personal opinions because I think that my observations are inter-related with the experience, but not in the sense that I creat! ed the e vent in my own mind. I actually saw these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The color was changing, but basically a very light gray and covered with a (seemingly partly frozen mist of smokey, foggy white), very much like frozen carbon dioxide clinging to the surface all over, except in certain areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The areas would change covering, and I could see and witness the change and the exposure of a very detailed mechanical system or device. There was a matrix or grid pattern of vent holes, which were about two feet in diameter each and two feet apart. These were checkerboarding (although round and not aquare)an area of about twenty feet or 40 feet in diameter and basically round, but not perfectly round due to the shifting nature of the fog covering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grid pattern of holes had a thick brownish, mixed with blackish, smokey substance flowing at the rate of approximately two gallons per second streaming from each port (hole, exhaust port) into each adjacent hole, and also the same substance was streaming from each adjacent port into each other adjacent port, so that all ports had the substance streaming both in and also out and from each adjacent port in the same manner. I can draw a picture or series of pictures dipicting these events in great detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, later, a minute, another area would be exposed on the skin (surface of the ship) and repeat the same event. I watched this series happen two times very clearly, and on the third time, the ship was being partly hidden among sirrus clouds partly and was crossing over Broad Rock Road four to six city blocks high in the sky, about the same distance high as when I first spotted the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to stare at the ship without blinking my eyes. I was not comfortable with the thought of not having a camera or of not being able to continue learning and watching. As I stared more and more, the ship was slipping into the sirrus clouds almost as if the ship were to some extent creating the clouds or some of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not want to loose sight of it. I was riding my bicycle and had stopped at the corner of Broad Rock Road, one block south of Orlando Street. In seconds, the ship sped away. I looked and stared and searched the sky in the direction it was travelling, and I was disappointed that it had vanished or gone out of my sight. I have never gotten this off of my mind at any time since then, except for a few days at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think about it veru often, every few days or weeks. I tell people about it, draw pictures and make estimations regarding the activities of the mechanical parts. Maybe this was a cover, maybe a propelling factor, a disguise, or a cooling system. This was on a late summer day. This could have been engines, exhausts, or gas exchange for changing the dimensional atomic makup of the density factor in apparent spacial configuration. I have developed a series of (plans), which depict the apparent configuration of the atomic and subatomic properties. It is theory and hypothetical, but it explains the phenominum in this way. When I speak of emmiting lights, I am speaking of the fact that I saw light from it or light reflecting from it. I did not see any things that would be defined as headlights or metallic fixtures. But, I do seem to possess amazing clarity as to the possible makup of the ship. If you want to discuss this further, contact me at 804-((number, name, and addresses deleted))<n>

It involved a landed UFO at a small park, in broad daylight, on a summer day, within sight of a main north-south highway, just north of Warren, OH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened while returning to Warren from a day trip to Geneva on the Lake, driving my new, Miami Blue VW Beetle, which I had received as a graduation gift a few months before.  I wanted to treat my friends to a ride up to lake Erie to my aunt and uncle&#39;s summer rental house for a day of fun and show off my ride in the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning to Warren that afternoon, early to mid afternoon, my car was literally slowed to a stop, turned around, and &#34;driven&#34; for me about 150 yards to a place beside a small lake which I recollect to be the Willow Lake area.  I recall it being near the intersection of Grand Army of the Republic Highway and State Route 45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft, if that was what it was, was very large.  I recall it being silver, but whoever was in charge of that little shindig probably had the power to make me think it was a giant cinnamon bun if they so choose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember only parts of the event but I recall two of my friends screaming in sheer terror, blaming me for their predicament and recalling numerous other people in and out of their cars at the site for the same purpose as us.  Whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we were heading back down route 45, on a fine Northeast Ohio summer day, in my new car, on the way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in broad daylight.  There were many people. I&#39;m either blocking what happened or I really can&#39;t recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us never got together again all at once ever again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was about 8 or almost 9 months pregnant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ws almost dark and I headed home which was swampy and more isolated then on Fort Johnson Rd. James Island, S.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident was in 1975.  I saw something hovering over the swamp, it was tremendous and had bight lights all over and around the top of a hugh disc, rotating around and around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remembe a lot after that but I think I stopped the car and got out to go and look at the object.  I must have been there about 2 or 3 hours.  I think the object was glass or opaque in color and I remember that I was not afraid as many people say they are.  I don&#39;t remember a lot more and then I was back in my car and it was really dark about 6 or 7pm.  I had lost about two or three hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think much of it at that time and went home.  I did not feel drained, tired confused or anything.  I did not feel threatened either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had our daughter and called her laughingly our little alien child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone so there were no witnesses that I know of concerning this object.  I think the object had an ability of letting us see it and then some sort of way of not being seen.  This was the only time I ever saw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty years later we took some photos of the little house we owned out on the island and walmart developed them.   A disc like object was seen in the left corner of the house.   I questioned Walmart and they said it was not any of their equipment, and they asked if my car window was down, and yes it was.  I still have the photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired nurse and also have a background in sociology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a strange event and I rarely talk about it, and I do not laugh at those saying they have had encounters.

When we all for some unknown reason looked to our right and witnessed a star dancing in the sky.  It appeared to just dance, back and forth up and down, then it came closer.  Suddenly, it took off in a westerly direction, as we chased it.  Two years later I would witness another event similar in nature in Georgia.  While on bivevac training and standing guard with a Private Rodriguez, I saw a star dancing in the sky, similar to the one I seen, as stated previously.  I related this story to Pvt. Rodriquez and wouldn&#39;t you know it.  The star did the exact same thing.  With one exception, I ran to report it to my drill sargent, he thought i was a lunatic.  When I stepped out of his tent some 10 meters away, a stealthy black object appeared above me.  See my second reporting to finish this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One fireball, starlike. We were Mid teens.  Again, just out to view the sunset.<n>

Next thing I knew 2hrs had passed...I was sitting in the garage by myself. there was a terrible thunderstorm. my boyfriend was yelling for me,I went to him....He asked me where I had been, I told him as far as I know I was in the garage....He sad he had looked for me there already. We never talked about it again<n>

Traffic was light and I was going 35-40 mph. It was mostly cloudy with occasional patches of blue sky. I glanced over at the golf course and saw through a break in the clouds a large, gold colored cigar shaped flying object leaving a smoke trail. It was off in distance but was traveling horizontal from north to south. After watching it incredulously for a couple of seconds I looked away to pull off on the side of the road. After I got the bike stopped I looked back to where it had been but there was nothing there anymore. I watched for  couple of minutes to see if I could see it in any other breaks in the clouds with no luck. When it became obvious it was gone I got back on my bike and rode on to work. I didn&#39;t report it or tell too many people what I had seen. I was 23 at the time and taking time off from college. Shortly after that I went back to college and finished my BA Psychology. That, and another incident, spawned a lifelong interest in UFOs. I am a MUFON Field Investigator and have been a MUFON state section director.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It&#39;s a really interesting account though and it should be on your books.  The date is an estimate based on what he told me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of them were in a band as teenagers and often played late into the night at friends&#39; houses.  On that particular night (and date is just an estimate) they were riding their bikes from one house to the other person&#39;s house early in the wee hours and they had stopped to take a break, looked up in the sky and saw this big, ovoid shaped thing that was glowing all around, shimmering with an irridescent glow.  They were staring at it for a minute and then one of them said something like &amp;quot;you see that?&amp;quot; and the other said &amp;quot;yeah - you see it too?&amp;quot; as if each one thought they were imagining things.  All of a sudden, the object emits a brilliant flash of light which lights up the whole sky as if it was daylight and disappears.  Then they continued on their way although, when my cousin tells the story, it sounds like they continued on their way without ever talking about it, or like there are gaps in his memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After he told me this about a year ago, he ran into the friend again and brought it up.  The friend didn&#39;t even remember that they had been together at first (or wasn&#39;t sure).  This would be over three decades later, so I was surprised it wasn&#39;t something they particularly talked about.  I also should mention Sunland crosses little Tujunga Canyon and River which is not far from Big Tujunga Canyon and Tunjunga CA where there were apparently a number of sitings in the 1970s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if he could add anything to the story if you contact him.  I will put my information below if you want more info.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although it was around 3:15 am, I was not under the influence of alcohol or any other substance(s).  My baby son was sleeping in the back seat of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rural areas are very dark at night, so I immediately noticed a bright light in the sky to my left.  Although it was the brightness of the light which first caught my eye, I couldn&#39;t believe the size of the object - at least the length of a couple of football fields.  It was kind of saucer shaped, very long and the entire object glowed reddish-orange.  It seemed to be in a kind of haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Completely &#34;freaked-out&#34;, by now I had stopped the car.  The craft was gigantic, glowed orange and did not move, but just hovered in the sky.  My father was a pilot and I was familiar with many different types of aircraft and I &#34;knew&#34; this was no earthly aircraft.  I just stared at it and remember feeling completely terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stared at it, it kind of &#34;sucked up into itself&#34; and disappeared within a split second, leaving a &#34;light trail&#34; as it left.  If I doubted what it was before it took off, I certainly knew, without a doubt, what it was afterward as I knew no earthly aircraft takes off that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid to notify local law enforcement as I assumed (small town) I would not be taken seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked over to my left were hydro (power) lines run behind apartment buildings, and that is when I saw the first ufo, it was bell shaped, and had a single light moving (like a spot light) on the dome of the ship.  I was slowly and silently glidding over the hydro lines, I kept watching in amazement, then the second one came into sight doing the same as the first, I could also see small objects twirling around the hydro lines then going up to the ship, then back to the hydro lines.  I watched for quite a while, it was very quiet out, dark sky, I am not sure if the moon was out.  Then I happened to look up and slightly over to the right, and there was a ufo right above the house.  Not a sound came from it, the body of the ship was a silver colour and the dome was a smokey green colour (same colour that comes out of a puff mushroom when you step on it), the ship was huge, I could not see any sky. My heart started to pound in my chest, I was never so scared in my life as I was at that moment.  It has been almost 30 yrs since I saw the ufo&#39;s, and I can still remember as if it happened yesterday, I will never forget for as long as I live.  I did wake my brother up, but by that time the ufo&#39;s had gone, and of course he did not believe me and still does not to this day.  The next day there was a report in the newspaper about a sighting in another city on the same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
