My sister and I who were six or seven years old at the time (twins) were playing in the barnyard away from the adults.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She and I were sitting on the barn gate when I noticed in the distance over the corn fields a bright light that was coming our way.  It wasn&#39;t in a hurry and I was anxious to see what it was.  I continued playing and kind of kept an eye on it&#39;s movements.  The closer it got the more I could make it out and it had the most beautiful flowing &#34;gown&#34; that looked luminescent and changed colors as if it were shading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just to the left of me about 30 feet off the ground when I thought that it was an angel but got the feeling that it wasn&#39;t exactly friendly.  As it came directly in front of me I held my breath so as not to be noticed hoping that it would just go away!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued passing by me, and then it stopped, turned it&#39;s head sharply and looked directly at me!  It did that for what seemed like an eternity but was only a few seconds.  I saw its eyes, the color of its hair, its face and there was no smile.  It felt sinister.  After it was done sternly looking at me it continued on its way passing over several farm houses until I could no longer see its glowing dress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I ran to the porch where everyone was sitting and they also noticed the bright light but thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see that being on that warm summer night in Illinois?  I really need an answer.<n>

This is something very special that I encountered and feel a real remourse for the alien forms that I witnessed, to this day I feel very sad when I see posters and key chains etc. made of these. I am not going to get into the fact that I have talked to very few people about this, it is obvious that when someone at such a young age can actually remember in detail what really happened on this day in Hoquiam, Wa., it&#39;s hard to share something like this to just anyone! I had no communicaations at all with these two forms, just the fact that I was very fortunate to witness such a wonderous sight.<n>

I was only 10 years old at the time, and my Father, Mother, aunt and uncle and cousin went to an old drive-in movie theatre just outside of Atlanta.  This drive-in had bleachers at it similar to what you would see on a small sports field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and i were watching the movie from the bleachers while our parents were still in my uncle&#39;s car when a boy on the top row of the bleachers yelled out, &#39;&#39; look, there goes a flying saucer!&#39;&#39; we all looked in the direction he was looking in and there was this brightly lit white object that looked like the lid to a round candy dish with a dome like thing on top. This thing was moving very rapidly just above the tree line and disappeared below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think about it after it disappeared and turned around and turned my attention to the movie again until the same kid that first saw it yelled, &#39;&#39; here it comes again!!! but this time this thing was coming directly toward us!  Every child on those bleachers including me and my cousin ran for cover.  We searched frantically for our parents but could not find the car as it was quite dark, so we ran into the building that housed the projector booth and the snack bar.  I told my cousin to look out and see if it was gone, and he said he didn&#39;t see it, so we stepped back outside and to our horror, this thing was directly overhead!   We ran again trying to find our parents in the car, and to my great relief i heard my Mom yelling, &#39;&#39; we are over here!&#39;&#39; and we ran to the safety of our parents and the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing looked quite different from the way it did the first time we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had slowly rotating white lights on it like rectangles stood on end.  Nothing else could be seen but the lights in that circular pattern.  It was about 1,000 ft. AGL and looked to be about 30 ft. in diameter. This thing was dark in the center.  It moved slowly and came from the northwest and moved on toward a southeasterly direction until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father was in the U.S. Air Force for 6 years and i asked him what that thing was, his reply, &#39;&#39; I don&#39;t have the faintest idea.&#39;&#39;   I was horrified by this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen another UFO. I would very much like to know if anyone else has saw a UFO that looked like what we saw that night back in June 1964.  As frightning as this was, i would love to see that thing again now that i am a trained observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone could let me know what this thing was, i would sincerely appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My witness count is just an estimate, it is possible that over 50 people could have seen this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

I think the area is called Dowden Terrace, several streets back from Seminary Rd in the residential section.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost dusk I around 1965 or 64 early summer, I was at my cousin’s house, and she wasabout 7 or 8.  And as I just discovered about a year ago my little brother was there also, although we never talked about it until just recently.  I was shocked to hear him explain the same sighting.  Anyway we my cousin and I were playing in the front yard.  Our parents, my Aunt, my father, and I think my Uncle (not sure if he was there) were in the garage talking with it opened.  They were approx 100 to 125 feet away, just from the corner of the front yard to the garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden there zoomed in from the sky, (we were facing Chestnut Place road-looking towards John Adams school—I think that would have been looking almost northeast about 2:00 into the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was saucer shaped silver with a smaller dome on the top.  I remember windows all the way around the dome, the bottom of it was circles of colored lights like a spinning top, like a child’s toy of red/green/blue/white.  And as it hovered over we went to the most corner of the yard to look up at this thing.  It did not make a sound and it moved fast and quick and then kind of moved closer to us all the time the lights were going like that toy does of blue/green/red…etc on the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (I only thought it was me and my cousin at the time) ran to the garage to get our parents, my aunt and my father.  We told them there was something in the sky come quick, come quick.  They finally came out and my cousin remembers my aunt saying “Jesus Chxxxst, what the hell is that?   It then kind of moved down a bit, in a kind of dipping jerky fast move, then, zoomed towards John Adams school area up into the sky, still those colors moving like a child’s spinning top, on the bottom of it and making not one bit of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and I have talked about this for years and my aunt, but it wasn’t until this past year that I found out my brother was there with us.  He would have been 3 years old if I was 5 and my cousin was about 7 or 8.  It has freaked me out since.  When I found out he was there it really freaked me out.  I know this was not our imagination especially when my brother began to say that he remembered that same thing that I was talking about.  I stopped talking, and asked him to describe what he saw, to see if he would say the same thing.  He did in fact; describe the exact same thing above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else seen this around that timeframe and area?  I could be off in my years, I could have been 4 but then that would have been in 1964 early summer.  Someone surely had to have seen this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to enter the info on the UFO page and I remembered two things because of 2 of the questions.  It definitely glowed like white haze around the whole thing and my cousin has always felt loss of time and she always felt we stood there much longer before we ran to get our parents and looked up at that thing in a trance like state, but I have never felt like that.  She was much older and I was only maybe 4 which would have made my brother 2 and her about 7.  Oh yea, my dad and aunt have already passed away only us three are here to confirm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was sitting in front of a very large pane glass window in my partents home. heard a whoooshing noise and the object made the entire window, each pane shake almost to the point of breaking the glass it was that close as I sat directly in front of the widow working on a dress for my home ec class. not only that but the tall grass swayed back and forth as the &#34;the dull gray, no lights, almost cartoon shaped object stayed and spunn&#34; my biggest fear was that it would break the window and my parents would not believe me. If the window had been open I could have touched it but knew better because the rate of the spinning would have burned my finger.  I ran outside and it took off at a speed that I have never witnessed before.

Even in the clear desert air a searchlight such as those used at grand openings can be discerned. As I focused on the light it resolved into a V-shape. I could see six points of light and I thought it was six seperate ships but now I believe it might well have been one triangular craft with six light showing. It traveled from a little right of straight up to off the horizon in about 5 seconds. This occured over Davis-Monthan AFB and the craft(s) travelled south toward Mexico. Having been raised in the Air Force and knowing a lot about aircraft, I am sure that it was travelling at least ten times as fast as anything we had in the air at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Suddenly , what looked like a star began moving across the sky very fast in a straight line.  Another &#34;star&#34; in the same area began moving in a different direction but this one was zig zagging at impossible turns. Then a third one from again the same area began yet another direction and blinking on and off.  I dropped the cigarette I was holding and when I looked down to pick it up,, all the other boys began yelling at the same time &#34;Did you see that?&#34; They were all very excited and I looked up immediately but only saw what I have already described. I asked what they were talking about and they all began to chatter that one of the &#34;lights&#34; shot a red beam out from it to a light in the sky that it was passing (that light or star never moved). I am now 51 years old and really can&#39;t remember the specifics of the event like the exact year or month.  I do remember some of the boys with me and I am sure if located they would confirm my story and I also remember listening to the radio at breakfast the next morning and hearing a brief statement that UFO&#39;s were reported over the city of New Orleans the previous night (Destrehan is not far from New Orleans)so someone else must have seen what we saw. I have seen satalites and grown up as airplanes turned into jets.  I have never again seen anything able to move that fast or manuver the way these objects did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The three points of light were approximately 1/16&#34; at arms length, the large stationary light about 1/8&#34;.  My brother and I were high school age at the time.  Our Father had been a pilot and member of the Civil Air Patrol previously and we had read his manuals as well as military infantry training manuals in which one is taught to use finger/hand widths for spotting targets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/64 21:30|Anchorville|MI|Disk|3 miutes|I saw into disc with clear openings under it, chased by police at tree top level, then hesitating directly above my home.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29694.html|12|ndxe196406| I saw into disc with clear openings under it, chased by police at tree top level, then hesitating directly above my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was preparing for bed with no lights on in the room I shared with my younger brother one night, and while pulling my sweatshirt up over my head, I felt a sudden surge of what I can only describe as something like an electric current run through my body starting at my scalp and flowing down all the way to my feet. As I quickly removed the shirt, I noticed flashing red lights reflecting off the upermost branches of the fruit trees outside the high open window at the top of the bedroom wall. I could see the bottom of the eaves, and they were in shadow just above the top of the window. As I was wondering what angle the red light was coming from, the rounded leading edge of what I would see later was a saucer shaped craft slowly came into view from the north, directly above the house, moving away from me very slowly to the south, blocking out the stars as it went. At that point I was less than 30 feet from the bottom of the saucer, about 8 to 10 feet to the west of it&#39;s center. At several poimts around the rim of the vehicle were bright bluish-white lights that blinked slowly on and off. When the lights were on, they were a solid field of light with no filaments or bulbs visible,even as close as I was. When they went off, there was nothing in that spot, as if the skin of the ship had instantly covered them over.It made absolutely no sound, but my German Shepherd was throwing a fit in the back yard, as it was moving directly toward him. As I realized this was something out of the ordinary, to say the least, I began to notice details on the bottom edge and body of the craft. It was moving so slowly that it took 3 or 4 seconds to move about 15 feet. That was when I first saw the detailed edge of a strangely shaped window in the underbody of the craft. It took perhaps another second or so before I could actually see into the interior. All this time, I was frozen in my tracks, unable to move. I was so frightened by what I was seeing, that I wanted to run and warn my Mother of what was happening.! But the harder I tried to move, the more I realized that I couldn&#39;t. The craft moved very smoothly and steadily, not wobbling in the least, and the flashig red lights reflected off it&#39;s surface as if it were made of polished chrome. When it reached a point directly above the dog, he suddenly became quiet. I could see at that time that it was perhaps 30 feet or so across. Within a second or so it was no longer right above me, and I found I could finally move, so I began screaming at the top of my lungs. I remember my brother waking up at that point, and I ran out of the room without saying anything to him. I met my Mother in the hall, and told her what had happened. She said that the lights were from a police car she had seen stop in front of the house. I finally convinced her that there was more to it than that, and she went to look out the back door. I was so shaken up that I couldn&#39;t go with her. She returned and told me that she had seen the craft moving slowly away to the south, when it quickly accelerated away faster than a jet, and disappeared to the south. The police report appeared in the local newspaper the next day, saying the officers had chased a flying disc down our road to a point directly in front of our house, where it suddenly slowed and turned southward, flying exactly over our home, then sped off in a southerly direction at incredible speed. As we lived quite close to Selfridge Air Force Base, both my family and the officers were well aquainted with the different types and speed of military aircraft at the time, so when they say incredible speed, they mean it. That incident so traumatized me, and my Mother, that I blocked it out of my mind for years afterward, and even now, I can&#39;t bring my mind to recall certain details of what I saw. Slowly over the years, I&#39;ve been able to remember a little more, and a little more, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I want to remember who or what I saw inside that ship, and I know there were certain details about the edges of the windows that ! absolutly astounded me for some reason, but my memory will not yet allow me to know these things. I truly hope that someday I will. This was my first of several related incidents, and by far the most documented, what with police officers as additional witnesses, so I decided to report it on this website. After keeping it to myself all this time, it feels good just to know it has finally been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I lived in rual west Tennessee. It was summer and we had no air conditioning, so we slept with the windows up. We had just gone to bed around 9 p.m.. My brother and I shared a room and we had not gotten to sleep yet. We noticed in the upper right-hand corner of our bedroom window that there was a strange redish-orange glow. It was gradually getting larger and larger. As we looked out the window, we saw a large sphere shaped object slowly desending. It seemed to be going down into a pasture between our house and my uncle&#39;s house about a quarter mile away. This thing  glowed with redish-orange light so bright that it light up our room like it was daylight. It took around ten minutes for it to disappear...then every thing was dark again. My parents also saw this and my uncle&#39;s son,whose bedroom faced our house. We went out the next day to see if we could find any sign of the object,but found nothing. There may be a logical explanation for this,but I have not as yet found one. It still haunts me to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It measured about the size of a quarter at arms length and had the same reflected appearance  as the moon during daylight hours.

And I suppose it could have been, except that it came back out from the cloud to its previous position.  This motion was repeated twice again, then it failed to reappear.  I had the distinct impression that it was trying to hide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the clouds were small, I watched for perhaps better than ten minutes, waiting for the object to reappear on the other side.  It never showed.  The objects behavior has stayed in my memory for over  40 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were driving northbound on US-1 in the early AM in the dark before sunrise in the vicinity of what is now known as Pinecrest. In the 1960&#39;s, it was a semi-rural area.  My dad spotted what he thought was an aircraft to the north of their position.  He said it was a very bright white light that stayed in one position.  He assumed that it was an airplane with its landing lights on heading for Miami International Airport. When it didn&#39;t appear to turn he was afraid that it may be making an emergency landing on the highway! As my mom and dad became concerned, the object shot away to the west at incredible speed. My dad said that it left like a bullet shot from a gun, leaving only a line in the sky. This was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I lived below a place called Peavine Mountain.  The day was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky.  As I was playing outside in the yard, I noticed an object flying along a range of hills.  As I watched it, I noticed that it traveling extremely slow.  I thought to myself that this could not be a plane because it was moving too slow, and it could not be a helicopter because it made no noise.  As it got closer, I noticed that it was shaped like a disc.  What really made it seem so strange is that this saucer in the sky was luminous, it glowed like a light bulb in the sky.  I sat there in my yard and couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of this object.  It approached a big hill and disappeared behind it.  I looked to the other side of the hill to see if it was going to appear on the other side.  All of sudden, I saw a huge silver streak go across the sky, like this thing took off at a tremendous rate of speed.  This was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before or since…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/11/64 21:40|Dedham/Westwood line|MA|Circle|uncertain|sighted a huge, bright, full "moon" without typical moon markings directly above the roadside.|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33163.html|20|ndxe196406| sighted a huge, bright, full &#34;moon&#34; without typical moon markings directly above the roadside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday,6/11/1964 was a beautiful clear night.  Driving north on Rt. 128 a short distance before the Rt. 109 exit, I glanced ahead to my left, at what I thought was a huge bright full moon a short distance above a small pine tree on top of a rock formation.  I was mesmerized by the fact that it was so large and bright and so close to the roadside.  My fascination turned to terror when I realized that there were no markings on it.  I also, couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I was being watched.  I sped up, desperately wanting to get away and yet, also wanting to take the next exit,(Rt. 109) back to the previous one, (Rt. 1) to return and see it again.  But, I was a young woman, driving alone and shaking like a leaf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was deep in thought,puzzling over what I had just seen, when, a few miles away, where the trees and foliage by the roadside no longer blocked my view, I saw the real full moon on the horizon, markings and all.  At my family&#39;s behest,I did not reported it to the police. I was a teacher in the local high school in my home town of Arlington and they were afraid that I would be held up to ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of weeks later, I heard a radio interview with a man who was the head of the UFO group in Ma.  I contacted him and submitted the form he sent me.  His first name was Raymond, but I cant remember his last name.  I never heard from him, after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December, of 1964,(I remember it as the final Sunday issue of the Boston Globe for the year,) a full page spread was run concerning UFO sightings in N.E. for the year. It was stated in the article that 3 people in Hingham, Ma. had reported that very same sighting, on that date. So. at least I was vindicated before my family, who were skeptics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never forgotten my experience and have spoken of it many times over the years. But, I still have difficulty dealing with the attitudes of those who listen and look at me askance.  I know what I saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for electrical effects...from the time I was a small child, during an electrical storm, I get an odd sensation in my chest, a reaction I guess and I felt that same sensation as I drove past that object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dedham/Westwood, MA)  This sounded so much like what I experienced when I was 7 yrs old I thought an additional report would be supportive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 8:00 pm.  I was in the back yard of my home in the Auburndale section of Newton, MA, with my parents and 5 yr old sister.  We were having fun watching and catching fireflies before getting ready for bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, the night sky starting to fill with stars.  My neighbor had built a telescope to look at the moon with me and I was looking forward to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the whole yard filled with bright, white light.  I looked up to the south east and saw a huge white &#34;moon&#34; that looked like it was perched on the tree tops.  It seemed as big as a house.  I don&#39;t recall the chronology of the rest of the evening&#39;s events, but this is what happened:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became intensely frightened when I saw the white moon.  I realized it couldn&#39;t be a moon since I saw no craters.  My mother screamed and carried my sister into the house.  My dad hugged me and we joined our telescope-making neighbors, watching, wondering what we were seeing, he didn&#39;t seem frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 other neighbors joined us and one man said it was a UFO.  I knew what that was.  It remained in the same place for about 20 or 30 minutes and then went straight up and disappeared, very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I am the only person still alive that was in my backyard that night.  I know my mom spoke to other parents about it and one person/child there was in school with me.   But nobody from my grammar school remembers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t recall the exact date, only what grade I was in and time of year, firefly season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I read the posting for 6/11/64, it sounded very much like what I saw and the date and time of year fit.  The areas of Dedham, Westwood and Newton are close enough that two events are entirely plausible.<n>

This disc was orange in color like the moon at certain times and had dark circles with in it, almost looking like craters on the moon and it did not have a tail like those of comets. I can&#39;t say how far up in the sky it was but it seemed to be moving rather slowly, maybe twenty to thirty miles per hour, because I watched it for a minute or two as it moved across the sky. I was only ten but I know what I saw and will never forget it. I wish that I could be hypnotized and draw a picture of it because like I said I will never forget what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I reported it to my parents ONLY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a sunny summer day in the Italian town where I was rised, and I was playng ball in my grandparents garden, when I saw whith the corner of my eyes somthing big flyng. I raised my eyes and I got stunned : a discus shaped object was flyng with no audible sounds or lights. Attached under it had 3 tanks-alike things, and the top was shaped as a tower with round things like windows or lights ( NOT lighting ). The object flyed slowly, not shaking and had a path. It disappeared behind a nerby house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immeditly reconnised the object as an extraterrestial flyng sourcer as the Italian press called them: At that time the word UFO was NOT in use. They was called invaders and abducers, so I was terryfied since I tought they saw me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the object was seen by other in town and photographed in the local paper, with no description.

A father and son were driving south from Montrose Colorado early one morning to go to work in a Uranium mine in the town of Uravan, Colorado. The son was trying to sleep in the back seat and the father was driving the car. About 20 miles south of town the father saw an odd and brillant light coming from the west over a ridge. (This highway was two lane and in a deep valley the entire distance.) He continued driving wondering what the light could be as the Sun rises on the opposite side of the valley and a plane couldn&#39;t be a light source of this intensity. He drove for a short time longer and at that point the Light broke from behind the mountain and was of such an intensity as to be uncomfortable to look it. He stopped the car and brought it to the attention of his son who had already noticed the light. They got out of the car and paused in total wonder and stark fear as to what this thing could be. It didn&#39;t fit anything they had ever experienced or heard of. At this point other cars had stopped in both lanes of traffic as others became involuntary witnesses to its sheer power. They described the thing as being (roughly oval shaped) of an intense Blueish hue, much like a welder arc but no definite form could be made from it as the light was so bright, sharp images were impossible to see. It filled the entire valley with its light, making the landscape and surrounding hills totally visable. It traveled without sound and at a very slow pace in a West to East direction. Proceeding across the valley and eventually was obscured to vision by the ridge opposite of its entry. They said it was very large and low over the mountain but never gave an estimate as to size. As it escaped from direct view its glow was seen for many minutes as it lazily departed the area. They were both left with a feeling of absolute astonishment to have seen something so unearthly but glad that others had shared this experience. The motorist all spoke for a few moments and had no conclusions as to what it could have been. This father and son only worked at Uravan for a short time after this event but were always unnerved to drive that stretch of road (in darkness or daylight from that point on) dreading a second encounter with this &#34;Thing&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

About 100 feet above me was a huge hovering craft with a &#34;Capitol&#34; shaped dome on top and the same shape on the bottom separated by a ring.  It hummed as the top dome spun in one direction and the bottom in another.  It was as clear as day.  Each half of the craft had rows of lighted windows.  I had never heard of UFO&#39;s before, so there was no preconceived notion to create interpret anything in my mind.  Awestruck, I looked back into the house, where I saw a friend about to exit and called him to come see.  As he stood next to me and looked up, I asked him, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;, pointing to the craft.  He answered affirmatively and described what I was seeing.  Thirty seconds later, it moved off at astounding speed directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

BUT JOE GOT THE PIC DEVELOPED FIRST OR MY FATHER WOULD HAVE BEEN FAMOUS INSTEAD OF JOE.WE HAD THE ORIGINAL PIC BUT IT WAS LOST, OR STOLEN, BUT PERHAPS WAS WORTH A FORTUNE. MY FATHER WAS GOING TO TELL ME AL! IENS ARE REAL AND THAT THE USA GOVT IS HIDING EVIDENCE, AND BORROWING ALIEN TECHNOLOGY. HE ALSO SAID A BLUE LIGHT IN THE 1960&#39;S WENT UP IN THE SKY AND THAT IS WHEN I SAW THE UFO, JUST AROUND THAT TIME. I AM WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THIS. I AM TRYING TO FIND SOME EYEWITNESSES. BUT ALL HAVE GROWN UP, MOVED, DIED. I REMEMBER SOME NAMES. I HAVENT LOCATED THEM YET. i AM STILL LOOKING. i BELIEVE IN ALIENS, SHIP, ALIEN TECHNOLOGY, BECAUSE MY FATHER WOULD NOT LIE TO ME.

I was about 14 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pre-dawn night was clear and cold with no moon.  Gathering my last newspaper bundle, I noticed the roof of the house across the street, was brighter than all other roof-tops...a kind of glow..almost a fluorecsent white-ish blue aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the roof of this house, (I remember thinking perhaps there was a re- placement of new shingles), when the left-hand edge of the roof began to darken.  I began to walk towards the house, and noticed that the house roof-top to the right began to brighten. I arrived in the front lawn of the first house, and could see that the &#34;glow&#34; was moving from left to right, very slowly.  There was not a strong definition line to the edge of this &#34;glow&#34; as it moved from house #1 to house #2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now being positioned some few feet away from these houses, I could discern a subtle sort of &#34;beam&#34; of light emanating from the roof-tops, and travelling into the sky at about a 70 degree angle.  The &#34;beam&#34; reminded me of how a light beam appears when shining a flashlight into the night sky, only larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed this light moving slowly to cover most of the roof of house #2, it began to fade, (not click-off), rather quickly and was gone.  I stared intently at the star-lit sky for several minutes to see where the light was coming from.  I was not able to see any object, aircraft or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall if I perceived the light beam reaching the ground between the houses as it travelled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting/phenomenon to my route manager, as well as my parents and some other folks.  I remember being frustrated that no one seemed to be interested, and my story being received with funny looks and jokes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, years since witnessing this unexplained sighting, and being college educated, I&#39;ve yet to receive any plausible, scientific explanation for what occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve travelled past these houses several times over the years, to see...to find...I don&#39;t know what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that I had to report, officially, to someone what I saw and would welcome qualified inquiry and discussion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
