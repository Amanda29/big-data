7/30/58 22:00|Randallstown|MD|Triangle|4  minutes|Two triangular slow,silent lowflying objects,each with three white lites,were seen in mid-l958 over Balto.Co.,Md.by hundreds.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42840.html|1|ndxe195807| Two triangular slow,silent lowflying objects,each with three white lites,were seen in mid-l958 over Balto.Co.,Md.by hundreds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after the recently-lauched&#34;Telstar&#34;satellite passed overhead during the summer of 1958,and fell below the horizon,two utterly silent triagular objects moving parallel close together in tandem,each with a point of white light at each corner,passed directly overhead,blocking the background stars,each the width of a full moon,at what appeared to be low altitude,moving slowly south to north,which was followed the next day by an article buried in the inside pages of the Baltimore newspapers claiming that &#34;hundreds of persons reported seeing UFOs over northern/northwestern Baltimore County the previous night.&#34; These two objects were not aircraft,since completely silent yet low in altitude,but were obviously under coordinated controlled flight,and moving too slowly to be supported by aerodynamic lift. These identical observations were made by me(about age 9),my then best friend,age 11,and his mother,then about age 45. She is the one who found the newspaper article the next day,which I have never taken the time to attempt to relocate since then,but which forever impressed this sighting in my memory,since independently confirmed and shared by many other complete strangers in the area written up in the Baltimore Sunpapers(or News American). The date and time is approximate,but was approximately the height of summer,l958. I have never had any other sighing before nor since,and did not connect it to UFOs per se because back then they were described as&#34;flying saucers&#34;,and I had never heard of triagular UFOs,only discs or alleged cigar shapes, until the l990s,when photos of the triagular objects over Belgium and elsewhere first came to my attention. Unlike some other reports of triangular sightings,however,there was no central light,but instead merely one small white lite at each apex of each triangle. Other than the absence of a central(fourth)light,what we saw appeared identical to the Belgian triangles caught on film in the l990s. No other detail could be made out with respect to the objects. I&#39;ve decided to report this after all these years in the hope that if enough people make enough reports,then the scientific community and the appropriate authorities will study these phenomenon seriously. Also,someone should check the archives of the local newspapers for the summer of l958 which should substantiate that many persons reported the same observations at the same time,totally independently of one another. Our group of three had not made any report of what we saw that night to anyone,but were genuinely puzzled at the time,and surprised the next day that so many other unknown  persons reported similar phenomena the previous night at the same time in the same area,over northern and northwestern Baltimore County. In those days Randallstown,where our sighing occurred,was semi-rural and therefore relatively free of City light pollution. It was a warm,clear,dry,starry,moonless night,which may help pin down the time of month,and will remain vivid in my recollection forever,since what we saw was nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before nor since,except for the Belgian photos from the early l990 sightings,and was definitely not manmade aircraft due to their flight characteristics:apparent large size,lack of sound,low slow coordinated,level,uniform straightline motion, and other appearance as described above. These two objects continued north not changing speed nor direction until over the horizon.This is all I recall observing,and would have thought no more of it but for the aforesaid newspaper reports by so many others the next day,on the theory that all of us could not be mistaken nor confused at what we saw,i.e.controlled silent low flying triangles in formation,maintaining equal distance from one another,inconsistent with any known technology,nor any natural phenomena whatsoever.The lights did not flash like a plane,nor change color, nor intensity,nor their positions relative to one another while continuing a uniform motion northward of our backyard vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We lived on a hill that over looked the desert. I looked out to the s.w. and saw this object and i said to my friend look at that and it left the ground and disappered all most straight up before he could turn and look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was round with a dome on it. It was like a soft white color and had like port holes around it. It wasn`t far off the ground. As the crow flys it was about three quarters of a mile away. It was a clear summer night with no obstuctions in the way of viewing . It left the spot with no sound and went out of sight staight up in just a matter of seconds and out of sight.Over the years i have seen simular pictures but not the one i saw.The one that comes close to it is the picture of te one in McMinnville,Oregon. About one week later about three in the after noon four of us were playing basket ball and looked up to get a rebound and there were 3 disk like objects in the sky in the formation of a &gt; again no sound and were flying around the height of a plane.They were a med. gray color and just went across the sky about the speed of a com. jet would now days. You may contact me if you want.<n>

It was on a Sunday 5:30 p.m. on 101 hwy south.  We saw this shiny greyish object about 30 to 40 feet in diameter next to the edge of SanFrancisco Bay.  The reason why we noticed it was the field had caught a fire.  Then the object took off almost in a 45 degree angle straight toward us which was west and it was moving at such a great speed that after a few moments it just got smaller and smaller until it dissapeared.  The saucer was totaly quiet.  It had no lights that we could see and it left the grass field totaly burning.  My Father was an opperating engineer all his life.  He always wanted me not to talk about it because people would think that we were crazy or something.  And for myself I am 56 years old and don&#39;t care what they say.  My Dad is passed away so there is no one else that could back me up except if anybody like fire departments, the farmers, or anyone else that had seen the fire, or the saucer itselt.  I would like to know if there was a report around that area and time, that would make me feel a little better.  I am very mechanicaly inclined and know that this was not something that the US had developed for a few years later I saw the nasa research flying saucer in the old hanger at Mofet field in Mountain View CA and it was nothing in comparison to what my father and I saw.<n>

Her story has never changed when it has been brought twice before to me, thought you might be interested. The lady for you to contact is ((name deleted)) at ((e-address deleted)). Please do not use her name unless you contact her via email because l dont know if she will consent since lm telling you this on my own. She mentioned this story to me last month again to me when l mentioned ufos to her in an email months after hearing a previous coasttocoast show. She was herding sheep with her husband up ontop of Mt. Nephi near Provo Utah back in 1958 or 1959, she will know the exact year and county. The craft appeared about 1000-1500 ft above them at a stand still. Then it just took off towards Calif direction, west, then shot right back to the same spot were she was. She got scared and ran into the tent, waited about 20 minutes, then poked her head out and it was gone. l think she mentioned the craft made no noise. Hope this helps......but please email her first to get a more accurate response on that night from her, if she is willing to talk and have this documented. My name is ((name deleted)) up in Ontario Canada now. Goodluck<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was walking with my father down a sidewalk (north to south) in the apartment complex we lived at when for some reason our attention was attracted skyward. (There may have been a whistle sound but not postive of that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Weather at the time was a totally clear blue sky with no haze and since we were next to a 2 story apt. building the sun wasn&#39;t high enough in the sky to be seen over the roof).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A teardrop shaped object flew over us at about an 75-80 degress angle of elevation above the Southern horizon moving east to west. It appeared to be emitting it&#39;s own light source and was uniformily white in color. The light was a very pure white but did not glare. I recall trying to see any detail but could not. The perceived size was larger than a full moon but there was no way we could determine how high it was nor the actual size and speed. I had the impression for some reason it was at least a few thousand feet up. There was no contrail left nor any pieces falling off and no change in direction, velocity, shape and color in the short time we witnessed the object. Afterwards my father and I we wouldn&#39;t report it and as far as I know there weren&#39;t any reports of a sighting in the area in newspapers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While hardily an expert I do know that the object was not a plane, bird, cloud, balloon, bolide meteor, or Venus. I have never seen anything of this nature since that time but felt I should report it now just so it&#39;s in the public record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/5/58 21:00|Lakebay|WA|Disk|several hours|9 people see UFO in night sky.|11/26/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115556.html|7|ndxe195807| 9 people see UFO in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 7 years old in 1958, and we slept out in our yard pretty regular in the summer months. Not just my brother and me, but the whole family.  We had a 2 story home on a farm in the country that was built in the late 1800s and while it was big and handsome, it did not have a stitch of insulation in it so it was cold in the winter and hot in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember back to one evening in particular, our family was sleeping outside.  Mom, dad, my brother and sister and me.  Another hot summer night in about July or August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we lay looking at the billions of stars in the clear dark sky, one star in particular, we thought a shooting star, was coming straight toward us.  It came out of the southeastern sky and flew straight above us in a graceful arch to the middle of our sky.  It stopped and hovered directly above our farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large in the night sky, about as big as a silver dollar at arms length, looking up through our 5 archer window of evening sky.  It was a round metal looking disk shaped ship, and it hovered above us for a while with blinking white lights around the edges, and then other ships came out of it on 8 points of the compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These ships were about the size of dimes compared to the mother ship.  All the ships looked as though they were very high in the sky and all looked like shiny metal.  The little ships came straight out and hovered for a few moments then shot across the sky in all 8 directions so fast it was like seeing shooting stars.  All at the same time and all completely across the sky out of sight in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main ship continued to hover in our sky as we watched and visited about what it might be.  We lived across the bay from McChord Air Force base at the time, so our first thought was it was something from the base.  But that would change when the smaller ships returned around an hour later.  When they did, they came from many directions, but not all at the same time.  These ships traveling as fast as shooting starts would fly halfway across the sky and with out slowing down, would turn ninety degrees and shoot across to the mother ship.  When they returned to the mother ship each hovered next to her for a few moments then disappeared inside.  After what seemed like all of them had returned (we didn&#39;t count them when they came back) and after all that returned had entered the mother ship, she started kind of glowing.  Going bright and dim and the lights around the edge started spinning faster and faster.  There was no sound at any time.  Then the ship shot straight up and to a pinpoint and out of site in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sightings such as these became pretty regular when we slept in our yard and we looked forward to the shows when we&#39;d go out there to sleep.  We decided they were UFOs or flying saucers when they made their unusual moves across the sky, but no one ever said what they were and we never reported them to any one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let it go and figured it would be explained in time.  But I am now 63 years old and it has never been explained.  I decided I should get this story told before I am to old to remember it and to old to type it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It could have been l958 or 59.  I was outside and looked at the sky, which was full of stars.  I noticed that one of the stars was moving in a very large circle around the sky.  For as high as it must have been, it must have been moving at a great speed. It continued this for  awhile and then it shot off straight out of sight at a much greater speed.  It was about the size of one of the stars, but brighter.  Other people outside saw it also.  I called the Civil Defense call line and found that it was busy for quite awhile.  When I finally got through, they said that they had many calls about the same thing.  I am a high school teacher<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I covered over again and do not remember any thing until the next morning,  I do not remember if I told any one the next day or not?
