I was looking almost straight up. The rectangular shape had clearly defined edges. The long part of the rectangle was oriented east/west. I looked back at the shape several times in the next few minutes. I always located it quickly in the same spot. It looked like a patch on the sky. There were other spectators around, but none with binoculars. I didn&#39;t mention it to anyone, because the demonstration had everyone&#39;s attention. After a few minutes, I became very concerned that there was going to be a violent accident with the ultra light aircraft, because the pilot was trying aerobatics in the flimsy craft. I left in my vehicle. I have never mentioned this incident to anyone, nor have I ever again seen anything similar. I am a 69 year old retired banker, a former computer progammer and I was a control tower operator in the Air Force in the late 1940&#39;s.<n>

The inversion was so thick that vehicles had their headlights on at noon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding in the bed of a pickup truck enjoying the reflection of the city lights on the dense smog/fog layer above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, an enormous triangle glided silently over my head. I would guess it to be 3-4 times larger than a commercial airliner. It was 50 feet above me and was dark gray. It had no lights and the reflection of the city lights revealed the gray color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up and watched it glide into the night. the whole experience was 20 seconds at best.<n>
1/15/79 20:00|Clines Corners/Tijeras (between)|NM|Triangle|20 - 25 minutes|25 minute event of a Triangle shaped object seen by many on Interstate 40 in New Mexico, between Clines Corner and Tijera,New Mexico|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76816.html|3|ndxe197901| 25 minute event of a Triangle shaped object seen by many on Interstate 40 in New Mexico, between Clines Corner and Tijera,New Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> In  January of 1979, my family and I were driving home to Albuquerque from a cross country trip from Massachusetts after the Christmas Season.  We had stopped in Tucumcari for a family bathroom and stretching break; this had been a 2000+ mile journey and we were on day 5, the home stretch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still light out and the sun was preparing to set in the hour  when we left Tucumcari; the only thing unusual observed in the sky was multiple &#34;Morning Glory&#34; cloud formations that we passed under, on route 40. This in itself was unusual because &#34;Morning Glories&#34; are very rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it grew dark on the long stretch of road called Interstate 40, which cuts through from the boarder of the Pan Handle of Texas; straight through to Albuquerque, a 217 mile 3+ hour journey, at 9 years old you wonder if this trip is ever going to end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only approximate the time as being about  8:00pm when somewhere between Clines Corner, New Mexico and Tijeras, New Mexico on Interstate Route 40 an event that was observed by all 4 members of my family that we will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off in the distance a tower with anti-collision lights could be observed, it was on the left hand side of the road; it must have been a large tower because, the outline obscured in the darkness was visible from quite a ways away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But there was something peculiar about this tower, above it was what appeared to be 3 spinning flashing lights; which when viewed at a distance were not attached to the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother then asked my father:  &#34; __________  is that a Helicopter?&#34;  My father answered:  &#34;Maybe, but, My Mother:” But What???” 	My Father:” I don’t know  ____________ , ,,,,, its too windy,,,, I don’t now what it is..”  As we drew closer to the tower, (possibly a weather or communication station, no cell towers back then) we observed 1 or 2 smaller structures under the tower from a distance; and an unidentified  air craft maintaining distance above the tower itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were still a ways away from the tower station, but we could notice that this object was spinning; the approximate spin was about 90° per second or one complete revolution per 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drew closer to the object we could see a distinct triangular form, which was in my estimation at least 100 feet across. It was at this point that this object began to gain altitude and loose altitude like a bounce on a trampoline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This increase and decrease in elevation was effortless and smooth, and at first it was in increments of maybe 20 feet;  vertical up and down on the top part of the tower, and at no time did this object stop spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular stretch of road it was very windy, the sheer alone was blowing tractor trailer trucks all over the road; but this object displayed no lateral vectoring what so ever, every time it raised in elevation or lost elevation the object did so in a straight ballistic line.   (My father’s last duty in the Navy was a chopper trainer, he said that it was impossible for a helicopter to maintain position like that in those winds and not experience severe lateral vectoring) The closer we drew to the object the more distinct it became,  the object  then moved slightly away from the tower and stopped in the center of the  tower –yard; at this point the object began to bounce gracefully in approximately 50 foot drops  and 50 accessions, all the time still spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother tried to take some pictures of the object but as far as I know they never came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was now clear to my parents and I that this was no helicopter. My father and mother opened their windows, in order to try to here if the sound of a copter was present, but the only sound heard was road noise; and at this distance, if it was a helicopter one would have been able to hear the roar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were passing the tower station, the object leisurely and effortlessly moved and began to follow the highway; particularly our white suburban truck.  At this point, my mother began to flip out, and begged my father to get off the highway, but we just kept driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where the events of this night become weird, as we were driving the craft took up position above our truck and started to flash bright, and I mean bright flashes of directed light into our vehicle, particularly at me. They were brighter than any police or emergency vehicle or anti -collision light I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First flashes of:  yellow, than flashes of red, than blue, than green, than blue than red, than green and finally blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while the object flew slowly away east bound in to the sky and out of sight straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole event from start to finish lasted from 20 to 25 minutes; I have tried using Google Earth to locate the precise location of where this event occurred, but much of the topography there has changed since I was a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What has bothered me over the years is that there were other witness to this event  on that stretch of interstate 40 that night; none as far as I know, have ever reported this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My current vocation is a Licensed and soon to be Ordained Pastor, there is a big risk for me to even speak out these events, but they must be told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the only experience my family and I had in New Mexico;  there was another one, just as weird.<n>
1/15/79 17:00|Los Angeles|CA|Fireball|30 seconds or less|Fireball passing through outer atmosphere about sunset.|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05385.html|4|ndxe197901| Fireball passing through outer atmosphere about sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about sunset I was doing something in my house when my next door neighbor began shouting &#34;Bob! Bob! Get out here right now, you have to see this!&#34;  I lagged in answering about five seconds and he repeated with great urgency.  I ran out just in time to see half the event remaining.  It was a very bright object passing through the outer atmosphere, at very high speed, going perhaps southeast to west.  Whatever it was had two sets of streamers coming off it, one was a series of superheated lines of atmosphere or perhaps particles, which streamers looked very much in configuration like the lines coming off a plastic badminton birdie.  The second was a SHOCK WAVE perhaps fifty miles in FRONT of the object, of super compressed air which also was forming streamers, but of a much larger diameter, like pushing a large flat serving bowl.  The intensity of the object did not diminish, and it passed right on through the atmosphere and out again, into space.  I checked the news and a few other sources but I never heard of anyone else seeing this object, which was either an off course spacecraft (which someone must have caught hell for), or simply a large meteor.  This was probably 1978 or 1979 winter, probably January.<n>
1/9/79 14:30|Key West|FL|Disk|5 minutes|A small unexplainable hovering object I spotted as a child of 10 while walking home from school one day in the 70s|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61444.html|5|ndxe197901| A small unexplainable hovering object I spotted as a child of 10 while walking home from school one day in the 70s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from school one day in about the 5th grade, possibly 4th down Flagler Avenue. This was around 1978 or 1979. I had walked home every day since the 2nd grade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 2:30 and 3pm. I was walking on the sidewalk against the traffic. It was a 4-lane with a median. I was one block from my home when I looked across the street ahead of me and saw a strange small object hovering above that sidewalk about 15-20 feet up. From that point on I did not take my eyes off of it but I did try to see if there was a string on it or if it was being controlled from someone on the ground. This was a residential neighborhood and there was little to no traffic at this time. Or if there was, I do not remember, I was so fixated by this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it, walking slowly as it just hovered there.  Suddenly it seemed to &#34;notice&#34; me and it made a direct bee-line across the street toward me. As I write this I am getting chills upon chills just recalling this. It didn’t move fast nor slow but just steadily in a very straight line at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it was right over my head maybe 10 feet above me and following me exactly as a continued to walk. I was not afraid but extremely intrigued. I couldn’t imagine what it was! It was a small very colorful disk. It was slightly tilted, with a small cylindrical &#34;handle&#34; going through the center.  If I can remember, I believe the handle was red.  It looked kind of like a toy but it baffled me because it was spinning and it was silent and there was nothing attached to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t understand how it could be suspended up there, and at that time, I was not aware of any remote controls like THIS.  It hovered over me spinning quietly until I reached the end of the block and stepped off into the street, then it immediately went back across the street.  I still continued to watch it, looking back until I got to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT that point, I felt afraid and went into the house, locked the doors and called my mom at work as a watched out the kitchen windo w trying to spot it.  I didn’t have a good view.  I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not particularly aware of UFOs. Our family was not into that. So it didn’t occur to me that this could be a UFO.  I drew a picture of it for my mom and dad and my mom wrote down what I said and we kept that.  But I have never forgotten anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that day on, I always tried to find an explanation for such an object.  I looked at kites and remote controls or whatever I could find to explain it.  I never could.  Then when I saw a toy or colorful kite that reminded me of it, I would feel a sense of panic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I still have not found a plausible explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have reported it.  I am 40 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching a UFO special on Discovery Channel this afternoon prompted me to report this finally!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your attention to this matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was about 10 ft. diameter, had a series of evenly spaced red lights around the perimeter, and made no sound.  The object made no changes in speed or direction during the time that I could see it.  I was around 9 at the time, and my memory of it is somewhat jumbled, but I am certain that this happened.  It was a quiet night, and the sky was overcast.  I thought at first that it was a helecopter, but it made no sound and was perfectly circular.  I think I saw a circle on the bottom of it, but otherwise it was dark.<n>

I was across the street from my high school football field when Ilooked up and nearly had a heart attack when i saw the object hovering over the football field.  I was so scared and surprised at what I was looking at that I could barely get the words out to my 3 friends to get out of the car and look at this!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a Saucer shaped object of metalic looking structure with detail around it on the bottom that appeared to be holes of many in numbers and small. It was so close to the ground that I would say to be approxmatly 50ft. or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first as did my friends try to find an explanation that would discount what we were actually seeing and then we all gave into the reality of it and accepted the fact that we were wittnessing an event that would haunt our memories for the rest of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my friends got back into the car as the object began to move to the east very slowly.  We followed it for about 20 minutes as it gained altitude and speed until it in an instant it accelerated from an estimated altitude of around 200 to 300 feet to out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a God loving rational individual and believe in everything in the Bible and that is what keeps me feeling safe from any possible event that could harm me while I await the rapture when Jesus returns. With that said I&#39;m very interested in finding out what that was when I hope to make it to Heaven and ask the Lord my self. Until then I will only know what I saw and that the Lord didn&#39;t tell us about other life forms in the universe for reasons of his own. That I can accept and that is how I deal with that event!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that event I have seen questionable UFOs, but never anything as clearly visible in description as that object was and I hope to never experience anything like that again for now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.  I was living off base inside a housing compound, outside the local town called Silvertown.  There was no light in the one roomed apartment, yet when I looked, I could see clearly.  I remember waking up on the floor.  My wife was on the bed to my left and slightly behind me.  My attention was drawn to the direction of the doorway.  I saw a large dark figure standing in the door.  The figure seemed to be wearing a hooded cloak or cape.  I think it was dark grey or black  in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there just staring at it when it seemed to start approaching me.  It didn&#39;t appear to be walking.  It seemed to glide across the floor.  I tried to back away from it but couldn&#39;t move.  I tried to call for my wife but couldn&#39;t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although my body refused to respond to my efforts to move, I can remember thinking that if I could make a sound, the fear, and the figure, would go away.  While I can remember it moving toward me, I don&#39;t remember it traveling the distance of the room to where I was laying.  That is to say, I only remember it moving a distance of about 3 or 4 feet. I can&#39;t recall it ever actually reaching me.  My struggle to move or make some kind of sound seemed to go on for several minutes.  My heart was pounding in my chest and I was desperately trying to call for my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I managed to make a whisper/squeak of a noise.  I tried again and the noise came easier this time. Finally, I was calling my wife&#39;s name.  I could move as well, although it was extremely difficult.  I dragged myself to our bed.  I reached up and as I was about to touch my wife, everything was back to normal, if you can call it that.  The stranger was gone. So was the loss of my voice and my inability to move.  However, the room was darker and it was harder to see.  I was still on the floor and my wife was sleeping soundly on the bed.  My heart began to slow down and the pounding reduced itself to a normal beating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just sat there. To this day, I call still recall parts of this incident with great clarity.  But I&#39;m not sure if it was a dream.  I don&#39;t recall if I had been drinking alcohol that night but it is a very real possibility.  Nor do I understand why I was on the floor instead of the bed with my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if my wife recalls any of this. I don&#39;t even remember if I ever talked to my wife about this, but through the years, I&#39;ve told this story to others when the topic of strange things comes up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the risk of coming off as a nut case, other strange things have happened to me as well and are as clear or vivid but may mean nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom between 1982-83, I recalled leaving the shop one night to go across the street to another building.  As I left the shop, I was in a direct line of sight to the door that I was heading for.  Suddenly, I ran into a heating fuel containment wall some 8 to 10 feet off the original path I was on.  I don&#39;t know how I got my original course but it did leave scratches on my shins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another incident at the same base and time frame occurred when I left the shop to catch the bus home.  I left the shop at 10 minutes till 1 AM for what should have been a one minute walk to the bus stop.  However, after I arrived at the stop, I checked my watch and it said the time was 20 minutes after 1AM.  In these two incidents, no alcohol was involved due to the fact that I was just coming off duty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And one morning while in England during the 82-83 time frame, I awoke to find myself inside my wardrode (closet).  However, this one could have been due to drinking, but I thought I&#39;d mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While station at Hurlburt Field, Florida between 1991-92, I used to drive a stretch of road every night that was not well traveled or lit at that time of night.  On numerous occasions while driving, I expected to hear a loud popping noise come from the dash of my car.  The expectation was so strong that my eyes where prepared to close the way they do when someone is hammering on something over and over and then they suddenly stop, but your eyes still twitch in anticipation of the next blow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night late 1996 or early 97, while at work with the Gate Rubber Co in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, I experienced what you would call lost time.  I worked with six presses that cure belts for the company.  On this night, I was waiting for press number 4 to open.  I decided to go check something on press number 1 about 15-20 feet away.  I looked at the timer on press 4 and saw that I had 1 minute and 45 seconds before the press was ready to open, so I turned around to go to press 1.  As soon as I turned around and started to take a step, press number 4 opened up.  I stopped and turned back around.  I wondered if maybe I had looked at the wrong timer, but none of the other timers on the unit were set anywhere near a minute and 45.  It was only a minute and 45 seconds and I didn&#39;t feel anything else was out of order, but I still recall it with great clarity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day after I had begun working for the University of Arkansas, I experience an incident where I seemed to gain time.  I checked the time that I entered Hwy 412 at the intersection of hwy 530 (old Hwy 71). And began the 20 minute drive to Siloam.  As I entered the City limits, I checked the time again and found that I had made the trip in 10 minutes.  I verified the operation of my watch and the Curise Control that I always used and found them to be in good working order.  I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of anyone gaining time, although I have experienced times that I felt time had past quicker than I thought it should have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the standard &#34;Scoop&#34; mark on my left leg that I&amp;#8217;ve heard and read about.  It&#39;s been there as long as I can remember. And in 1999, I noticed that there was a scoop mark on the top of my left hand.  I don&amp;#8217;t recall anything out of the ordinary having happened at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *********** Additional back ground information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was in the sixth grade, I experienced several incident where there were large scabs in my nostrials.  I remember that my grandmother used to have to use large hair pins to remove them.  This lasted several weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1976/77 while stationed at Beale AFB in California and living in the barracks, I got up one night to go to the bathroom.  As I walked past my papasan chair, I saw someone sitting there and stepped around them to go into the hall.  I closed the door behind me.  When I went back to my room, I had locked myself out. I knocked on the door, but no one answered.  I finally had to go outside and break into the room.  No one was there and the next day, when I asked my friends if any of them had been in the room, they all said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading all this, I wouldn&#39;t blame anyone for thinking that I was a nutcase looking for attention.  But I swear that it&amp;#8217;s all true to the best of my knowledge.  It&amp;#8217;s also convinced me that I need to keep a document of dates, times, and conditions, should anything else occur.  Thanks for taking the time to read through this and as always, if you have any quesitons, please let me know.<n>

All 4 of us were frightened.  Craft proceeded to travel at the same speed as our car (95-105 miles per hour) as driver&#39;s response was a futile attempt to &#34;outrun&#34; the craft (this lasted about 5-10 minutes).  It should be noted that other witnesses were present as another automobile actually passed our automobile at approximately 110 or more, miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driver became exhausted and recognizing that he could not outrun the craft, and fearing an accident at this speed, driver decided to slow down and finally stopped the automobile on the side of Highway 80, hoping that the craft would continue in it&#39;s trajectory, and simply pass.  Driver got out of the car and watched as the craft continued and finally passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The craft traveled approximately 100 feet off the ground over the terrain which increased and decreased in height according to the height of the terrain as if perfectly measuring a gravitational effect of the earths pull on the craft.  There was no sound effect from the craft, and in fact, from any other source. It was totally quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arrival at our destination, this matter was called into the USAF dispatch and a complete report was made by all 4 witnesses.  There was never any followup by the USAF.  I still remember this event as if it was just yesterday.  The only detail that still troubles me is the fact that it took us 6 hours to make the trip that even at 65 miles per hour should not have exceeded 4 1/2 hours.  This means that driver estimates that we were missing about 1 1/2 hours of time as measured from Reno to Pleasanton, CA., as the trip took us over 6 hours total.  Saucer was approximately 130 feet wide by 35 feet high.<n>
