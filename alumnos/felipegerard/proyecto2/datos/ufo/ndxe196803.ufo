I heard a jet aircraft floing low coming from the east,  I turned to watch it.  It was flying low, at about 1000 feet.  I reacted when I saw a silver mirror like sphere following the fighter plane just below the tail and about 100 feet behind it.  I thought it was being towed by the fighter.  When it was just over head the sphere moved, in an instant to below the front of the aircraft about 50 feet in front, then it moved instantly to behind the plane again.  I shot a whole roll of film from overhead until it was out of sight.  I took the film to the photo lab at the college and gave it to a grad student who ran the lab.  I told him what I photographed and he said he would take care of the pictures.  Next morning I found him and we went to the lab and he opened the door and went to the darkroom.  He pointed to the drying clamps and declared that the negatives were gone.  He said he processed them the night before, just before he locked up and hung the negs up to dry.   My background:  BA with double major in Astronomy and World Literature, MA in Speech and Theatre, at the time.  I had seen another phenomena when I was 17 years old, but completely different and in a different place.  Nobody seems to care about my accounts, so I am glad to have found your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of us had our coats on and were sitting and waiting for our teacher to tell us to stand.  It was a bright, sunny day and I was sitting near the window when I happened to look up and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There in the sky was a large round saucer shape disk slowing gliding in the sky.  It was a white object and at some point it reflected sunlight on its edge.  I signalled to a boy sitting next to me and he looked out too.  We didnt know what it was and at that time I believed it was someone in a parachute.   The teacher dismissed us and as I got outside, I looked up but the object was gone.  I assumed it was a parachute.  I never forgot the sight but a few years later, logic reasoned that it couldnt have been a parachute I witnessed.  There would have to have been a disabled aircraft for this to occur, and it dawned on my 11 year old mind that what I witnessed was an actual UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
