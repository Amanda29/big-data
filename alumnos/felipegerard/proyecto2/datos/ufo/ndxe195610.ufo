10/15/56 21:30|Mt. Vernon|IN|Disk|7 to 8 seconds|Clear night observation of lumenescent object leaving a trail from east to north.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13255.html|1|ndxe195610| Clear night observation of lumenescent object leaving a trail from east to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing basketball between 2100 and 2200 on a cold October or November clear, star filled night (no moon) with two other youths.  The court was illuminated by service station lights just south of the school yard basketball court.  The object appeared from the east behind trees to directly overhead making a 90 degree change in direction to the north and went out of sight behind a church to the north.  Approach azimuth was approximately 20 to 25 degrees and the eparture azimuth was about 20 degrees.  It was in view seven to eight seconds.  The object was a little larger than a pea held at arms length with a two inch tail (arms length) that can best be described as the animated &#34;Tinker Bell&#34; wand.  It was sparkling and luminescent while fading about two inches behind the object.  I yelled at the other two guys and pointed to the north as it disappeared behind the church.  One of the other guys saw it just before it went out of sight.  This is as I remember it some 44 years ago!<n>

10/10/56 21:00|Edna|TX|Circle|1/2 hour|My older brother and twin sister were leaving the only Edna theater at about 9 PM,...we had our bikes and I took a different route home|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33982.html|3|ndxe195610| My older brother and twin sister were leaving the only Edna theater at about 9 PM,...we had our bikes and I took a different route home than my siblings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was going along, I looked up at this beautiful orange harvest moon that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  The next thing I knew, I was riding down the street, going as fast as I could, scared at I knew not what!  When I got home, my mother said, &#34;Where have you been?  The other kids have been home for half an hour!&#34;  &#34;I came right home mom!&#34;.  I said it so sincerely, she believed me.  I have vague memories of being completely under control except for my thoughts.  I was sad because my stepdad drank a lot, and I was thinking, &#34;Who will take care of Mom?&#34;.  I also, I have memories of making love with this beautiful alien woman and during it, she was in my mind and I was in hers.  This may not have been my first encounter as when I was a little boy, living with my grandmother and grandad in Spring Hill West VA., I used to have these nightmares of skeletons coming through the log cabin (15 rooms - square hardwood logs), and I would want to sleep with my grandmother, but she thought I was hallucinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about 1975, I was working late and long hours at ((name deleted)) near Cincinnati, and after about 20 hours of work, I headed to my home in Colerain Township, Ohio.  As I came to this stoplight on to a main road, scarcly populated,...there was a hill to my left.  On top of this hill was a large circular ship with spotlights that were going all over the place.  There were 2 cars ahead of me, stopped with their motors off, and the people in them were like zombies.  I looked over at the ship and thought &#34;I&#39;m too tired to ((be concerned with)) you now!&#34;.  I went around them and got home with no missing time.  The next day, the newspaper said a military helicopter reported running into a UFO, losing power of their vehicle, and only gaining control just before they hit the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The helicopter incident alluded to above may have been the celebrated &#34;Coyne Case,&#34; of October 1973.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other interesting incident,....after being told by a psycic that I went up in a UFO with aliens, I became expert in Reverse Speech, told the ((deleted)) story, and when I reversed it, it clearly said I went up into the sky with ((name 2 deleted)) and an alien woman named Zua.  My neighbors knew what I was into....Using crystals and copper cones, etc. I spent $50,000 researching and building what I call an Energy Matrix..where one can feel the energy and at one area see it (normal people can see it).  About 3 or 4 years ago, in the evening, my neighbor lady (((name deleted))) knocked on my door as I was at the computer and said my TV antenna had red and white globs of lights jumping all over the antenna.  This was in Costa Mesa, CA.  I went outside, and a couple visiting ((name deleted)) said they had never seen anything like it.  I looked at the antenna, and saw nothing.  The next day, Art Bell reported that there were red and white UFOs spotted at Oceonside (about 40 miles south of Costa Mesa).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report is of service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Born ((deleted--1930&#39;s)) BA degree Math.â€¦((school deleted)) (minors in Russian and Chemistry) MBA ((school name deleted)) Degree in the Korean Language...USALS (Army GT score = 150)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Months later I told my wife ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

10/1/56 19:00|Newport|NH|Rectangle|5 minutes|Disk with glass center section, and flames behind the glass|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42545.html|4|ndxe195610| Disk with glass center section, and flames behind the glass<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fall of 1956 or 57, Newport, NH.  My mother related this UFO experience to me.  While I was there, too, I was too small to remember it (I was born in 1954).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, the woman who usually babysat us, my brother and I were all in our back yard.  It was just after dusk and getting dark.  My mom and the other lady were dipping apples that had fallen from the tree in the back yard into a sulphur solution to kill the hornets that were feeding inside of them (to this day, that part of the story sounds as bizarre as the UFO part of the story itself!).  My brother started crying because a hornet got in his boot and stung him.  But just then, a disk shaped object came out of the sky and hovered near us.  It had a section in the middle that was made of glass through which could be seen bright flames burning.  My mother felt like it was about the distance away as the top of a telephone pole, yet she felt the impulse to just reach up and touch it...it seemed so close.  And then the thing shot up straight into the sky at a supernatural speed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
