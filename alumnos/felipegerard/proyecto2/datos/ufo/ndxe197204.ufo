4/1/72 20:00|Sulphur Springs|TX|Disk|10 minutes|1971-1972 Saucer Siting, Northeast Texas|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29384.html|1|ndxe197204| 1971-1972 Saucer Siting, Northeast Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 12 and my mother about 45. We were driving to a late night store downtown, travelling east to west down one more or less direct route/straight road. Near the downtown grocery was also a water tower and a police communications tower which were probably high points/tallest objects in the immediate area. We saw a metallic saucer-shaped object with red, green and white lights that appeared the size of a small plane not much higher than the water and communications towers. We noticed it as we headed toward these towers then watched it approach them, hover in a stationary position and then head back east. We attempted to follow its path in the car but lost it fairly quickly. We thought it seemed to head further east toward other communication or radio towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was educated, I have two degrees, father is an attorney. We had no reason to disbelieve the existance of a UFO and we had always been star-gazers in the spring and summer months as my mother had taken an astronomy course. We never really told anyone outside our family because at that time there were already so many stories that seemed unbelievable. I guess we just assumed ours would seem just like all the others. But it was as real as  could be. Just like anything else we might have looked at that night, there was no reason not to believe what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know the exact date or year. I have said March of 1972 but it could have been 1973 and could have been May or even Sept-Nov. I know it was a school night! and not middle of the winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/1/72 19:00|Indianapolis|IN|Disk|1 hour Aprox.|Indianapolis Multi-Colored Round object 1972-74 chased by fighter jets|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80755.html|2|ndxe197204| Indianapolis Multi-Colored Round object 1972-74 chased by fighter jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aproximately 1972-74 west central Indianapolis, Indiana. I was a young boy probably around 7 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking back home with my friend coming from his house on a dead end street (Corral &amp; Birtha street)   When we reach the front of my house and sidewalk we noticed a huge round object hovering directly over us.  No sound, I can not explain how huge this was.  We had to actually move our heads back and fourth to see the entire object at one point.  It was rotating with multiple colored lights.  From our vantage point directly under it, it seemed to be like a spoke in a wheel.  The outer edges seemed to be rotating around the center and changing colors as it did that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the object shot straight up in a flash, hardly even able to distinguish between it and stars other than the color looked more orange from the distanced view.  We ran inside to tell my mother and finally we convinced her to come outside to see it.  By that time other neighbors was outside too looking at it.  The object had came back down to it&#39;s original position but occasionally would maneuver up, down or left or right and even diagonally.  Some times fast and sometimes slow.  The second time it shot up and was ha! rdly distinguishable between the stars other than the color difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went back inside and my mother called the police and reported it.  She also called the Air force. Moments later it was on the news on TV.  Wier Cook Airport at the time ( Now Indianapolis International ) had sent 2 fighter jets to intercept it.  We went back outside a third time and seen the jets heading towards the object. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards again so fast... but this time it disappeared completely out of view.  The news that evening said the Air force identified it as being a blown off course weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day it was in the news papers also.  A few day&#39;s later me and my friend was walking along side the road in the middle of the day and a blue car and 2  men in air force uniforms stopped us and asked if we saw anything strange in the sky. We told them about it as they took notes.  Then they drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never head anything more about this.  Now I am 46 and still remember it so vividly. I tried researching the news archives without success.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else who witnessed this please post here.  Obviously it was not a blown off course weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not chase weather balloons with fighter jets... I might add... they couldn&#39;t catch it...lol  I just wish I could find some archives or documentation on this.   Approximately 1972-75 Summer-time, at night very clear sky.  It was all over the news...  Why can&#39;t I find anything on it now?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
