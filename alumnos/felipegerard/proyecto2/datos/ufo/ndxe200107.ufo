7/31/01 23:50|Blanchester|OH|Triangle|8-10 min.|At 11:50 pm, I was driving home and I saw this object on the left of me.  It was triangular in shape.  It had a white light on each tip|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18764.html|1|ndxe200107| At 11:50 pm, I was driving home and I saw this object on the left of me.  It was triangular in shape.  It had a white light on each tip (3 of them), and a really bright red light in the middle.  The object was moving so fast that I had a hard time following it.  Then it just stopped, without slowing down.  As I turned onto my road, It was hovering over this house.  I was trying to get home as quick as possible so my family can see it. I got to my driveway and it shot across the sky again, as silent as can be.  There was NO sound coming from this object.  It went so fast it seemed like it didn&#39;t move.  Then it just hovered over my neighbor&#39;s field.  Where I live, the neighbor&#39;s have about 5-20acres if land and woods in the background.  But, It just sat in the sky, for about 4 minutes.  It didn&#39;t bob up and down or move in the slightest bit.  I ran inside to get my video camera (but the battery was dead), I went back outside and it was still there, over the field.  Then it was gone.  I have never seen ANYTHING go as fast as this object did.  And then come to a dead stop.  It was amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness at length via telephone on several occasions, and she is an excellent and credible witness.  At our request, she submitted a follow-up report, which describes the incident in somewhat greater detail.  The case is under investigation.  Please see reports from Wisconsin and Michigan for same date.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> smooth, rounded, silent, triangular object  following me...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:50pm- I was driving home (southeast) on rt ((highway deleted; rural area)) in Ohio.  When I looked to my right (southeast) and there was an object.  Triangular in shape, the tips of it were very smooth and round.  There was a white light in each corner and a bright red light in the middle.  It hovered there for about 30 seconds.  As I came closer it shot over to the left (North).  The object was at a complete dead stop and it went so fast.  It didn&#39;t start slow or slow down to stop.  It stopped as fast as it went. It just sat there in the sky perfectly quiet.  It didn&#39;t bob up and down or anything, completely still.  It stayed there for about 1 1/2 minutes.  I turned onto my street (north).  I couldn&#39;t see anything for about 1 minute because there were trees.  When I did, it was at the beginning of my street, the south tip.  It was hovering over a house there.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home.  When I got to my driveway I couldn&#39;t see it anymore until it shot across the sky so fast.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes it went so fast.  I had never seen an aircraft go so fast and be completely silent.  It went over my house and went two houses down from mine (north) and hovered in my neighbor&#39;s backyard which is about 20 acres.  It wasn&#39;t very far from their house though.  It again just sat there in the air with no movement or sound, like it was watching me.  I sat in my car for about 2 minutes and watched it.  I was stunned.  I ran in my house to find my video camera but I had forgotten to recharge the battery.  So I was in my house for about a minute or two and ran back outside and it was still there. In my neighbor&#39;s backyard.  We had looked at each other for about 50-60 seconds and it was gone.  So smooth and graceful.  It never changed altitude, shape, anything.  It is hard to describe the size of it b/c I don&#39;t know exactly how high it was but it was larger than a full moon.  To guessimate, it wasn&#39;t very high.  I have a map of my town that will hopefully help you better on the location and direction.<n>

7/31/01 23:40|Traverse City|MI|Light|2 minutes|Light spotted over Traverse City Mi. traveling at a high rate of speed 11:40 July 31 ,2001|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18773.html|3|ndxe200107| Light spotted over Traverse City Mi. traveling at a high rate of speed 11:40 July 31 ,2001<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11:40 Pm. and I was laying in bed looking at the stars through the window.I noticed a bright orange/red light that I know was higher then commercial jets.fly. I would guess that if a commercial jet flies 36 to 45 thousand feet this was flying about 3 times that height. It was hard to try and determine the speed but I can say that it went from the southwest to the northeast until I could not see it any longer in about 2 minutes. I have seen satelites at night before and this was no satilite. It went in a straight line...I started thinking while I was watching this thing that when looking at airliners flying at night they almost look like they are not moving. But this object was moving and moving fast. Funny color too. Orange and red.<n>

It looked like it was crashing but there wasn&#39;t a bang or anything and we only saw it for about fifteen seconds and then we couldn&#39;t see it behind the trees.<n>

This was on Tues. July 31st. Did the people in Wausau see something like this on Tues or Thurs?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this incident over MI and WI.  Hundreds of calls to local radio station.  Some suggested that the sighting was caused by the International Space Station (!!).  We suspect that it was not the ISS.  PD))<n>
7/31/01 23:18|Wausau|WI|Sphere|into the nite|UFO spotted by over 500 people in central to northern WI|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18828.html|7|ndxe200107| UFO spotted by over 500 people in central to northern WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this in case no one else has. On Thursday Aug 2 2001 a Wausau WI-based radio station was flooded with between 550 and 650 phone calls from listeners who claimed to have seen a large green lite that would streak across the sky, hover, then appear to crash. Several people claimed to have also thought is was a plane crashing and so they reported the sighting to several police and sheriff&#39;s departments. PLEASE look at a map of WI: callers who reported this (remember: there were over 550 of them)were calling from Wausau WI, WI Rapids WI, Bowler WI, Nekoosa WI, Plover WI, Stevens Point WI,  in the middle of the state, all the way up to the northern part of the state: Minocqua WI, Phillips WI, Rhinelander, WI.  People reported having to stop in the middle of highways because this thing hovered 30 to 50 feet above the ground.  Police departments verified also seeing this, and also recieving the numerous phone calls reporting a so-called downed plane. Meteorologists have suggested the possibility that this could be ball lightening.  Ball lightening is one of the rarest natural phenomena, and if that&#39;s what this is, it seems strange that it was seen by that many people....How could something so rare travel from the middle of the state of wisconsin, basicly along highway 51, up to the northern part of the state? Does ball lightening hover over Dodge Durangos? The object was reported as being extremely huge, and VERY bright green. One woman said that as she looked at it through the small side window of her car (the one that is next to large window that you would actually roll down) the green glow filled the entire window. It was said to have a sort of red tail that could be seen as it was moving. Those who saw it hover closer to the ground said it was so bright, that it didn&#39;t appear to have any shape, except that looking into it, the center appeared black, surrounded by a blinding green glow, with evident lights at the bottom perimeter of it. It would move slowly, flicker, and stop, drop in altitude, then appear to either crash or land. People in several cities reported seeing it crash or land or disappear into trees in several towns....<n>
7/31/01 23:15|Madison|WI|Light|5 seconds|Spherical greenish-white glowing light in the sky moving very fast to the North/Northeast|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18781.html|8|ndxe200107| Spherical greenish-white glowing light in the sky moving very fast to the North/Northeast<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:15 on 7/31/2001, I was going home from work, driving East on Madison&#39;s West Beltline Highway near Gammon Road. I saw a very bright, spherical greenish-white light appear in the sky from my driver&#39;s side window. The window was totally rolled down so it could not have been a reflection. The spherical light was very bright with a kind of glow or aura around it and not pure white but instead greenish-white. The light was steady with no other flashing lights visible. When I first noticed it, it was about the relative size of my thumbnail held out at arm&#39;s length and got smaller as it moved very fast to the North/Northeast. I saw it for about 5 seconds before it went out of view on the horizon. There was no visible trail like a meteor has and it seemed closer in the sky more like the height of a passenger jet. It seemed to be moving in a straight line from directly over my truck towards the North/Northeast horizon. It seemed to be moving faster than a jet. I did not hear any noise or sonic boom over the sound of my moving truck as it went by. The sky was clear and dark with stars visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and his wife, at length via telephone, and they both appear to be very good witnesses, and quite credible with regard to what they report here.

7/31/01 22:00|Blackstone|VA|Triangle|3 to 5 minutes|Traveling home around 22:00 my friend and I spotted a triangular craft, with 3 "headlights".|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18774.html|10|ndxe200107| Traveling home around 22:00 my friend and I spotted a triangular craft, with 3 &#34;headlights&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were coming home last night about 22:00 at which time I saw 3 Large Headlights (if you will).  They were in a triangular shape, appearing to be one unit.  There was only darkness between these lights.  We could not determine an actual craft, but it was definitely one unit.  The craft was above the treeline when I spotted it, my friend tried to keep track of the craft (I was driving).  It was on the left of us when we first saw it, then crossed to the right after we passed it.  It seemed to be &#34;hovering&#34;.  At this point we lost sight of the craft.  We continued maybe 2 miles down the road and again the craft was in front of us.  At this time it was hovering above a field facing us.  I slowed the car almost to a stop, my window was partially down and absolutely no sound could be heard.  At the urging of my friend, I continued down the road.  (we were almost in town at this point)  When my friend turned around to see where the craft had gone, it had disappeared.  This was a trully strange event.  I&#39;m curious if anyone else in the area witnessed this and would like to know if there is an explanation of this.  As we discussed this, the one thing that really stands out would be the lights on this craft.  I have never seen this type of light before.<n>

It appeared to look like a kite or mylar balloon.  It was like a teardrop shape, but a double teardrop.  It appearred metallic, as it was flashing white light in a rhythmic rate.  It also appeared to be green at times. It was broad daylight, and the light was visible, but did not appear to be shooting.  It hovered, moved slightly.  I lost it on the drive to the company, and after I parked, we walked back to the street to find it, and it was gone.<n>
7/31/01 06:40|Hagerstown|MD|Cigar|30 seconds|White cigar-shaped light, travelling fast NNE to SSE, emited second small light which arced downwards.|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18839.html|13|ndxe200107| White cigar-shaped light, travelling fast NNE to SSE, emited second small light which arced downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing at the front door of my workplace looking at a family of crows [mother feeding 2 young] on a light stanchion in the parking lot next door. Behind the crows, passed a &#39;dirty&#39; white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was &#39;dirty&#39; or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light&#39;s speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said &#34;What in the world is that&#34; Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as &#34;rapid&#34;. I am 46, an ex-air defense artillery crewman [Vulcan] and have experience observing numerous aircraft types, in various light [reflective] conditions including military jets on afterburner or emitting IR decoy flares as well as satellites passing overhead. Light was not a short contrail. This was nothing like anything I have ever seen before.<n>

The light was 3-4 times brighter than any star or aircraft. We watched the light move north for about 10 senconds before it faded in intensity and vanishing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A satellite moving in polar orbit to the north at 0030 hrs. during summer months would not fade from sight the way orbiting objects do when they pass into the terminator, I.e. shadow, of the Earth.  It might have been something along the lines of a tumbling booster shell, but even those appear to pulse or &#34;strobe&#34; at a fairly regular rate.  PD))<n>
7/30/01 22:00|Jamestown|RI|Light|5 minutes|Object resembling airplane light blinked in random patterns, moved strangely, then very quickly for a sec., turned red and dissappeared|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18799.html|15|ndxe200107| ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Pd))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object resembling airplane light blinked in random patterns, moved strangely, then very quickly for a sec., turned red and dissappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us (3 guys and one girl)  were sitting on a beach (Sheffield&#39;s cove) in Jamestown, at night, and one of my friends said, &#34;I thought that airplane over there was a firefly.&#34;  So we all looked in the direction of the airplane, and sure enough it looked like an airplane flying in the distance, pretty far off.  (It was a small light)  We all thought it was funny our friend would mistake an airplane for a firefly.   It caught our interest, and we all kept staring at the &#34;airplane&#34;. It was blinking, more like pulsing,  a white light, and it was pretty dim, and there was no repetitious pattern to the pulsing, it was a completely random order.  It would blink a bit, then not blink for a few deconds, then blink a few times rapidly, and so forth, and something about it seemed odd to everyone there.  (Except one of us, who we later discovered was looking at a real airplane in the sky, and thought we were nuts. We realized he was looking way to the left of the object were staring at) I couldn&#39;t figure out if the object was moving or not, it seemed to remain motionless, but then i made the suggestion out loud to compare it to the tree level to see if it is moving right or left.  The trees were pretty far away, and there was an inch of sky between the object and the tree line from where we sat.  (You know what I mean)   So we all (except for the guy who wasn&#39;t looking in the right direction) were in agreement that it was moving to the right a bit.  But then it seemed like it was back where it had been.  We watched this thing for a few minutes, debating whether we were hallucinating or if was really was moving from side to side like this, but never the less something seemed very strange about it.  Then it obviously moved higher in the sky, before dropping back down and to the right in a very quick motion, so fast that it left a trail in our vision. It had moved about an inch to the right in the sky.  Then it was motionless again, while the three of us were all kinda freaking out and &#34;did you see that?&#34;  sorta stuff.  Then it sank below the trees, reappeared about 20 seconds later, just above the tree line, when it changed from a white light to a pulsing red light.  Then it sank back down and was gone.  It made no sounds.  The whole incident lasted 5 minutes.  It in the direction of north in the sky from were we were sitting.  Northeast slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I already submitted the report, but I left out the date and time, which is important I assume.  Also, it was a very clear night outside, and yes there were airplanes in the sky that night, one flying at the same time as the object we saw, this being the plane the 4th person was looking at, thinking it was the object we were all bugging about.  He made no suggestion that the plane he was staring at was acting in any strange way.))<n>

The thing was silent moving south to north northwest  at an extremely high rate of speed, it covered the entire sky from horizon to horizon in 10 seconds. I am wanting to know if their have been any other sightings? I would also like to know if maybe it was some kind of anomally because it appeared to possibly be a reflection of the moon like maybe on the upper atmosphere!!!!!!!!! Please reply!!! Thank You.<n>
7/30/01 12:30|Stanwood|WA|Sphere|2-3 minutes|2 spheres, same color as sky,  manuvering, trailing eachother, seen through binoculars too.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46307.html|17|ndxe200107| 2 spheres, same color as sky,  manuvering, trailing eachother, seen through binoculars too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a saturday definately, I think @ July7 30, 2001.  It was definately 12:30 pm because I was readying to leave my home for the bank, which closes at 1pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Completely clear and sunny, no clouds, calm air at ground level. I never would have seen them but I paused to watch an eagle circle in the sky over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 2 spheres, 1 behind the other, coming toward me from the south heading smoothly due mostly north.  They were the same color as sky, barely paler blue/gray, slightly pearlescent sheen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched continuously as they approached and a small cessna style aircraft turned and slowly flew on general intercept coursetoward them.  I assumed the pilot saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres veered slightly to the northwest, the cessna soon turned back toward the southeast and seemed to be flying slower than the planes usually do in this area (about 7 miles from Arlington Airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres seemed to turn again toward the north, 1 behind the other still.  I ran to get my binoculars in the house, and saw the objects thru them when they were just north of my position.  No other details were discernable but for a slightly darker blue gray &#34;core&#34;.  They were close enough so that I should have seen details, such as appendages, balloon baskets, ropes/cables, but only a sphere was seen.  I am guessing they were 2 miles or less from me now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The discoloration core was approx 1/4 to 1/5 the diam of the spheres.

Then I looked back and the huge star had moved way over to the right,and that&#39;s when I stopped and said &#34;oh shit! Not again&#34;.It was the exact same thing my girlfriend and I saw 8 years earlier.It was a big blob of light hovering and bobbing a bit above the horizon line with another smaller &#34;wingman&#34; looking light lower and to the left of it.They were both moving around a little in strange bobbing motions.Sometimes they would appear to get to get bigger and then shrink back.I watched for about a half hour before noticing 2 more in the same formation in another area and not so obvious to the eye.Then I started trying to search the entire sky.They appear to be yellowish and sometimes blueish in color and unlike the actual stars around them.Alltogether I counted 10 of them (all in pairs).8 years ago we saw one pair of these bobbing lights but that time they came right up instantly and we got a full on close up look at the craft and we were absolutely terrified.We thought we were going to be abducted for sure.It came right at us.It had to have seen us atop a dune next ! to the w ater.It turned a bit though and went over the water in front of us then cicled in toward the houses and floated completely silently at practically rooftop level over the town area then reappeared down the beach where it came from originally(it was cicling the area).So then it came back for another run staight at us again.We were back to clutching each going,&#34;Omigod, this is it!&#34;.This time it took a left and floated out over the water and into the darkness.There was no more yellowish light in the distance after that.It was over.I&#39;ll never forget that.Definately the most bizarre thing I&#39;ve ever seen.The actual craft looked like this:Basically a giant tic-tac,metallic in color with three &#34;windows&#34;,two small ones on the ends and one big one in the middle.They had etremely bright light coming out of them.It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.On the front pointing down was like a headlight(oddly enough)and when it was flying low over the water the reflection from the light on the water showed that it was only about 100 ft. up(at the most).I thought for sure I&#39;d be reading about in the local paper.Surely someone else was going to see it.It flew RIGHT OVER town at like rootop level at 10 o&#39;clock at night.But nobody saw except us.Oh well.Last night when I saw the same far away lights I&#39;ve decided to try and tell my story to whoever will listen.Thanks.<n>

In an instant, something caught the attention of my sight in the lower sky just above eye level. I witnessed a large object on fire with a trail of fire behind it shoot accross the sky. At first I thought it was a plane crashing to earth. The 3-5 second span that this object took to fly accross the whole sky canceled this theory. I then braced myself to feel the effect of the impact of such a large object falling towards the earth at such velocity. There was nothing. However, I knew there was Something!!!!!!! This Something I cannot explain. Can you help me???????!!!!!!!!!!<n>

It was twinkling fast and white, disappeared for a second, and reappeared flashing red, green, and white.  I called my husband and grandson to come out to the balcony to see this;  my husband had a pair of binoculars (10x25)and used them to better see this thing.  To the naked eye, there appeared to be three spheres, blinking  red, green and white lights, seeming to go one in front of the other, then seperate to the left and right of each other, going up and down diagnonally. We stood there mesmerized watching this for about 45 minutes. Using binoculars, my husband was better able to the action: he observed these objects rotating each other, with two white lights in the front, and the red  and green ones on either side of the shape. One appeared to be stationary, while the others circled it. One remained ,on what we think was the surface of the water for quite some time. When we mentioned this to one of the maids the next morning, she told us that, &#34;There&#39;s always things there, don&#39;t forget that Patrick Air Force Base is not to far away.&#34; Patrick Air Force Base is about 8 miles north from our observation point.<n>

The kicker is behind this group(distance unknown) was a single light (same color as the first group) chasing or trying to catch the first group, just as it passed overhead the rear craft did catch the first group and I thought it was going to rear end the 4 lights, but it suddenly veered off to the left and went past the 4 lights. Winds were calm and slight thin clouds, half moon was about 30 degrees to the west of the objects. Speed of these craft was faster than the comercial or military jets.I observed them from about 40 degrees off the southern horizon till they disappeared behind the trees from my house to the north, there is no power lines or anything to distract my vision.<n>

It had  been windy during the day but this had dropped well down by then and the object moved much faster than anything moving solely by the wind could have gone.  Aircraft, I&#39;d guess, would be nearer 10,000 ft. Observed firstly by my neighbour(a policeman) - I&#39;m ex-RAF - radar operator.<n>

The craft had lights at each point of the triangle. At first thought it was a helicopter but then decided it wasn&#39;t, because the craft did not move at all for the whole 5 minutes it was in view; nor did the lights on it flicker or blink as lights on regular aircraft are wont to do. Boyfriend (driving the car) also noted the craft and its peculiarity. It hung in the sky without moving until the car moved out of viewing range.<n>

The object was cylinderical in shape and changed to oval as it moved.  We noticed a bright glowing orange/gold color not present in other aircraft in the viscinity at the time.  There were several aircraft in the area at the time, inbound to O&#39;Hare from our west/southwest position, and outbound and heading west from Midway at our east position.  All jet aircraft in the area were a darker silouette, that the vehicle in question ( with landing lights, anti-collision lights and flying a specific pattern.)  The object did not appear to have any wings or tail stabilizer and at once I thought that it looked like the slender silouette of an MD-80.  But all at once it changed shape to oval and stopped!  Right there about 7,500 to 10,000 feet, appearing to watch the commercial traffic!  To add to the mystery, we noticed an eastbound twin-engine aircraft crusing at at least 35,000 feet and for a brief moment, the object blocked our view to to the contrail of the eastbound crusing aircraft.  An outbound 757 from Midway passed our position, and the object began to move again, northeast, same altitude.  In a matter of seconds it dissapeared.<n>

In appearance, it looked like a meteor or light reflecting off of a missile or the fusilage of a shiny airliner. In this first object, there was a bright light at the front, and two smaller lights very close in a line behind (in reference to its direction of travel), which made it appear to be the tail of a meteor (but they did not change in relationship to the front light, so I&#39;ve pretty much ruled that out). The lights were nearly the same color as the yellowish-red type of street light (high pressure sodium, I believe). There was no sound, nor was there a vapor trail. The object traveled in a mostly west &amp; slightly south direction. When the object reached approximately south-southwest of my house, the 3 lights appeared to move closer together, until you could only see 1 light. This 1 light appeared to grow *at least* 4 times brighter than the 3 lights combined. It stayed bright for a period of time, maybe 10-15 seconds, then it dimmed to the brightness of the original light (the one in front without the 2 behind). It continued to move in the same mostly west, slightly south, direction until it faded out of sight (presumably from going further away). Just before the first object faded out completely, my dad looked at the spot where it appeared, just below the moon, &amp; saw another object. This second object was *identical* in appearance &amp; motion, including having the 3 lights combine into one, grow bright, &amp; continue west until fading out of sight. At a similar interval (just before the second object faded completely), the third object appeared. It was sighted just above &amp; to the left of the moon &amp; traveled in exactly the same direction &amp; approximately the same speed as the first two objects (presumably it was in pursuit). This third object was quite obviously a plane, as vapor trails and wings were evident. However, the leading edge glowed in 3 places a *bright* red, approximately the same hue as a bright red car, or a fresh cherry. I assume the bright red in front, was a reflection of the now set sun. I am no expert in finding velocities of flying objects, but if all three were plane sized, I approximate their speed at around 5-600mph, &amp; an altitude of 30,000 to 45,000 feet. At no time did any of the objects change speed or direction of flight. My very first impression of these objects was that they were planes that had the setting sun&#39;s light reflecting off of them. But there were no vapor trails (except for the 3rd object), no strobe lights, no sound &amp; no wings or tail (except the 3rd object, where we could clearly see wings). A few moments later an airliner flew directly overhead &amp; it was very clear that this was an airplane, we could see the full length of the fusilage, the tail, both wings &amp; a vapor trail. But the first two objects are very puzzling to us; they definitely fit the under the category of Unidentified Flying Objects. If this description isn&#39;t detailed enough, or you would like me to make drawings of what I saw, I would be glad to answer any questions or send drawings if you contact me by phone, mail, or (preferably) e-mail.<n>

The day I had taken the picture there was nothing else that I noticed different on my walk. It was a very nice day about 28 deg Celsius with an occasional breeze.  The picture that I&#39;m sending you is a copy of the original. It was taken with a Fuji Finepix 1300 digital camera.. Upon later viewing the images in my camera, I noticed this short dark line on the right side of the sky area in one of the pictures. The apartment building in the background is the building that I lived in at the time and was taking a picture of it. I was standing on the bridge and the vehicle traffic was passing behind me.The camera was new at the time and had few pictures taken with it. Also there are no other marks on any of the other pics that I had taken that day. I really was amazed when I viewed the pic on my computer. I have no idea what that is on the pic. If you are ever in this area visiting I can show you the exact spot the pic was taken from if it would help you investigate things that I may not be aware of. Hope to hear from you again. Maybe there is more to this than I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was witnessed in the late afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes watching it and then I decided to run out to my truck to get my binoculars.  It took me about another minute to find the object again.  It was still in the same place but the clouds had drifted away making it harder to see.  Looking through my binoculars I could tell that it had a shape similar to a stealth aircraft but it was so small that I can&#39;t be absolutely sure about that.  There was also a haze around the object, like when you look through gasoline fumes.  I went back to my porch and had a hard time finding it again.  I spotted it once but I lost it while trying to find it with my binoculars.  The entire episode lasted about 10 minutes and I never saw the object move.<n>

I noticed an object (circular) rising from behinds the 10th story of the buiding across the street.  The object was the size of a satellite dish. It flew parallel to the ground before making a sharp turn eastward and climb. The coating of the object flickered from opaque to mirror-like. It climbed sharply but steadily. All of a sudden, a huge cloud seemed to form over a distance of 20 miles (dist. from my home to the CN Tower)very quickly. It enveloped the object. I must have looked down for a few seconds when I looked up the storm cloud had dissipated taking the object with it.  The whole incident took approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is illogical, and return e-mail is invalid.

At approx. 3;20 am saturday morning july 28 2001. In our backyard we were watching the delta aquarids meter shower, suddenly my husband yelled &#34;What the **** is that ***** do you see that!I looked to the north where he was looking. I saw approx. 15 to 20 white triangles just over the roof of our home. they were in a trianglur formation. At first you could only see the side and part of the top of these things then they sort of banked our direction and you could see the intire shape of the trangle. these things looked like they were lite from above {a light source shing down from above} but the moon had already set. After banking or whatever they did they dissaperd behind a large pecan tree in our front yard. the sighting lasted approx. 6 seconds.There was no sound or wind at the time , skies were clear.They were approx 1 thumnail at arms lenght after  banking. They moved west to east we were facing north They were approx. 30 to 35 degrees above the north horizon.I would guess the distance at apporox. one mile or so but could have been more.This sighting was very upsetting to my husband and myself. I have tried to find a reasonal explanition for this sighting but the only thing I could come up with is a flock of geese but I checked into that. geese flap there wings when they fly.there was no movement like that also geese dont glow on moonless nights.Also the geese that migrate thur this part of the country are mostly grey. Whatever we saw was white and glowing and travaled in a solid triangle not a hollow v.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally good observer and reporter of fact.  She asserts that she and her husband consider themselves seasoned sky watchers, and they are amateur astronomers.  Her ability to describe the objects, and the event, in factual, unambiguous terms was exceptional.  We suspect this is an extremely interesting report.  PD))<n>

I awakened, needing to use the bathroom.  The bedroom was luminated from a bright light outsid of the East window of the bedroom.  Looking out I saw two very bright lights in a dark, cloudless sky.  I went in the the bathroom, completed my errand and went back to the window.  The lights were still there.  I did not know if anyone would believe me and did not wish to wake my sleeping husband.  I went into the livingroom closet and got the camera, went back to the bedroom and took a picture from the window, with the telescopic lens set to infinity. The lights were still there and had not moved.  I then returned the camera to its place in the closet and went back to the window.  The lights were still there and i wend to bed.  I thought I may here of something the next day on the news. I asked my husband if he had gotten up during the night but he had not. I forgot about the incident after a couple of days and did not think about it until I finally had the roll of film developed a couple of months later.  There was a picture of what I had thought a flying saucer looked like.  Two of them.  I showed the picture to my family and friends to see if they thought the same thing and without exception they all thought it looked like saucers.  I did not know where or who to report it to so just put it away until I heard the locak noon news today on CBS ( Channel 2). They were interviewing a lady named ((name deleted))  who said she was expecting her &#34;brothers and sisters&#34; to drop in on Salt Lake City for an Olympic visit. I thought it was more Olympic hipe until she said she had seen saucers in July 2001. This is when I thought I should report my sighting to someone.  If this is interesting to you I have photo and negative.  I do not however have a scanner. I am leaving for a month to care for my father on Feb.28 and will be back on April 4, 2002.if you are interested you can contact me then.<n>

He occupied a responsible position in the military.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Temecula, CA two people viewed 3 star like objects in motion for 5 minutes at 2:30 AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man and his girl friend were sitting on the porch of her house.  The house is located within one mile of the route 79 E exit off of I-15 some 30 miles N of Escondido, CA, near the Pechanga Casino.  Looking at the stars, the man noticed that three stars were in motion.  They appeared to form an equilateral triangle as they flickered and moved to the South horizon.  The triangle subtended a huge arc of the sky(a distance between 10:30 and 1:30 elevation )  This huge spread attracted the man&#39;s attention and he told his girl friend to look at this phenomenon.  Both were quite amazed and emotional. They both observed for five minutes.  During this time the leading star-like object stopped and the other two objects fell in line behind it.  They then faded away as they got low on the horizon. The man is a military veteran and held secret clearances.  The night was very clear with the Milky Way visible.  He had never had an experience such as this and has viewed the night sky many times in the past around the world.  This witness volunteered he was not drinking.<n>
7/28/01 01:48|Bendigo (Australia)||Unknown|5-8 seconds|Orange arrow shape that made an impossible manoeuvre over Bendigo, Australia.|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18926.html|45|ndxe200107| Orange arrow shape that made an impossible manoeuvre over Bendigo, Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had arrived home late from a social occasion (I was completely sober though). From my back yard, looking north-west, I was taking a look at Mars which in recent months has been very bright.(I&#39;m in the southern hemisphere remember). There was about one half of the moon showing and the night sky was virtually clear of cloud cover. As I stood watching, a light appeared out of nowhere at about the one-o&#39;clock position, travelling east-west, and probably 80 degrees up from the horizon. It travelled to about the ten-o&#39;clock  position and changed direction, without changing speed, and headed north. After a few seconds heading north it faded out, just the way it had faded in; like someone using a light dimmer switch. Now just a few more details: The colour of the UFO was a uniform yellow-orange glow. There were NO flashing lights as per conventional aircraft. An &#34;arrow-head&#34; form was discernible behind the glow. In size it appeared about 4-5 times larger than Mars appeared that night (it actually crossed close to my view of Mars so this was easy to judge). When it changed direction it did not change speed or bank into the turn, (it was like it bounced off a wall at right-angles!!!). It did not appear to change altitude during the time I observed it. Its altitude was difficult to judge but I would say at least 12-15,000 feet. Its speed was much faster than I have seen any aircraft travel yet slower than a meteor,(&#34;falling star&#34;). It had no &#34;tail&#34; like a meteor. There was no sound associated with the event that I could hear. It was moving as it faded in and out; that is I could see it moving before it reached its maximum brightness and I could still see it moving as it dimmed to invisible. I have seen numerous UFOs over the years but this is the first one that impressed me so much that I felt I had to make the effort to report it to someone.(Someone who wouldn&#39;t laugh anyway). I have scientific training (analytical chemist) and I&#39;m well read in areas of physics and astronomy. I can with confidence rule out that I saw any of the following on this occasion: a conventional aircraft, space debris, meteor, satelite, space shuttle, space station (esp MIR), balloon,(weather, hot air or other), searchlight, flare, fireworks. In short I cannot ascribe what I saw to any man made device or phenomena. Unfortunately, I cannot say what it is that I saw either, only describe it as I have. Thanks for the opportunity to tell the story.<n>

We were following one piece going from south to north at either 10:45 or 11:45 in a campground a mile or so upstream from the power plant in Huntington Creek canyon in Central Utah. Suddenly, two pieces caught our eyes that looked about a mile or so apart from each other, but were both going the same speed from west to east.They traveled the same speed as the other stuff we see. What was that?! I can&#39;t be sure, but once in a while I thought I saw a third light in front of the two lights, forming a triangle of sorts.<n>

I was driving notrh(really slightly north-east) on Interstate 95, at exit 57 for Guilford, CT. I happened to look up as the approach to the exit was an upgrade, and I noticed activity in the sky.... several fast moving,cone-shaped objects sped in a northerly direction. These cone-shaped objects had a tail which was lighted...I can&#39;t recall a color, but it was a lighted trail. I also noticed in the same short period of time, after the 4 to 6 cones passed toward the north,I then saw 2 to 3 speeding in the southerly direction. The northely and southerly movement was separate... not at the same time, first to the north, then to the south. I did pull over to the roadside to have a better look, but unfortunately there was no more activity. I drove to my exit, # 58,and stopped at the ramp end and again looked skyward only to observe no further activity. As I drove home I tried to continue looking skyward while watching traffic. Nothing! When I reached home,I ran to the back yard to get a better view however, sadly,I saw nothing else. I did observe the Hale-Bop(sp?) Comet a few years ago and would say  these objects looked similar, but smaller and mover much faster through the sky. This activity all happened within 2-3 minutes...from 9:58 to 10:00PM. It was especially exciting as the sky was so incredibly clear. This is my first sighting of any unusual activity since the HB Comet.I am not an astromomer, but merely a constant observer who is fascinated with beautiful skys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness.  She was careful to record the precise time and location of the sighting, as is evident from  her description above, we observe.  We would welcome any other reports from possible witnesses in this area.  PD))<n>

They eventually faded out after becoming the size of a star, then disappeared in the same spot we had seen five lights disappear earlier in the night. They lokk almost like a glass ball with fire inside of it however when we got our binoculars they were too far away.<n>

I and friend watched it for about 40 minutes. It was brighter than a star or a planet, and larger than both. It was very high but looked like it was in our atmosphere. You could not see a shape to the craft but it did appear to have lights that changed colors from different greens to blues and purples. The glow to a star is hazy, but on this craft it seemed to have beams of light projecting out that moved in a circle. The craft moved like nothing I had ever seen manmade. It stayed in a general area, but moved as a bug would, zig zag motions. It moved incredibly fast from spot to spot, stopping occasionally, and then continuing to move. We stopped watching the craft after it seemed to stop moving for about 10 minutes. We checked the next night at the same time but the craft was not there in relation to two stars it had stayed with in a changing triangular shape.<n>

I was in the passenger seat.  Myself, the driver and another passanger all saw the same thing.  We kept seeing this really bright light over the road several miles ahead.  It was in the middle of nowhere and at first we thought it was some kind of plane, or airport.  But then we kept seeing it going back and forth so we figured that it was an overpass and we were seeing trucks cross over.  But when we got closer we realized it was something else.  It was literally swooping right through the traffic -which was fairly heavy considering it was 3:32 am in the middle of nowhere.  It had 3 bright white lights and when it would swoop from east to west over the highway it would shine an incredible bright beam down onto the road and surrounding ground.  Then after it swooped through the traffic and rose again the beam and the 3 white lights would go off and it would turn to one red blinking light.  It was not blinking consistently the same.  The speed at which the red light was blinking was changing, sort of like Morse code and I wondered if it was some sort of pattern.  Then it would flip around and back to the starting point.  I&#39;ve NEVER seen anything move like that.  It was truly bizarre.  It turned in all directions, end over end and side over side.  It was very graceful and smooth.  It didn&#39;t jump at all.  It kept repeating this pattern.  We passed under it and kept traveling south.  When we drove under it, it was very high up with the red blinking light and it was flipping back to the starting point again.  We watch it make several passes.  At least 10.  We continued to watch it until we were out of site.  We travel back through the area almost exactly 48 hours later, there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies a date of July 27, 2001.

7/27/01 02:55|New York City|NY|Oval|approximately one hour|On July 27,2001 I saw lights that outlined a large oval from which three other bright white lights detached and flew away. from|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18697.html|52|ndxe200107| On July 27,2001 I saw lights that outlined a large oval from which three other bright white lights detached and flew away. from<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was locking the doors and putting out the lights on my roof terrace which overlooks New Jersey and the Hudson River. It was a beautiful night with small clouds and patches of sky in between.  There was an oval of diffused white light which appeared to be coming from behind the clouds.  Only th outline or the rim of the object was illuminated. It seemed as if it were over New Jersey, but I could not see any beams of light coming up from the ground. I moved away from the door and windows to turn out the terrace lights--literally an instant--and when I looked again it was gone.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden I could see it again.  It appeared as if it switched the lights on and off and had been there all the time.  It had just not been illuminated which is why I could not see it.When the lights came on again, they started off a soft lavender color and then went to pink and possibly green.  Again very diffused soft colors.  Photographs I have seen of the aurora borealis came to mind.  But this light was stationery.  No movement  The first time this light turned off was 3:04 in the morning. I believe it turned off once or twice again. I believe that one time it turned off when a helicopter went down the Hudson River.  After the helicopter was out of sight three balls of light (one at each end of the oval and one in the middle) flew away from the central light and instantly disappeared. They flew faster then any plane  I have ever seen.  I believe this happened at least three times.  The closest visual analogy I could make is the huge craft that the scientists played the music for in &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&#34;  As a matter of fact this object looked exactly the same.  My friend was sleeping soundly during this so I called WCBS and ABC (whose studios overlook the same  part of New Jersey as I do ). I wanted to see if anyone else had phoned in after seeing this.  The people at both numbers were polite but obviously didn&#39;t believe me.  At 3AM I&#39;m sure that many of th! eir call s are from people who are far from sober.  My friend heard me on the phone and woke up.  I excitedly told him what had happened, but since there was nothing in the sky now he had difficulty understanding what I was talking about.  However, as we were watching the sky, I saw a faint light, then two.  Once I brought them to his attention, he could see them, but since he hadn&#39;t seen the entire object as I had, they didn&#39;t mean much to him.  As I noticed a third light appearing, they suddenly flew off whoosh into the skies behind us. That he saw.  He couldn&#39;t figure out any logical explanation either nor could I.  I am aware that people in Virginia and some of the other southeastern states had seen something which was described as a fireball in the week prior to my experience.  What I saw was nothing like a fireball.  It was almost as if someone were projecting a slide from &#34;Close Encounters&#34; onto the clouds. I am retired, although I am only 55 years old.  I was the president of a company which  manufactured women&#39;s clothing. The most unusual thing I have ever seen in the sky was what I believe was a fireball over the Pacific off Tahiti.  The reason it was described as a fireball was that it looked like a bright meteor travelling horizontally.  What I saw over New Jersey was not a natural phenomena.  It was perfectly shaped and would appear and disappear as if someone were flipping a switch. I am terribly interested in knowing if anyone else saw this that night.  There are millions of people in New York.  Granted few are looking at the sky at 3AM, but someone had to see this.  It was huge.  I would also like to know about other sightings of objects similar to this. In the space for number of craft seen, I answered four.  I decided on this figure because I saw one huge craft and no more than three others at any one time.  However because three craft flew off at least three times, I have no way of knowing if they were different craft each time.<n>

I was sleeping outside with my two kids - 10/6 under the stars in the back yard. We have a very private backyard - lots of trees/terraces and up against the mountain. The view from the yard is great, with the lake and the City below. It was totally clear warm mid-summers night and we looked at the various constellations and spotted satellites and fell asleep at about midnight.I woke up in the middle of the night - about 2:00 a.m., and immediately had a notion for whatever reason to turn my head and look to the north. I saw what appeared to be an extremely bright object traversing the sky in a north to south direction. I thought at first it was an extremely low satellite as it had no flashing lights whatsoever, just a continuous bright light like a streetlight again at about 100 yards or so. But it was so bright I wasn&#39;t really sure what it was. There was no noticeable noise. All of a sudden after watching for about 8-10 seconds, the object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky, and either slowly went out - just like turning off a TV that is heated up - the light/picture goes very rapidly smaller, or it just took off at an extreme speed in the opposite direction. This all took place in a span of maybe 15 seconds. When it &#34;disappeared&#34;, my daughter who was unbeknownst to me awake and obviously observing the same thing, commented &#34;Dad, what was that&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m really scared right now&#34;. I also experienced a very odd sensation right after the sighting. It felt eerie to me. Almost a feeling of dread.

7/27/01 00:45|Meridian|ID|Diamond|30 Sec. - 2 hours|Three Head Lights, Plasma bottom, Different colors, Bizzar flying Patterns, 2 encounters almost exactly 1 year apart.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18692.html|54|ndxe200107| Three Head Lights, Plasma bottom, Different colors, Bizzar flying Patterns, 2 encounters almost exactly 1 year apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 27th, 2001 While Driving Home From my GirlFriends house at 12:45, I was heading northbound on Meridian Road in between Ustick and McMillan.  While coming to the stop sign at the intersection of Meridian and McMillan I saw a Green light coming from the field northwest of the intersection. It was about 50 feet high in the air, moving parallel with McMillan about 40 feet north of the road.  It was coming towards me and then the Green light dissapated.  I could still tell their was an object flying in the sky and when it came to the point where it was going to cross meridian road, it banked and turned 180 degrees and was then heading west.  I was probably fifty yards from the craft.  Then, the belly of this diamond craft lit up like white lava and radiated very bright light on the ground.  As soon as the craft lit up, it dived for the ground and then pulled up back to about 50 feet from the ground.  Then the plasma light on the belly completely shut off.  I saw It then bank, and turn another 180 degrees and it was coming towards me again, still moving parallel with McMillan coming towards meridian road.  Then the Front of the craft illuminated it&#39;s front &#34;Head Lights.&#34;  It had three very large lights on the front of the craft.  The lights remind me of lights in a Football stadium.  The middle light was slightly higher then the other Lights on each side.  Then the Diamond shaped UFO started to radiate colors from the end of its wings.  Not blinking lights like an airplane, But slowly appearing light that gradually became brighter in color.  I beleive the first color was blue, then red then green.  It took about 5-7 seconds for each color to come on very dim, gradually become brighter and then dim out-to start the next color.  After the green color on the edges of the UFO dimmed, the front headlights shut off, the UFO banked and turned again, the belly lit up and the CYCLE repeated itself.  Instantly I knew I had encountered it again.  Absolutely nobody was on the desolate farming roads except for me.  I had a sensation ! of an ov erwhelming feeling that I needed to leave the area ASAP.  The only logical thing I could think of doing was to drive where lots of people were, so I headed towards boise down McMillan street at a very fast pace. July 28 2000. While coming home from work at 1:20 in the morning on a late thursday night (Friday morning),  I saw the exact same UFO I had just described.  Except this was the first time I had ever encountered a UFO.  The exact coloring, shape, plasma bottom, three head lights and the cycles of going in circles  were all the same.  But, I didn&#39;t recognize it untill I pulled into my driveway at home.  It was probably 100 yards away from me and the three headlights (It was so bright, that Is all I could see)was coming straight for me.  I scrambled inside of my house, and paced back in forth in disbeleive of what it was.  I  kept seeing the craft fly about 30 feet high off of the ground on my street where my house resides.  I quickly woke my father up to tell hime about the flying crafts outside of our house.  He woke up and walked outside with me.  Nothing was their.  He went back to bed thinking I was insane.  About 20 minutes later I heard the distinct humming noise this diamond craft makes and I immediately went back to wake my father up.  We went outside again and the craft was farther off in the distance.  Within a minute or so the craft was in our back yard, doing the cycles and my dad was so scared, he ran in the house (of course I did too).  We peeked out of our windows and watched the craft for about an hour and a half, going back and forth inside and outside.  While watching the UFO, it did it&#39;s cycles in three spots within about a couple of miles.  The first cycle was right near our house.  Then the craft would fly about 2 miles southeast and do some cycles  there.  Then the UFO would go directly west and do more cycles and then come back to our house, (northeast) and continue its cycles.  Three different spots of continuous cycles and then repitition.  This lasted for nearly 2 hours..... The UFO was quiet large.  I would say it is bigger then an average size home, Especially the width.  For how big it was, It meandered through the air like a hang-glider.  For something that big to be flying 50-60 feet off of the ground and turning around and diving towards the ground, ruled out any logical explanation of what I think it could be.  I also realized that when I had come across the UFO for the second time, it was one day away from being exactly one year from when I saw the first one.  The only thing I can conclude, is that both experiences happend on the last thursday night (Early friday morning) of July 2000 and July 2001<n>

I was sitting at the passenger seat and as we passed I look behind and it was still sitting there without movement.  The object seemed to be at the same hight as an usual plane would be. we went around the corner and it was out of our site.<n>

I was standing in my backyard when I observed a glowing white object approaching from the west and traveling east.  I thought at first that it was a plane as I live near Metro Airport.  As the object got closer I could see that it was not a plane.  It reminded me of a long neon light tube and glowed in the same manner.  This was not reflected light.  It moved in a straight line from west to east at a slow steady pace.  There was no sound and it seemed to be at a much greater altitude than the planes that fly overhead.  By the time I ran into the house to get my camcorder it had disappeared from sight.  This object was midway between the horizon and overhead as I faced in a southerly direction.  Skies were clear blue and it was still daylight, a few whispy clouds.  I am no longer a skeptic.<n>
7/26/01 19:50|Denver|CO|Oval|10 minutes|Two solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the wind|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18677.html|61|ndxe200107| Two solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the wind<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several friends and I were taking a break from remodeling a newly-purchased duplex in northwest Denver, standing on the porch and chatting.  I am a sales professional and the other witnesses are business owners and real estate investors, all in our mid-thirties.  There had been some nearby thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, with sporadic sprinkles and a cool breeze.  At 7:20 the sky was partly cloudly, with more storm clouds beginning to develop and move in from the mountains.  As I was facing east, I noticed a tiny black dot in the sky about 20 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and appearing to move west very slowly.  I observed that it was not a bird, so I said to my friends, &#34;Look, there&#39;s a UFO&#34; and pointed.  I said it was probably a helicopter, but whatever it was, at this point it was a UFO, and my most skeptical friend said, &#34;Yes, exactly, it&#39;s an &#39;unidentified flying object,&#34; with a little laugh.  It &#34;drifted&#34; our direction much like a balloon would, and initially, that&#39;s what I judged it to be.  As it got closer to being overhead, I could see that it was actually not a balloon.  It was moving in a very deliberate fashion against the wind. The clouds were not moving fast by any means, but they were slowly drifting eastward, while this object moved steadily westward.  I grabbed some binoculars from inside and another of my friends had binoculars in her car, so she ran and grabbed them, and we watched as the object flew directly overhead.  Only two of us were incredibly interested in the sighting, so we looked at it through our binoculars.  I considered it to be football-shaped, and she thought it oval.  It was a dark reddish-brown colour -- very solid and not self-luminous.  But as it went over, we both saw a pinpoint light flash on the middle of the bottom surface a few times.  &#34;Did you see that flash?&#34; I yelled, still looking through the binoculars, and she said, &#34;Yes, I definitely saw a flash!&#34;  At that point, we both felt sure that this was not an explainable event.  We cou! ldnt&#39; fi gure out, of all things, what would present itself like this.  Not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a blimp, but an apparent ovoid-type craft with a single light which flashed just a few times, which we could only see when it was overhead.  It still appeared to be &#34;floating&#34; like a balloon, without slowing or changing directions, but more with intention.  From the time I spotted it to the time it disappeared into the clouds to the west, it was probably close to 5 minutes, though we didn&#39;t keep track on a watch.  We both estimated the altitude of the object at between 1 to 2 miles, but it was hard to judge.  I figured it must have been about 20 to 30 feet in length and probably 2/3rds as wide, and it was traveling in the direction of it&#39;s longest length.  Again, the true size is hard to judge, but the apparent size was approximately one centimeter at an arm&#39;s length as it flew overhead.  When we lost sight of it, we both chatted excitedly about what we had seen for a few minutes, and then I spotted another apparently-identical craft directly south of our location, moving west.  It was on a trajectory about 20 degrees south of the first object, so it did not pass directly overhead as the first one did.  We lost sight of it within a minute as it flew right into a cloud, and never did catch this one through binoculars.  But it looked like the same type of object and it was moving at the same apparent speed as the first one, and in the same direction.  Once again, I looked at the clouds to confirm their movement, and they were driftly slowly eastward.  So whatever these UFOs were, they were deliberately flying westward at a steady rate of speed.<n>

I woke up to use the bathroom and walked into the bathroom facing the window, as I entered the bathroom a bright bluish light outside my window, caught my eye.  I moved toward the window without turning on the light and watched as the spherical blue light moved in a spiral motion heading west directly toward me, moving very quickly.  It continued it&#39;s corkscrew spiral right over my house, I heard no sound or engine noise, just a woosh of air as it went right over the roof tops.  I moved to the window in my bedroom but it was gone.  The light seemed to strobe in unison with the corkscrew spiral motion but this could have been an optical illusion due to it&#39;s motion.  As a former Marine Aviation Ordinanceman I can tell you that the US Military does NOT have anything that can fly like that.<n>

As I drove east on Hatcher Road to my home on 19th Street (last street on the mountain) I saw a bright object that looked somewhat like a Goodyear blimp, but it was covered with lights...multi-colored lights.   And it seemed to be traveling at a faster speed than a blimp.  It was about 3 blocks away at about 200&#39; in the air.  I thought it was going to land on the roof of my home, but it continued in a northeast direction across the mountain.  The area is in the Dreamy Draw area of northeast Phoenix.  I am 5a 56 year old grandmother of 12 and have never witnessed anything like this before.  I immediately called Phoenix Police Department to report what I had seen.  They directed me to call Sky Harbor Airport.  Sky Harbor said there were no blimps in the area and directed me to call UFO reportings at a 480 area code number.  I have been trying to find out all day what this could be.  I am curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for the same area for July 23rd and 24th.  We presumed that the sightings were caused by a blimp advertising beer, but we no longer feel that these sightings are explained by a blimp.  PD))<n>

When something caught my eye.  I said out loud what the heck is that.  My first thought was it was baloons.  I was looking to the NW.  I grabed my biculors, the object was dark grey and very long. appr. 6&#34; from top to bottom, and 1 1/2&#34; wide.  It was moving very slowely and going up in a spiral direction straight up.  There was no marking on the object. When it would turn 1/2 way around, I could make out a red and green ball at top and middle of object.  Then the object changed shape and looked like a plane banking and turning in a circle at which time it would go around once and turn back into the shape that is going straight up.  I thought it was a group of balloons that were different sizes.  You could only see the red and green baloons when it would turn completely half way around.  It was still going straight up.  it would make two turns and then change into a plane.  After it had changed three times I lost sight of it as it went into the clouds.  Very dark grey with no marking I could make out. It moved very slow, and moved straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite credible.  The apparent size of the object was somewhere between the &#34;size of the sun and the size of a star.&#34;  It almost certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft.  The event occurred at 8:30 p.m.; we have amended the date here.  PD))<n>

It was very odd in shape I have never seen such a strange craft before my parents and my brother heard it too but they didn&#39;t saw it. I am a 27th years old white female and a graphic Artist. I never believed in UFO’s. I am not even sure these two aircrafts were UFO’s it could have been from the Air force a new type of aircraft which I have never seen before.

It&#39;s position was near the Bellingham Airport. Above it. The object remained stationary and seemed to have another smaller object hovering near it. Smaller object was undiscernable except for the sun reflecting off of it. The Larger ufo object was highly noticeable because of the brightness of the sunlight that was reflecting from it. I did not see it move at all, but it was appearing be about 1000 feet in altitude. I got tired of looking at it after 20 minutes because it was hard to look at because of the brightness, then when I looked again it was gone. and the smaller light reflecting object was gone also. I could not discern any details about the craft except for it&#39;s basic saucer like shape and twas metallic and reflecting light. also was  fairly large because it was  a ways away, maybe not over a half mile, but I couldnt be sure.. Seemed like it was more like 1-2 miles in distance from me. The airport was  about a mile from my position at the time. The smaller object may have been a helicopter, butI couldnt hear a thing.<n>

At first i thought it might be some kind of gull that one often sees around a land fills.  as i strained to identify the object i noticed several more, flying in circles around the first.  The more intensely i stared, the more orbs i noticed.  The harder i tryed to identify what they were the more i counted.  the origional one flew in a straight line with the others circleing around the first.  It almost appeared as though they were&#34;playing&#34;. i looked away on several occasions and looked back to see if i was just imagining this and i was able to located the group of &#34;orbs&#34; each time.  to my utter amazement I continued to watch for several mins. until my neck began to ache from looking straight up.  I looked away a last time and was never able to locate them again.  I have no idea what they were.  I know the were not birds, ballons or planes.  They appeared to be round, dull (not shiney or reflective) metalic looking objects that were flying under the control of someone or something.  Due to the elevation and haze i cannot tell you how big or small they were.

We live in a somewhat rural area, and also very close to an Aviation Tower, which directs airplanes, so at first i just thought it was a plane. But then when i noticed that for the moon being in the smallest part of it&#39;s phase, and it being very dark out, it was flying very close to tree level. Then when i noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving, i asked my sister if she thought that it seemed abnormal and i pointed out to her all of the things that i&#39;ve listed. The craft was directly over the woods next to my house, so as we were coming down our driveway, we both had a very good view of it. We both saw the lights on it and saw that it was circular shaped, and that it wasn&#39;t moving, it was just hovering there, and wasn&#39;t making any noise. When i came in my house, i stood at the kitchen window, and we could both see the lights coming over the treetops, and i waited for about ten minutes, because i knew that if it was a plane, then it would fly over, but after ten minutes, the lights didn&#39;t even seem to move, my neighbors might have seen this also, but i am 100% sure that we saw a ufo last night. I also noticed one more, VERY strange thing, the radio on my alarm clock did not work at all, i tried to change stations and i turned the volume all the way up and there was no sound whatsoever.<n>

Suddenly, the bright light went away, and two more fainter lights apeared. The lights moved around until they were in a triangular-shaped formation. Some lights apeared to fade out, but as we drove closer, we saw that they actually went behind a cloud, then reappeared. We also noticed that one of the lights was actually a jet, we could tell by two blinking red and white lights at either side. We could tell the other two lights weren&#39;t jets because they seemed to hang in the sky, and they had no other lights on them, like a jet probably would. By then we passed underneath the lights, and moved on. Other lights, unknown number, were noticed along the horizon, not known if they had anything to do with the lights seen before.<n>

I am reporting a different shape, but in such a close time-frame and geographic location that it tends to make me think we probably saw the same craft, about a half hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date:  July 23, 2001 Location:  Del Dios, just southwest of Escondido, CA, on Lake Hodges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather:  Clear, starry sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:40 PM (22:40), we (two of us) were alarmed by a loud, relatively high-pitched whine overhead outside of our house-- apparently an aircraft, on a descending path from the west.  The impression of &#34;descent&#34;-- increasing volume, i.e. sound from an incoming source-- was fast enough for my friend, who is an experienced pilot, to say that it sounded like it was in trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and spotted the craft to the north-northwest of us, at an apparent altitude of about four thousand feet, about 1/3 mile to the north of us, moving almost due east.  The whine of the engine had stabilized, and the craft was cruising slowly to the east.  My friend put shoes on and came out too.  What was visible were four blinking red and four continuous white lights in a kite-shaped pattern (I chose &#34;diamond&#34; &lt;&gt; shape out of your menu choices, but it had a shorter point to the front than to the back).  The craft filled the pattern of the lights-- that is, it was not an airplane body with wings sticking out.  Stars were blocked out (and reappeared) as they crossed the &#34;line&#34; from one pair of red &amp; white of lights to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The span &#34;across&#34; was at least comparable to the wingspan of a 737, with the length about one and a half times what would be expected.  My impression is that it was more like 1-1/2 times that size, but size and distance are tricky to estimate at night.  The craft was moving distinctly slower than a 737 on final approach, however-- i.e. at what should have been well below &#34;stall speed&#34; for any plane of its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in sight for about a minute and a half, in level or close to level flight, going almost due east, before it disappeared behind trees and a low ridge northeast of us.  That path would take it over the city of Escondido perhaps a mile north of the central downtown area.  It traversed one and a half to two miles of sky while it as visible, so its apparent speed was about 60 or 70 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound it made was like the whine of a turbine, with a &#34;beat&#34; in it on about a one to two second interval.  The beat was not, however, like the beat caused by wave interference from two or more sound sources slightly out of phase.  (I&#39;m a musician, with a decent knowledge of physics.)  I am reasonably sure the whine was from a single source, not multiple engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made me especially curious because of the many reports of &#34;triangles&#34;, whereas this was apparently kite-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned it to several friends the next day.  One of them said they had been on the coast highway around ten, and had seen something out over the ocean that they couldn&#39;t identify, but didn&#39;t pull over to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards, ((e-address deleted)).com PS: Since this is an &#34;old&#34; sighting, you may contact me if you wish, but I am not requesting it.<n>

Laguna Air Force Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a remote forest on the Pacific Coast Trail, about 500 yards south of Mt. Laguna Air Force Station, a black triangular craft was seen heading west towards Escondito, CA. The craft was so black that if it turned off it&#39;s blinking strobe lights, you could not have seen it in the night sky; just its outline. The craft had three red lights at each tip of the triangle.  These red lights flashed independently of each other.  A very deep low rumbling sound was associated with the sighting. The craft was flying very, very slowly, as if searching for something. I cannot give an estimate on the size, however I would say that it was larger than a normal airplane. The sky was 100 clear with no clouds and about 2 nights into the new moon. Also seen the next day in the area were 2 black helicopters with NO insignia or markings flying to a restricted military area north of where this sighting took place.<n>

We were listening to the Beach Boys concert at a nearby park and at least fifteen airplanes crossed the sky as usual with the normal sound of jets accompanying them.  All of a sudden, a very bright light crossed the sky ten times the speed of any aircraft I have ever experienced, stopped in midair for five seconds, and shot off in a completely different direction.  I sat speechless for a few seconds.  My husband finally said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  and I said, &#34;I think we just saw a UFO.&#34;  He has been talking about it ever since.  I waited so long to post this in the hopes that someone else saw the same thing.  Like it or not, there is a stigma attatched to this type of phenomenon.  I have been interested in ariel phenomena for years, have been granted a scholarship for astronomy and have attended the NASA &#34;space camp&#34;.

He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know how far South you can see, or if you can see this.  I&#39;m looking at some sort of object in the sky.&#34;  He told me that he was in the Les Schwab parking lot which is about 3/4 of a mile from my house.  He said it was a huge black triangle shaped thing with rounded corners, no lights, no wings, no landing gear, no rotor, no other visible details. I said that I was carrying my cordless and was running down the street, that I&#39;d keep talking as long as I could.  He said that it was moving very slowly, and that it changed directions, then started moving up.  Then I lost contact with him.  I ran a total of about 2.5 blocks from my house into the parking lot of a retirement home.  I looked toward the South and saw a black object in the sky.  It was still daylight, clear sky overhead with a few clouds to the South and West.  It was far enough away from me that I couldn&#39;t make out whether it was a triangle or a squashed diamond, but I could make out that it had corners at the widest part (wasn&#39;t a round ball and wasn&#39;t flat). I watched the object move very slowly up and to the South (a little bit East).  It seemed to be heading into a big high flat cloud.  Then before it entered the cloud, it changed directions.  It seemed to come back toward me and a bit to the West.  Then it went up and over the cloud, not through it.  Then it continued to move South and up, very slowly.  I watched it for a long time, probably at least 5 minutes, during which time my friend drove by looking for me.  He went to my house.  I walked backward through the parking lot to the street, keeping my eye on the object.  By the time he came back up the road from my house, it was almost too small to see. I called KEX radio in Portland to report it.  I was surprised that no one else had.  It was right over I-5 most of the time.  I also called the Oregonian news paper.  They also said that no one else had reported anything. My house is on several flight paths.  Small planes land and take-off from the Aurora airport to the South.  There&#39;s a helecopter company there too.  Also, jets fly overhead many times each day on route to/from the Portland International Airport, about 30 miles away.  So I&#39;m used to what aircraft and helecopters look like, how long they stay in view, and how they sound.  This thing stayed in view far longer than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen.  It left no trail, and did not move in a straight line, but rather kind of wandered a bit.  I heard no sound at all, but I would have expected to, if it were a plane or a helecopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have talked to the other witness to the same event, who was in a different location at the time of the sighting.  However, the two witnesses were communicating by telephone.  Triangulation on the location of the object may be possible.  PD))<n>
7/23/01 20:27|Wilsonville|OR|Triangle|5 min|Black rounded corner pyramid, or triangle moving slowly without lights, sound, or visible means of propulsion, Wilsonville, OR.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18597.html|90|ndxe200107| Black rounded corner pyramid, or triangle moving slowly without lights, sound, or visible means of propulsion, Wilsonville, OR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving West on Town Center loop road, looking to the South at 8:27 PM local time.  With the exception of a few high level clouds (cirrus), it was a clear day, 80 degrees.  Looking over the top of Fry&#39;s electronics in Wilsonville, I noticed what I first thought to be a black mylar baloon floating above the parking lot.  I looked again, and noticed that it was stationary even though there was a slight wind moving approximately 5 knots to the Southeast.  I looked again, and realized that it was not a baloon, but was much larger and farther away than I first thought.  I pulled into the Les Schwab parking lot on the North side of town center loop, stopped the car, and looked at it in more detail.  We get a lot of aircraft in our vicinity since we are essentially in the Northern approach to Aurora airport.  I thought that this might be one of the larger hellicopters that are operated by Evergreen Aviation, a Sykorski Sky-Crane, or similar. What struck me is that this thing was hovering , then moved toward the South.  There was no sign of the rotor on top (normally I can see the disk that&#39;s formed by the rotor), there were no lights of any type (strange, being in the Northern approach of the Aurora Airport, and within an hour of dusk), no sound, no protrusions out the side for wings, no tail, nothing.  I called on my cell phone to a friends house where I had just left.  I explained what I was seeing, (I told her as it was happening that it was hovering, then moving to the West, then moved upward, then away to the South again.  I asked if she could see it from her house (less than 1/4 mile away).  She ran out and looked where I was describing, I lost the signal from her cordless phone and drove back to her house.  I didn&#39;t find her at home, and decided that I must have passed her somewhere on the road without seeing her.  I back tracked my route and found her standing down the street pointing to it.  She said that It had continued to move away to the South and that she had watched it for 5 minutes.  I could no longer see it since it had just become a dot in the sky, and I had lost sight of it while driving.  She continued to watch it, until we decided that it had dissapeared into the distance, and drove back to her house. The best way to describe its shape is the following: I was viewing it primarily from the end rather than the bottom of the object.  It was roughly triangle shaped as viewed from the end, but had rounded corners on all three corners.  I described it to my friend as shaped like one of the black licorice candies you get at the theater.  When I was describing it to her on the phone earlier, I said it was like a pyramid shape, but with rounded corners.  My friend said that she saw it moving straight up, but that when she viewed it, that it had not gone into the clouds, but had continued to move upward, and had made a jog backward to avoid going through the clouds she saw.  We compared our timelines, and decided that the cloud I saw it go through was before she had arrived at a location where she could see it, and that when she watched it, it had continued to climb, but avoided the other clouds on its way up. Compared to all other aircraft we see in the Wilsonville area in and around airports, this thing moved really slowly.  I have experience being in and around aircraft, have flown in and piloted light aircraft including helicopters, and can not explain what I saw.  I think that several other people may have seen this object since it passed over Interstate 5 in the vicinity somewhere between Boone Bridge (Willamette River) and the Donald exit (5 miles to the south of Wilsonville).  If you need additional information (although I&#39;m not sure I can remember anything else of significance) you can contact me.<n>

But it was moving slowly at first and then it darted across the sky for about 1km. There was a passenger plane in the sky aswell but that was closer to the horizon.The light was basically directly above us when we first saw it. I thought it was a satterlite or something but the second time it darted it made a 90 degree turn and then it slowly faded away.<n>

My neighbor was visiting, so I did not experience this al|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18610.html|94|ndxe200107| This report is not a &#34;sighting&#34; of any UFO, but a happening that was strange. My neighbor was visiting, so I did not experience this alone. I am sitting inside, on my my recliner chair that faces north, my neighbor is sitting on the couch that faces east. We are simply in discussion of whatever subject and there&#39;s a flash of darkenss, such as when the power went out. The time was &#39;approximately&#39; 6:30 pm, and it was full sunlight outside, there were NO lights (electricity) on within the house (nor was it needed). This flash of darkness happened within a flash - estimate of time at a layman&#39;s guess was only about a second (somewhat to 1-2 blinks of an eye). At that time, my neighbor and I both spoke alarm with this inicident. It was as though the sunshine simply blinked out! Facts: (1) I live within 12 miles east of McChord AFB - granted there is military aircaft that flys over/around on occasion, BUT there was NO forwarning of any sound, which is always typical! This flash of darkness happpened WITHOUT warning (no sound effect(s). (2) I was sitting in my recliner facing north to a wall with the fireplace with peripheal vision on my left to the outdoors (sliding glass door) and my neighbor was facing east towards a halfway wall with a skylight on the cathredal ceiling. I have a huge living room window to her backside covered by a window shade. At any rate, I was requested to state this in hopes to relate to anyone else that may have experienced the same &#39;incident&#39;, hopefully to those living in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be unusually eloquent and credible.  She described the events in very objective, factual, and matter-of-fact fashion, and we suspect she is reporting quite accurately.  We have requested that the neighbor submit a report, as well.  We are baffled by this report, particularly because of the other reports from the west coast of Oregon, at approximately the same time.  PD))<n>

At about 1820 EDT Delta 434 and a couple of other aircraft reported to Wash Center (133.725) a large flaming falling object which left a visible contrail. The first report stated that a large ball of flame was noted passing by the aircraft at their 10 o&#39;clock position.  After the object passed by he reported a large, visible contrail along the object&#39;s downward path. The first aircraft reported the object as a daytime meteor. The object&#39;s downward movement and contrail was confirmed by at least three other aircraft. No geographic references were noted in any of the reports so I can&#39;t tell you exactly where this all happened. The freq serves the Wash Center sector around Gordonsville &amp; Flat Rock, just east of Richmond VA.<n>

Behind it was a cone of some sort coming to a point of orange.  I don&#39;t know whether it was fire, or vapor?  I knew the object was going extremely fast, for it travelled the length of my windshield in no time at all.  Also, it was below the clouds(ceiling).  I had enough time to hold up my hand, and determine it was the size of my thumbnail when my arm was fully extended, and the &#34;vapor&#34; behind it was approximately 4-6 inches across my windshield.

There were four in a sort of formation. There were also two or more off to the right and two to the left. The lights were so far off at first I thought I must be seeing stars even though it was the middle of the day. I watched very carefully and at times it was hard to see them. I actually stopped a lady walking down the street and asked her to look up. She described exactly what I was looking at without me describing it first. She said two of the lights were red. I only recall seeing one red. She also said she saw movement. I am positive I saw movement because the formation I saw changed shape. Not rapidly and not all four lights at once. There was a gradual but distinct and unmistakable shift over the course of ten minutes. I am postive of what I saw. These lights were suspended extremely high in the sky. There was a gradual controlled movement, and after approxamately ten minutes the lights dissapeared from my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means July 23, not July 24.

In my line of work, I am able to watch the entire metro skies from the roof of the heating plant , where I&#39;m employed. At 0330 this morning, I began looking for high altitute aircraft and weather patterns. My first observation was what looked like a satellite. It was moving slowly from Northwest to Southeast. I watched it&#39;s straight line path until it was out of sight . I then turned around to view west again and I saw a bright star-like object, traveling from west to east . It was to my north and as bright as Saturn. It was not an airplane. It had no flashing lights.  It appeared lower and larger than the satellite I had just seen, but higher than the hazy cloud patterns present. I was so amazed at this object and was semi- scared by it&#39;s appearance. Suddenly there was another object right behind the first. As if they were flying in formation. Both objects were on the same course and speed. The first object was brighter than the second and I watched   them disappear in the eastern sky. I have been in the military during Viet Nam and spent my entire life around airplanes. Never have I seen such craft. I sat down and was in semi-shock trying to measure what I had just seen. Then I noticed another satellite object coming towards me from the north. I watched it, until it vanished overhead. (no cloulds near) After straining to see where it might have gone, a small red flash appeared. I&#39;m thinking to myself now and wondering just what is going on...I radioed down to my work partner, to get upstairs and see the show that was going on. He arrived in two minutes and I explained my observations. He also has seen these on occasion and the couple he has observed didn&#39;t always move in a straight line but eratic patterns. We both began watching now and within two minutes I noticed another bright satellite object moving towards us from the west. I pointed it out to him and he caught sight of it, also. Then this object faded from a very bright light to nothing, r! ight abo ve us. Within less than an a hour, 12 objects were seen until cloud cover and the brightening sunrise took over.<n>

About 2;25 am on the 23rd, I was stargazing with the telescopes I brought along. In a clear sky,(no scopes, just my naked eyes), saw a triangular &#34;shadow&#34;, blocking the stars- it seemed to move at about the same velocity as a mid-sized passenger jet, low altitude, no noise. From my point, it seemed to bank right sharply for a short distance, and I lost sight of it. I would have difficulty trying to guess it&#39;s size and speed. And it did get me to surf the net for ufo information. I am not a crackpot, I have over 15 years past experience in the commercial airline refueling and managing a freight forwarding outfit for a dc-8 airline. And, I am into amateur astronomy as a hobby. I read a couple of reports from Virginia here, and I do know it was not a far-off missile. Whatever it was,( and it was not a stealth fighter-I am familiar with them also) it was solid, dark, and quiet. And it did operate much lower than the commercial planes I did view at much higher altitudes, and could hear their thrust even. I have no photos, and my wife was asleep.<n>

I was laying in bed at about 11:30pm, looking out the sliding glass door at the stars as I always do before going to sleep. I was about 6 feet from the door which is about 6 feet across. Then suddenly a pinpoint white light streaked across the span of the door so fast that it shocked me. It must have taken in my guess a fifth of a second or less to cross. I live way out in the country and frequently see falling stars, but I have never seen one travel this fast. I don&#39;t guess that anyone else could have seen it, but I thought I&#39;d pass it along just the same.<n>

This is off of Highway 97.  I am a 17 year old male and my friend is an 18 year old male.  We were sitting on the dock of the lake and at about 10:30 PM, I noticed up in the SSE part of the sky a bright flash and a Orange fireball appeared about 1/12 the size of a full moon.  The fireball lasted about 10 seconds while leaving a small trail of orange and a orange haze around it.  My friend noticed it about 5 seconds after I had.  It then changed just in to an extremely bright star looking craft and zigzagged and swerved for about another 30 seconds or so until it disappeared over the horizon.  The craft didn&#39;t seem to have any sort of pattern to its flight path.  It went north and just was flying erratically.  I have seen 2 other sightings in hte past.  Neither where the craft actually entered the atmosphere.  There is no way that this could of been any sort of spacerock.  The object entering the atmosphere was too big and it was moving after it went through the atmosphere.  To my knowledge this could not have been any sorty of human made craft because after going through the atmosphere it wasn&#39;t flying straight.  Also I don&#39;t know why an human made craft would enter our atmosphere, or leave it over Oregon, because there is no aerospace base nearby.<n>

The plane shifted left and the object followed. The plane manuevered back and forth twice more and the object seperated and moved North. Another &#39;thing&#39; seperated from the object and disappeared. It wasn&#39;t a flash of light or engine type light, but was also grey in color and smaller; same as the first seperation. The object seemed to wobble, or tightly zig zag a bit, and flew a pinky finger length North. My daughter and I were very excited and I turned to glance at her. When I looked back, the object was suddenly a full hand width back toward the West moving three times as fast and seemed to have a &#39;light tail&#39;.

The plane shifted left and the main object followed. The plane manuevered back and forth twice more and the main object seperated and moved North. Another &#39;thing&#39; seperated from the object and disappeared. It wasn&#39;t a flash of light or engine type light, but was also grey in color and smaller; same as the first seperation. The main object seemed to wobble, or tightly zig zag a bit, and flew a pinky finger length North. The plane continued West heading in direction over Hurlburt AFB airfield. My daughter and I were very excited and I turned to glance at her. When I looked back, the object was suddenly a full hand width back toward the West moving three times as fast and seemed to have a &#39;streak tail&#39;. The airplane had already disappeared behind the trees which border Hurlburt Air Force Base, and the object then disappeared as well. Neither one of us actually saw the object turn so can&#39;t comment on that. Been skywatching a long time, haven&#39;t seen anything quite like that. I can be contacted at: ((e-address deleted))<n>

I believe it was a Sunday afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in between sets weight lifting sets and I staring out the window.  As I looked up, I noticed saw a small airplane (propeller) crossing the sky.  I was facing south west and the sun was going behind some buildings.  It was a clear day.  Few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the small plane fly over (it was headed NW), I noticed what looked like one of those small mylar balloons pass between my view and the low flying plane.  I got up from my weight machine and walked over to the window to get a better look.  What was strange was that it was difficult to focus in on.  They seemed out of focus to me.  I could see that there was something there but I had a hard time keeping my eye on it.  But I kept staring at it expecting it to move with whatever way the wind was blowing.  But it didn&#39;t move in any particular direction.  It simply seemed to float around a very small area in the sky.  I don&#39;t think one of those silver mylar baloons would do that.  They would probably float away.  But this &#34;orb&#34; did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was reflecting light but I think it was somewhat &#34;bright&#34;.  Here is the weird part.  Once I got used to looking at it, all of a sudden other orbs &#34;popped&#34; out at me.  They all seemed to be floating around each other.  They didn&#39;t cross paths or move over each other, but they did seem to waver around a bit.  They were all shiny and somewhat &#34;bright&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve since thought about it and realized that the setting sun might have had something to do with why they &#34;popped&#34; out into my view.  I think increased infrared light from the lowering sun has something to do with being able to &#34;see&#34; them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve since seen the Mexico City ufo video footage and realized that my orbs look just like those UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t need to be contacted by an investigator but if you want to call please feel free to do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a camera on me while I was working out.

I saw a bright object that seemed to change shape. I called out my 13 yr. old son. While he kept track, I got out the binoculars. Using them, it seemed that there were several smaller bright objects clustered. Since it was moving in the general direction of the one high cloud(although at a different speed), Maybe a weather balloon? Another bright single starlike object came into the binocular view. This thing approached then went by the first thing. This was at a right angle to the direction of the first object. I&#39;m 45 yrs. old., and a manager at a grocery store. My son will go into the eighth grade this September. Total time observing the first object is about 20 minutes. The second object came and went within 1 to 2 minutes.

This sighting was made at Barnum Lake, near Thunder Bay, Ontario on Sunday morning, on July 22, 2001.

The brite white lights were situated one infront of the other.I first thought that maybe they were satellites.But they seemed much closer and larger in size than a a typical satelite.They were a continuous white light,no strobes or colors.However, there did seem to be a beam of light out infront of the leading light.This also was just a white beam. It was very still and quiet outside at the time of this sighting and I could not hear any sound that indicated any type of aircraft.Theonly way I can tell you distance between the two lights is if you were to see the lights,hold our hand streight out at arms length away and fill the space between the lights using your fingers.It was about two fingers to fill that gap.If that tells ya anything whatsoever?The one charactoristic that it did have equal to that of a satellite is that as it moved Eastword,the intensity of the light changed.As if to say it wasnt reflecting as much light as it was when it was overhead. Could this have been the space shuttle and station? My back was to the south,and I was looking north as it passed from west to east.<n>

The lights and the swath were moving accross the sky under the Milky Way, and they retained their relative positions to each other. That is, the lights lined up in the direction of travel, and the swath out in front not quite in line with the lights, and not touching the lights.  Also, as to the quality of the lights, one of we who saw it noticed that they did not flicker as stars do, but were brighter and had a steady light.  As to the swath, it was three or more times longer than the space between the lights and maybe a third the lights space apart in width.  The slightly uneven shape of the swath did not change in shape or quality, and the whole unit, which had no apparrent body besides the lights themselves, moved steadily toward the horrizon.  From midheaven to horizon I estimate about three minutes. It was seen by two parties of two on the island(Madaline) at that time and by young campers two hours away near Manitowish Waters, though the campers reports are less specific and are second hand as told to their captain.  Around 2:30--3:00 AM<n>

It was a very clear sky without moonlight so the stars were very visible.  Took dog for a walk in a large field and took the opportunity to stargaze. Immediately noticed movement low on the Northern horizon.  Braced myself against a fence to make sure the two lights were in fact moving.  I estimate a low flying object no more than 1000 feet altitude and 200 feet in diameter (large).  The trailing light was at about 35 degrees lower than the leading light and this attitude and orientation was constant.  Both lights were white and steady and I could make out a very light white or light blue light arc of light or forward rim on the leading edge, suggesting a saucer shape.  There was no sound and the movement was rather slow for an aircraft.  I counted 10 seconds and judged it at about a 1/2 mile... -180 mph.  At its closest it appeared to pass within a 1000 yards of me (a fence stood between me and a high school football field, so I had a decent basis of comparison).  At this closest point I had a horrible few seconds during which it appeared to stop moving forward and seemed to be getting either bigger or closer.   It did however, slowly proceed northeast without a sound.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 more minutes before it was gone, low on the northeast horizon past Palatine and towards Mt. Prospect. Interestingly, I realized I was hearing a &#34;wooshing&#34; of air shortly afterwards.  I saw no aircraft in the sky at all, but there was no mistaking the sound of a subsonic jet passing overhead, but not like any I had ever heard.  It sounded extremely low and &#34;muffled.&#34;.  There were no chem-trails (I was looking for chem.-trails to appear from the first craft).  My watch read 3:05AM.  This too was followed by a distant, low rumble, which I presume to have been a high altitude supersonic aircraft, again unlike any I had ever heard and much more subtle than the ones I have heard.  Although I have no explanation for the first craft, I speculate that the last two craft were chase planes -one subsonic following closely and the other supersonic circling at a distance.  The sounds clearly occurred over to great an expanse of time to be physically connected to one another or the siting. This is the second siting of &#34;unknowns&#34; I have recently enjoyed while walking my dog.  I hate the idea that such phenomenon is commonplace above our suburban skies.  I expect to see other reports of this night&#39;s occurrence here.  It was the most remarkable thing I&#39;ve ever seen and heard.<n>

The white color was only on the outside of the light almost like a very thin, dull halo. I did not see an actual metallic disc but light in the shape of a disc like it was was glowing. It stayed still in the same spot for about 12-15 seconds. Then towards the top of it the light brightened a white color and then the object just vanished. I did not turn my head, look back and then it was gone. I had my eyes on it the whole time and it just vanished.<n>

There were also two bright greenish spheres moving wildy around the orange sphere. Note, I could see this clearly without optical aid. When I used my husband&#39;s binoculars, each bright greenish spheres looked like tiny v- shaped objects when they appeared in front of the orange sphere. When the bright greenish objects moved wildly on the sides and top of the orange sphere, they appeared to be spherical. I continued to watch with and without binoculars. There was a bright flash and the orange sphere split into 2. The bottom half appeared to have dropped to the ground and the top half disappeared. One green sphere headed to the north at a fast rate of speed and the other green sphere stayed in the general vicinity of where the orange sphere had been and seemed to move wildly around that area. I continued to watch the green sphere until 11:15 pm. The mosquitos were getting too bad for me so I went to the car. My husband stayed to watch it for a longer period of time.<n>

There were no other lights surrounding the object; there were CLEARLY no standard regulation aircraft beacons, strobes, or wingtip red/green lights, and the object made no discernable sound. If an aircraft, it was certainly not an ordinary one. OBJECT 2: Approx 1 minute after disappearance of object 1, same type amber light appeared in same location and began same northward track. Approximately thirty seconds after appearing, object flashed very brightly white -- looking similar to a very bright set of aircraft landing ligts -- approximately a half dozen times in rapid succession -- then continued on same original course. When object was to our east-northeast, a tiny deep red point of light appeared below the object and proceeded downward to disappear in the treetops below. Some comments were that it looked like someone dropping a flare. OBJECT 3:  After object 2 had &#34;dropped its flare&#34; and was tracking off  to the northeast, another amber light of the same type appeared in the north. It too performed the same flashing of bright white lights. And, it also &#34;dropped flares&#34; -- three times -- before disappearing in the southeast. OBJECT 4: Four to five minutes after the disappearance of object 3, as the crowd was abuzz with discussion of that we had seen, one more amber light -- this one somewhat dimmer that the first three -- appeared in the south-southwest. This one had an additional feature the others had lacked; two  blue-green pinpoint lights which appeared to be circling the amber light. The entire complex slowly tracked westward toward the tree line, while seeming to bounce and weave in an unpredictable manner. The complex eventually disappeared into the trees, then reappeared on other side of trees several minutes later, still bouncing and weaving. This persisted for several more minutes until a muffled &#34;popping&#34; sound was heard, the amber light disappeared, another deep red point light dropped toward the ground, and one of the blue-green point lights rapidly accelerated off to the northwest and disappeared. The remaining blue-green point light remained in the same general location, bouncing and weaving back and forth within the space of a few degrees of arc, for another 90 minutes or so, at which time the reporter departed the scene for the evening. notes: This was reporter&#39;s first ever personal sighting of a UFO. Report is based on naked eye observation only -- had no binoculars or camera.<n>
7/21/01 22:05|Osceola (Town of, near Long Lake)|WI|Sphere|3 hours +|Large hazy amber orb with two bright greenish-blue orbs circling object wildly.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18553.html|130|ndxe200107| Large hazy amber orb with two bright greenish-blue orbs circling object wildly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I and at least 50 witnesses were out at Long Lake Recreational Area outside near the north end of Long Lake (located east of Fond du Lac County). At approximately 10:05 p.m., a series of very unusual events began occurring and continued late into the early morning hours. At 10:05 p.m., we were looking south and could plainly see the planet Mars off the southern horizon. Slightly east of this location, a large bright amber colored light rose straight up from behind a forest of trees in the distance. The object went up approximately 25 degrees off the horizon and moved in a northerly direction at about the speed of a fast moving airplane. As it was removing, it seemed to drop round orbs of amber colored lights. It continued and disappeared in the northern horizon. As it disappeared, a second object reappeared exactly as before and followed the exact path as the first object. This object also headed north and seemed to stop before the northern horizon. At this point, a third object rose again at the same exact starting point as the other two. It rose up and became extremely bright white and accelerated in a northerly direction in the same path as the previous two. Along its path several times, it seemed to flare up bright and dim and several times it seemed to drop amber balls of light. As it approached close to the second light, the second light blinked out and the third light continued northerly and finally blinked out. This series of events started at 10:05 to 10:20 pm. At this point, everything seemed to calm down. At this point, we were excited but some of us felt these 3 events could perhaps be described as airplanes or pyrotechnic devices, therefore, no one seemed to draw irrational conclusions. This was only the beginning of several strange events that were to follow. At approximately 10:35 pm, a 4th amber ball of light rose from the general location as the previous three. At this time, the fourth light however headed westerly instead of northerly and seemed to hover approximately 30 degrees off the southern horizon and was blocked by trees approximately the first 20 degrees. Now the object after it headed west seemed to head north directly toward us and became quite large, approximately the size of a small finger fingernail at arm&#39;s length. At this time, became extremely white bright and then extradionary the orange&#39;s object seemed to have a definite halo or fog around it. Outside of this halo were two distinct bright greenish-blue tiny orbs that continued to circle and rotate wildly around the object. At times, the two greenish-blue orbs would seem to stop directly in front of the object and at times, they would stop and change direction wildly. Other times, they would circle around the top or bottom or around the side of it. This wild movement continued for approximately 35 minutes and was seen by at least 50 witnesses, some had video cameras and still cameras. After approximately 35 minutes, a major event occurred. At this time, the large amber object seemed to split into two. One piece shot directly down towards the ground and was covered by the trees. The second piece seemed to disappear. At this time, one of the intense greenish blue orbs &#34;shot&#34; directly up and northward at an extremely high rate of speed covering the sky from where it had been to the northern horizon in perhaps 8 seconds. The other greenish-blue orb continued to stay in the general area above where the amber orb seemed to have descended or crashed to earth. The time now was approximately 11:15 pm. The one remaining greenish-blue orb continued to move wildly up and down, side to side doing circles and loops but stayed in the general close area. The single orb continued to move wildly into the early morning hours. Unfortunately, I left for home approximately 12 midnight and drove home. Several friends of mine stayed until 1:30 am and the object was still there and doing its wild dance. I don&#39;t know how long this continued because most people left near or at this time. During all these events, I had a 35mm camera equipped with a 450 mm lens mounted on a heavy duty tripod and was using 1600 ISO rated color print film. While looking through the view finder and centering the object in the microprism, I could clearly see the object move wildly and I know my camera wasn&#39;t moving nor was I. I shot approximately 30 shots of film during both major events, the first three and the fourth. Also, I used a 10x50 BAK4 optics glass binoculars meant for astromonical use and viewed the object. Clearly, I could see what appeared to be an envelope of haze or fog that surrounded the amber light. The two greenish-blue lights appeared clearly and extremely bright and very distinct with no haze whatsoever surrounding them. The greenish-blue orbs reminded me of what appeared to be bees flying around the object in a nonrestrictive orbit, changing directions and paths many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several reports.

The object moved across the sky and at several different points it lit up even brighter. Then it dropped something orange several times. I saw 3 of these types of objects at approximately 5 minute intervals. After they got a certain distance they seemed to fade and disappear. None of these 3 objects made any noise. At approximately 10:20PM at the same location I saw a smaller orange object and two blue objects coming from the side of the lake I was on. The two blue objects were circling around the orange object. They looked like they were dancing in the sky. They moved across the sky for a short distance,then seemed to hover and circle around each other. This happened for approximately 5-10 minutes. Then one of the blue lights shot across the sky at an amazing speed, and at the same time the orange light fell straight down. The one blue light that was left hovered in it&#39;s position by itself for over a half hour. There were atleast 20 other people who saw these objects. They definately were not airplanes, hot air balloons, or kites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and his wife, both of whom submitted written reports of their sighting.

The fourth craft then split into three distinct objects. one blue/green ligh stayed stationary inthe south/west sky. the red/orange light drop straight to the ground. the other blue/green light shot of the north at high spped. the stationary light was still visible in the sky when we left at about 2315-2330<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and her husband, both of whom submitted written reports of their sighting.  Both parties appear to be exceptionally good observers, and both seem to be quite eloquent, and serious minded, individuals.  They were standing with an estimated 50 other observers to the phenomenon at the time of the sighting.  The witnesses estimated that the first three red &#34;balls of light traveled from the southern sky to the northern sky, passing through an arc of an estimated 160 degrees, in approximately 10 seconds.

The second light was smaller. The bigger light would pulsate and grow very dim and then bright again. It moved from side to side and up and down. It would move in a circle and turn a green color. The smaller object would follow it everywhere it moved and was on its right side or to the north of the larger object. We watched for about two hours through binoculars. Through the binoculars when this light grew dim we could see the dark shape of a disc. When it grew bright we could not see its outline. When we went in to the house at about 23:00 pm they were still there. There was no sound and we could also see planes flying in the sky and it was nothing like a plane. It was much bigger and brighter than a star. If you held a dime at arms length it was about half that size. It is the first one we ever saw. It was in the southwestern sky.<n>

A teacher and a school administrator observed a bright green ball similar in color to the green of a traffic signal. The object was about the the size of a thumbnail on an extended arm. It may have had a short tail but nothing significant.It moved rather slowly across the horizon from west to eas travelling parallel to the earth not far above the horizon. It moved much too fast for an airplane yet seemed to move too slowly for a meteor. It did not fall but continued to move at the same height above the horizon until it was lost behind a cloud.<n>

A fireball (a luminiscent green in color) moved from northwest to southeast in the northern sky. It appeared rather large and was lost after going behind trees.  Seemed to be some miles away but was very spectacular and breathtaking.  We are not sure if it was a meteor or not.<n>

There were white cumulus clouds floating across the sky and it was mostly overcast and hazy. Just to my left,coming from the northwest,was a black disc. It was clearly visible against the white clouds. I looked very close and it had no wings,no markings of any kind. It made no sound. It turned and moved straight to the south. When it was directly in front of me to the east it went straight up in the air about 500 ft. That is just an estimation. Then it continued south but was gaining a little altitite as it went. I watched it untill it was out of sight. I called my son outside and he also observed the craft for about half a minute. I can&#39;t estimate how high it was but it was under the cloud cover and was easy to see because of it&#39;s black color. I observed it about one minute and my son for about half that time. It was moving fairly fast but not extremely fast. Faster than a jet would go across the sky.<n>

At first I thought I was dreaming or seeing things. As I started to get up to get a better look all I could do was move my head I could not move my body in any way. as I looked and saw that I was not dreaming it stopped and paused for only a few seconds and changed colors from a solid to more of a transparent silver gray color and slowly left the room and went through the wall. once it was gone I felt that i could move my legs and arms.but at the time of this I felt at peace and in no harm. My wife was laying on her back and I was on my side with my arm over her body. my wife is in her 7th month of pregnancy. I feel that this thing was not here to harm us in any way but here to scan us or maybe just my wife. I think that at the time I woke up it had just finished what it was here to do, or that it was getting ready to start and I disturbed it in some way. The shape of it was rectangler about 3inches thick by 2feet in length with a small dome like eye on the bottom of it&#39;s belly. It was rounded but yet squared at the corners.<n>

We are both engineers. I live in Seattle,my friend in Eugene, OR. It was around 1230 PM or 0030 military time. We had been sitting around the campfire,talking about the days waves and star gazing. I had identified several planets and constellations to my friend when I noticed a very fient triangular object in the southern sky.It really looked like dim stars on each point of a triangle and it was moving upward,very slowly.It stopped,then moved left,then up and out into space until I could no longer see it. It disappeared at my 1 o&#39;clock position as I faced south.I pointed it out to my friend as soon as I saw it and he confirmed that I was not crazy or seeing things. It was very fient and very large. I hope that we were not the only witness to this object.<n>

7/20/01 23:59|Austin|TX|Circle|three minutes|low-flying, helicopter-sounding, aircraft or circle shaped (from underneath), and had  few lights + bright spotlight|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18526.html|143|ndxe200107| low-flying, helicopter-sounding, aircraft or circle shaped (from underneath), and had  few lights + bright spotlight<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were talking around the hot tub in our backyard when we spotted what we thought was a helicopter spotlight about three houses down. The light was stopped very close to the ground and we thought that it was a law enforcement helicopter searching for something. We walked up to the back porch thinking that there might be a criminal in the area, and stood by the door. As we watched, the light then moved towards our house and was out of my view (we were standing on the bottom deck). Once it reached the house, it came back into view. It sounded like a helicopter and my mom said that she heard it from inside her bed room. I never saw the actual shape due to the intensity of the spotlight, but when it came up to the house, we could clearly see the bottom of the object. It was round and with a few white lights on the bottom. It appeared to be a white, or light grey color. It flew over the house very slowly so that we had a good thirty seconds to see the bottom of it. It was a very strange looking helicopter, if that&#39;s what it was. The spotlight was very intense. It lit the pool area as it flew by. I&#39;m normally very skeptic of U.F.O. sightings, and am not confinced that it was one, but would like to find something to explain this object. It was extremely low, sounded like a helicopter, shaped like an aircraft or circle from underneath, and had a few lights including a very bright spotlight.<n>
7/20/01 23:30|Hockessin|DE|Formation|15-20 minutes|Shifting formation of amber lights|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31865.html|144|ndxe200107| Shifting formation of amber lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little bit of background info:  This experience happened in about mid-summer of &#39;01, before we moved out of our old house.  It was situated on a nice, high hill, with a beautiful view of rural PA and a very dark western sky.  I was a hobbyist stargazer growing up in such a nice dark sky, so I have a rudimentary knowledge of sky measurement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I occasionally liked to look out my window and stargaze for a bit before going to bed.  Around 11 pm or so one night, I happened to look out and notice an odd sight:  5 or 6 bright amber lights, ranged widely-spaced line on a rising angle of perhaps 15-20 degrees to the horizon.  The lowest, most southern light was perhaps one fingerwidth from the horizon, while the highest northern one was about three fingerwidths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all sort of.. drifting in their line, upwards and northern slowly in their line.  Then, the most northern light suddenly speeded up and faded off into apparent nothingness.  The rest of the lights continued to move along the path, until the second light was in the position of where the first had been.  A new light then faded in in the southern end, apparently slowing down from come speed, and took the hindmost position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this, and another shifting, for perhaps five minutes, then went down the hall and knocked on my parents&#39; door.  They called my brother, and all four of us watched this for another five or ten minutes or so out of their large bedroom window.  I went and got my pair of binoculars to try and see if there were any other identifying lights on the objects.  I could see none, but I noticed either some sort of odd fuzziness or atmospheric distortion, as if they were at least a good few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents got bored and shooed my brother and I out of the room.  So I went back to my own room and watched the &#39;scene&#39; for another few minutes, the objects rotating in their line another two times, until all of the lights sped up and faded out of view from their then-present positions, and not returning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between the first sighting in &#39;01, and when we moved in spring &#39;03, I&#39;ve seen the same objects doing various boring things (cruising slowly just over the horizon and fading in and out, speeding up etc, singly and in pairs) four or five times.  I&#39;d grown a bit used to it, but the memory still sends my hackles up, as they say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We live in a remote , wooded area outside of town without street lights.We were on the last road to the house ,heading downhill when I noticed the bright light was above the tree line. I mentioned it to my wife at which point she suggested we pull into the drive and watch it.I pulled into our drive,still 100yds. from the house , and turned the vehicle and headlights off. The brightlight continued in a straight course directly toward us. By this time I&#39;m thinking it has to be a helicopter. Oddly though we noticed as it got ever so closer there was no apparent noise. Just as the object flew directly over our heads many things were evident. It was not a helicopter,it appeared to be moving much too slowly. It not only had a huge bright spotlight on the front,but also one pointing directly downward at the ground as well as one pointing directly to the rear for a total of 3 spotlights.The spotights were increadibly bright! The craft was metallic gray/silver with protruding structures underneath like pipe work. It was cylindrical in shape with no obvious front or rear other than the direction it was flying. It was approximately 20-25 ft in length and 10 ft wide. It was moving from the South to North toward the Greater Austin area. It seemed to be traveling no more than 15mph. It moved so slowly it is hard to believe it could stay in the sky.The only noise I could hear was when it was directly overhead.The noise was a faint metallic clanking or moving of metal parts.It did not have blades or wings! It was no more than 30 ft above us just clearing the trees. The light was so bright we couldn&#39;t make outfine details of the craft. We watched it slowly cruise overhead and continue across the front of our property through the woods. The rear spotlight,just as bright as the others,was so bright that you could see the light penetrating through the trees until it was over the horizon. I remember the date so easily because my daughter was born the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both were identical in shape and in color: Something like an oval with triangular wings, but not like any jet or plane silouette I&#39;ve ever seen. What was really bizarre was the color was a coppery-gray and the whole craft shimmered in appearance, as though we were watching through a hot exhaust. Both planes moved in tandem, and the second weaved gently around the first, moving back and forth from four-o&#39;clock to one-o&#39;clock (relative to the first). The overall movement of both craft was steady, swift and silent. My wife and I and a friend saw the craft initially, and as we alerted other friends inside, others came out and saw the craft shortly before we lost sight of it. Also: my wife and I were just reading other sightings, and the description of the craft reported in Bangalore India sounds exactly like this one, except that we couldn&#39;t see enough detail of the crafts, and we think it didn&#39;t fade away.<n>

These objects were difficult to see against the dark night sky, but were more visible when they passed below scattered clouds.  They gave off no light,made no sound and could be mistaken for night flying birds if they were nit so fast.  The two outboard objects came close together and then return to their original posions.  The object did not seem to oscillate ,flap or vibrate.  My best guess as to the altitude was 3000-4000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Three reports of these objects, seen on this night, and also several nights later.

I saw what I believe to be two commercial aircraft flying from east to west approximately 30 miles south of me,  actually all that I could see was their strobe lights steadily flashing across the southern sky. As I was driving along and observing these flashing lights, a saucer shaped craft went past me on my right side. The craft was flying vertically, at about 100 feet above ground, about 200 yards to the west of the road, traveling at a speed of about 100mph. The craft then speed up and started gaining altitude,and looked to be heading straight towards one of the commercial aircraft that I was observing.It only took the saucer shaped aircraft about 6 or7 seconds to close the gap between it and the airliner,it looked like the saucer just missed the airliner to its rear and then in about 2 more seconds the saucer was clean out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was not long before we heard a humming sound in the distance.  My family member and I simply ignored it and continued to wait for the dog to go to the bathroom.  Mysteriously, the dog began to bark at something behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us turned to see the most unbelievable thing we ever set eyes upon coming towards us, over the tree tops.  It was a black, teardrop, shaped craft, about the size of house.  After a few moments the craft, still humming, was hovering above our heads. To our shock, it froze there and then lowered until it was only about twenty feet above our heads! It was then that we were able to see it quit clearly.  We observed several lights on the belly of the craft, one of them glowing mysteriously in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our surprise, from this strange glowing light, a long, pointed needle, with a wire wrapping around it and meeting at the point, ejected.  This needle then sent down a focused beam of light, which suddenly expanded, then the light was gone and the needle was drawn back up into the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The teardrop shaped craft slowly began to move forward again.  I, being curious, chased it, not wanting to allow it to escape.  The faster I ran, the faster it moved.  Suddenly, it sped forward in the direction the trees.  I thought for sure it would crash into them, but the moment that impact would have occurred, there was a dazzling flash of light and the craft vanished altogether, leaving behind only one trace: a patch of dead grass where the original beam of light had projected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unsure off what had just happened we rushed back into the house, where another family member had watched the craft appear behind us from the window.  We assumed that this whole event had taken about two or three minutes, five at the most to occur, however she, and the clocks in the house, told another story: that we had been out for about a half-hour! She also said that the television signal was lost during this event. This mysterious occurrence puzzles us all to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Meanwhile at a stop sign still observing, I caught the attention of a motorcyclist to also see the object. We then parked and I just happened to carry my sony cybershot s30 camera with, i managed to take pictures of the direction the craft was in, but since the camera had no light filter , the pictures are bright, the craft was hidden in a cloud over &#34;Edwards Hospital&#34; I took as many pictures as i could if you would like them i will email them as soon as i getem off the camera, i even turned on the &#34;negative&#34; camera affect to try and get the object to stand out in a few pictures.<n>

We both stood watching it moving in a straight line for about two minutes and then it turned left and was heading East. We continued watching it for about another two minutes and then it just disappeared!

We were discussing something not interesting to me, I turned my gaze to the night sky (which was rather clear that night, not a cloud in the sky), when I noticed a small light, looked like a star from a galaxy light years away.  I began to return my gaze to my friend when I noticed the light move a bit, very slowly.  I interrupted the conversation and told them to look at the object.  I asked &#34;Does anyone no what that is?&#34;, and my friend replied, &#34;Could it be a satellite?&#34;.  We were about to say something else when the object seemed to get brighter.  We stopped and kept our gaze on it for about 6 seconds.  All of the sudden (and I swear on my mothers grave) it seemed to dim a little bit every second, until it disappeared.  Now I have been studying astronomy as a hobby for about a year and a half now, and I often research or ask people (teachers, chatters, etc...) if they know of what I saw.  So far I have no answers.

The first night, an orange light stayed in one spot for almost an hour. It was moving in little circles. Finally, it took off. To my friend (who wears glasses and has rather poor eyesite) it looked to be in the distant sky. To me (with very good vision) it looked like it was much closer than a star, like maybe a mile or so back in the woods, over the trees, but still small. Of course, it&#39;s hard to tell. The second night there were two of them. These did look far away. One in the west, and one in the north sky. Again, these were moving back and forth and in little circles. I would like to know if there is an atmospheric condition that might cause the illusion of movement like this. The only thing is, none of the other &#34;stars&#34; were moving, regardless of their brightness or position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note;  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with a celestial body, a star or a planet.

I was watching a sattelite moving through the sky southwest. When it reached the treeline I noticed another &#34;star&#34; moving north at a very high rate of speed. It was not a constant light, but more of a pulsing light. The best way I can describe it was like a knife being thrown. It tumbled end over end. It was very high in the sky, seemed to be in space. As it zipped through space i would loose sight of it, but following its trajectory I could pick it up. It was moving way too fast and high to be conventional aircraft. I followed it till it disappeared. It seems to slow down at times then pick up speed very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Original report taken by MIG: MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP www.ufomig.com B.Becker ufomig@yahoo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

It tool approx 1 min to come into view and then leave the other way. There were other commercial jets in the sky directly behind the object. I beleive it was a military or test vehicle but have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides four digital photographs of the object.  It is seen leaving two contrails behind each wing, so we presume that the object is powered by air-breathing engines.  The object has the general appearance of a military jet fighter.

The jet seemed to be on an aproach to Will Rogers Airport.  It was heading due south directly over our location.  The jet was flying low, perhaps 2000 to 2500 feet above the ground.  I was the first to notice an other object just off the plane&#39;s left side.  The object was about 75 to 100 feet from the left side and keeping pace with the plane.  At first I thought I was seeing a reflection in my glasses. I asked the other person with me if they saw it too.  They did. We watched for about 45 seconds, untill the jet and object disappeared behind some trees to our south.  The object had no lights of it&#39;s own and was only lighted by the street lights below.  The object looked to be cigar shaped, 25 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The object was gray in color and made no sound that we could hear over that of the jet.  The object made to change in direction other  than to pace the plane.  The weather was clear with a few stars showing, wind was from the south at 5 MPH.  Temp was in the 90&#39;s  Myself nor the other person had been drinking or taking any drugs.<n>

It had very faint amber aura on the leading edge and was blackish/brown in color...very difficult to see unless looking directly at it.  It appeared to be huge, dwarfing any aircraft that I have ever seen flying, cruising high (est. 10,000+feet), moving swiftly and silently in a straight line.  It covered alot of arc in the sky in a brief time, I saw it for about 10 seconds.  I thought it could have been a B-2 bomber (I have seen them at airshows), but this seemed significantly larger...it seemed odd to me, but it was quite interesting to say the least.<n>

I was at work and went outside for some fresh air. Had I not been looking up I probably would have never seen it, because it was very dim. I have a hard time calling it a craft because I didnt see any structure to it.  It was in the shape of a &#34;V&#34; and it just materialized in the night sky.  It was stationary when it appeared for maybe 30 seconds then slowly began to move south then it just disappeared, no sound no lights no colors. It looked the same as if it were a spotlight on the clouds, a dim kind of grayish look, but with very distinct lines forming the shape.  The thing that really got me though was the way it appeared, how it just materialized right in front of me, then disappeared the same way.<n>

7/18/01 04:45|Hattiesburg|MS|Light|1hr, 15min|Bright, red pulsing object in the north eastern section of the sky.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18472.html|182|ndxe200107| Bright, red pulsing object in the north eastern section of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 18 July, 2001, at approximately 0445hrs my supervisor and I were on duty at a location approximately 15 miles south of Hattiesburg, MS.  We were standing outside of our patrol vehicles.  My supervisor called my attention to a &#34;bright star&#34; low in sky to the north east.  Upon seeing this very bright, red twinkling object I first thought that it was a planet,  then the object faded out and disappeared.  We thought that maybe a cloud had passed in front of this object that we were still assuming was a planet or star, although the night was relatively clear as one could plainly see the cresent moon.  Approximately five minutes later, this object reappeared at what appeared to be a higher altitude and began to slowly become very dim and then very bright, as if someone were playing with a dimmer switch on a light bulb.  I retrieved a pair of 10 by 25 binoculars that I keep with my duty gear and again looked at the object.  Through the binoculars, three seperate objects could be seen in a tight triangle formation.  By this time, around 0500hrs, vehicles were passing by our location, but noone elese seemed to notice the object, as it looked like a &#34;normal&#34; star unless one watched it for a few minutes and noticed it&#39;s strange behavior.  At dawn, around 0530hrs, the object seemed to stabilize at a constant brightness and ended the pulsing effect.  At 0545hrs, with sufficient sunlight,  when looking at the object through my binoculars,  the three lights were still distinct, although now they were a bright white color, with what appeared to be some sort of solid object behind them, visible only through the binoculars.  At this time, the moon and this object were the only visible objects in the sky, but by this time, if one did not know where to look, one would probably not notice it.  By 0600,  with the glare of the rising sun, the object was no longer visible.  I have six years of law enforcement/security experience, with many nights being spent on the overnight shift.  I, nor my supervisor,  who has over ten! years e xperience, have never seen anything like this object.  I have seen satellites and had an astronomy course in college and do not remember studying any know heavenly objects visible from earth that act in this manner.  Approximately six months ago I did see something similar but dismissed it as an aircraft or figment of my imagination because it only lasted a few seconds.<n>

I have seem the Russian space lab passing accross the sky in the past, and all these things were massive by comparison , and moving much slower.

The site at an elevation of approximately 350&#39; was close to the ocean which was directly to the east. 2 Fishing vessels were observed on the ocean earlier in the evening but had moved from the area. The area is within 3nm of an airport and also a transatlantic route for aircraft. Equipped with a 5&#34; wide field refractor I was joined by 2 friends at 10:00EST and spent an hour touring the totally clear skies looking at different star and galaxy formations. We were also observant of numerous &#34;high flyers&#34; (aircraft), satellites and the occasional &#34;shooting star&#34;. At 11:00, one of my friends spotted an elliptical light toward the ocean and brought our attention to it. It moved very slowly from North to South, then at the same slow speed and direction descended. It ascended and headed directly due east until it completely faded from view. While transitting from North to South, it was observed through the telescope which revealed an elliptical source of light at the &#34;front&#34; and a blinking light towards the back. First thought: aircraft, possibly helicopter. Not likely. Myself and one of the other people present are experienced observers, also involved in the aviation industry and knowledgable of aircraft activities in the area. Observed numerous aircraft that night, including trainers. Altitude and flight direction/pattern were not that of normal commercial aircraft operations or trainers. No other military presence in this area either. Simply could not classify what we were looking at.<n>

That is kind of hard when you live pretty close to Los Angeles.On this night my mom and I looked up into the sky and saw a dimond shaped craft that was brighter than a star and not as bright as a planet. It was not moving and I am positive that it was not an air plane or helicopter because of the lack of noise. Me and my mom watched it for a few  minutes and then we went in. I looked out again at ten o&#39;clock and it was still there.It also hadn&#39;t moved an inch from where it had been before. Then by chance I looked out the window into the Northern sky where it had always been. I was going to go to sleep so I just looked for a couple of seconds and when I was looking it suddenly vanished and I have never seen it again.<n>

It was moving slowly true north to true south. At first I thought that it was the setting sun reflecting on a satellite. I lost sight of it when it passed over my house. But about five minutes later, I saw the same object again (or was it another one?) moving in the exact same path and speed. I called my son to come out and he saw it too. This time, when it moved over my house, I went in front the house and continued to watch it for about 2-3 minutes , until I lost sight of it, approximately 45 degrees over the southern horizon. There was no sound or contrail. Is it possible that 2 satellites follow each other so closely in the same orbit? I am an engineer and so is my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There are many satellites that orbit around the planet.  Many of them are in polar orbit.

The details were more vivid of any photos I have yet to ever seen, I and others were even able to see windows on the air craft. It had many golden lights around it.

We were sitting looking up at the sky watching for anything that might move accross the sky. My back was to the plough/big dipper and in an area of darkness, (to the naked eye) we both saw a bright flash of light, followed some 10 seconds later by another flash in what seemed to be the same place. The light was like a pinprick in size, but the light was white and intensly bright. The area where the light was was in the s.e approx mid way between the horizon and directly overhead. Shortly after this from the west we watched an object move e.n.e. moving spasmodically. It was lit to intensity of dull star two objects one from the north and one for the south moved towards it and seemed to dissapeer, as did the orriginal object. They were very high, and we were not able to discern any lights on or shape of the orriginal object, which I had been watching through field glasses. Later, possibly 10 minutes after this a large round object moved e to w.s.w steadily accross the sky. I watched it with field glasses untill I could no longer see it. It was a dull yellow, seemed to glow, not shine. I could see no other lights and it was very high, yet it was clearly bigger than any satalite I have seen. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT 17th July 2001. 20.40 hrs. Mazarron, Spain.  warm night, clear sky. 3 objects move accross the sky with about 8 to 10 minute intervals. They followed the same flight path, travelling roughly s to n. Viewed through the field glasses they seemed illuminated, by the sun perhaps, but with the naked eye they appeared only slightly lighter than the sky. At 23.02 I spotted another of these objects on the same pathway. I was using the field glasses. It was almost overhead when it just dissapeered. I could not see it at all after this. Some 3 to 4 mins. later a bright light the size of a pinhead flashed for a few seconds in the area where the object had dissapeered. Then: some 15 to 20 secs later a similar flash seen an inch or so from the last flash on the forward line of projection. Some 15 secs later a further flash seen 12 inches e. of the last then two more in the area between the previous flashes. Some 30 secs later a final flash in the line of flight of the three previous objects The plough/big dipper was at my back at all times. NIGHT OF 18th July. 22.00hrs. warm some cloud. Sky not really dark, only Venus and a few of the brightest stars visable. I looked up and saw a bright star. I realised that there was no bright star at that point, looked again and saw it move s. to n. on a line approx to that of the  previous night. It reached a point over my head and dissapeered. I scanned the sky for some time but saw nothing. At 22.30ish. I saw a bright flicker to the s.e. Then an object moving n.w. to s. steadily. No lights visable through field glasses. I am sorry that I am not good at giving better direction/sky positions, but I have little knowledge in this direction. However I do know that these bright flashes of light were not natural, and they were so very very bright, even though they were no bigger than a pin head to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain what the witnesses were observing, but we believe that the first possibility to consider would be orbiting objects, e.g. satellites, tumbling rocket booster shells, Iridium satellites, etc..

ST. in Central park, on the Great Lawn.  He layed down, and i (fully clothed:))  stradled him and we talked like this for a while.  Suddenly he put his head back and stared at the sky.  Compelled by his intense gaze, i looked up as well.  What i saw was an airplane flying east, and just below it, two large bright white lights rotating over  one another in a wide diamond pattern.  He saw the same thing, but from a different angle.  The lights moved quickly to the east maintaining the rotation, but in less than 60 sec. they dissappeared into the north east, behind some thick clouds.  We got up and walked back to his apartment.  I am an actress and 20yrs old, and a character i played a while back was into sci-fi, so i did a lot of research in this area, and became obsessed with it.  So, as we walked home i slowly began to relate some of my findings with my boyfriend, who is in investment banking and 24yrs old.  Needless to say we were both freaked out and would like to know if anyone else in the city saw the same thing.<n>

I at the time was testing my wings as an OTR truck driver. Partly because I made descent money for a twenty two year old, mostly because I was able to see many things I wasn&#39;t sure I would ever get to see otherwise. As a team driver at the time I typically drove at night, usually 9:00 pm to 5:00 am. Of course this was a great time to watch the sky as I often did. Strangely enough I was driving through Mississippi on a very sunny summer day. It was strange because; I never drove during the day and I was in a state I had been through only a handful of times in my short lived driving career. My driving partner at the time was sleeping and it was getting close to the end of my shift. Still very early in the morning I was driving north on I-55 heading home to Nashville, TN in a very desolate part of Mississippi, close to Durant, when I glanced up. There in the bright blue early afternoon sky I saw three very small dots sitting in a triangular formation. I say sitting because there was no movement whatsoever. The objects were so small I thought they must have been miles up. I continued to watch the objects as I drove up the interstate and they remained perfectly still in a right triangle configuration. I thought it was so odd because I had the thought that it could be a real sighting, but it was almost surreal. They seemed so far away and they were so small I wasn’t sure what to think. I have no pictures to document what I saw but, if you saw three of the brightest stars in the night sky shining that brightly through the afternoon sun forming a perfect triangle, that’s what it was. As opened minded as I am I had always been skeptical about the existence of e.t. life, but watching these objects made me really feel that there was something possibly alien or otherwise unknown hovering above me. My sighting went on for a total of about ten minutes. ! During the last few seconds of what was a very wonderful, but rather uneventful phenomena the objects suddenly moved straight up at a rate of speed I could not begin to judge. They literally disappeared in less than a blink of an eye, but I absolutely saw what appeared to be some type of mechanical movement something not at all natural. It was amazing and I so wished I had the opportunity to get pictures as I was driving. I had somewhat doubted the whole experience, but within about a minute of the objects disappearing the strangest thing happened. Five Air Force jets, and I’m not sure what model, but fighter jets were doing flybys at and around the interstate. They circled within five miles of the interstate for a few minutes then disappeared. That incident certainly sparked my interest and belief that something possibly threatening and likely not human exists. Recently I was driving through a neighborhood close to home when I noticed a rainbow in the clouds. While observing the rainbow I shifted my sight about 45 degrees to the right when I noticed the same strange object. This encounter was much briefer and there was only one object I could see. My friend Keith was with me this time and I tried to get him to look, but when I looked to find it again, it was gone. I’m certainly glad to know there is a website dedicated to discovering the truth about UFO’s. I totally and whole heartedly believe that there is a lot we don’t know, but I think we are on the verge of finding the answer to the age old question: Are we alone?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had seen several satellites before I noticed the most remarkable shape emerging from behind my roofline.  Looking toward the east, I saw a perfect V-shape at approximately 50 degrees up from ground level and moving in what I would guess to be a south-southwest to north-northeast direction.  The V was laying on its right side.  It looked like a flying &#34;less than&#34; symbol.  Only two edges were visible.  From what I could tell, there was no third line to connect the two arms.  There were no lights on it.  It moved very smoothly in only one direction.  It had to be very large.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I tried to see if the area between the two arms would block out light as it passed between my position and a star.  It looked as though the starlight was blocked out until both arms passed the star.  Only the two edges were distinctly visible, but they were very straight, very symmetrical and came to a very sharp point.  I&#39;m not sure that I would have seen it without the night vision device.  I couldn&#39;t say how far away it was, but my feeling was that it was many miles away and quite high.  The sight of it was actually stunning.  I truly could not place this object anywhere within my frame of reference.  I&#39;ve never seen anything remotely like it.  I can&#39;t believe that anything this large and so incredibly unique would escape the attention of our military.  After having seen this object and thinking about it for several days, I really think its time somebody in a position of responsibility stepped forward with some real answers.<n>

We were 3 friends and only two saw the aprox. 4 objects (my friend visiting from England saw it). Nobody else in the boat was able to match this sighting. Shape and color: red circles or spheres. The objects looked small and far away to the naked eye. At one point they were motionless, but suddenly moved so rapidly and randomly that it made it impossible to think that it could be some kind of known aircraft, because inertia could hurt the &#34;pilot&#34;, so sharply they moved when they did. The objects dissapeared for a while and then were back and repeated a similar pattern. I and the other observer are colleage-educated professionals. I have experience in the sea. We were puzzled. We were positive that is was not a searchlight or lasser nor anything that could make sense to us or to suggest that it was being proyected from the coast or another ship. At one point they were gone and we were not able to see them again. I indeed saw it and did not report it before because I thought lots of people had to have seen it and reported it.

I called my wife to the radio so she could hear that I was not making things up about that night. I was sitting in my car on 80th street south of Powell Blvd when I noticed something further south approximately 5-10 miles.  Whatever it was it stayed stationery for some time turned on it side, leveled back down then proceeded to go southward towards the Clackamas Town Center-Oregon City area. I was waiting for my wife at the time while she was in her mothers Adult Care facility.

The lights on it were blinky very slow and it looked like a big object. then my mother went inside for a min to get the phone and i stayed staring at it and all of a sudden it vanished into the sky.

I did not see any noticible lights or markings on this craft and it was unlike anything I have evern seen in my years of in the Military (9). The craft was moving slowly at or around 75 miles per hour. It was flying at a low altitude and seemed to be in front of some clouds and behind others.

A few days in both directions at most. I was sitting out on my balcony taking some sun as it was a clear warm cloudless day. As I took a break from it I watched an aircraft fly over me at cruising altitude leaving a contrail. There is a flight corridor right overhead (west -&gt; east) for most likely intercontinental flights. About five to ten minutes after the aircraft went out of sight (balcony&#39;s ceiling). I noticed a bright white light moving thru the sky. It was a constant blinking light in about one second interval, moving in my point of view in the exact same place and direction as the contrail left by the recent aircraft. But the speed was 6 - 8 times faster (or even more) than the normal aircrafts that slowly move across the sky. There were no change of speed what so ever. I didn&#39;t see any object during the &#34;no light&#34; period. Maybe it was behind the contrail. But the blinking light was so strong it seemed to be below the contrail. This made me think this thing was actually moving IN the contrail. The contrail wasn&#39;t affected in any way as it was slowly disappearing. The size of the light was about twice of a big airliner flying at cruising altitude. I&#39;d say the light moved over the part of the sky I can see (about 40% of total) in about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The huge speed, bright blinking light, moving exactly where the contrail was, made no sense to me and still I&#39;m wondering what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am an 18 year old college student who never saw UFOs before or thought much about them. The sky was blue and there were few clouds at the time. The circle of the sun was completely behind the slant of the roof and only the corona of the sun was visible to me. Around the corona, I saw from 7 to 11 white lights. Some were hovering and about 3 were darting quickly and suddenly in random directions. After a few minutes, they drifted away. They seemed to go behind the roof so I could not see them anymore. I saw them between the roof and trees that were nearby. They were so close to the sun that I suppose I would not have looked up unless the circle of the sun was hidden by the roof and did not hurt my eyes. The lights were a steady white which stood out among the blue of the sky. They reminded me of diamonds (such as a diamond with a silver background) that were sparkling. The lights were not well defined to be a particular shape but I think they were circular. They were unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before. When I heard the next day that other sightings had occurred in New Jersey, I felt I should report what I had seen. These UFOs were in no particular formation and did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports from this area of New Jersey for this time period.

It was the summer of 2001 and I lived in San Diego.  Once or twice a week I would come down to the Imperial Valley and hang out with mith my friends and family.  There is a Navy base there and an airport, so we&#39;re all used to seeing plains in the sky.  That summer though there seem to be this big influx of activity.  It would always occur between 10pm and 1:30am sometimes later.  We were big smokers and chatter bugs, so we&#39;d be out all night long smoking at chatting away.  My budy and I had seen our share of &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; before; living near a Navy base.  Anyway, It all started one night when we happened to a small white light seemingly drop straight down into the sky off to the east of his house.  It stopped for a second and then shot off south and dissapeared.  Then another did the same thing only it appeared further south and shot off north.  Then the eastern sky was repeatedly being adorned with these small white lights dropping in and then shooting off.  Three, four, and five at a time, and in different directions.  We started getting all excited and I went in to grab my camcorder.  I pointed the camera at the occurance and hoped.  It was very dark and the lights seemed far away.  I also shot a plain, a helicopter, and a planet that was in the sky that night for brightness reference.  After about thirty mins or so the event died down.  I remember thinking to myself &#34;I wonder if they are directly above us too.&#34; I looked up and sure enough one drooped in right over my head and then shot away.  It was the last one we saw that night.  Apon later review of the tape everything showed up except for the stange lights.  There seemed to be an awful lot of static in the picture as well.  This dance of objects went on durring many of my trips.  Never quite as dramatic as the first night, but we came to regard it as &#34;The Show&#34;  We would show other of our friends when they&#39;s hang out with us.  Sometimes when coming down the mountains from San Diego I&#39;d be able to see them, and I&#39;d call my friend in the Imperial Valley.  We&#39;d both watch them from either side. Telling eachother what we were seeing as sometimes one of us would lose sight of it or them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other major one we saw was very similar sounding to some that I&#39;ve read on this sight.  We were out one night waiting for &#34;The Show,&#34; and dissapointed we disided to go inside.  My friend even coaxed &#34;them&#34; by saying out load in a humoring tone &#34;We are going inside now!&#34;  And took large exagerated steps towards the door.  He then realized that he had to put out the trash.  As he rolled then trash container out to the street I looked back at him to see his jaw drop.  &#34;What?&#34; I asked.  &#34;Come here&#34; he said, &#34;look at this.&#34;  I walked slowly over to him, expecting that what-ever he had seen would be gone by the time I got there.  But to my surprise he pointed out a rather large seeming reddish orange glowing object moving extreemly slow and low off in the distance.  It appeared to be on the other (west) side of the city.  We followed it as it traveld north east.  It was strange, seeming to grow and shrink, or rather brighten and dim.  Being night time that&#39;s all I could gather of the shape.  It would even stop at times, and then continue.  It also would blink out and then reapear about 10 to 20 degrees further north east.  As it was now dirrectly north of us we gaged it to be somewhere between Imperial and El Centro.  It began flashing more quickly now, and seem to drop a couple glowing balls of light that seemed to float down like a flare or feather, waivering back and forth and getting dimmer the lower they went blacking out completely at 50-100 feet. It began blinking faster and faster and dopping more and objects until it just kind of went out looking like when you throw a cigarette out the window of a car and it hits the ground.  Just a bunch of light fading embers, then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure I wrote too much, but this is a collection of UFO sightings right?  I wish I had more specific dates for you.  I&#39;m going to check my old tapes, and see if I can figure it out. I was 19 at the time going to Comunnity college in San Diego, and managing three stores.  My friend was a pizza delivery boy 26 and going to Community college in Imperial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD))<n>

After staring at this for about a minute, I noticed that the star was moving against the background of the night sky and other stars.  It did not have any flashing or pulsing lights, as might be seen on an airplane.  It had a steady and slow trajectory and was moving East from the western sky, but it was not moving even as fast as one might expect to see an airplane move.  It moved in its course in a straight line directly overhead and eventually disappeared into the eastern sky in about 5 minutes.  It appeared brightest from its first appearance in the West and then diminshed in brightness as it moved away into the East.<n>

7/15/01 03:16|Oklahoma City|OK|Unknown|2 or 3 min.?|Loud grinding/saw like noise woke and startled me. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84354.html|229|ndxe200107| Loud grinding/saw like noise woke and startled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summer  Night 2001  Oklahoma City,  I was sleeping in my bedroom and was suddenly startled and woken by an extremely loud sawing/grinding sound like a jet airliner was crashing into our one story house. I am not sure if the back yard was illuminated or not as we lived next to an alley with street lamps behind a shopping center that also had security lights on the back of their building and light would emit into our yard over our 6 foot privacy fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke to an extremely loud sawing noise that made me jump a little up in my bed and I was extremely terrified. I looked at my alarm clock and noticed it was showing 3:16 am.  Which struck me because I had recently converted to Christianity and I immediately thought of John 3:16 (for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son). I then immediately felt like something or someone might be in the house and coming to me.  I heard the door that leads out to the garage and to the back yard door open and shut. I was so frightened that I did not move but laid in my bed in fear. It took me a long time to go back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept thinking about all this and also asked my uncle who was my room mate and owned the house if he had gone anywhere early in the morning and he said no.  I knew he had gone to his room to go to bed a few hours before me so I was puzzled at the door sound.  I started to chock my experience up to a religious event and possibly a religious experience where I might have been visited by angels at 3:16am as a religious omen, but cannot explain why I was so terrified at the thought of them coming in my room after the grinding/saw sound.  It’s like subconsciously I new what that sound meant and it horrified me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must disclose that I had two previously weird events before that I recalled. One was in 1997 while I was alone at night working security at an apartment complex overnight. It was early in the morning around 2 or 3am and a bright light shone down on my car as I sat in it. I got out after a few seconds to see what the light was looking for. I live in Oklahoma City and it is very common to have OKC. P.D.’s “Air One” police helicopter searching the area for suspects fleeing a crime scene. When I looked up at the light it was so bright I couldn’t make out what I was looking at, but the weirdest part was it made no sound and that freaked me out because I didn’t believe the police were using some conspiracy theory “Black Helicopters.” I remember I felt freaked out and went into the complex a moment later after the light left. I just wanted to get near other people so I felt safer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have seen strange anomalies a few times like cluster formations of what I thought were stars in a clear sky and then suddenly break out in different directions and disappear. When I would see this I would go immediately inside my house and turn on the T.V. and try not to think about what I saw as it scared me.  I have also had fits of sleep paralysis from time to time where I would swear I saw silhouettes near the bed moving around and I was completely terrified and couldn’t wake myself. I just chocked it up as sleep paralysis after some internet self diagnosing.  I feel like I have been visited and know things but can’t remember what it is.  I hope I am not to hallucinating any of these experiences because that would indicate possible mental illness and I don’t feel like I have mental health issues.  These occurrences felt genuine and not willed by thought but sudden instances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I wanted to report the incidents before but didnt know who or where to report it to until I came across your website.  I was going through the archives and I noticed other reports of similar sightings around the time I experienced my sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On three different occasions Me and a couple of friends were smoking a ciggarette outside around 3:15 am when we noticed a bright orange object in the sky.  At first we thought it was a flare but it couldnt be, because the object was not coming down.  We observed what I can describe as a fireball floating very slowly and decending from East to NorthWest for about 15 minutes until the object floated behind the houselines.  That was approximately 2.5 to 3 miles from where we were at.  On the second occasion around the same time and location in Wilmington about 3 months later.  Me and one of the other witnesses from the first sighting were outside and noticed 2 Similar objects coming from the same direction.  It was very similar to the first sighting but now there were 2 objects.  On the third occasion about 6 mos later, around 4 am.I saw a fireball in the sky coming from the east.  It was floating and dropping smaller fireballs as it dissapeared  then it would flicker and then it got bigger and at 1 point it got so small that it dissapeared and then it would reappear, It did that a couple of times then it dissapeared completely.  The 3 sightings happened on a weekend.<n>

The object was semi-circular on the bottom with a low pyramid shape on top. I watched it for about 2 minutes as it became a bright orange color and seemed to grow larger. It then quickly receded with no apparent movement. I assume that it either was moving directly toward me or away from me which would explain the apparent stilloness of it.<n>

Saw the light through the trees, then the shape when it came through a section with no branches. I saw this through my second story bedroom window. We live in the country so there are not alot of lights surrounding us. It could not have been too high.  We live not too far from the airport, so I see lots of planes coming and going.  That is not what I saw this morning. It Moved slowly, and silently I am college educated, never seen anything like this before.  Never gave it much thought. Just stared at it with disbelief.<n>

We were right around exit 10 on the turnpike and we saw a whole bunch of clustered bright lights about 1000 – 2000 feet in the air.  We figured these were approaching planes, however, as we got closer they appeared to form some sort of pattern and were kind of hovering.  There were about 50 cars stopped on the side of the turnpike.  My wife believes that the lights “reorganized” to form a different pattern.  I really didn’t see any reorganization happen.  We did not stop because my wife was nervous.<n>

I interviewed the  ((name deleted)) (higher than Monsignor) by phone that saw the object.  He sent me the following e-mail.  I&#39;m driving up to interview him tomorrow and trying to get a copy of tape made by Carteret Lt. of police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From:   ((names and addresses deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello: I have to report this since it occurred at approximately 12:45 AM July   15th  2001, over the town of Carteret, New Jersey.  I am an Orthodox Ukrainian priest -- and my son (who is a funeral director was going out on a death call) gets in touch with me via his cell phone at about 12:40 and tells me I need to get dressed quickly and come outside.  He was just getting ready to get on to the New Jersey turnpike when he saw a huge collection of lights numbering about 30 over the town of Carteret, and, specifically over the &#34;Carteret Shoprite Shopping Center.&#34;  I immediately put on a pair of shorts and slippers and went outside.  By this time, my son was standing in front of the rectory (which is aside of the church) and was pointing to the series of lights moving in an easterly direction towards Staten Island.  The Lights were arrayed in a series of triangular forms, but I only counted 13 or 14 lights.  I say 13 or 14 because I was so taken by them that I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of<n> <n><n> them to count them twice.  The entire group of lights was moving from right to left (east) and totally in unison.  As they were moving, a light would &#34;drop&#34; a &#34;new&#34; light from it (less intense than itself) and the &#34;new&#34; light would fade away.  Immediately after that, the light that just &#34;dropped&#34; the new light would also fade out.  This happened about five times as the collection of lights continued to move.  As the entire sequence of lights continued to move behind the buildings to my immediate left, I had to move to our parking lot to see them and as I did, I began to lose sight of the group of lights until there was only one light and then none at all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest phenomenon I have ever seen.  I estimate that the lights were no more than 3-4000 feet above the town.  I am a private pilot, so I have a little idea of height and some sense of distance in the sky.  These lights made absolutely no noise and moved with such precision that they<n> <n><n> resembled a huge craft, yet I get the sense that they were individual lights and not one large craft.  They definitely were not a meteor shower as a neighbor of mine neither yelled to me nor were they stars moving.  They were a &#34;calculated&#34; series of high intensity lights moving in a specific direction.  At this point, I can only call them UFO&#39;s and that they definitely were.  I only wish I knew what they were doing here?  If anyone else saw them or can explain their purpose, I certainly would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you.  Rt. Rev. ((name and address deleted)) an added note - the sky was totally clears - no wind - stars were visible in the sky as well as approaching aircraft to Newark.  There were no aircraft in the vicinity of the &#34;lights&#34; and my son commented that the airplanes which were on approach to Newark airport were lower than usual.  ---<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor&#39;s Note: Witnesses claim they do not believe these were parachute flares, blimps or other similar phenonena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> George Filer<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END REPORT))<n>
7/15/01 00:40|Carteret|NJ|Formation||Orange lights hovering over Carteret NJ in V formation|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18441.html|236|ndxe200107| Orange lights hovering over Carteret NJ in V formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I have seen it too. Anyway I would like to re-cap the facts presented by different people so far in regards to these observations: The sighting was collective. About 75 cars stopped on the highway to view the lights and 15 people in different locations who have noticed it independently of each other and called the Cartret police department. According to reports police officers themselves saw the lights as well. Whatever this was, it must have been very close to the ground, as only people at Pert Amboy, Raritan Bay, and Carteret NJ, but not in any other neighboring towns, saw it. The descriptions all point to orange redish radial self contained lights in a V and then Diamond shaped formation. This does not convincingly corespond to any possibility of projected light from the ground or Aurora Borialis as some suggested. It would be very interesting to know whether the coast guard or the Newark airport radars have picked up anything unusual at that time. It is also interesting to find out if any of the people heard anything at all while making this observation (such as a chopper or plane sound) especially considering the concluded low altitude of these lights. could we have a more articulated description of the sighting from anybody who saw it? What was the angle of the opening in the V shape? How far do people asses the lights along the sides where in relation to the end points of the V from each other? What shade of color would you compare it to? Did the intensity or shade of the lights change throughout the observation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the source is alluding to the event at approximately 0030 hrs. on July 15th.  We have changed the date here.  PD))<n>

Police received about 15 calls, 75 cars stopped on NJ Turnpike to watch, even the police themselves saw it.  Newark airport, National Weather Service, and McGuire AFB all report no explanation.  No planes, no unusual weather, no air force. Late-night Carteret light show a mystery 07/16/01 BY DORE CARROLL STAR-LEDGER STAFF A drowsy mother in Carteret saw the flickering golden lights in the sky and ran for her camera. A hard-boiled Navy veteran traveling the New Jersey Turnpike spotted the slow-moving, bright-yellow V-formation and pulled his car to the shoulder to get a better look. Police officers on patrol at 12:40 a.m. yesterday couldn&#39;t believe their eyes. Within the hour, Carteret police dispatchers said they heard from at least 15 callers reporting strange orange flares blazing high above the Arthur Kill. The eerie glow had people at backyard barbecues mesmerized, with heads upturned and mouths agape. Almost 75 vehicles pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike to watch the spectacle. But no one seems to know what caused the luminous vision. Police could not identify the source of the lights, and Newark International Airport authorities reported no unusual flight patterns. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service said nothing in the atmosphere would have caused the bright disturbance, and an airman at McGuire Air Force Base said none of their military planes were in the air at that hour. Whatever it was that lit up the sky above Carteret was by all accounts weird. &#34;It wasn&#39;t fireworks, and it couldn&#39;t have been a hot-air balloon, not at night near the airfield,&#34; said Steven Vannoy, who pulled over on the turnpike with his girlfriend on their way home to Perth Amboy. &#34;What we saw last night qualifies as a UFO. It was an unidentifiable flying object.&#34; A Carteret police sergeant on duty called the State Police and neighboring departments in Linden and Woodbridge to find out what was causing the strange glow, but he said none had received reports of the lights. Bob Wanton, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, had no explanation for the lights. &#34;Weatherwise, there was nothing that would have caused it,&#34; he said. The aurora borealis, a spectacular show of light high in the northern hemisphere, is seldom visible in New Jersey, said Wanton. The lights normally appear in the winter, he said. &#34;It&#39;s very unusual for the northern lights to come down this far, especially at this time of year,&#34; he said. On Staten Island, a spokeswoman for the 123rd precinct in the Tottenville section suggested the display might have come from a nightclub on Arthur Kill Road that frequently uses search lights for promotions. The club had been ordered closed by a judge on July 11 and its phone was disconnected yesterday. Airman First Class Andre Steverson said no planes from McGuire Air Force Base were flying at that time. An operations manager at Newark International Airport said there were no reports of unusual activity and said the lights &#34;could have been almost anything,&#34; from a group of military helicopters on flight exercises to a blimp. Maybe, said David Stich, who saw the bursts of light from his back yard in Carteret. But those flares didn&#39;t look to him like spotlights or anything else he could recognize. &#34;I never in my life saw anything like it,&#34; said Stich, a lifelong Carteret resident accustomed to the roar and flight path of aircraft from Newark. He compared the lights to volleyballs, dwarfing the surrounding stars, and said they clearly moved in formation. Around the corner, Pam Russell&#39;s husband woke her to see the show. She saw a diamond-shaped pattern in the sky and noticed smaller lights leading the pack and bringing up the rear. &#34;I ran for my camera,&#34; said Russell. &#34;But they disappeared.&#34; Afterward, she said, the skies were dark and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ARTICLE))<n>

They were not stars nor plane lights so as we continued to drive there were cars lined up along the shoulers on the turnpike.  So then we pulled over along the shoulder to.  We got out of the car and looked up into the sky and stood there for about 3 minutes looking at the circular lights above us.  Cars were pulled all over for at least a 1/2 mile in front of us and a 1/2 mile in back of us. We spoke with the people behind us and the people in front of us.

Since I live very close to the area, I will be personally doing a field investigation for a small UfoAmerica.iwarp.com. Several thousand others were witness to this event, as vehicles on surrounding roadways were reportedly pulling off to the shoulder faster than you could imagine. There were about 15, maybe as many as 20 glowing orange orbs, high in the sky above Caretet New Jersey. The event was reported on all the local NJ/NYC news channels including Fox-5, NBC-4, WB-11, NJ-12, and is totally unexplained. The orbs moved about, changing various formations. People said they saw everything from a circle, to the big dipper. The UFOs were just floating there in the sky, moving about each other and taking various formations. Carteret NJ police were notified by several callers. So far there has been no radar confirmation, and it appears that the military was not involved. The only alternative explanation at this point, are unlawful sky divers with illumination flares. However, the length of the event seems to rule that out. There are at least two known videos. The UFOs themselves were of the &#34;string of pearls&#34; variety. The same type have been caught on tape before. Once in the US in the 50s I beleive, and the other in Mexico more recently. This seems to be a very good sighting with many people as witnesses. I will be going door to door today asking witnesses to tell their story in the area. I&#39;m hoping that by posting it on the Internet everywhere, more people will come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the event here.  PD))<n>

The erratic pattern changed slowly until these lights faded out and disappeared one by one in no particular order. I am not good at estimating height in the dark but it appeared to be higher than a personal aircraft(Cessna)would fly. Witnessed by 5 people, each in a different location (we were at work). We communicated what we were seeing via 2-way radios.  Also at this time a jet was on approach to Newark airport and I wonder if they may have observed these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the time indicated above by the witness to be an estimate.

I estimate the height in this way because that is what I thought the objects were, a bunch of private planes, i.e. a local flying club, out for a night flight around town (although I did not see any particular form or shape to the objects).  They gradually veered away from me (for them, they would&#39;ve been making a right hand turn).  They may, in fact, have been gradually veering away from me from when I first saw them (being at night it was impossible to accurately determine if they were proceeding directly across my line of vision and then veered away, or if they had been gradually veering away from me from the start (moving laterally diagonally across my line of vision) and then veered &#34;more sharply&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) I say &#34;in formation&#34; because all though all the lights appeared to move in concert, or in a pack, there was smaller movement between some of the lights, like individual objects speeding up to keep up with each other and/or slowing down to avoid getting to close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) That the objects didn&#39;t make a sound, I attributed to their being down wind of me, i.e. the wind blew the sound of the planes away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) That no small plane I had ever seen before at night had ever been lit up like this and, in any event, probably wouldn&#39;t be if they really were out for a night flight, i.e. out to see the city all lit up at night, strange as this sounds, I didn&#39;t think anything of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) In retrospect, I guess the only thing stranger than the sight itself, was my nonchalant reaction to it.  I certainly wasn&#39;t frightened, but neither do I remember being particularly awed, I seem to remember thinking: &#34;Oh, that&#39;s neat&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for his having submitted such a nice report.

7/15/01 00:00|Wilkes-Barre|PA|Triangle|4 to 5 hours|The truth behind the Grays  ((NUFORC Note:  Report of abductions is unconfirmed.  PD))|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57243.html|256|ndxe200107| The truth behind the Grays<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a recounting of an abduction experience I&#39;ve hade about 6 years ago.  Nobody knows about it, or the other countless abductions I&#39;ve had for as long back as I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I remember there being quiet bright lights in the sky above the back yard.  I felt this strong urge to go outside and check it out. and when I did, they took me.  And they&#39;ve been taking me ever since.  Sometimes they&#39;d come for me, other times they called me and I would have no choice but to them.  I did tell my parents about it once, as a little kid, around 6 years old, when the Greys left me in my living room insted of dropping me back in my bedroom.  They blamed it on sci-fi movies and videogames and I got yelled at for making up stories.  That was the only time I tried to tell anyone.  When I moved from home into my appartment, I slept with a 9mm. under my pillow for months, but I was always paralised when they would come for me, so that idea was a bust.  Setting up video cameras in my bedroom proved ineffective as well.  In the morning, the tapes would be blank, like I never set them to record at all.  And after a while, the fear dissapeared from the abductions and I started to accept that getting pulled out of my room on random nights was just something I&#39;d have to deal with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in July of 2001, I was abducted.  It seemed business as usual.  I was called to the room of my apartment and then the flash filled my eyes, and when it cleared, I was laying on the table again.  The grays usually planted dozens of accupuncture type needles in my chest, stomach, neck.  Rarely they would insert a tube into my ear or throat which was quite painful.  This time was the tube in my throat.  As the machine was being prepared, several of the grays seemed to rushin from another room.  They spoke to the ones about to experiment on me, and they all ran from the room.  I felt a rumble in the table I was laying on and heard a loud explosion, followed by what seemed to be weapons fire.  Several minuets passed and then a tall, armored figure wearing a blank faced mask entered the room, carrying a type of weapon, resembeling an assault rifle.  The figure removed the mask to reveal a very canine like face, with bright orange eyes, covered by short, blue fur.  The usual abduction experience was frightening, but seeing this new creature made me feel like my heart would beat out of my chest.  The being leaned over the instrument table the grays kept their tools on and began touching the objects there.  Suddenly I could move again. The creature came over to me and gently helped me into a sitting position on the table. Then, in plane English, asked if I was alright.  I told her(I say &#39;her&#39; because the voice of the being sounded most definitely female to me) yes and asked what was happening. I rose from the table, and she led me from the exam room.  Outside the room, in the large halls of the ship, there were dead bodies of grays around every corner.  Creatures like her, and several other new strange creatures were at control panles and moving about the ship.  The creature introduced herself at this point as Boudica(boo-dee-ca) and told me that this ship was going to be destroyed.  I asked her why and what was going on.  She then exlained to me something I never thought of in all the time I was being abducted:  The grays, in reality were a cybernetic lifeform created by Boudica&#39;s race and more than 3 dozen other races in contact with each other on the other side of the Milky Way.  Centuries ago, they formed a union with each other to establish trade, travel and the discovery of new lifeforms across the universe. However, space travle was a long, difficult affair.  So these large, strong alien races created the small, weak looning grays as sort of advanced scouts, used to seek out, examine and greet new intelegent lifeforms as they found it. They gray body design was chosen because the alien union thought that body shape the least threatening. They in general being tall and muscular, they couldn&#39;t see the gray body type being a threat to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceded through the ship, I noticed gray bodis being carried through the hall, some in peices.  And sure enough, in the open wounds of the grays there were servos, wires and components I could not identify in my limited experience.  Boudica took me to a room filled with several other large aliens.  One alien, an 8 foot tall being who appeared to have a reptilian face with a feathery red crest around its head, asked how long they grays had been taking me.  I told him(?) the last 15 years and he apoligised to me for all the pain and trouble I&#39;ve been through. Then he promised me I&#39;d never have to go through any of that again. Boudica told me I&#39;d have to be put to sleep to be transported back to my appartment, because they didn&#39;t fully understand the methods the grays used to teleport people from place to place.  She took a long rod like instrument from the control panle and waved it once in front of my face.  That is the last I remembered from the gray ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been more than 6 years since I&#39;ve been abducted. I&#39;ve tried to make sense of the events on the gray&#39;s ship tha night. As far as I can figure, they grays were supposed to be a scouting party to survey newly discovered intelegent races in secret. For whatever reason, they failed their mission, and would not stop abducting people and experimenting on them. So, the ALien union who created them is now in the process of finding and destroying them. It is my beliefe that whe the Ailen union finally destroys the threat to Earth posed by the grays, then they might finally make their existence known to humanity and induct us into their collection of races across the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report of abductions is unconfirmed.

From 22:00-23:30 we spotted 6 satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the Northern sky we both saw what appeared to be yet another satellite moving, but this one was very large (about 5 times the size of the others). It was a large, clear, and solid bright white. It was moving in s slow straight line/course. Then, it suddenly it made a VERY fast and sharp/severe Double Zigzag (like a giant “W”) across the sky, and completely vanished. I said, &#34;It must have passed behind the mountains.&#34;  My husband replied, There are no mountains there.  It just vanished.&#34;  He was right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning I phoned Twenty-Nine Palms, USMC, and spoke with a Captain.  I told him what I saw and asked him if it was night maneuvers.  He told me that there were no night maneuvers that night.<n>

But I am from New Mexico and I have seen alot of fireballs. I just never seen a fireball fade out so fast. The color of the object was yellow and red.

I took my infant daughter into the house and came right back out but could not see it. I have been a star gazer for more than 20 years and have never seen anything like this.

I was looking down into the Potomac River valley to the north towards Little Orleans, Maryland.  I noticed what I first believed to be a bright star or planet well above the horizon line.  It caught my attention, either because of its unusual brightness or a vague perception of movement.  While I was watching it, it suddenly disappeared.  My wife had not been watching, and I described to her what I had seen, and commented on its oddity.  A few minutes later, I observed the same light.  I pointed towards it, and said &#34;there!&#34;  My wife looked up and saw the light.  It remained for approximately 3-5 seconds, then again suddeny disappeared.  It was too large and bright to be an airplane, and the suddeness of its disappearance was its most remarkable feature.  It was also well-above the horizon and could not have been an object on the ground.<n>

At first we thought it was a plane but as it got closer and lower it looked more like two airplanes on top of one another.  it came so low we thought it was going to hit the house.  It flew over the house and we ran to the other window to watch it fly over the house and begin rising in the sky.  It just kept getting higher and higher until we could not see it any more.  I am not saying it was a UFO, but I am saying that we never saw or heard anything like it before.<n>

It was the brightest color I have ever seen and was a yellow yellow-green color but had a flourescent look to it. If you hold out your arm with the back of your hand to you,  that would be it&#39;s size.

The ranch where I was a guest was 30 miles away. So the following evening the 18 yr. old son of my hosts drove me into town to pick up my PA equip. in his truck. Going back to the ranch we had to travel quite slow as these are gravel roads through thousands of acres of cattle/wheat/ect. and  my equip. could be damaged. There were no lights anywhere for miles other than the headlights.  As we came up a foothill rize, I saw 3 bright lights in the northern sky. I pointed them out to the young man and he freaked. &#34;Wow&#34;!!! he said &#34;My good buddy and I saw lights like these last winter coming home from football practice&#34; We stoppe the truck, turned off the headlights and watched these 3 lights in the form of a triangle move through the sky from west to east... then stationary...then move. When suddenly the lights separated into a line and quickly headed into the handle of the little dipper and each one moved into the exact star pattern and never moved again. We watched for quite some time before heading back to the ranch. This ranch is about 20 miles south of the Canadian border on the &#34;highline&#34;. This is only the most recent sighting for me. I&#39;ve seen 4 before this occasion beginning in 1965 (with many witnesses) over Billings,Mt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Red, blue, green lights are seen going in a circle fast like a strobe light.  It gets very bright and the dull.  The first evening it was to the SE, then the next two evening it was to the SW.  It becomes most evident around 22:00 and lasts for approximately 2-3 hours.  The first night we saw this thing in the sky and stopped at a gas station to view it with about 3 other people,  after a 5 minute period we saw a red light come off the right part of the thing and fly very fast downwards then around the aircraft then disapear.  If you blinked you would have missed most of it.  We have video taped this and you can see the lights changing colors from red to blue to green.  It will go towards the ground then go back up almost as if it were a yo-yo.  On July 13 approximately 23:00 hours headed west on rt 30 I yelled to my husband &#34;what was that orange thing that almost hit the cat and then swooped beside it&#34;  he replied in a shaky voice &#34;I don&#39;t know did you see the blace thing in front of it as if they were in a playful chase?&#34;  My aircraft was like a flying stingray fish with large holes in the wings and a color burnt orange then there was a huge white circle in the trees.  I looked behind us to see if the truck behind us was causing the light and they were not for they had stopped in the middle of the road and got out pointing and looking.  They saw the same thing we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Except for the motion reported by the witnesses, we ordinarily would suspect that a celestial body had given rise to the report, probably Mars, which moves across the southern sky over the course of the evening.

To the right of the car, we both noticed something strange in the sky; three triangular objects.  What drew our attention to them was the fact that there seemed to be a center object (larger than the others) hovering, while the 2 objects surrounding it moved rapidly from either side of it. These objects had lights at all 3 corners (two red, one blue) and a larger white light in the center.  What was so amazing about these objects was their ability to hover, as well as their incredible speed.  We stopped and got out of our car to get a better look, but within about 5-10min they were gone.  A little later in the evening, closer to 10pm, we went out again to see if we could spot these objects.  As we drove on the interstate closer to Raleigh, they appeared again.  It seemed to me that we saw between 3-5 of these at various locations. Again, we got out of the car (with camera in hand) and one of the objects flew fairly close to us to allow a better look.  This object appeared to be similar to the center object we had seen earlier.  Also triangular, it appeared to have two very bright white lights at the top-most point, with red lights on the bottom two.  In the center was again a larger white light, and right above these were two strange markings of white light (resembeling &lt;&lt;).  This object came close to us, but made absolutely no sound whatsoever. In total, over about 1-2 hours, we witnessed between 3-5 of these objects.  While I was skeptical, I just can&#39;t explain what it was that we saw.  Another strange thing was that there was a much higher amount of air traffic (airplanes) in the area than we normally see. Though I can&#39;t be sure, some did appear to be military.<n>

My wife spotted the object first and, curiously, I had seen the same object a week before except it was about 5000 feet altitude and a mile off to the south headed SSE. More baffling is that in August of &#39;98 when my daughter (age 12 at the time) and I were camping at Cougar Reservoir (West slope of the Oregon Cascades, roughly central Oregan) she pointed out the very same type object as it passed over our campground at about 100 knots and 200 feet altitude. She was old enough to know it was a craft not from this Earth and got really scared and began to cry, thinking it was going to come back. A strange side to this report is that as the object passed overhead an Oregon State trooper came roaring into the campground and the overlook across the reservoir. He got out of his patrol car and looked up in the sky toward the object then got back in his car and hauled butt out of the campground.

We consider ourselves normal, everyday people. We don&#39;t subscribe to UFO literature and are generally not interested in the subject...although...in my 54 years on this planet I&#39;ve seen enough strange things in the sky that make you wonder if we&#39;re not alone.

It was big and I could make out rows of lights. the lights did not blink and were a dim yellow. I could not tell how high up it was, it seemed to be both high up and low to the ground. The speed that it went was unreal, it went from one side of the sky to the other in about 8 seconds. It was triangle shaped, or the lights made up a triangle shape.<n>

At this time I witnessed a incredibly bright series of three lights in the eastern sky. The series of lights would change configuration. Three in a parallel, then it would change to a pyramid configuration one on top of two. When the lights would realign a small yellowish-orange orb cicled the light pattern. It entered the top and exited the bottom. I have followed the night sky for all my 40 years. At first glance I thought this was the morning star. It was in the same region as the morning star. This was not the planet Venus. This was some type of event not consistant with the normal early morning sky. I live near Lake Erie, along the flightpath from Detroit to Cleveland. I saw one aircraft follow the normal flightpath. Two aircraft flew by this object and cicled it.  I have lived in this area for my whole life. I have never seen anything similar to this.

7/13/01 04:00|Beloit|WI|Other|until sunrise|One big white light and 2 smaller ones on it's side|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18406.html|281|ndxe200107| One big white light and 2 smaller ones on it&#39;s side<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I have seen this particular sighting.  The first time I saw it I thought it was strange but blew it off simply as stars.  However, since I&#39;ve seen it again, thought it might be worth sharing. Not really sure if it is a UFO per se, but it is definately not like anything I&#39;ve seen before. Would love it if someone could explain what it is. Around about the same time it was before, 4:00-4:30 a.m., I went outside for a smoke because I was having problems sleeping.  Outside, over I 43 west of Beloit, going towards Milwaukee, there was one very big extremely bright and intense white light in the sky and a smaller light on it&#39;s lower right side, stationary in the sky.  I noticed it right away because as I stepped outside the garage it was located directly in front of me.  I looked around to see if there were any other &#34;stars&#34; in the sky, because the sun was about to come up and I was surprised to see such a huge bright light at that time of the day.  As I turned back around, to look at the bright light and the smaller one, I saw another smaller white light  coming from the east side of the big bright light moving west towards it.  (It was small like the other light on it&#39;s lower right side.)  When it got in a position to where it made all the three lights form a triangle, it stopped.  Maybe 2 minutes after that, (still smoking so it wasn&#39;t that long)I heard and saw an airplane fly towards the smaller light that had just recently moved towards the big light.  As the airplane got closer to the light, the bright light in the center, changed shapes, it got oblonged and grew 2 armlike looking things from it (like a stick person without the legs). While it was doing this, the light got really intense.  The airplane went around it.  Then, not more than 1 or 2  minutes later (still smoking the same cigarette), another airplane to the right of me this time came from behind me, and flew towards the triangle and again, when it got close, the big light in the middle got oblonged and the arms came out, and the brightness increased. The airplane flew past it.  I came inside the house but went back out just before the sun came out (about 45 minutes later) to see if it could be seen in the day light.  When the sun came out, I could still see it. (It was that bright!) But it didn&#39;t stay long.  It got smaller and smaller and just disappeared, in a matter of seco! nds.  If anyone lives along, or near the I 45 freeway between Beloit and Milwaukee Wisconsin, check it out, it&#39;s a neat sight.  Like I said this is the second time that I have seen it, and both times were early in the morning around 4:00-4:30 a.m. before sunset.<n>

July 13, 2001, 9:30 p.m.,  Green Swamp, west of Orlando Reported to Tampa Bay MUFON Hot line While driving home on State Road 474 west of Orlando, Witness #1 and his son (13 year old) saw a pin ball like object, 30-40 inch diameter seen in rear window of his automobile.  It was reflecting back the details of the rear lights of the car.  It was shimmering as they drove and they both had the feeling that they were being watched.  He drove faster thinking that &#34;Something was coming on us.&#34;   As he looked at the rear view mirror the reflection was as a convex chromium surfaced object (pin ball) and he said he had difficulty focusing on it.  He thought the object to be 3-4 feet behind his car.   He said that there was something blocking the night sky as he looked up.   When they reached the end of the road they noted that there was an increase of light without any visible  shadows.  Both witnesses were frightened.  When they examined the car upon arriving at home (10 or 15 minute drive), there was nothing on the car or back window, no oily residue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lorraine Gerber, MUFON Assistant State Director www.mufonhq.com, local hotline (727) 595-7964<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Lorraine Gerber, and Florida MUFON, for this report.

It was 0515 hrs. The sky was perfectly clear. It was a mix of dark semi light and light. Traveling north bound at approximately 30-35 degrees from the earth was a bright light traveling extremely fast. Additionally., it was perferfectly horizontal to the earth. Behind the light was a trail (vapor?). The object was a size I have never seen before. It would appear to have been over either the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike. These highway systems at thes point are about 5-8 miles apart. At a point the object and the vapor simply disappeared. It was as though someone simply turned off a light switch and a room went dark. I report this now given the news story of sightings of unidentified objects this past Sunday night in New Jersey. Had I not seen this story on the national news this morning, I would hasve dismissed this entirely. I have never witnessed a phenemonon such as this in my life. You may contact me.<n>

I could not sleep so I got up and look at the clock and it was 02:30.  I walked outside to the campfire to have a smoke.  Earlier that evening there were thunderstorms, but the skies were clear at the time of the sighting.  After about ten minutes a flash lit up the campground as if it was daylight, I look up and saw what appeared to be a shooting star with a long tail behind it moving Northeast. It was not as fast as your normal shooting star, because if I had actually seen a flash from a real shooting star against the ground, by the time I look up the star would have already been gone.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 7 seconds. About 2-3 minutes later I heard one single boom. Then I knew for sure it was not a shooting star because I had heard what appeared to be an explosion. Earlier that evening, my family and I were watching lightening flashes and counting the seconds after the flash.  I told my son I believe for every second the lightening is a mile away.  If this is true than the explosion had to be between 120-180 miles away. I looked on the CNN website today to see if we had lost any satellites, but there were none. My brother had asked me how high I thought the object was, the only thing I could tell him is it appeared to be much lower than a shooting star. There were no running lights and the object  turned into a orange fireball with a tail of 1/3 of the skies length.<n>

We both get good grades. Anyways, i woke up and looked out the window. I noticed there was a bright &#34;star&#34; like thing. I woke my friend up so he could see the object. We both knew that it was way too bright to be a star or a planet, and that it was way too late for it to be Venus. We both looked at the object, which from far away looked white. We had an old handheld telescope which we looked at it with. And close up it looked greenish reddish with a dark spot in the middle. After a few minutes. the object started to slowly turn on and off almost. It would fade really dim and then go way bright. While doing this, the object started to slowly head up, out of the atmosphere we guessed. It slowed down even more, became more bright, and shot straight up, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I looked up I noticed a large white/green light travelling North. It was circular with a greenish halo and trail. It&#39;s size looked about as large as a penny held out at arm&#39;s length. It looked to be fairly high up, maybe just below cloud level. I was only able to watch it for a few seconds as I was driving but the last I saw was when it appeared to burst into flames. It looked like a falling star except it was much closer. It appeared to be over the Kirkland area. My friend had left work at the same time, and was heading North on I-405. He saw the exact same object heading over almost directly overhead I-405 heading North.<n>

It was much bigger than a plane and brighter than a shooting star.  The light was falling from the sky in an arc at an astonishing speed.  Then it just disappeared from sight, even though it was a clear night and nothing was blocking our line of vision.  What stands out the most is how big it was, its bright colour (green), and how fast it was falling before it disappeared.  We reported the sighting to NASA soon after it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the height of the event, it was moving  as fast as a jet across the sky and the head was very bright.  Suddenly the streak (tail) disapeared and about a second later apearred on the opposite side of the head (in a 10&#39;clock position).  At that moment it stopped moving downwards and seemed to stay in a relatively stable position moving slightly upwards again in the distance.  After this it just got smaller and smaller as it faded towards the horizon.  All in all this occurred between 9:05 and 9:25 pm with the most dramatic part being about 30 seconds.  VERY dramatic and bright - I was walking across the Granville st. bridge from work and myself, a co-worker and at least 15 other people stopped and stood viewing what was happenning.  I phoned the news stations when I got home, but although they said they had recieved calls about it, without camera footage they did not care.  In retrospect it seemed to have been a comet or meteor entering and exiting the atmosphere with the moment when the tail suddenly changed direction probably being the time when it was closest to the Earth (and land/water).  Actually scared the #*!@ out of me during that moment because it was so bright and fast (and probably a HUGE object up there).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received a telephone call from a Vancouver, B.C., radio station, reporting that witnesses had reported the event to them, too.  We have not idea what the witnesses observed, but our first guess would be a contrail from a high flying jet.  However, the witnesses insist that they were not looking at a contrail.  We do not know what caused this sighting report.  PD))<n>

A storm front to the south, clear sun to North allowed for clear visability ahead.  Noticed a slight white flash, as if something popped below the clouds ahead to my right at 2 oclock... thought it was sunflash off of a plane, but the flash didnt diminish, so it caught my interest.  My next thought was how fast it seemed to be approaching, following the line of the highway.  As it got closer I saw that there were no wings, then that it wasnt a helocopter.  I also observed a strange aura/trail around it similar to the heat that rises off a hot road. no sounds, seemed also to have a slight wobble; maybe caused by the aura, as it seemed to blur the outline.  object silvery, seemed to have black on it; shape seemed to resemble a trashcan (or R2D2 from star wars) Continued to approach, and passed overhead and behind me and I lost sight of it.  observed other people in the cars around me also looking into the sky as they passed me.  total time of sighting less than 7-8 seconds<n>

Lights remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:00 AM I took my dogs outside to do their business, the sky was totally clear and full of stars.  I live quite a ways from the city and there is very little light polution so I often look at the stars.  I was gazing at the stars and was drawn to the ENE sky by an extremely large light.  My first reaction was that it was the headlight of an airplane especially since it was in the direction of Cleveland Hopkins airport.  The main light was so large it  amazed me, It was the size of a cars headlight when viewed in oncoming traffic.  Along with the main light were two other lights more star sized, with the main light they formed a triangle with the two smaller lights at the bottom.  I watched this grouping of lights for at least 15 minutes trying to figure out what they were.  I concluded they were not airplanes as they did not move or change size.  The lights did not twinkle like stars so I thought possibly  they were planets, but the odd arrangement and the extremely large light did not make sense.  I often look at the stars and am familuar with most of the constellations so to see this in the sky continues to puzzle me.<n>

As they were looking at Mars in the southern sky, a bright light moving north from out of the south caught their attention. The object grew brighter in intensity and at first seemed as if it must be a meteor, but highly unusual as the brightness seemed almost too much to look at directly. It quickly grew to be twice as bright as venus, and then faded again. The still visibly bright light was suddenly joined by another bright light catching up to it as it moved north -- the two objects seemed to interact with each other. The two objects seemed about to collide with each other, then suddenly &#34;swerved&#34; or danced around each other, and then both lights zipped off in opposite directions, one to the east and one to the west.

The sky was dark, rain was about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, it was like someone turned a radio on and tuned their dial into us.  It&#39;s hard to explain.

They don&#39;t have a bird shape but that&#39;s my local venacular coming through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were laughing at us!  It was not a malicious laugh.  They were mirthful and humouring us benign humans.  I could hear them in my head, not out loud.

Small disklike silvery object doing abt 60 - 70 knots per hr. at a relative low altitude.  The event happened under partly-cloudy skies, and under very good visibility in terms of past days&#39; records. Event follows a nighttime event reported on July 4/01 at 21:15 hrs. (AST) of the sudden sighting of a comet-like structure at same height, which shifted shape and position turning into a fluorescent cloud that moved over SW portion of town.  Said sighting was reported by people as far apart as 7-8 kilometres, during a span of over 15 mins, and was reported on local press.  Some of the spectators reported said sighting as if &#34;the comet had appeared out of nowhere, like &#34;when you see ships appearing out of &#39;wormholes&#39; in movies&#34;. That same night, attacks on fowl and rabbits  by the ill-famed chupacabras (or goatsucker)were reported in the vicinity of Barrio Jobos, on the NNW side of Isabela&#39;s municipality - photographs of the attacked dead animals and the torn-up cages have been taken and are available to serious investigators.  These attacks and sightings have been ongoing for over 2 years and are still being ignored by most authorities.<n>

There is no way a plane could have traveled that far that quickly.  It was only a flash of light.  Was not able to see a shape. It was a redish/white light.<n>

It was spherical and had multi-colored lights along the base that were chasing each other, and it had a red ball on the top. The body was dark, and I didn&#39;t see the underside of it because of the treeline. I realized a split second later that it couldn&#39;t be the spaceneedle because that particular building is about 15 miles away, and this  sphere was between 1/4 and 1/2 mile away. I had my windows cracked open because it was a warm night, and I don&#39;t have a radio in my car, but I didn&#39;t hear anything that sounded mechanical or electrical. As I went down the road I lost track of it in the treeline. I didn&#39;t see it take off, but as this happened within a couple blocks of my house I went to go get my husband, and after I located him there was no sign of it. I would be very interested to know if there were any other reportings for that time and dates<n>

Me and a friend decided to sit outside because it was rather warm inside his apartment. We were outside for maybe 15 minutes talking and I happened to look up and something caught my attention. A dimm, yellow round light hovering in the sky about a mile and a half away. It was hovering about 100 feet in the air. When I noticed it I told my friend to look at it, I pointed at it. We both had no clue what it could be because the light was too big to be a helicopter, and we knew it wasnt an airplane. About 2 minutes after we spotted the object, we saw something very strange! The erea where the object was hovering over is a resivior (Sweetwater Resivior) which is our water supply. The object began dropping things into the resivior. The objects it was dropping fell very slowly and illuminated with many different colors. Rainbow colored objects. It was unbelievable. I couldnt determine the size of the illuminating objects, but they seemed to sparkle as they fell. On and off. After about 3 munutes of dropping things into the water, it vanished. The light was gone. It didnt fly away, just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As I walked back toward the house, I noticed a single white object high in the clear sky over my house. I stopped and watched it for about 30 seconds. It appeared somewhat balloon-like, being a very small and/or high-altitude, white colored, vaguely spherical object. It did not have a strongly defined path of travel, but seemed to drift about. It was definitely not a plane or other aircraft. The only possibility I was considering as I watched was some sort of balloon. I ran inside and got my digital camera. When I came back out, I saw that there were now several objects in the sky. Three of them were in a large equilateral triangle formation. The entire formation rotated as it moved off beyond the treeline. There were several other stray objects. After snapping a few pics, I went back inside and got binoculars. As I was walking into the house, I saw that one of the objects made a sudden controlled descent, dropping downward below the distant treeline as if tugged by a string. When I came back out with the binoculars, I saw that only one object remained. I looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it appeared to be oblong in shape, and part of it flickered as if reflecting sunlight. This object eventually rose very high until it was almost invisible, then moved beyond the treeline. It is possible that these were balloons, but their behavior seemed suspect. I have seen UFOs before, one of which I reported to NUFORC several years ago (1998, I believe). Only one of the digital photos came out with a visible object (what can I say, cheap camera). I posted that photo on a UFO message board. It can be seen at (http://www.ufoalert.com/pictures/159.html). The upper pic is the actual shot, the lower is a Paint Shop enlargement and sharpening.<n>

Where the Police helicopter was they made a pryamid shape formation. off to the distance I saw this silver sort of oval round thing flying at a steady speed. It went into a little cloud and didn&#39;t come out the otherside!!!!! Then from the west coming in an eastern direction was a black jet. I could even  hear it. The silver object I saw was about the size of a bic pen cap if I were to hold it at arms legth. Very weird. My heart is still racing.

Approx. 5 secconds later, the 3rd rejoined the formation, and then all 3 disappeared from sight, having passed across the entire horizon. These objects were yellow/orange in color, and, as stated by an 11 year old witness, looked like bats.<n>

Have a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 7:40 in the evening and I had walked with a friend(we were on a break from work at a summer camp)into the woods to this clearing were there is hammock. On our way we hear a loud buzzing noise like an electrical engine to a golf cart or something except magnified immensely. We followed the noise until we stopped and looked in the sky. We saw Two triangular shaped objects hovering near us. They were approximately 150 feet high if i had to guess. One was bigger than the other. They both had lights on each corner of the spaceship that were a dark red. The smaller ship then suddenly accelerated extremely fast and was gone and then the bigger ship opened a middle hatch and another ship came out of the bigger ship. Then they bothe proceded to acclerate very fast and were gone. This all happened within ten minutes. My friend left to go get someone else from the camp when the second ship left. She couldnt find any one in time. By the time they got back bothe ships had been gone for at least 5 minutes. I filed a report with the police department but never heard anything back from them. Still have no idea what they were. Personal guss would be an out-of-space aircraft.<n>

They seemed to be doing some type of arial exercise.  Then at 11:05am, a passenger plane that had just taken off from LAX, was making its turn around the So. Bay area, , when all five saucer craft left its current position and went after the plane.  I witnessed the passenger plane abruptly make a sharp turn and ascend to a higher altitude, when the craft began approaching the plane.  They followed the jet for @ 40 sec. and  returned to its original location.  On Sunday 07/08/01, at 6:00pm I was looking up at the sky when I noticed a bright object, that appeared to be as bright as a star,  I retreived my binoculars, and brought them into focus, and saw a Large triangular object, with lights under it which appeared to be changing color from an amber color to a fiery red, which could have be the suns reflection.  I continued observing the object to make sure it wasn&#39;t just mylar balloons, but the object remained stationary,  where as balloons will drift with the air current. ( There was a breeze that had also pick up in the early evening.)  I went in the house to get family members to witness this occurance,  and when spotting the object with the binoculars, I also then witnessed 5 additional craft , however these were saucer shaped, and were hovering also to the left of the large triangular object.  These craft were not moving for some time, aprrox. 1-1 1/2 hr. in the sky.<n>

From the moment we first saw it, it seemed as though it appeared out of nowhere, it shot acroos the sky and disappeared in an instant. The light seemed to be traveling just below the moon. Even though it was a little after the 4th of July, it traveled much to far and fast to be any type of fire work or flare.  My boyfriend and I don&#39;t particularly believe in aliens, but what we saw couldn&#39;t be identified or explained by either of us.<n>

I was pointing out to her where I saw what I thought to be a fire on Waterworks hill on the northside of our small town of about 60,000 people.  As we were looking a flicker of amber light appeared.  I thought this wa rather odd so I  got out my very light sensiteve binoculars and waited to see if the flicker reappeared.  I was supprised to see the light appear again only this time the light changed to a brilliant white.  I continued to watch and found that the light would change appearance.  About every 20 to 60 seconds light changed color, location and duration although the light flashes only lasted a maximum of about 10 seconds per incedent.  The light firsh was first amber, then white then amber then amber then red   then blue...  I had thought that perhaps these were left over fireworks but the short flash of most of the lights and the intesity considering that it was about 15 miles away made it seem unlikely.  As I contiunued to watch the light then moved behind the hill and projected a beem of   light upward in a &#34;V&#34; formation  so that all that was light was the air itself.  Then positioning itself back atop of the hill it flashed two short green flashes.  About a minute and a half later it then flashed a combined blue and red combination light.  As I waited there were no more light flashes for about 10 minutes then out from behind the hill a craft slowly appeared from behind west side of the hill.  This craft had a stack of three amber lights horizontally and vertically.  In the center very brilliant white lights strobed from left to right.  It then changed direction and started moving slowly north toward the small community of Saint Ignatius, Montana.  I watched it slowly drift north for about 3 to 5 minutes.  A comercial airliner then flew directly over my home and within seconds the unidentified craft made a extreamly quick turn to the east and accerlerated.  I would say the ! craft by that time was 30 miles away and during its acceleration covered 10 to 15 miles in about 3 to 5 seconds and disappeared bihind a group mountains somewhere in the St. Ignatiius Valley which is in the Mission Mountain range area.  I have never before seen a craft that I felt that I could not explain but both my wife and I were and are baffed. I was not going to report this for fear of being thought of as I may be accused of causing a mass halucionination with my wife but our local radio station that they had received several calls from people around the Missoula area that a green light had been seen moving about our city late Saturday afternoon.  This gave me the courage to tell what I and my wife had seen.<n>

My wife and I were visiting my brother who lives in the Alief area. Soon we headed to the car that was parked right outside the garage, my wife yelled, What&#39;s that!! She was looking South pointing at a white bright light coming toward our direction at tremendous speed. My wife and I along with my brother and his wife just wateched the ligh come above us, there was no sound whatsoever. The light did couple of nice manuvers then headed toward north, did couple of circles and then vanished. While I was looking at it, I noticed it was apox 100 meters high. I believe it was a probe and not a space ship. It was a breath taking experience.<n>

The sky was clear and you could see a lot of stars.  My brother in law pointed to the sky and said &#34;what is that&#34;.  I looked to the sky and saw a (V) formation of six or seven white lights that almost looked like shooting stars but slower. The (V) formation was missing two lights on one end to make a perfect (V).  The formation looked a little blurry to me. The formation moved from the ocean side (South) to the north, high in the sky, maybe out of the atmosphere. The formation moved very fast lasting about three seconds.  Iam a Vietnam veteran and retired Police Officer.  I have lived near a military air base most of my life.  I have Never seen anything like this in my life!  About 11pm I called the Patrick Air Force base, which is near by, and spoke to the operator at the base.  I told her what I saw and asked her who I could talk to about what I saw.  She advised me that the Air Base did not investigate UFO sightings and advised me to call the Sheriffs office, which I did.  After telling the dispatcher what we saw, she said she had no other reports of what I saw and asked if I wanted to see a Police Officer and I stated no.  At aprox 3am I could not sleep thinking about what I saw and called the Sheriffs dispatcher again.  This time I talked to a male operator.  I asked him if he had any reports of strange lights and he stated &#34;oh yes&#34; lots of reports!  I told him what I saw and he had a quick change of attitude and asked if I had been drinking?  I told him no.  He said what you saw were fireworks and asked if I wanted him to send a Police Officer and I said no . I hope some eone else saw what we saw!<n>

July 7,2001 945 pm, I observed a UFO and filed a report Aug 8,2001 .I reported a (V) shaped UFO, which was missing two lights on one end, while in Melborne Florida. (see original report for more info). Today, Aug 20,2002, I was checking your website and observed a report and drawing of a UFO reported 7-23-2002, in Valencia,California.  This drawing is the same shape craft that I saw, except for the color of the lights.  My wife and kids make fun of me all the time for the report that I made to your website.  This report and drawing sure make me feel better for filing my report! Thank you for all your hard work!<n>

I lived on twenty acres of plush land and trees no neighbors. Suddenly a large light from the sky came on down over on the hill side about 200 feet from where I was standing. The light appeared to be around 80 feet in length shooting straight down. It looked like a huge search light of some type. A light that a light house becon puts off only this was shooting straight down onto the hillside from something in the sky. There was no sound of any air craft or hellicopters.  It was a clear white light shining down and was wider towards the ground and thinner as one was to look up to see where it was coming from, but could see no source from where the light was coming from.  Was pitch black. It lasted for only about ten seconds than went off and did not return. Was truly amazing.

Craft appeared to be dome-shaped, black, and possibly 5 to 10 feet in diameter. The object had no lights, and there were no anomalous effects surrounding it. It hovered motionlessly in the air for most of the sighting, but occasionally drifted back and forth, and appeared to waver or change shape at one point. It may have been a black trashbag lifted by a thermal, but the shape seemed too symmetrical (except for the few seconds when it &#39;wavered&#39;, as if behind a heat wave). Driver confirmed the siting, but could not watch for the entire duration. Object disappeared after passing behind trees, and did not come out the other side.<n>

We had taken a boat to the far side of the island that the city of Ketchikan is on. It is very remote out there except for a few forest service cabins, most of which are unocupied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the evening around 5:30PM my father, step mother and I went to go collect the crab pots we had set earlier in the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the crab pots was in a small bay, the beach went up from the water for about 30 yards and then turned into dense forest. We did not notice anything when we first entered the bay and stopped at the crab pot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we started pulling up the crab pot me and my father both looked up at the same time, I am not sure why we did as we did not hear anything unusual and we were occupied with the crab pot at that time. What we saw when we looked up was very odd but did not scare us. We saw a large rectangular shaped thing sitting about 10 yards up on the beach. It was about 20ft high 20ft wide and 30 ft long. It had perfectly square corners. It was also more brightly white then anything I have ever seen. And as this was South East Alaska during the summer there was no chance it was snow, not that we ever get that much snow even in winter and never that close to the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure why but we both went back to pulling up the crab pot. It took us about 45 seconds to finish pulling it up. When we looked back to the beach the object had gone, but we had not heard a take off or splach, and the object was much to large to have made its way in to the dense forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My step mother claims to not have seen anything, but she also addmitted that she had not looked at the beach in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Bringing me back to what I was saying about my trip to work that day I looked up into the heavens and I was near where one of the crop circles had been, there in the sky was a metallic disk flying high not moving no noise completely silent. The sun was shining on this object, which gave it a mirror effect and that’s what drew my attention. It then just disappeared right in front of my eyes while I was still looking at it.

I live on the 18th floor and have an unobstructed view of the mountains to the northeast, Burnaby City, and Mt. Baker. It was a clear crisp evening and I was looking directly out the window when I witnessed a huge fireball approx. 1/2 the size of the hay moon that evening. It streaked in an arch from  south to northeast for approx 6/7 seconds appearing to be directly over Burnaby (Although probably farther past) Judging by the size and the intensity (Red/Orange with short trail) My first thought was that it might have hit either mid BC or into the rockies??? I was unable to get any information on it the next day and local news desks received nothing over their wires? I&#39;ve asked just about every night-owl and insomniac I know and no one observed it. I&#39;m quite certain this was not the Linear A2 commet due to its size and visibility. It was stunning!...Anyone??!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from Vancouver.

Upon turning my eyes skyward, a very bright, white light caught my attention. It looked like a star, but very bright, brighter that anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky other than the sun and moon. It was west from my position, at an azimuth of about 50-60 degrees. It shone for about 10 seconds in the same position, then faded away, shrinking in size and diminishing in intensity until it was no longer visible, as if it were either simply disappearing or traveling away in a straight line at a speed great enough to leave the atmosphere within seconds. I observed the area for another 10 to 15 minutes, but no further activity was noted.<n>

The sky was clear, stars shining, etc. and the mood was upbeat. I (sober) first saw something seem to rise in the distant North horizon. A circle-shaped ball of amber light was directly below it, but flickered out after about four seconds. I called out to anyone who would look- a light blue oval was shooting across on an exactly straight path overhead. No one could ID it, elongated and about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. It went, still glowing into the Southern horizon and not making sounds, although there was a sound system in the area. This is my second sighting; it wasn&#39;t as shocking this time... I&#39;m still angry about not being told a straight story.<n>

It didn&#39;t look like anything I have ever seen.  I know it was not some type of balloon or known aircraft.  It looked perfectly round with nothing attached to it.  And it was shinier than anything I have ever seen.  When it would rotate to the black side it was not solid black.  That part is hard to explain. lol.  And just to add it seemed to be rotating slowly.  I also forgot to add that there did seem to be an aura or haze around the object!<n>

It made kind of a looping u-turn, then it made a big left hand turn, and started accelerating. Then it accelerated so fast it disapeared from sight in about 3-5 seconds. It was unbeleivable! It was like Star Trek or something the way it disapeared. There was no sound or anything. At first we thought it might be a satelite until it turned.<n>
7/6/01 14:00|Allentown|PA|Rectangle|20 min.|rectangular object extended spiral tail (black and silver) and climbed to about 12k feet in under two minutes, no noise or lights.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19482.html|347|ndxe200107| rectangular object extended spiral tail (black and silver) and climbed to about 12k feet in under two minutes, no noise or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My little boy and I were in our front yard when I saw a black rectangular object hovering about 200 feet high and perhaps 500 yards to the south east of my home.  As we watched it the object began to drift to the west very slowly.  Since it was a very bright day with good thermals possible I thought the object might be some kind of debris that had been lofted into the air by a strong thermal and wind.  As we watched the object it grew a sprial tail that was at least as wide as the object itself and two to three times as long; this tail was black on one side and silver on the other.  It began to climb very rapidly with the tail spiraling in a clockwise direction.  Since it was in the local airport traffic pattern I called a report of flying junk into the ABE airport; they said they did not have anything on radar. Given the altitude and distance of the object, it must have been about 20 plus feet in length and at least six feet from top to bottom.  The cloud base was about 12 to 15 thousand feet that day and the object climbed to cloud base in less than two minutes.  I could keep visual contact as the sun reflected from the silver side of the tail. I have thought about this object nearly every day since we saw it and came to the conclusion that it was not just some kind of junk floating around for the following.  First if it was something like a cardboard box, the rectangle would have become mishapen when the tail extended as that would have been part of the box.  Second even in a boomer thermal I have never seen an object climb that fast (no whosh or whoom) it just climbed near vertical with the spiral tail flashing in the sun.  If it had climbed in a thermal, my experience is that a free flying object would circle and float not just climb like this thing did. This object is without question the most unusual thing I have ever seen. I would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has ever experienced this type of thing and if they did identify the object.<n>

I was accompanied by a young adult female and as we conversed I observed a bright light, (flying in the sky) resembling a star moving from left to right.  I had witnessed this type of movement from these bright lights within the same vicinity before, and I started to turn my high beam lights on the object as I had done previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved to the left I would briefly turn the high beams on in my vehicle once, and when it would move to the right I would I would briefly turn the high beams on and off twice (or vice versa).  During this flight pattern, my companion was not happy about me showing attention to anything besides her, and was discouraging me from shining the lights towards the object.  This went on for a few moments when the bright lit object began to fly up and down as well as left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object flew up (moved up or ascended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 3 times, when it flew down (moved down or descended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 4 times (or vice versa).  Also during this time, I observed a red light in the distance flying to left of my vehicle. I did not pay it too much attention as it could have been a plane.  Either before or after the lit object began to fly up and fly down my companion observed it as well and said “Okay, now that thing is moving”. I decided that we should get out of the vehicle to witness this bizarre flight pattern. As we stood at the front end of the vehicle, the lit object began to fly towards us at a high rate of speed. At this point the objects light must have reached us, (just like a mirror would reflect sunlight on a person’s face in the daytime) because without saying a word to each other, we simultaneously took a few stuttering steps towards the veh! icle doors in a hurried manner. We looked at each other briefl! y and I mentioned to her “Let’s get the F—k out of here”! We entered into the vehicle and I drove us out of there in an extreme hurry at high rate of speed. On our way out I had calmed down realizing that whatever we witnessed was not in pursuit of our vehicle. Being a young adult male, I decided that it was safe for us to pull over and continue what we set out to do when we parked in this area. At that time, my companion reclined her seat so that she could not look out the front passenger window. I was leaning over the middle console conversing with her when I observed another object (possibly the same object I shined my light at) appear just over the hillside approximately 50 yards away. If I had to estimate I would say it was  100 yards above ground. At this moment, numerous yellow, red, white and green lights appeared on the object and were flashing on and off with a row of white lights spinning around the middle of the object. I could hear rapid clicking sounds as well. At this! point the object ascended  approximately 50 yards higher (its highest point was approximately 150 yard above ground) than its original position and then descended approximately 100 yards down to a position of approximately 50 yards above ground. It flew up and down twice before going back to its original position at a 100 yards. It did this in approximately 1 second and proceeded to fly to the right at a slow pace. I could not believe my eyes. I felt as though this was something I should not be witnessing, the equivalence of taking a man before the wheel was invented, and placing him in the middle of a highway with nothing but 18-wheel rigs driving by him with lights all over each rig!  We would experience the same feelings with the same expression on our face! I find it ironic that I was not terrified at what I was witnessing, just shocked and amazed. The object repeated the flight pattern three times, but with the last it ascended once and descended once. Just before the! 3rd pattern my companion said to me “Oh god, not this again”.! I repli ed for her to ”Look”, (I was in such shock I could not speak at first), she answered “Oh god”. I got frustrated and impatient and yelled “F----ing Look”! Just as she began sitting to an upright position and looking to her right, the object flew out of view behind a hillside. I witnessed an object in flight that I will forever question and she missed it! I didn’t even have a witness although I was with another person. Sometimes I wonder why didn’t she hear the initial clicking from the lights, or maybe a reflection of the object anywhere. Now, whenever I am outside at night I will look to the sky’s for anything unusual. I often think about that object, what was it, who flew it, where did it come from, who owns it because something has to, where was it manufactured, does it have a monetary value like a car, and where is it now? Is it in a hangar somewhere, a garage or is it destroyed on some desolate planet?  Or maybe, it’s occupants are awaiting the rapture so that they can re! veal their role in Human history with lie’s spewing from their mouth. Whatever the case, there is definitely a higher intelligence far beyond our own and our government must have some kind of information that could shed some light on this controversial topic. It is even possible government officials were piloting the object and had a great laugh at my expense. This account is real and there is definitely something of another intelligence other than ourselves in this universe. I have never heard of any other accounts similar to mine and the only thing close to it is from a John Lennon song of a UFO he witnessed while in a NY hotel room. If needed I could provide pictures of the vicinity where the second encounter took place. Also I would be willing to make a composite drawing of the object if needed. I am very interested in knowning of any other accounts such as mine and hope I am not disregarded.<n>

We asked them what they were looking at and they said &#34;the green star up there.&#34; So we continued down the road until we reached our house. I got out of the car and watched it for a little while. The star moved slowly towards us at an extremely slow speed, almost unseeable. Then all of a sudden it shot back to a star at light speed. When it hit, the star lit up really bright for a split second, then returned to normal. No more than 10 minutes later we were over across the street in our other neighbor&#39;s driveway, talking to him. I looked up and saw a flock of black birds flying directly overhead. They made no sound, and it was pitch black out and so were the birds. It was a miracle that I saw them. It took me a long time to get everyone else to see them by pointing them out. What i&#39;ve found is that ufo sightings are somewhat strangely linked with black birds somehow, I haven&#39;t figured it out yet, but I&#39;ve heard other people&#39;s sightings, and some of them saw black birds too. I hope that was usefull to someone out there, and if not, oh well, it still has my attention and I know I saw what I saw, and I know that what I saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains totally anonymous.  We wonder if the &#34;green star&#34; may have been a twinkling star.  We do not know if blackbirds traditionally fly at night, and we have no suspicion that blackbirds, or their activities, are in any way related to the presence of UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>

I look up and I see a bright white light, to the immediate right of that was a small red diamond, and barely touching to the right of that was a large blue diamond. The diamonds were so colorful and they had black lines going through them like you would see on a cartoon or something. It made a very loud, hard to explain noise. The ufo flew to the left in a straight line for about 10-30 seconds, then went up, left two black marks in the sky which looked like skid marks, and completely disappeared. We sat there amazed and asking each other exactly what the other saw. About five minutes later we heard the same noise in the distance. It got louder and we looked back to see a futuristic-looking car flying over the trees not too far away. It was very close and you could see it&#39;s details easily. It was blue, had white headlights, and blue and red lights (the same color as the diamonds).. Also there was a weird oval around it that was transparent. A force field or something I assume. It flew very slow as we watched it go past the lake, a tree strangely bending over, then bending back up, on the other side as it passed over it. There were at least 10 other people in that same backyard asleep, but it seemed like the loud noise the ufo&#39;s made would have easily woken them up. It was the 4th of July at 1 am and no one else on that lake claims they heard or saw anything, which I find weird.<n>

I had looked at the clock, because I was waiting for my wife to return from the airport.  I immediately noticed a red light, moving generally from west to east.  It was bright enough that I initially thought it was a low flying, small plane.  I thought it would turn, at some point and I would see a blue or white light.  When I did not, I continued to watch it move in the direction of my house.  Then, it slowed and seemed to make a very tight semi-circular turn, then stopped,and became motionless. At this point, I thought it must be a helicopter, but I continued to watch it.  It gradually became a smaller red light, like it was moving straight up.  Then it seemed to stop again.  It appeared to be slowly spinning now, because about every 20 seconds, it seemed to have a dark band, running vertically. I continued to watch it (by now about 15 minutes had elapsed), I saw what looked like a short burst of silvery threads below it (about 2 inches proportionately in the sky ).  At this point, it had the appearance of a red star, in the sky, vs the earlier appearance of a low flying plane.  It then slowly disappeared, as if it was moving straight up.  The sky was clear that night, with no small moving clouds, in the area. I have been thinking about what I saw, since that morning and decided to search the internet, for a place to report it.  I noticed 2 other reports, very similar to my own, so I now know that I was not alone, in viewing this object.  I am a affluent, professional, business man, rational, and not under the influence of drugs.  Once I foud your web site and read the other 2 sightings of the same object, I almost did not report it.  Then I decided I should, since one more description might help in determining what he obect was.<n>

I dismissed it as a plane since it did not move in relation to the star within 5 minutes.  Another red light &#34;dropped&#34; from the light approximately 1 inch below the primary light and then disappeared.  The primary light moved to the right slowly during a 5 minute period.  I grabbed my video camera and tripod hoping that the zoom feature may shed some light on what was causing this bright red light.  During the next 10 minutes, I observed the light &#34;pulsating&#34;- growing brighter like a light on top of a tower to almost disappearing in the clear sky then brighter again.  The light then gradually moved up above the neighboring star (during several minutes) and then stayed still. The light would dim to almost nothing then appear again.  Eventually, after 45 minutes, the light disappeared.  Please note that the sky was clear, no clouds or wind, no rain, and the neighboring star remained constant and visible during the observation dismissing the possibility of clouds interfering with the brightness of the light. I am a college educated, drug-free, teacher who has never seen anything like this before.  My husband is also drug-free ( I feel I must include that one) and very sane as well.  We are VERY normal and extremely skeptical at the possibility of this being a UFO, but of course, I have no other explantation.  I have been thinking about this for 2 hours now and am writing this at 1:52 a.m. the same night.<n>
7/4/01 22:00|Big Pine|CA|Disk|7 1/2 hours|3 objects take off from mountains near Big Ears site|5/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28925.html|361|ndxe200107| 3 objects take off from mountains near Big Ears site<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the 4th of July my girlfriend and I went camping at Owen&#39;s River in Owen&#39;s Valley near Big Pine and the Big Ears station.  Our campsite was on the eastern bank of the river approximately 150-200 yards north of the Taboose Creek river crossing.  At around 8 P.M., we watched the Independence firework display (approximately 30 miles south), as well as the occasional displays over Bishop (approximately 25-30 miles north).  At around 9 o&#39;clock, when most of the fireworks had stopped, my girlfriend sighted a strange object in the sky east of our camp.  By my reckoning, the object was about 3 miles east and between 500 and 800 feet in the air.  It hovered just above the top of a peak in the White Mountain Range.  From our vantage point, near the easternmost side of the valley, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime, and had a three-layered disk shape (the top and bottom sides more narrow than the center layer, similar to a hamburger shape).  Around the middle of the object were a series of revolving lights. They turned in sequence...  YELLOW-ORANGE-PINK-RED-WHITE etc., etc. Thge object hovered over the mountains for about 30 minutes, in which time it sporactically darted from place to place, excelerating rapidly then gliding to a stop in diagnol, horizontal, and vertical movements.  At one point, the object came closer to our campsite, growing to about the size of a quarter.  From it, several beams of white lit up the mountain side and base.  The pattern appeared very clearly on the ground, consisting of about 20 to 30 white circles spaced out and forming a hexagon in it&#39;s entirety.  This light moved over the ground and the side of the mountain like a search light, and at one point actually lit up the tree just above where we were sitting in the bed of my truck.  I think it is important to note here that my rottweiler Tank was also aware of the object at this time.  He sat at the tail gate of my truck in a guard position and watched the desert around us to the east.  He did this! fully alert for some hours.  It may be equally important to note that at this time we were yelling back and forth to some other campers about 100 yeard up river to our north who were all watching the same event.  Sometime after the the white lights stopped, the object retreated back towards the mountain, at which time it emitted a second series of lights which included a red horizontal beam which hit the mountain side at regular intervuls.  This sequence was always followed by a series of vertical lights which scanned over the same area.  It appeared to me like a grid.  It was during this time (about 1 hour), that my girlfriend noticed another light go up from the mountain.  It appeared to have the same shape and spinning lights at as the first, but was much smaller in comparison (if it had indeed taken off from the mountain top, then it would have been a few miles behind the original object.  It is very likely that they were actually the same size).  Shortly after the second object started to gain alttitude, a third object took off from the mountain from the same area as the first.  It was also the same shape as the other two with the same lights, and was the same size as the smaller of the two others.  This object drifted straight up while the one that had gone up before it drifted diagnally to the right (or south).  The time between the two take-offs was somewhere between 2 and 3 minutes, at which time the grid-like lights from the first object had ceased and it darted upwards to a great height at great speed. The lowest of the objects (the last to &#34;take off&#34;), stopped climbing for about a minute.  It was at this time that we saw a red beam flash beneath it to the mountain top, followed a second later by a strange rushing sound.  After this, the three drifted upwards in unison for a few more minutes, then one by one, the revolving lights of each stopped turning and the objects became solid white lights against the black night.  It occured to me at this point that they looked remarkably like stars.  W! ith the exception of the largest object, they were almost indistinguishable from other stars, almost.  They drifted straight upwards in a triangular pattern which they held for hours.  The only way I could keep my eyes on them (my eyes were beginning to become confused by the abundance of stars that night and focusing on just one or two lights became increasingly more difficult), was by comparing their drifting movements to that of other stars (the three moved significantly faster than other constellations).  I watched them drift upwards until early morning, in which the light of the sun made them impossible to see.  I did, however, catch a glimpse of the a metallic reflection high above before the sun broke fully into my eyes.  It might be important to note that in the morning, I could see the area where the two had taken off from, and there seemed to be a trail of smoke or vapor which started at the top of the mountain.  I fell asleep sometime early in the morning, but was awakened by the sound of two jets (F-16s by the look of them) flying low through the valley and circling the mountain top where we had seen the objects just hours before.  The fighters left and came back many times during the day (assuming that they were the same planes), until it started raining around 5 in the afternoon and after that they never returned.  It was a very strange 4th of July for me and one that my girlfriend and I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On July 4th 2001 a friend of mine, his sister, and I were driving home from a fire works show in Long Beach around 10:30 or 11:00 PM. I was looking up in the sky in the back of the convertable and I saw a light suspended in the air, it looked like it was an airplane, except that it was not moveing as far as I could tell ( I was in a car going about 60mph) the odd part about this light is that it seemed to be dripping an orange-red fire, it would drip a few flames then stop, then it started dripping some more. I dont know how long the object was there for because we where driveing away. When we (my friend and I) looked back it was gone, a dark tree or building might have been obstructing our view, I cant say. I know what you are all thinking: it must have been fire works. I dont know about you but I have never seen fire works that stay in a fixed vertical position for any length of time and drip fire. that would be some pretty boring fire works. plus we saw it was after the shows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date of the occurrence to July 04, 2001, as indicated in the text by the witness.

We observed a Roman Candle set off behind us and turned to watch it. I watched the trail of smoke emitted from it, but then immediately adjacent I saw a trapezoid-shaped, black object moving slowly and silently at an altitude of no more than 2,000 feet. I called out to my two sons, a friend, and my nephew who all watched with me as the &#34;object&#34; continued to move East out over the ocean in between the haze and dark clouds at a speed of no more than 50 or 60 mph. The object then accelerated to about 100-150 mph and then seemed to vanish within the clouds. We were all deeply awed, and all of us repoted seeing the exact same shape, height, and speed of this object--we all dismissed it as too large to be a &#34;stealth fighter or bomber&#34;, or even a large dirigible. We estimate it to be about 80 or 90 feet tall and about the length of two football fields.<n>

I was startled as it seemed very low, very close and very loud. The sound &#34;appeared&#34; immediately before the sighting. I looked up and saw it coming into my view over the tree tops, it passed over my head and watched it &#34;fly&#34; out of sight.  It never hovered and it was not moving at an abnormally fast speed and the movement was very smooth. For as loud and large as it was, it didn&#39;t seem to be going very fast.  The sighting took about 15 sec. It was in the shape of a triangle - a &#34;brushed aluminum&#34; looking material - with 2 flashing red lights on the tip of the &#34;wings&#34;.  It was moving forward.  It had a wide &#34;acoridan&#34; design on the underside.  It was a very &#34;strange&#34; experience and I &#34;knew&#34; immediately that I had just seen something very unusual.  Background: I have recently moved to the midwest from Houston, I am a middleclass, white female, mother and grandmother, single and am totally sane and have never seen anything &#34;unusual&#34; before no have no desire to go looking for unusual people or things or to have contact with &#34;aliens&#34;.  But I DO believe I saw something that is NOT a US aircraft.<n>

The plane was not directly on top of us but about 20 degrees to the right of us. Me being the airplane fanatic that I am I was watching it, when suddenly just behind the plane out from a clound comes this small pearl white object (about the size of the jets rudder) that was following the plane and keeping pace with it. Now because of my flying experience I know that if this was a smaller plane theres no way in the world it could keep up with the jet.There were no sounds or anything with the object just the object and  the plane. The plane was easy to see but because of the clouds,sun,and blue sky, the object was a little harder to see. The only ones that saw it were me,my stepsister,and stepmother.We all watched as the object followed the plane untill the plane was out of site.<n>

Maybe the UFO caused the storm but metorologists did predict the stormy weather. I turned around to get my camera but when I looked back it was gone and I&#39;m not sure if anyone else encountered it.<n>

I have seen and heard of many sightings in the area in which I reside/and have resided. The first was in aproximately 1969, we were on a neighbors deck in Seahurst, our address at the time was ((address deleted)) 25th ave S.W., we were not too long from the water/Puget Sound. Our neighbor had a telescope and we were looking at stars at approximately 8:00 p.m., we saw a rapidly moving object, maybe covering 20 miles back and forth, in the matter of seconds. This was my first experience with unexplained phenomena, I was 9 years old. I then became aware of events occuring around Seahurst beach proper around 1975. A friend of mine who lived at Seahurst beach &#34;((pseudonym deleted))&#34; told me about his brother &#34;((name deleted))&#34;,seeing a large cigar shaped object in the early morning as he was doing his early morning paper route on the upper ledge of homes above the Seahurst Beach cove/fault line. I kept this information on file, and when I was in a Philosophy class at Highline Community College in 1982, I brought up this sighting, as well as the other, while we were discussing paranormal activities in our class. another older woman in our class brought up the exact same sighting as &#34;((pseudonym deleted))&#34;, it seems she was one of my friends &#34;((3rd name deleted))&#34; mother and she also lived in the Seahurst Park neighborhood, &#34;I thought this very ironic and strange&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last sighting was on July 4th 2001, at aprroximately 5:30 a.m. I am a musician, and my friend and I were working and recording music all night long on Tuesday July 3rd from 7:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. July 4th 2001. I woke up early to check my blood sugar, &#34;I am a Type 1 diabetic&#34;, I went out on &#34;((4th name delete))&#34; deck, &#34;my fellow musician&#34; above Redondo to have a cigarette. I looked out over the Puget Sound, &#34;because it is so beautifull there&#34;. His cat had come outside with me. I then saw a large Oval ball floating over the bay directly in front of Redondo, approximately 3 football fields away from me. It was black and silver inside, and the two colors seemed to be mixing together and rotating inside like wet paint. I would say it was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter from my perspective. It hovered and paroused the area until it went out of my sight, to the right because of the large trees in the area. The strange thing was, is that ((name deleted)) cat was watching it the whole time with me. Of course ((name deleted)) and my friends thought I was crazy. I now live under the flight path coming into Sea/Tac, in Des Moines, WA. I have many times thought I heard, stange sounds and lights outside of my condo/bedrooms window. Since I am a type 1 diabetic, and am prone to insulin reations, &#34;911 medics have been here more times than I wish to mention&#34;, I do not know if these experiences are real, or part of my imbalances in my brain. I know that on July 4th 2001 my blood sugar was 125 mg/dl which is normal. Go figure?<n>

It comes in from South with a high speed and then about 10 seconds later de-accellerates,  then comes to a complete halt, fades and blushes up again to an extremely bright white with a metallic blue haze around it,  does this in 5 seconds and moves on accellerating fast towards North.  My window was open, and there was no sound that I could hear from this object, there was no reflections or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immedately dressed and went out to further investigate, but saw nothing but clear skies with stars.<n>
7/4/01 00:00|Kennewick|WA|Light|~ 1 minute|Silent, orange ball of light seen crossing the night sky in Kennewick, WA.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18300.html|371|ndxe200107| Silent, orange ball of light seen crossing the night sky in Kennewick, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out my window towards the north and  noticed a bright orange light appearing to be rising from several miles away, as it broke over the shadow. The object was first thought to be a large firework, but the object did not explode, nor did it stop rising after several  seconds. I then thought that it might be an airplane taking off, as the airport is in that general direction.  The object then appeared to stop rising and track horizontally and southward after it had risen approximately three finger widths at arms length.  At that point, the odd nature of the object instilled curiosity and a desire for further investigation.  I went outside, and through my binocularts tracked the object as it approached me at somewhat an obliwue angle.  My binocular power setting was high at first, and revealed what appeared to be two orange lights seperated by a small distance.  My hands were shakey, and at that power things were hard to focus, so my thought was that it was an airplane with wing-tipped landing/takeoff lights.  However, it struck me that the object was making no sound and the typical red and green marker lights were not seen. I then reduced the power on the binoculars, making it much easier to focus the object, and the thing I saw revealed itself.  The object had a large central orange ball of light, in which a smaller orange ball of light circled at approximately one orbit per second.  Several seconds later orange debree was seen falling from the object, and slowly fading in color, as though it were cooling, and disapperaed prior to reaching the level of the trees and houses across the way.  It was then that I thought the object might be burning material caught on an updraft and prevailing winds, but there were not winds sufficient enough to move the object across the sky as fast as it was travelling, nor did the object&#39;s shape and characteristic change after the falling debree.  I continued to track the object for several more seconds until it just vanished.  Through the entire incident no sound was heard, and no other color was seen other than the orange of the two balls of light.  Whether it was one object or two is not known to me.  I wonder if others have seen this same object and can confirm what I observed.<n>

We just finished droping off the last of our friends and I was last to be dropped off. we were at the intersection of the street I live on and anotherand I looked out to look at the clouds. I was staring at the clouds when i noticed a low hovering, green glowing, circular object just below the clouds. It was not moving at all. It was sordof cone shapped looking to me but all the others in the car said they didnt see anything. We kept driving down the road to my house and when we got there  we all headed inside because my friend&#39;s mom wanted to talk to my mom. My friend and i decided to go outside and look for it at the intersection so we got on my bike and headed to the intersection to see. we were on our way when i looked up in the sky and saw a green glowing ball hovering and a red glowing ball right above it. they seemed to be dancind in circles above eachother. i couldnt make out their exact shape but they definetly werent an airplane of any sort. i rushed home to get my parents and a camera and then we went back outside to look and it was totally gone. that was it.<n>

We suspect she is an excellent source of factual information regardsing the event described here.  Case is under active investigation.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> sister, friend and I saw some UFO&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside and I was about to ask my sister and her friend something when they started to tell me they thought they saw a UFO.  So I ran down to where they were and started talking to my friend, and then we saw this big shape like an egg almost as big as a house, it was like a bluish, silvery color. Then we ran to tell my mom and she came outside to see if she if she could see it too.  But it was gone so she went back in the house.  Right as soon as my mom went in the house we saw a shape again but it was sort of a more triangler egg shape.  Then the shape started to shoot out something in a line, and sort of looked like a lot of small triangles hooked together. The shape was like a silvery white color and was about as big as maybe a mansion.  The color of the  things that shot out of the shape were white. Then my friend and I ran back to our house to tell my mom again while my sister stayed back to see if she could see anything else.  But my mom still didn&#39;t see anything so she went back in the house.  After that we went to the spot to see if we could see anything else.  But we didn&#39;t except for the sky which lit up behind these houses we weren&#39;t sure if it had landed or not. Then about five minutes later my sister and our friend were walking back to the house and I thought I saw some red lights moving around in a tree or something.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anything so I called my sister and friend over to ask them if they saw anything but they said they didn&#39;t. So we walked back to the house.  Then after we went back to the house my sister went back to the spot where we had been seeing the shapes and said she saw the red lights moving in the trees too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A more complete report from the same source, submitted after we had spoken with the witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were sitting on the curb in front of my house.  We noticed a flash of bluish-white light to the left of us, and then an<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were sitting on the curb in front of my house.  We noticed a flash of bluish-white light to the left of us, and then another flash of the same light to the right of us about 15 seconds later.  We assumed that it might just be a strange form of lightning.  We did find it a little strange because we usually see lightning behind our house, and the &#34;lightning&#34; seemed to just appear and move horizintally instead of the usual vertical lightning.  My friend and I then went into the house.  We were sitting on the couch, and looking out of the window when suddenly we saw an egg-shaped craft of the same color as the &#34;lightning&#34; in the sky a bit south of our house.  It was about the size of a house.  We ran out the front door and saw it disappear.  In hopes to see it again, we then ran down the street towards the direction in which we had seen the ship. My sister came out of the house.  We told her what we had seen and she joined us down the street.  It had been about one minute since the first sighting when we saw the craft again.  It was the same size, shape, and color.  It was a little further south of the area in which it first appeared.  The craft stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.  We ran back home and told my mother.  She came outside with us and we went back down the street to the place we had been during the second sighting.  We were out there telling my mother what happened for about 2-3 minutes.  She then went in the house. About a minute or two later, my friend and sister and I were standing in the same spot when a second craft appeared in the place where the first sighting had occured. This craft was the same shape as the first, but it was twice as big.  It was a light silver color.  An extremely bright, white beam of light shot and of the craft and sort of beamed around the ship.  There was some kind lightning-like bolts that seemed to be coming out of the beam of light which gave of white squiggly lines and small triangular light.  The ship disappeared and we ran back to my house to get my mother again.  She was outside with us for about 5 minutes but saw nothing and went back inside. My sister and friend and I then went back down the street to see if there was anything else to see.  Our neighborhood is surrounded by canyons and my sister noticed red lights flashing around some trees in a canyon about 4 blocks south of us.  My friend and i started walking back to my house and my sister followed.  A minute or two later, I went back down the street to see these red lights.  From the distance I was at from them, the lights were about the size of the tail lights of a car.  They were flashing in a running-motion (sort of like the motion christmas lights) around the trees.  I went back home.  A few minutes later, when my sister and friend and I went back to see the red lights, they were gone.<n>

There was, what looked like, a plane without wings very high up.The length was about the width of my thumb and it appeared metallic. There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky so I figured I&#39;d watch it to make sure the sun wasn&#39;t playing tricks on my eyes.I thought it might be a blimp but they probably don&#39;t reach that altitude.I put my groceries in the car (took about 30 seconds)and turned to look again and it was gone.....no trace.Blimps don&#39;t move that fast!<n>

It was still light out. There was a large irredescent white object hovering silently and motionless below the moon (new moon, I think) with a small jet ascending beside it at a 45 degree angle, as if to fly above it. The object wlooked like a cigar with two fins, much like the profile of a sun dial but with an extra &#34;fin&#34;. It was a strange white, like the moon but was too far below the moon to have been confused with it. I drove a mile on Route 30 before I stopped at a cul de sac to observe. I got scared and continued on my way home. About 2-3 minutes on my way, I saw what seemed a large commercial, passenger airplane hovering noiseless about 100-200 feet above the trees, above a house. Both the unidentified object and the passenger airplane hovered as if set upon invisible pedestals, while the jet flying ovetr the u.f.o. was ascending quickly, either to investigate/attack the u.f.o, or to avoid its path. The passenger plane was close to me, nowhere near the u.f.o. The next day I noticed two small, private-like planes flying around and lots of chemtrails.<n>

There was a triangualr (flat equilateral triangle) craft moving across the sky, we live next to an airfield to we didn&#39;t know what to make of it. So we carried on playing our game.  Approx 14mins after we saw it it came back againbut goin the other way, it would occasionally float accross and then vanish again, but this time it was closer. We rung the airfield and they said that there was only something reflecting and they couldnt make out what it was.We started to get very nervous and scared so we went inside and observed outside whil watching t.v, nothing happened until about 17mins later when the t.v went off, the phone started ringing and the fax came through with all types of wierd stuff, I have the fax to proveit, it sends chills just looking at it, our cellphones went dead and we saw it again but this time it was hovering right over our house, it slowly picked up speed flew over some trees and we never saw it again. We live in the country so there are a few valleys it could have gone down and hidden because we only saw a group of jets fly over the valleys apparently doing a practice run, these pilots didnt look rookie though, and it seemed strange the flew over just as the craft vanished beyond our sitings, I dont know what to take of this, it happened about a half hour ago, i dont know because we have to reset our clocks. only contact me by email<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report, from a student, is the only one we have received of this alleged sighting.

I was on my break this morning, on the 6th floor of the hospital on Capitol Hill.  The lounge on the 6th floor has a commanding view looking westward, toward Puget Sound.  The skies were clear, there was no precipitation.  I was sitting on a couch in the lounge reading when out of the corner of my eye I saw something big, red and moving.  Looking out the window I saw a very large RED FIREBALL descending rather slowly, apparently over the north Sound area.  It was quite large, appearing to be nearly half the size of the almost-full moon.  It was extremely bright, a glaring reddish-pink in color.  It was definitely burning as it fell, not sparkling or hazy, no diminishment in size as it arced downward through the sky.  I watched it as it went behind the 3 radio towers located atop Queen Anne hill - I could clearly see the framework of the towers illuminated from behind as the fireball descended behind them.  It then fell out of sight behind Queen Anne hill itself.  There were no bits of debris of any sort that flew off the fireball as it fell, no ejecta, just a BIG red ball lazily falling through the night sky.  I was miles away, and this thing, whatever it was, was huge.  Needless to say, I have no idea what it was I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report may address an apparent emergency flare that was reported by a tugboat, whose crew reported that they thought it was somewhere over Lake Union.

The sky was bright and clear. I was looking west in the direction of the sun, which was below the roofline of my house. My first impression was that I was seeing a white pilot chute and that the main chute wasn&#39;t opening. The speed and direction wern&#39;t right for a parachute and skydiver and the object faded and disappeared from sight. At first I thought it might have been a satelite (it still could), but why could it be seen in brite daylight? I suppose from my angle of viewing, it could have been bottom lit by the sun. Also, it&#39;s velocity across the sky was a lot faster than the satelites I&#39;ve observed.It took approximately 5-8 seconds to travel through about 15 degrees. At first it appeared to be falling and then disappeared in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be a quite credible source.  PD))<n>

We stopped between Cle Elum and Ellensburg at the Indian John Hill rest stop for lunch.  While having lunch I was looking north toward the Mt Stuart range.  I watched a jet airliner pass across my field of view eastbound above the mountains.  Looking upward at about 45 degrees to see if I could spot another plane I noticed a chevron-shaped formation of small silver blobs.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses and could just barely distinguish the lighter silver of the blobs from the blue of the sky.  I removed my sunglasses to see if I could see the formation better but without the sunglasses,  I could not see it at all.  Putting my sunglasses back on I could once again see the formation but it was becoming more difficult as it moved northward toward the horizon.  I guickly handed my sunglasses to my wife and asked if she could see anything.  She could not and then my daughter insisted on a look.  By the time I had my sunglasses back, I could no longer find the formation.  In all I probably only saw the formation for ten to 15 seconds at somewhere between 1:20 and 1:30 PM PDT I am unsure how may silver blobs made up the formation, I would guess either seven or nine &amp;#8211; one at the point and then either three or four in each trailing arm.  While the chevron pointed west, the movement appeared to be to the north. At first I assumed this was a flight of geese but there was no shifting of position or movement.  The formation remained rigid.  I also thought it could be a formation of high flying military jets and cannot fully rule this out.  I was however struck by the consistent pattern of the formation, how none of the silvery blobs shifted in relation to all the others.  And of course I am intrigued that without the polarized sunglasses, the formation was essentially invisible.<n>

It was a pretty coudy night and the sky was colored light/dark grey. I look above the building and I see a circle. It had no lights and it made no sound and it looked like it had a diameter of about 15-20 feet, it was pretty big. It was a circle and it looked like it was floating about 10-20 feet above the building. It was just a pitch-black circle. I couldn&#39;t identify any textures or features that it had. It was just a dark, floating circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get my father and my aunt to look but until I got their attention and until they looked, it was gone.

My dad was boiling some water for a drink when he noticed a ball of light hovering in the sky towards Saxton hill it stayed there for approximately 2-5 minutes and phased out. We didn&#39;t think much of it until about 10 minutes later we saw it appear again over Scarborough it hovered there for about a minute and phased out a again. We then began to question what we ahd seen and I got pretty nervouse. Another 5 minutes later it appeared again above Saxton hill again. I scarambled for the Binoculars and got a glimpse of the objects it seemed to look like a White sphere with orange lights on the body although I am not completely suer because I was ina rush and may not have focused on the object properley. On all occasions the objects phased out and appeared to be approximately 2000-3000 feet above the ground. My Mother and sister saw this object aswell.<n>

A friend and I both saw something as we were walking across the street heading towards a gas station.  We did not receive any signals from outer space or anything like that but we both know what we saw was NOT a firecracker, airplane, shooting star, or comet.  We have both seen things of that nature before.  (Note: we are not and have not been under the influence of any drugs.)  We saw an extremely bright greenish blue light that appeared directly in front of us in the middle of the sky and shot rapidly down across the sky until it disappeared as quickly as it had originally appeared.  There was a bright red trail behind the object and it made no noise (or if it did we were too far away to hear it.)  We realize that todays date is close to the 4th but we KNOW that what we saw was NOT a firework of any kind.  If you receive any other emails regarding this phenomenon, feel free to email us back.  Even if you don&#39;t, please email us back with any web pages or other sites that you think we should contact.  We believe that we know beyond a resonable doubt that we DON&#39;T know what we saw.  We also believe that it was NOT any of the things that commonly could have been mistaken for it.  We have seen all the FOX specials and neither one of us believes in UFO&#39;s but we can not adequately explain what we saw by using any other word.   We are not crazy, we are just convinced we have seen something that warrants some sort of an explanation.  Please take this email seriously.  We are going to copy this email and send it to a few other sites that we think might be interested to hear what we have to say.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken to this witness, and we find him to be a quite credible and serious-minded.

As was our habit, we had been fishing from sundown and intended to fish until dawn.  At around 2330 hrs. we both noticed what appeared to be a single bright light in the area of Kimberling City which at that time was about 2 miles south and east of us.  We both assumed it was a medical helicopter based out of Springfield, Mo.  We had seen the helicopter on other nights and went about our fishing.  During the next few minutes we noticed the light didn’t move from the area we originally spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an effort to get a better view we motored up the James River Arm which would allow us to see a lower altitude in the area of the light.  After moving 2 miles upstream (away from Kimberling City) we stopped, turned and noted that there was actually more than one light.  We actually counted at this time 4 lights in what appeared close proximity with each other.  The lights were moving slowly in our direction (north-northwest) at a slow rate of speed.  Occasionally 3 of the 4 lights would hold position as one light went forward.  The separation appeared to be as much as 500-750 yards.  It would &#34;hover&#34; as the other 3 lights caught-up.  Then the same light would again scout forward, as if scouting for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I owned a new Ranger Bass Boar equipped with a 200 HP outboard engine.  It had a top speed of around 75-MPH.  As we continued watching and noticing the way the formation was progressing we figured it might be time to vacate the area.  I tried to start the engine and while it would crank, it failed to fire.  I used the electric trolling motor to move toward an adjacent boat dock in an attempt avoid a direct overflight of the boat by the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving about 35 yards the trolling motor began to slow.  Then it also stopped working.  There is no reasonable explanation as both the electric motor and the afore mentioned 200 HP motor later started without effort or adjustment by my friend or myself.  By now the formation was 500 or so yards away from our location and what I was referring as the Scout Craft was no more than 60 yards away.  What was really remakabke was the total lack of any noise from any helicopter rotors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know it was almost daylight and my friend and I were in my bass boat 15 miles        up river in the area of Galena, MO.  That time of year the sun rises at around 0625 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

About two weeks ago I was in Key west and staying at a hotel. I was in the pool, which is obviously outside, the time was approximately 10 PM. As I was relaxing (I had not been drinking!)and staring into the night sky I suddenly noticed a &#34;V&#34; formation of orange spheres. They were moving fairly slowly from my point of view but I realized that at the altitude that they were traveling their speed must have been much greater. The odd thing about this was one ball that was zigzagging in and out of formation. As much as I am interested in UFO&#39;s I am a logical person and do not jump to conclusions, but I have no explanation for what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/1/01 21:20|Victoria (Canada)|BC|Cylinder|approx: 20 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Tube shaped Object|7/23/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29864.html|395|ndxe200107| Tube shaped Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received a telephone call from a man who resides in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. He reports that himself and two other friends saw an object sitting at approx: 100 feet from the ground. The sighting took place right downtown in Victoria, B.C. over the Calwood Hills. (Witnesses description to where the object was seen). He said there is the break water running along Dallas Road, and from here you can look over what is called the Calwood Hills, in the Calwood area which is over a small stretch of water called the Esquimalt Lagoon. The witnesses were out taking a walk right down at the waters edge at sunset and fortunately one of the men had a pair of binoculars with him. One of the fellows looked up and thought he was seeing a very large airplane over the Calwood Hills. The distance between the witnesses and the hills was approx: 3 to 4 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they all realized what they were seeing was not an airplane they got very excited and went on to explain the shape of the object to me. One witnesses described the object as being tube shaped, or like the fuselage of a large aircraft just sitting stationary in one position. Even though the sun was setting behind the craft, they could see it glowing brightly from the objects side facing the three men. It was slightly tilted at about a 20 degree angle then moved slowly down behind the hills. The men stood watching for approx; 20 minutes more to see if they could catch another glimpse of it. It was about 9:45 p.m. and completely dark at this time when the object came back up and sat just above the trees. Finally they remembered they had the binoculars with them, and started to pass them around so everyone could get a good look at it. After watching it for about another 10 minutes it slowly dropped back down again. Due to having a young child with them at the time, and it was getting cooler they decided to head back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow I talked with still went on with a few more details about what he had saw. When the object dropped down for the last time, he said it would have been right over a small lake, called Prospect Lake which is spring fed. He also said the lake itself was only a half kilometer across at the most. After thinking about it, he wondered if the object was dropping down to pick up water. The fellow claims that what was witnessed was larger than two of the biggest aircraft he knows of, even with them being so far away. There were no wings visible on the structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thanks the folks for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for this report.

I watched them for a while, and had to go inside for a moment.  When I went back outside to see them again, they were gone.  They looked to be very high up, yet they were very shiny in the evening sunset.  I thought they must be satellites as they were not moving as any craft would be doing.  To verify the satellite theory, I again went out at 8pm the next night, but they weren&#39;t there.  I can&#39;t seem to dismiss this as satellites.  And I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.<n>

We obseved with our natural eye, then tried to pick it up with binoculars.  That was difficult but one of us was able to see it briefly through the binoculars.  It appeared to be a bright circular (unenclosed on one side), and seemed to move faster when observed through the binocular and hard to keep in vision.  It disappeared when it got almost straight overhead, and we could not pick it up again.  We observed it for 5-10 minutes (estimate, starting about 16:30-16:35 and lasting  until about 16:45.

(Bushnell 7x35, 420ft.at1000 yds.,14om at 1000m, field8) I searched and found the object , it hadn&#39;t moved it was very shiney and look to be wobbling in the one spot I watched this object for aleast 15 to 30 sec..  I then put my binocular&#39;s down to help my husband with the grill and then picked up them up again , when I went to look at it had change shape and looked like a column wobbling in the same spot . I turned to say something to my husband and looked back and it was gone from that spot where I was looking .  I then ran down the stairs to see if I could see it more from the direction to west and high in the sky , it was there for just a moment and it was gone ..  As I was looking at this object for the first time I said to my husband this has no wings so it can&#39;t be a airplane and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter. I know what they look like and this wasn&#39;t it ... All of this happen at about 3:20 or 3:30 pm this 1st day of July , Sunday .  There was no sound coming from this object , but it did look to me as if there was some sort of short beam coming from it in a downwards direction ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone at length with this witness, and found her to be a serious-minded person.  Her description of how suddenly the object disappeared from her sight, combined with a similar report from Gresham, OR, approximately on hour later, suggests to us that she may have witnessed something unusual.

It was a I think cigar shaped craft hovering over our lake.  It had about 5 or 6 red and white strobing lights on the side. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then real slowly started moving left.  I saw it go behind my neighboors house and I ran outside to see if I could still see it but then it was just gone.

This wasn&#39;t the sort of red cloud seen at sunrise or sunset.  The time was about noon, and the cloud was cumulus type and small.  As we watched, the cloud gradually split into two clouds, each of which then appeared to emit red virga to the ground.  In a few minutes both clouds had rained themselves onto the ground east of Laramie and had completely disappeared.

Nevertheless, my former asiistant and myself, were 500 feet in the air on the rooftop of a 50 story high rise where I have been employed in building maintenance for 22 years. This was in the heart of downtown Chicago. We were checking out the chemtrails left by some tankers that were spraying the area on that morning, ( another story entirely) when we simultaneously noticed a mettalic looking round ball sitting to the left of a very small cloud about 300 feet above us, but out over lake Michigan. We were inland about two city blocks from the lakefront, and I estimate the object to have been at the lakes edge, or directly above Lakeshore drive. As we pointed towards it, the object slowly moved behind a very small cloud, the only cloud around, and then appeared to go straight up. This was only about a 5 to 10 second viewing, and once it was behind the cloud, it&#39;s upward motion which we detected for only a second, yeilded to a complete absense of the object. Nothing speedy about it, it just appeared to briefly go upward behind this very small cloud, and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both sober, and both kind of feeling funny about the viewing. We joked that we had better not tell anyone, but of course we did. It was forgotten about over time as it was really not that much of a sighting. Very bland and very brief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have never reported it if I hadn&#39;t come across the opportunity to do so here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, we were 500 feet in the air and observed this metallic colored round ball. When we pointed to it and gazed at it, it moved behind a small cloud as if to hide itself from our view. We stayed on the roof another 10 minutes or so and it never re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Boring perhaps, but quite true. I&#39;m not saying what it was, or was not. I dont know one way or the other. Also, the object was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This flight path can be seen on a map from Blanka peak, CO (next to the Great Sand Dunes National Park) to Guadalupe peak, TX (Guadalupe Mountains National Park). This theory is on display at the Roswell International UFO museum and research center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are awaiting a video tape, in which the individual develops his theory.  PD))<n>

It and the other spacecraft moved across the horizon for the first segment of the encounter, during the second segment it moved at extreme speeds. There were two craft. The craft both left a trail of a mettallic grey dust that faded within five to ten seconds. All of this was observed over a large lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how the alleged events described by this young student could have extended over 1.5 hours&#39; time, as he indicates above.

7/1/01 02:45|San Pablo|CA|Circle|few seconds|bright moon sized object appeared to be over hills in Marin county as seen from Contra Costa County, Ca|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18307.html|405|ndxe200107| bright moon sized object appeared to be over hills in Marin county as seen from Contra Costa County, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was setting at my computer at approximately 2:45 am. The only light on in the house was in the room I was in, a ceiling light. The window above my desk faces west and I often look up at the window. The view includes the hills in Marin County as seen from near San Pablo bay in Contra Costa County.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a golden harvest moon, it gave off enough light to see the hills below it.  My impression was that it was the moon, but there was something off about it.  I commented in an IM that there was either a beautiful full moon or a UFO outside of my window.  It probably took me less than 30 seconds to type that and when I looked up again it was gone. I went outside and the sky was clear with stars clearly visable but I could not see the moon from my yard.  The object was moon sized but it didn&#39;t have the &#34;face&#34; in the moon, was more yellow than golden and seemed sort of speckled.  There are no street lights visible from my window and nothing in the house that could have been reflecting.  I don&#39;t know what this was but it was very strange.<n>
7/1/01 01:00|Jerome|AZ|Formation|3 mins|Three lights in formation|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18322.html|406|ndxe200107| Three lights in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three lights in sky, originally believed to be satalites, all moving toward each other from different directions. Met in a triangle, then moved together in formation to the south , over Cottonwood, towards Phoenix. Moved fairly quickly, then faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>
7/1/01 00:30|Quantico|VA|Light|10-15 seconds|Bright light coming closer and then disappearing|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18562.html|407|ndxe200107| Bright light coming closer and then disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on firewatch at Marine Corps Officer Candidate School and was looking out the window of the squad bay sometime between 2400 and 0100.  I saw a light in the distance.  At first I thought it was a star because it did not move, but then it started moving off towards the right, but then seemed to get closer (or at least a lot brighter).  After maybe 5 seconds it quickly faded and then completely disappeared.  It was a clear night and visibility was pretty far, but it couldn&#39;t have been more than a quarter mile away when it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the event occurred near midnight on June 30, July 01, or July 02nd.  Time and date indicated by the witness are ambiguous.  PD))<n>
