It was not a satellite.  We were walking back from the [Fort Lee] Service Club one night when the sky was very clear and this very distant dim spot of light came over the sky following a definite course.  Ordinarily we would have known it as a satellite, but then we saw that it had a zigzag or bobbing motion rather than a smooth course, and twice it receded or faded from view, as though it turned outward from the earth, but each time it came back.  (It was a completely clear night, stars bright, not a cloud in the sky.)   Twice also it definitely changed direction.  Finally it receded outward a last time and disappeared.  We have seen satellites enough to know them and this was unlike any satellite I have seen.  It was about the size of a very distant star and about that bright.  Its course and motion caused us to question what it was.”  Additional facts:  The sighting took place in a large open grassy ground where the sky was extensively visible without obstruction by objects or ground lights.  While the impression of zigzag motion might suggest the alternating wing lights of a high-flying plane, the most striking feature of this sighting was the object’s changes in direction, which impressed me very strongly as being made “on a dime,” that is, without a turn such as a plane might make, but a sudden, angular turn, without pause, which no known plane or satellite was capable of making at that time.  These two changes in direction were substantial, not slight.  My recollection is that the first turn marked a sharp angle, that is, sharper than a 90-degree turn.  The second turn was perhaps less sharp.  The night sky had more the clearness of winter than the usual haze of summer, and the stars were shining brilliantly.  When the craft faded from view, the third fade being the last, it diminished in size as well! as brightness, suggesting that it was moving away from earth.  Again, this was not the movement of a satellite and my memory is that it faded in place, not as it moved across the sky.  In other words, its fading was like its sharp angular turns, suggesting an instant upward-and-away movement.  We never for a moment thought it was anything like a meteor as it had none of those properties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that alcohol played no part in this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She was with a boyfriend, about one am. It was very dark. She had snuck out of the house. They were parked on a hill, listening to radio and talking. My mother had her foot dangling out the open car door, with her shoe kicked off. All of a sudden, a brilliant white light lit up the entire area. Everything could be seen, like it was daytime. She did not see an obvious source of the light, but she was quite scared. Everything was brightly lit, but not so much that it was impossible to see. A sort of very bright white daylight. There was no sound. She pulled her foot back in, slammed the door, and they drove off as quickly as they could. She was so terrified she does not remember if the light went away, or if they passed out of the illuminated area, though she believes the latter happened. The two of them vowed never to tell anyone, and she hadn&#39;t until a day ago, nearly forty years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the mother to submit a report of her recollection of the event.  PD))<n>

When the car rounded a corner, we all saw it: a massive, 3-tier Mexican-type pyramid shaped object, floating silently in the air, the entire ship glowing a pale luminous green. We thought we had witnessed it for ten minutes, but when we arrived home we realized an hour had elapsed. I was nineteen years old at the time, and the other witnesses were my thirteen year old cousin, my 39 year old mother, my 64 year old grandmother, and the 26 year old driver of the car (female.) I have had subsequent strange experiences, and also remember strange figures in my bedroom when I was a child. I have since become a successful musician and live a relatively sane life, but my experiences are always with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to contact the other witnesses, and have them submit reports.

5/15/66 22:00||AZ|Disk|10 minutes|Driving late at night in the middle of the desert, I stopped and watched a spaceship hovering close enough to see windows circling it|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89790.html|4|ndxe196605| Driving late at night in the middle of the desert, I stopped and watched a spaceship hovering close enough to see windows circling it<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1966 I was with a friend and we were driving to Guaymas, Mexico from Tucson, Arizona. My 3 year old son was asleep on the back seat of the car. It was after dark and I had fallen asleep when my friend stopped the car, pulled to the side of the road in the middle of the desert not far from the Mexican border. He woke me up and said, “look at that.”  We got out of the car and there in the sky in front of us hovered a spaceship. It was close enough to see what appeared to be windows encircling the middle section. Circling the middle section was also what looked like light blue and green colored vaporous lights swirling around the windows. The space ship was shaped like two huge saucers placed together in a v shape and it moved slowly in a circular direction. We watched it for awhile and then it just instantly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been open minded and my male companion who lived in the foothills of the Tucson Mountains, said that he had often seen UFO’s there. Still, all I could think of was that someone was filming a movie about spaceships out there in the middle of no where and that was what I was seeing. It looked exactly like what I had always thought a spaceship looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after when we reached the border, I tried to explain what I had seen to the Mexican border guards and was stumbling to find the Spanish word for saucer, but my friend finally told me not to bother since it was not something that they would probably understand in any event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After spending a couple of days in the resort area of Guaymas, we drove back to Tucson the way that we had come. I kept looking for tall mesas in the area where we had seen the spaceship as that would explain why it had just instantly disappeared while we were watching it by flying behind a mesa, but there were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often mentioned this sighting to others and no one seemed to doubt what I had seen. Perhaps there are more people in the world who do not disbelieve in their existence than one would imagine.  I had never seen one before nor since, but I know what I saw. I do not know from where it came or even if it may not have been created by someone on our earth planet. This is the first time that I have written this down and forty six years later, it is still quite clear in my mind. I expect that I just took it all for granted and the only reason that I am writing about it now is that on June 20, 2012   I heard the guest speaker, Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast say that it was necessary to share this incident with an organization such as the one that he represents at www.ufocenter.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/15/66 22:00|Mentone|AL|Egg|10 seconds|Both objects skirted the top of the ridge, keeping equi-distant with each other; traveling very fast.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38139.html|5|ndxe196605| Event occurred when I was a junior in high school, and has haunted me since (I now am 55 years old, and I am also a college graduate and a teacher).  Believe the event happened around the second weekend in May, 1966, but I am just now reporting it.  You may verify the event as reported in the Chattanooga Times, approximately the second weekend in May, 1966.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attending a house party (hosted by the Jr. Optimist Club) with a group of high school juniors and seniors from Chattanooga, a group of us were sitting around a campfire in an outdoor clearing, with one girl playing the guitar and others of us sitting around the fire.  Adult chaperones were present.  In the background at a distance of about two to three hundred yards was a ridge; a dense forest in front of that, with a lake.  Looking up at the sky (unable to tell the direction), I noticed two egg shaped objects that appeared to be about the size of a harvest moon appearing just above the ridge, moving from left to right.  One object was slightly above and ahead of the other.  They appeared to be a silvery-white in color.  Both objects skirted the top of the ridge, keeping equi-distant with each other; traveling very fast.  Suddenly, both objects stopped, and made a 45 degree turn to the left and upward, racing up until they vanished out of sight.  Those of us who were facing the ridge were able to track the event in its entirety; the others turned and looked as soon as we shouted &#34;Look at that!&#34;  Needless to say, none of us were able to sleep that night, and talked of the event all night long.  Upon returning to Chattanooga, I noticed that The Chattanooga Times ran a short article in their paper referring to Unidentified Objects spotted near Mentone, Alabama. This event can be confirmed by that newspaper report that appeared in the Sunday edition, I believe, of the Chattanooga Times. Would like a reply, by e-mail, as to exact date of the article in the Times, if possible.  (I have moved away from Chattanoog).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ll remember for the rest of my life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were in our kitchen doing the dishes and quizzing each other for a science test we were having the next day.  We were both in the seventh grade at the time.  My brother, who’s a jokester, was sitting on the rail of our back porch talking to us through the screen door.  All of a sudden he looked up into the still sunny sky and said, “Look, flying saucers!”  My friend dropped her dish towel onto the counter and dashed out the door to take a look.  Being my brother was always horsing around, I didn’t believe him and told my friend not to believe him either.  Well she was out the door already, and when she looked up she shouted back to me, “Yeah, come look, flying saucers, for real!”  I rushed out the door, which took about 5 seconds to do, and looked up into the sky and saw two saucer shaped objects, hovering above our house.  They looked to be about 30-35 feet above us. There were no wings or tail extended like an airplane or helicopter.  There were no noises or sounds that we could hear.  It was gray in color with one red and one pink light blinking from its underside.  I quickly ran through our little house, from the back porch, through the kitchen, the dining room, and into the living room where my mother was.  I shouted for her to come and see the “flying saucers”, and ran back out to the back porch.  In about 5 seconds of getting there, the two objects silently lifted into the sky and zipped out of sight in a matter of a second or so!  As quickly as I can zip my cursor from one end of my monitor screen to the other, is how I would describe the UFO’s course of action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 55 years of age now, and can still, vividly remember that afternoon like it was yesterday.  Anytime the subject of UFO’s or flying saucers come up in our presence, my brother and I look at each other and laugh, then we’ll say, &#34;We know, we saw some!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It looked just like a full moon except it was flying maybe 1000 ft. above ground. This is the first time I have told anyone. I tell you this thing looked like the moon with grayesh color, and even had what looked like crators from objects hitting it. I was 7 or 8 at the time making it around 1966-67 spring to summer, a cristal clear nite. This happened with in a few seconds,from over my school roof to maybe a mile away where trees got in the way. THIS EVENT IS BURNED INTO MY BRAIN AS IF IT HAPPENED MINUTES AGO. Please bare in mind that Gering is in the sticks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It happened early enough in the evening that it was still light outside despite the surrounding hills. Most of the concert choir had gone outside the front of the school to socialize and enjoy the nice weather. Suddenly, someone noticed a fairly strong light coming up the Ohio river valley from the south. I think our initial thought was that it was a helicopter because of its altitude and its slow leisurely progress, but as it came closer someone pointed out there was no whooshing sound.  The object continued moving to the north up the river valley until it was directly overhead. It appeared to be triangular shaped, with three round lights at each corner and one larger light in the center. It seemed to be a silvery colored metal,approximately 200 feet above ground, smaller than a light plane and with no visible wings.  As it continued it passed directly overhead, giving us a clear and unobstructed view of the underside of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The event was reported in the news, and they said it was a weather balloon (yeah, right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around dinner time, my brother yelled to come outside.  We saw a bright green object speeding across the sky at the same altitude from one side to the other.  I believe it was south to north.  It went as fast.  It was not possible to tell how high it was, thus it is unclear how fast it really was.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was about 16.

We could see an object above the Boeing Plant.  We got binoculers out and could see clearly a saucer shape with a person inside glass dome and a cable running to the large building at the boeing plant.  It looked exactly like My Favorite Martian Ship.  We watched for awhile and got bored.  I think Boeing has the technology and were testing that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At one half mile away, it was about 200 ft over the lake, no sound, obviously metal, dark red or rust color, about the size of three football fields across by 500 ft high.  There were a lot of circles and angled metal parts that were clearly visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for at least 20 minutes, trying to figure out how a structure so large could just sit in the air.  I turned to go home, turned around for one more look and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the date because it was so long ago and I was only 13 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
