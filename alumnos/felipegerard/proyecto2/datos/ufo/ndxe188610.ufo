No special pain was felt until the ninth day, when the skin peeled off, and these blotches were transformed into virulent raw sores.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hair of the head fell off upon the side which happened to be underneath when the phenomenon occurred, the same side of the body being, in all nine cases, the more seriously injured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remarkable part of the occurrence is that the house was uninjured, all doors and windows being closed at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No trace of lightning could afterward be observed in any part of the building, and all the sufferers unite in saying that there was no detonation, but only the loud humming already mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another curious attendant circumstance is that the trees around the house showed no signs of injury until the ninth day, when they suddenly withered, almost simultaneously with the development of the sores upon the bodies of the occupants of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is perhaps a mere coincidence, but it is remarkable that the same susceptibility to electrical effects, with the same lapse of time, should be observed in both animal and vegetable organisms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have visited the sufferers, who are now in one of the hospitals of this city; and although their appearance is truly horrible, yet it is hoped that in no case will the injuries prove fatal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Warner Cowgill, U. S. Consulate, Maracaibo, Venezuela, November 17, 1886<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END QUOTED TEXT))<n>
