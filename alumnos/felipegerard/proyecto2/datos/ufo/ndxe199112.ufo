My bedroom window faced out into the woods, where there was no body living due to the fact the road was still a trail.  There were no lights or homes in the direction my window faced.  My window was a big bay window.  At the time my aunt had a car that was very loud, like the engine was loud. I was laying in bed and heard what I thought was their car in our yard so I sat up to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment the woods and the side of the yard my window faced, was illuminated light that I would compare to a florescent shop light color.  I sat there and was thinking some idiot was trying to drive down the trail thinking it was a finished road.  Then in a southeast to northwest direction came this circle possibly oval shaped light in the sky.  I was beeping and moved in a zigzag fash! ion. to see this go across the sky took 3 seconds.  I did not try to look out my other window, I was so scared I covered my head and froze until I fell asleep.  I did notice that the engine sound, beeping and illumination all disappeared once this object went by my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/23/91 19:00|Pleasanton|NE|Sphere|7 minutes|Small orange fluorescent object seen S in distance, disappears, then rushes vehicle in northerly direction, narrowly missing windshield|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04097.html|3|ndxe199112| Small orange fluorescent object seen S in distance, disappears, then rushes vehicle in northerly direction, narrowly missing windshield.  Strobe-like flash accompanied at point of near-impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving 55-60 mph on the highway south of Pleasanton, NE, when I saw a small, orange, fluorescent object ahead in the distance. I dismissed it as a powerline reflector usually seen near small, rural airports, forgetting that there is no airport (to my knowledge) in that area.  It was just dusk and darkening into night, and the object seemed to get dimmer as I drove south, eventually fading out of sight, so I assume it was travelling in a southerly direction along the highway, perhaps a little faster than I was driving. A few minutes later, as I was passing a familiar farm site with house and grain elevator in the yard, a white/silver spherical object, about 9 inches in diameter, came down out of the night sky and rushed directly at my car. Its path was over the hood and up the windshield, a few inches above the vehicle.  I felt a rush of wind and heard a loud swooshing sound as it passed over.  My reaction was to duck and swerve the car slightly to the left, but my reaction occurred after this quick event.  There was a bright, strobe-like flash as it reached the top of my windshield and flew up over my car. The flash enabled me to see several feet from the vehicle, over to a power pole in the ditch, and a power line extending over the highway from the pole, so the object had to go beneath this line.  I tried to see it in my rear view mirror, but sited nothing, and sped on south to Kearney, NE. I wondered about the incident on my way home, but was really too scared and confused to come to any conclusions, so I promptly forgot about it, until I saw my family at Christmas.  We were telling stories, and I remembered my experience.  I told my sister-in-law, but got frightened as I told her, and told her I thought it was an owl that swooped in front of my car.  This thing was not an owl.  I can come up with nothing to explain the flash of light.<n>

Stop!!! Look!!! oh my gosh... It was a saucer shaped object hovering over with lights appearing to be going around and around it. I noticed it had no sound and that it was kinda dark metallic in color with all of the object being held together with triangle shapes all hooked to each other. There were big round like nots(very large screws) at every point of every triangle shape. Apparently this held it&#39;s shape together. I also noticed that when one of the rectangular shaped light&#39;s would go off, at that second the next light would come on - in a series of light&#39;s all the way around the craft. After a while of starring out the window of the car, the craft started almost unnoticeably going straight upwards, then up and to the side at exact incraments. Soundless, increasing speed all the time, it finally wens so darn fast it was absolutely amazing to the human eye. This is very true yall. I can only say that I have never felt the same since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You For Some Closure Here Sincerely<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

12/5/91 19:30|Tarzana|CA|Sphere|3.5min|'91, SF Valley. 5 small, bright, low-flying red spheres, followed fwy traffic: melded together from 5-3-1-2-4 total. West-to-East|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17130.html|9|ndxe199112| &#39;91, SF Valley. 5 small, bright, low-flying red spheres, followed fwy traffic: melded together from 5-3-1-2-4 total. West-to-East<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer #1: Myself. I am an engineering drafter of 24 years. Observer #2: My close friend who was a waitress, and the driver of the vehicle we were in during this event. While traveling East on the Ventura fwy (hwy 101), our car approached the halfway point between Winnetka Blvd &amp; Tampa Blvd (this would be at Corbin Ave) when the event began. As the passenger in the front seat, I had been facing to my left (North) while speaking with my friend. At this point near Cornin Ave, I took brief notice of an intense, red light in the far corner of my left eye. I assumed for a split second that a helicopters nav light was responsible for the bright glow. What initially drew my attention was the low altitude of the objects flight path(approx 90-120ft): By looking level thru the drivers side windows, the object was clearly visible. I looked away momentarily as I was in conversation, but returning my stare almost immediately. &#34;It&#34; was travelling East, slightly faster than traffic (65mph) and was moving parallel to the fwy trafic. With my attention now sharply focused on the object in question, we could see that 5 (five) objects were clearly in a flight formation: a straight, level line extending perpendicular to the fwy structure, and only about 200-300ft from the fwy. The objects were identical in every describable aspect,... and all were sparkling (not flaming) beautiful red spheres. The spheres were approx 30ft in diameter, and approx 120ft center-to-center. Not only were background urban features visible between spheres, but very subtle, yet distinct vertical variations of the altitude of individual spherical entities confirmed that they were indeed not (physically observable) conjoined entities. During this entire event, at no point did the entities appear to deviate from the estimated altitude/speed/direction/distance: Making for an exceptional viewpoint for us, for the duration. Beyond the point being perpendicular to my vehicle (&amp; while the entities briefly appeared as a singularity) and where &#34;individuals&#34; were clearly visible again, something radical in their orientation to one another developed rapidly. Each of the outermost two spheres began, simultaneously, to close the gap between its nearest neighbor in flight: encroaching on the sphere next to it!: I feared some sort of accident and/or crash. However, there were no visible cautionary measures taken by the two spheres apparently being jeopardized. In fact, the moving two entities simply continued on their collision course, to eventually meld with the neighboring spheres: All of which now totalled three! Very soon afterwards (only seconds), the outermost pair of entities embarked on the same course of action as their previously described counterparts,... and melded with the central spherical figure, and with the same methodical ease! Only one entity existed now. Note: At no point did any sphere, individual or combined or &#34;transitional&#34;, exhibit any deviation from the original observed color/shape/speed/altitude/direction. Within a few moments, our &#34;companion&#34; sphere (now approx 1/4mi ahead of us) quite casually split into two distinct entities,... and similarly, each of the new pair divided themselves, now formimg a group of four individuals. This talley was not observed to change. It appeared as though the unusual &#34;transformations&#34; within this event transpired over approx one minute. Since &#34;they&#34; had been travelling slightly faster than traffic, the theatrics of combining &amp; dividing had ceased when the group of spheres was approx 1/2-3/4mi ahead of my vehicle. By their brightness, this new group of four spheres was clearly visible up to approx 2mi away. The pitch of the fwy eventually severed our line-of-sight view. We were left astonished. It seems evident that my friend &amp; I were in perfect position to view the intelligent flight management display of either directly or remotely operated craft,... or simply that of &#34;Light Beings&#34; or pure consiousness. I am to this day, grateful for that night. This was my 8th sighting, and the 2nd for my friend, who also saw her first one with me approx 6mo earlier. I will write of this one in future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I always used the back roads because it was a quiet easy drive.  I was near the reservoir in Copley, when in my rear-view mirror I saw a light moving up behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a motorcycle; however, as it got closer I could tell it was something entirely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car started to hesitate and all the light on my car suddenly went out.  I pulled my car to the side of the road and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All at once the light totally encircled my car it was very bright almost blinding and made me feel dizzy and nauseous.  I remember hearing a whooshing sound and feeling static in the air.  Seemed just a few minutes and it was ahead of me moving up the road.  I began to follow its direction and past my road, when it shot up into the air, then up over the lake, then was gone.  I guess it was probably about the size of a semi-truck only round about 15 to 20 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over again and sat there awhile wandering what?--again what was that?  When I arrived home, my sister asked me what took me so long to get home.  See it is only a 10 to 15 minute drive.  Evidently, this time my drive home took over 3 hours.  Now from the time I saw the object till the time I returned driving home, seemed to me only maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I told my sister what had transpired and that I was getting scared because I had no idea what happened during the time I was encircled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said I sounding crazy.  But then we decided, I should call the police.  I did and they gave me another number to call because they said they had other sighting reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the other number the police gave me and gave them a full report of what I had experienced, They thanked me and said they would contact me if they needed more information-they never did.  Now, I still don&#39;t know transpired during the time my car was encircled by the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Till this day my hair and skin tingles ! when I think about my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n>
