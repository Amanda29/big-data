I as well as two other immediate family members have very clear memories of an event that occurred one night.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date but I know, as well as I know my own name, that it was the night the very last episode of M.A.S.H. aired I think it was 1983-84 something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We moved to Tilden from San Antonio because my mother was the personal assistant for a Texas oil man.  He had some 2000 acres just outside Tilden and wanted to get out of the city.  He built three houses all on virgin land on his ranch.  The houses were about 40 -50 yards apart one was for his parents, one for the pilot, and the other for our family.  My dad was in the air force and stationed in Korea at the time so being the typical air force brat I had a fascination with all aircraft.  The pilot, always kept the jet ranger close by the three houses incase one of us kids were to get struck by a snake.  My mothers boss had 3 kids, the pilot had 2, and my mother had 2 and being virgin South Texas land it was not uncommon to wakeup with Rattle Snakes on the door steps keeping warm on the concrete.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night I am referring to my mother&#39;s boss and the pilot had been using the Bell to help herd some cattle that day and had not come home when Mash started.  Just as Mash was ending my German Sheppard, Joy, started howling and crying like I&#39;ve never heard a dog do before or since.  She ran wildly around the living room and would run to the back door then back to the couch.  Joy would normally get upset when the bramas would come close to the house or when an illegal would come up to the house looking for work.  However this was different she literally went crazy.  She stopped running around and went to the sliding glass door and bared her teeth starring out the door snarling like she was possessed.  Did I mention that she was a puppy maybe 8 months old.  She had never done this before and was disturbing us so I went to the door to get her and calm her down when I saw what she was going on about  The scrub brush had been cleared probably 200 yards in any direction around the houses when they were built and directly behind ours was a ball of fire.  That is the only way I can describe it.  It was difficult to register the dimensions of the thing but I am sure it had to be at least 60 yards in diameter it looked huge.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be on fire.  NO windows or little green men coming out, it was simply hovering a few feet off the ground.  What was strange, as if that was not strange in its self, it was very bright and had red, yellow, and orange colors to it and pulsated but it cast NO light.  What I mean is it did not cast shadows or light up the area around it.  You could only barely make out the ground just below it.  I stood there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get my mother and sister to come look at this thing and when my mother saw it she started to panic and rushed us in to the back bedroom and forced Joy to come as well.  We probably stayed in the bedroom for 20 minutes when we heard the pilot coming in with the Jet Ranger.  The next day I told the pilot what we had seen and asked if he saw anything, of course I was met with a disbelieving attitude and he said he did not see a thing.  No one saw it but us, not the pilot’s family nor my mothers bosses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated professional businessman, in fact I minored in philosophy and consider myself a very rational person.  I know what I saw and gave up a very long time ago on trying to get people to believe this story no matter how very true it is.  I am not a UFO buff but I know there is something unexplained out there and it does fly.  I have however never heard of any sighting that can be described as a huge ball of fire and was wondering if you have.  I have heard of the Marfa lights and always thought maybe this was one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2/15/83 02:00|São Paulo (Brazil)||Disk|5 minutes|A solid, "Yo-Yo" shaped craft with lights seen in São Paulo, Brazil in 1983. Followed by weather phenomenon.|4/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28539.html|2|ndxe198302| A solid, &#34;Yo-Yo&#34; shaped craft with lights seen in São Paulo, Brazil in 1983. Followed by weather phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were vacationing in a farm in the state of São Paulo Brazil. The farm was located in a valley between two hills that were approximately 3 miles apart. The hills were covered with tall grass, shrubbery and a few scattered trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the closest town was 15 miles away and the closest large city about 100 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear, moonless night with very bright stars. We had a small pit fire burning and the a light in the living room inside the house. Otherwise there was no other light pollution. I was appreciating the clear sky and the quantity and clearness of the stars when I noticed a &#34;yo-yo&#34; shaped object appear from behind the hill to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say &#34;yo-yo&#34; becuse it was disk shaped and I could see an indentation (as where the string in a yo-yo would go) mid-ship. The edge of the indentation and the edges of the disk were smooth (no right angles). I do not know how deep the indentation went because of the darkeness. The starlight accentuated the edges and flat surfaces of the craft. The bottom side of the craft had a depression (seen as a darker area from the rest of the craft, about 80% of the total size of the circumference). In this depression there were 3 red half-globes. These globes emitted a soft red glow (not like an incandescent lamp, but more like a soft phosphorescent luminesence). They light half-globes were not spinning or blinking. The top of the craft (I cannot say if it was placed in a similar depression as the red half-globes) had a single, larger milky white luminescent dome (it flattened, not a half-globe). This dome was evenly lit just like the red half-globes. There were no other markings or characteristics to be seen. The whole craft was about 30 feet across and about 10 high (not considering the white dome on top. The red lights did not sem to extend past the depression where they were placed). The craft was smooth and the best explanation as to its texture would be that of brushed aluminum, but without the bright shine. It was dark grey (if it was colored).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft came from behind the hill on my right. That was about 100 to 200 feet high. It traversed the Valley in about 5 minutes and, at the closest point, it was about 2 football fields away from our position. There was no wind and it flew a straight path at an even pace. There was no noise or any other type of disturbance. Had we not seen it, it could have flown by wihtout any of us noticing it. Unlike in the movies, we did not loose any power in the house or experienced any kind of strange sensations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only extraordinary phenomena (besides the sighting) was the fog that followed the craft after its passage. The craft took about 5 minutes to travel the distance between the two hills. About 2 minutes after it had disappeared a &#34;wave&#34; of fog came from the hill were the craft had originally come from. The fog covered the valley within 10 minutes. Although the conditions seem to be right for that kind of weather (cool, clear nights after sunny warm days), that was the only time in our 4-day stay when we had fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

2/15/83 01:00|West Palm Beach|FL|Disk|2 minutes|A beam of light that resolved into 40 to 50 flying disks, outside of our atmosphere, with stars seen through their formation.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107649.html|3|ndxe198302| A beam of light that resolved into 40 to 50 flying disks, outside of our atmosphere, with stars seen through their formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in West Palm Beach, at the Hilton on Singer Island, for a very important job interview, the next morning.  Myself and three others were interviewed to be the executive team to start a hotel chain for the King of Saudi Arabia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone that night as my room partner had his own evening plans.  He was also one of the interviewees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down the beach about 1/2 mile to a restaurant and had a beer at the bar. I only finished half of it because I didn’t want any chance of effects the next morning.  I walked back down the  beach to the hotel, which was right on the beach.  Our room opened to the beach.  I sat in the sand to think and gather thoughts about the interview.  I was staring at the ocean when I saw what looked like one of those search lights that you see crossing the sky, shining out from the horizon.  I thought there must be a ship with a light out beyond the horizon.  But then the beam of light broke off from the horizon and traveled toward me and land.  It was now a beam of light flying along by itself.  I watched it approach and as it did the beam resolved into disks, as it got closer.  I presumed the light was from the crafts reflecting the suns light from around the globe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached I was able to see about 40 to 50 disks flying in a group sort of formation.  As they approached land the formation changed to two lines with ships within the lines, and turned south.  There was about eight large ships and the rest smaller...about 1/4 the size of the larger.  I could see the stars through the formation.  These crafts appeared to be in space, not in our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they flew overhead I saw one of the smaller disks fly to or into one of the bigger ships.  When the formation reached over land they turned south as if to follow the beach south.  They continued south and as they did, they changed back into the wider pack formation. Their resolution faded back into a glowing beam and they disappeared south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right about the time they were passing overhead my room mate got back.  I could hear him and so I shouted for him to come quickly.  He did but not in time to see any more than the beam of light traveling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a crystal clear, warm night.  What I saw was clear as could be and there was no mistaking what I was looking at.  My demeanor was calm, sober and totally clear headed. What I saw changed my life.  I’ve never had any doubt as to what I saw and the memory hasn’t faded.  I reported it to a group who’s name was an anagram from Ohio.  Teroco?  Or something like that.  I also did a report on the Sci-Fi Channel website, around that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d love to hear from someone about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

He was driving an old van. I was slumping down in the seat and had my legs bent up on the dashboard so I could see the sky. There were no lights out there that I remember. It was very dark with no traffic and the only lights were from his van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the sky while he was driving, as it was very late (sometime after midnight at least)  All of a sudden a small perfectly round disk shaped object swooped within a a foot or two right over the front of the van from nowhere. It made no noise and had no lights. The lights from the van reflected off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only describe it as about 10 to 15 feet perfectly round and it had a bottom that looked like a raised waffle iron and made out of the same type of tephlon type material.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw the underneath. I had my boyfriend pull over but it was gone and he never saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.
