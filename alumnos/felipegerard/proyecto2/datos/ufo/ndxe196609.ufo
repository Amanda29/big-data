WV in 1966, made 90 degree turns without changing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In September 1966, a friend and I were driving west on Rt60 in Huntington, West Virginia, almost in front of the entrance of Camden Park, a local amusement park. We noticed people along the sidewalk stopped and staring up in the sky to the north. I pulled over to the curb and we both got out of the car. There in the sky were two circular objects, one above the other, heading west. The color of both objects were a white, but like frosted ice. A pea heald at arms length, would be about the size. If the objects were a passenger airliner, they would be at cruising speed. After watching them for a few seconds, 15 to 20 seconds, the lower of the two objects made a 90 turn and went towards the ground. Its speed did not change. It dropped below the horizon. 3 to 5 seconds later the other object did the same manouver, 90 degree turn toward the ground, no change in speed and dropped below the horizon. There were at least 20 people that were standing with my friend and I. The objects did not appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing my boyfriend laying in his arms in the front seat when he grabed my arms and just turned my body around in the car and said quietly to me, look over there. My heart raced when in the field through some small little trees we saw this very round and shiny object like surgical steel  in a circle shape but had a flat bottom and top. We all got out of the car so scared as we were young,we thought no one would believe us. We stood there watching this object glowing for as long as 10 mins.and then watched how it took off. It used a hugh beam of light to push itself up off of the ground by the light comming down and moving the craft up and then it would shoot another beam of light down to push itself up again higher and higher until it had gotten high enough to start the lights around the indented center to glow around it and then we watched this ufo jolt faster than we could keep our eyes on it with no noise whatsoever. We were so shocked or in shock at what we all we had observed that we all decided it was not the place to be. We do however have what they called the Nike Site which is a Government Base which was around 1 1/2 miles away from that field. That field was owned by some people in Providence who let the pigs live there in old buses and live off the land and they used them for pig roasts. We never reported this but I told my brother whom was in the Air Force and he told me we should have reported it. At that time I guess they were looking into ufo&#39;s at that time. He flew so he didn&#39;t take what I had told him lightly. However shortly after telling my mom and  my brother my mom saw an object one night hovering over our neighbors hugh front yard, they had cows and farm animals and lots of land.She told me the nest day about it because as she watched it she said for a half hour or more, wh! ich she said seemed like hours, she said she was frozen stiff and couldn&#39;t move. She told her friend and her friend showed her the Pawtuxet Valley Times front page which showed a news article or picture about the night before. My mom is not alive now or I would ask her but she told her friend that she thought she had lost her mind and or was dreaming while standing up looking through our bathroom window that night. She didn&#39;t report it as she thought everyone would think she was nuts. Back then in those small towns which aren&#39;t small any more, no one believed you unless it was gossip. But to this day I still remember it so well as it was so fascinating and I know what my friends and I saw and we often talk about it. But there is only 3 of us left. I only wish I could see one now. I would have the guts to go back the next day or maybe while it was still there and try and find out all I could about it. We had no idea how long it had been there before us because we parked there before it was dark and when that craft started to leave and push it self up with the beam of light from underneath it was dark, so it lit all the field up. We could see the buses that sat a few 100 feet away in the back of the field. The light from underneath also started to come out form under the craft as a hugh circle of light and then as it ascended upward it sort of came down like a cone shape of light. Like a flash light would do if you started with the flashlight beam face down on the floor.  Well I could talk forever on this subject but enough is enough. But if anyone in Coventry wants to talk online with me just put something on the web here if you can or put a small ad in the Reminder and I&#39;d love to talk to you on the web. Thank You for letting me finally tell my story to people out there who don&#39;t belive. But you will when you see it as I did. It was both an experience I&#39;d never miss and one I had many night mares about.  BELIEVE! I DO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were just home from the hospital, sleeping in the living room of the older farmhouse on our acreage in the country in Mongomery Co. Iowa. Our newborn was in a small room just around the corner so we couldn&#39;t hear every gurgle. I was awakened around 1 a.m. by a beeping noise. At first I thought I was dreaming but then heard it again and realized that an eerie green light was coming in the window and was flooding the orchard to the east of the house. I woke my husband who saw it too and we immediately rushed to make sure the baby was OK. We weren&#39;t able to see anything but the light. Either it was foggy out or the light itself had a foggy quality. We were aware if it for about 2 to 3 minutes and then it moved away to the southeast and was gone. The following morning some of the local radio stations carried reports of UFO sightings to the south and east of us. We did not see a craft - only the light coming from not too high over the orchard. I would say it was more of an aura rather than a direct beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father and 2 brothers were in the cab of the truck and I was riding in the back with a friend of my father&#39;s who was asleep. I was laying down on a matress that was in the bed of the truck, my head was near the cab. It was about 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon and we were traveling east on highway 152 going toward San Luis Dam and Pacheco Pass. We were travelling about 50-60 mph. I looked to the north and saw two egg shaped objects (one slightly ahead and above the other) traveling in the same direction as we were. My first thought was that they looked beautiful and absolutly perfect and pristine. I then said to myself &#34;that&#39;s right, that is what they look like.&#34; I then realized that these objects were being piloted as I could sense a &#34;presence&#34; in the way they moved, this frightened me. I watched them for as long as I could for they were going a little faster than we were and were slowly moving up and away from us. I lost sight of them as they were lost in the haze of the setting sun. I was unable to determine their size but they were about the size of a pea held at arms length and I could see that they were round because of the shadow along the rear bottom portion. They were not shiny but white and they looked just like two chicken eggs, (I always felt silly telling people that they looked like chicken eggs.) Later on in life I connected the feeling that I had recognized them (&#34;that&#39;s right, that is what they look like&#34;)with an incident that happened when I was nine yrs old. A neighbor found me walking down the street at 3 oclock in the morning and brought me home. After I woke up in the morning the neighbor came over to our house to see if I was OK. At that moment I remembered that I had had a dream that night and in the dream I was standing on the front porch looking at someone on the other side of the fence but in the dream it was very, very bright outs! ide, bri ghter than daylight. I always felt like there was more to what happened that night than I could remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not imply that fact.  PD))<n>

I was only six or seven years old when I awoke in my livingroom as bits and pieces come to mind I fiind I have been through a lot more than I ever thought I could imagine in this whole wide world. Its been a very hard thing to explain something so unusualle to the world but this actually happened to me. I awake in the Morning hours and saw a Alien in my house next to the chair that mY father sat in and remember it very clear as it was a grey creature and as I remember more and more I remember it taking me out of my own bed and then it took my sister and she says she was given a chip in the leg. I do not know what they did to me but bits and pieces are now coming to mind in my head as I lay at night and wonder what happened to me. I do not remember these things but I remember my fam! ily telling me I used to wake up at night and scream I love you MOMMY I love YOU Daddy at the top of my lungs and they remember being helpless as to why I was doing that I still to this day do not remember any of this.  But I remember seeing that creature in my home and it took my oldest sister and myself for what reasons I can not explain.  I was only six or seven years old when this happened as we lived on 20 acres of land it was like this all around are area no homes nothing but land. This has haunted me through out my whole life and I have been scared that they are taking me again and again and do NOT know what or when or what reason for any of this. I only wish I could speak to someone about what happened to me and why? It is unusualle and Why a Child is beyond my belief as to what reason something like this would happen to a little girl. But it did.. It did happen and If you do NOT believe me you could as my own sister.. She remembers much more than I do but at this tim! e I do NOT know if she is even speaking about it but I have to! or I wo uld just go nuts thinking about this whole situation..  Why me..  Why a little girl. I have often thought about going to a hypnosis and find out more about what happened to me but it will not do me any good as I think in my mind to know what happened unless there was cause to be alarmed as to why this would happen to a young girl as bright and happy as I was when I was a child.. I do NOT remember screaming for my mother or my father.. I tried to scream when I was a kid for MY Mommy but The creature would not let me.. I know it was a female creature as she smiled at me as to say its ok before she disappeared into the morning. I have never opened up and told this story only to my family who thinks I am nothing but crazy only MY oldest sister doesnt think so for she remembers being takien as well but did not know I went with her.. I guess this will be something I have to live with since the Government doesnt care what happened or why or what this is all about and they think we ar! e nuts the people who have been taken.. I am one of them and I know for sure a child would not lie about something so tramatic that happened in her life..  I only wish I had someone to talk to about this as it is time to come out.. I am 53 years old now and things are coming to me all the time about this little girl that was taken and who knows what they did to me.. BUT today is the day to let the world know that children are also not safe and they too can be taken by these Aliens as I was.. I DO hope that someone would email me as I sure could use a support group of people who have been through what I have.. it is a thing I will not forget they were clammy and rubber feeling why I do NOT know.. I know nothing more than I remember as I was a child.. But this is the truth and nothing but the truth.. Thanks to all of you who actually care and who ever wants to know more please email me with who I am to talk to about something that happened to me in the 60&#39;s not sure of the dat! es just put down what I remembered as far as I could.. I was so young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for listening.. I do hope I get a email with a support group of people who have been through what I have.. Gerri<n>

My friends parents, his aunt, my mother, him and myself witnessed the event. Within a few minutes it almost flew directly over us (aprox 300 to 400 feet above us)traveling from south to north, it was between 400 and 500 hundred feet long and about 75 to 100 feet wide. What was strange is that we all watched it pass by and none of us said anything about it until it had passed. We just looked at it without saying anything until it had pasted by. The next day it was front page news of the Chicago Times, many other people saw it and called police. The commerical pilots were on strike at the time and no planes were in the air. Air force stated that they had nothing in the air over Chicago at the time of the sighting. Craft was fully illuminated all around, there was no sound and it traveled at maybe 40 to 60 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I read of the sighting over Williamsburg, Virginia on November 1 with great interest, as I had a similar experience back in November 1966. Heading east on I-64 from Ashland, Ky to Huntington, WV, I took the(I believe) the 5th Street exit (may have been the 16th Street exit). The exit ramp was uphill to the stop sign at the end of the ramp. It was a weekend night, clear, and little/no traffic. At the top of the ramp, I had the need to relieve myself, so I stopped the car and got out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While in the &#34;process&#34; I gazed to the sky. My father, a WWII AF vet, had instilled in me a very high interest in aircraft, space and the like. While standing there, I noticed an a triangular shaped object (almost exactly the same as described in the Williamsburg report) going straight over my car. If I had been holding a basketball at arms length, the craft was larger.  I imagine that the shape was triangular, as there were around 7 to 9 red lights arranged in an error shape, point at the front, or at least the direction the craft was headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted that there was no sound, and the speed of the craft was just over a hover - very slow. I had no fear, just interest. I noted the craft for approximately 40 to 45 seconds, in which time it was still in close proximity to me - again, it was moving very, very slow. Once I finished my &#34;business&#34; I sat down in the car, but did not shut the door. I thought to myself that that thing I just saw was just not acting right. I stepped back out of the car and the craft was gone.  I did not sit in the car any more that 3 or 4 seconds.  I had visibility for at least 5 miles in every direction, but the craft was gone.  Returning home, I told my Dad about the incident, and he said, &#34;you saw something, but who knows what it was&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more telling part of the sighting happened the next weekend. My Mother and Father were not living together at this time and I took a trip the next weekend to see my Mom in Oak Hill, WV.  Oak Hill is approximately 85 miles NNE of Huntington. While eating dinner, my Mom began telling me a story about seeing an odd aircraft the preceding weekend.  She and some of her friends were driving from Oak Hill to Charleston, WV, which lies between Oak Hill and Huntington.  Traveling down SRt 61, the road, which is very mountainous, opens up to a wide valley when it comes to the Kanawha River. Upon entering the valley, she and her friends noted an object on the north side of the river, moving SSW, at an extremely slow speed. From the distance they were from the craft (a marble held at arms length, about the same size), she could not determine definite shape or lighting, though she did say she thought the object had a faint red glow.  She and her friends observed the object for a good minute, then the object gained a rate of speed, almost too fast to follow, and almost immediately (from almost zero to bullet speed in an instant) and disappeared from sight.  Two points, (1) I had not told her my story yet and (2)this was the same day/evening I observed the craft in Huntington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The date is approximate.  As they were traveling home westbound on Oakdale Rd. in East Toledo, there is a C&amp;O train track which they were stopped at.  The area is residential now (the tracks still used by CSX) but, at the time it was mostly farmland.  My mother and grandmother recounted the story several times that they had scene a globe hoverring about 20 feet over them just to the side of the road.  The object was orange in color and seemed luminous.  There were two other vehicles stopped by the train, one of which was occupied by a young couple that had gotten out and taken photographs.  My mother seems to recall this event making local news, although I haven&#39;t found any evidence of that.  After some time, they described three distinc bursts of flame and explosive sound at different locations on the object (similar to a roman candle) and then the object increased slowly gaining speed into the sky.  They watched it until they could no longer see it.  My uncle had acknowledged the event, but was quite shaken by it and would not discuss it.  It is unknown who the &#34;young couple&#34; was or if they have photographic evidence of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a crash Fireman there for around two years: One day after we had gone to eat the evening meal and were back playing volley ball in the hanger one of the guys sighted this UFO directly over the runway 28 and every one went out to watch it and they were all pointing at the object and describing it in great detail. I could see NOTHING AT ALL. The dispatcher wanted to see and he was calling me so I relived him and he went and saw the object. While I was on the desk I called the tower (Aircraft Controller) he told me that he could not see the object with his eyes but that it was on the GCA radar. I also called the radio station and the ask all the people to go out and look and see fi they could see it. There was one other fireman who was unable to see the object. That night after the sighting the firehouse was a buzz with talk and speculation but when the next day came none of these witnesses could remember it, only me and the other man who did not see the Object could remember the incident. The next day when we went back on duty  (we were on 24 and 24 off) Naval intelligence officers were there in the rec. room and they interviewing the other man who did not see the object and he was in there about an hour then it was my turn. I went in and the man ask me what did you see? So I started describing what all the other men had described and after I got all through he said again, Now what did you see? After about the third time, &#34;DU&#34; I got the message and said, &#34;I didn&#39;t see anything Sir&#34; and he said to me, &#34;that&#39;s right now don&#39;t forget it&#34;. He did say to me, &#34;you didn&#39;t call the radio station from here did you&#34;? I said, &#34;I didn&#39;t see anything&#34;, He said, &#34;that&#39;s right; carry on Sailor&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following hours that day I and the other man who did not see the UFO, we were transferred out of the fire department and on to the flight line. (This is very unusual for trained Firefighters to be transferred) I got orders to Pacific Missal Range (The Naval Air Weapons Station, Point Mugu) I was a crash Firefighter again on St. Nicolas Island in the Channel Islands of California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The day before I had escaped from the reformatory at Gatesville,Texas. I had gone through Clifton because I had reletives that lived there and was seeking help from them. They did not aid me of course so I walked on out of town trying to keep out of sight of the law. shortly after the sun came up I came into a small fishing community not far from Lake Whitney.Ther was a car there that had the keys in it setting along side of the road in front of one of the houses. Being on the run I stole it and headed out of town. When I felt I was clear I checked out the inside of the car and noticed I had three quarters of a tank of gas. The car also had a clock which I also noticed was running and showed at that time a quarter past six. The two things I mentioned helped me to realize that there was a time lapse that I could account for but that is getting to far ahead yet. I do not know where I was exactly but I had driven for about two hours and Ihad just looked at the clock and the gas gauge. The clock read 8:30 and the gas gauge showed a little less than half a tank. When I looked up from the dash, there was this bright light that actually hurt my eyes. when my eyes focused on the road there was a model &#34;A&#34; Ford truck with wooden side rails on it in front of me. It was green and looked new. There were two people rideing in it that I could see from the back window. The truck started slowing down and the driver gave the signal to turn left by sticking his hand out of the window. I slowed down but then that flash thing happened again. I was looking out of my right window to see where the truck had turned and there was no truck. There was no road there either. The sound of the truck had gone as well but I had heard it only moments before. I checked the rearview mirror and saw nothing. I was startled by this and looked at the clock to make sure I had not fallen asleep. The clock read ten fifteen. I looked at the gas guage. It was a little past half just like befor! e. I tap ped the guage but the needle stayed where it was. I had never heard of abduction or anything like that but could not figure out what had happened back then. I still cannot. I drove that car till it ran out of gas and didn&#39;t see another car or anyone for the rest of that day along that road. I do not know what road this happened on nor the exact day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1966 is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/66 03:00|Terre Haute|IN|Sphere|20-30 mins.|Close Encounter with Scanning Object|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25143.html|14|ndxe196609| Close Encounter with Scanning Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sometime after midnight. There was a conjunction of 3 planets in the western sky, I had forgotten to look for it when they were in very close position, so I looked out our bedroom window on the west side to see if the conjunction was still visible. This was a night or two after, when separation of the planets had begun. I had been up late doing baby laundry. I was very pregnant with our 4th child, went to sleep almost immediately. I was awakened suddenly, startled, wide awake. At first, I lay still, trying to discern if someone had entered the house before I made any move. Then, in the doorway between the boy&#39;s room and our bedroom, (there wasn&#39;t any door), I saw a glowing white bright orangish globe floating about 4 feet above the floor. It appeared to be so hot, it was almost totally white. I opened my eyes as wide as possible, then slowly sat up. The object emitted a low hum and when I sat up, it conveyed a mental threat of electrocution to me if I moved any more. I felt it scan my children with beams that I don&#39;t think I conciously saw. Two boys were in the room it was in and it scanned my pregnant belly, then a child in another room. It seemd to convey that it discounted the child in the other room, a girl, but took note of the 2 sleeping boys and the infant in the womb, telling me that the baby was a boy. Then, it began to &#39;glow down&#39;, turning from white to bright ornage, to a faded dark orange, becoming transparent, then to gray and out. Then  got up, looked around, saw nothing, laid back in bed and almost as quick as earlier, fell asleep. I had placed a large chest of drawers between the boy&#39;s room and ours, it had a large mirror facing me. We lived in a corner house in the city then and light came through the venetian blinds and the kids claimed it bothered them. The door was an arch way and the house was not yet ours so we didn&#39;t try a door. As it turns out, I also ad one of those floating vacumm cleaners, a tan globe thing, which was in the closet in the boy&#39;s room. I didn&#39;t tell anyo! ne about this appearance due to several things, my being pregnant and tired when I retired, and, already having a sattelite shaped vaccumm cleaner people would have surely thought I&#39;d hallucinated the whole incident. But those were also the main reasons I made myself so alert, I was wide awake, no in between worlds fog. About 20 years later, I did tell my family when we were talking one night about OOB experiences.. and other &#39;weird&#39; happenings to us. That baby boy was born Jan. 20th, but I still had to guesstimate at the month of the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

9/5/66 21:00|Columbus|NE|Circle|30 minutes|Circular craft, nighttime sighting, close range, red, green, yellow lights, probable abduction, missing time|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36197.html|19|ndxe196609| Circular craft, nighttime sighting, close range, red, green, yellow lights, probable abduction, missing time<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting what happened to my boyfriend at the time, later my husband and father of my children.  We had been dating for about one year. I was 18 and he was 17.  He was coming out to my parents farm (2+ Mi. from town)to see me at around 9p.m..  He was driving a small Bridgestone motorcycle and was less than 1 mile out from town (where he lived, and almost to the Burlington Northern RR tracks when he sensed something above him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked up and a round craft was directly over him at around 100 ft. in the air.  It was not very large in size, completely circular, and had green lights, red lights and some yellowish lights on the bottom.  There seemed to be some sort of lines in the bottom, like spokes in a wheel look.  It was making a low humming sound that resonated. It was almost pitch dark so he couldn&#39;t see the color of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He immediately tried to accelerate the bike to get away from it because he was absolutely terrified and realized that he was staying in one place in the road, even though the bike was still running and it seemed that the tires were still moving.  He had driven that road so many times throughout his life and knew every bump in it.  He realized later that during this initial few seconds that if he were still driving fast like he had been before seeing the craft he would have already been past the RR tracks. He remembered cranking the accelerater real hard and the bike didn&#39;t speed up.Then he doesn&#39;t remember anything AT ALL until suddenly he was back on his bike in almost the same spot, with the bike moving, only he was going real slow, like 25mph, instead of 65mph from before.  He proceeded to come to see me and never mentioned a thing to me or anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point, I was waiting at the farm and watching the clock, excited to see him and couldn&#39;t figure out why he was late.  He had called me right before he left town and should have been to my place in 5 minutes.  Instead he arrived in about 25-30 minutes later.  I asked him what took him so long and he acted really weird. I noticed that he looked pale and was quiet all nite.  In fact I noticed a change in his personality from then on but kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about a month or so after that when we were out on a date, we talked about going and parking at a radio tower near town where all our friends went (lover&#39;s lane kinda spot).  We had been there before.  So we went there and were sitting for a few minutes when he freaked our and said he had to leave the spot, then proceeded to tell me what had happened with the UFO. Before that he had made fun of me because I believed they existed. I know this isn&#39;t my story to tell. I also know that the experience impacted my life almost as much as his and I feel it is important to tell you about it. I don&#39;t remember the date or time, but gave a guess. I was and still am amazed at how terrified he was and remained so for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are no longer married and as far as I know he refuses to talk about it. I think he pushed it out of his conscious mind. At the time, though, I told several friends and family members and he talked about it a couple of times to them, also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/66 22:00|New York City (Queens)|NY|Sphere|45 MINUTES|SITING OF A MASSIVE UFO ABOVE THROGS NECK BRIDGE SEPTEMBER 1966|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19486.html|20|ndxe196609| SITING OF A MASSIVE UFO ABOVE THROGS NECK BRIDGE SEPTEMBER 1966<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE TOLD THIS STORY SEVERAL TIMES, AS HAS MY YOUNGER BROTHER WHO ACCOMPANIED ME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPON OUR RETURN TRIP FROM ALBANY NY, OUR GROUP WAS APPROACHING THE THROGS NECK BRIDGE FROM THE NORTH (BRONX) SIDE.  WE ALL NOTICED SOMETHING FROM A DISTANCE OF 5 OR SO MILES AWAY WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE BRIDGE.  I SAID IT MUST BE A ZEPPELIN BECAUSE OF ITS HUGE SIZE IN RELATION TO THE BRIDGE, WHICH IT APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY OVER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS WE APPROACHED THE BRIDGE, THE WHITE LIGHTS AROUND THE CENTER GIRTH OF THE OBJECT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SHIP WAS SPHERICAL AND IN SOMEWHAT OF A SUSPENDED STATE.  THE LIGHTS WERE CLEARLY OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED TYPE THAT SURROUNDED THE CENTER, AND WIDEST PART OF THE OBJECT, LIKE A STRING OF PEARLS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS WE WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE BRIDGE RAMP ALL THE PEOPLE IN EVERY CAR HAD THEIR EYES FIXED UPWARD TO THE SHIP THAT WAS JUST UP AHEAD, HOVERING. WE LATER REMARKED THAT IT WAS A WONDER NOBODY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT THAT NIGHT SINCE NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHERE THEY WERE GOING. WE WERE HONKING OUR HORNS TO GET OTHER CARS&#39; ATTENTION AND WHEN WE DID THEY WOULD LOOK AT US WITH THE SAME TERRIFIED FACES WE PROBABLY HAD ON OURSELVES AND WE WOULD NOD TO EACH OTHER THAT SLOW KIND OF UP AND DOWN &#39;YES RESPONSE&#39; THAT CLEARLY CONVEYED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND FEAR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN THE CENTER OF THE SHIP STARTED TO SPIN, WHICH WE COULD CLEARLY SEE BECAUSE THE RING OF LIGHTS WERE MOVING IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS WE DROVE CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE THE SHIP&#39;S SIZE WAS HARD TO COMPUTE: WE COULDN&#39;T TELL IF IT WAS 100 OR 1000 FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE BUT WE KNEW IT WAS HUGE AND IT WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I FELT BECAUSE WE WERE DRIVING OFF OF THE BRIDGE, ONTO THE CLEARVIEW EXPRESSWAY AND AWAY FROM WHERE THE SHIP HAD STATIONED ITSELF, WAS QUICKLY CHANGED TO JOY AND WONDERMENT BECAUSE THE SHIP BEGAN FLYING ALONG THE SAME ROUTE, AND QUICKLY MOVED AHEAD OF US.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY (LIE)THE SHIP WAS JUST IN FRONT OF US AND WAS DARTING FORWARD AND BACK! , UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY.  AT ONE POINT IT WAS JUST A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US AND WE COULD SEE HOW HUGE IT WAS: IT EASILY SPANNED THE WIDTH OF THE LIE-WHICH IS 6 LANES WIDE AND HAS A ONE-LANE WIDE DIVIDER BETWEEN THE EAST AND WEST TRAFFIC LANES AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE MAIN LANES AND A SERVICE ROAD OF 2 LANES ON EACH SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY.[13 LANES IN ALL]  IF WE HAD TO GUESS, IT WOULD BE THAT THE SHIP&#39;S SPAN WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET AT ITS WIDEST POINT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SHIP LITERALLY FOLLOWED THE LIE WHICH WAS HEAVILY TRAFFICKED, ESPECIALLY IN OUR DIRECTION. WE WERE ABLE TO WATCH IT UNTIL IT LITERALLY MADE A RIGHT TURN SOUTHWARD AND FLEW ABOVE THE SEAFORD-OYSTER BAY EXPRESSWAY, UNTIL IT SHOT AHEAD WITH SUCH AMAZING SPEED THAT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS A MASSIVE UFO THEN A BLIP THEN GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE HAD CAMERAS WITH US BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE FILM, WE CALLED UP THE THEN-ACTIVE A/F BASE IN WESTHAMPTON BUT THEY DENIED SEEING ANYTHING OR THAT ANYBODY ELSE HAD CALLED WITH SUCH A SITING.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN WE CALLED THE LOCAL PAPER, NEWSDAY, THE FOLLOWING DAY.  SO, OVER TIME IT HAS BECOME A STORY WE HAVE TOLD OUR CHILDREN AND VERY FEW OTHERS BUT BOTH MY BROTHER AND I KNOW WHAT WE SAW AND ALTHOUGH OUR OTHER PASSENGERS HAVE GONE THEIR SEPARATE WAYS, I KNOW THEY TOO WILL NEVER FORGET THE EXPERIENCE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THE DATE BUT IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE START OF COLLEGE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AT ALBANY STATE UNIVERSITY FROM WHICH WE WERE RETURNING.  I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHETHER, OVER TIME, OTHER NEW YORKERS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE AND COULD CONFIRM THAT IT WASN&#39;T JUST A DREAM OR A FIGMENT OF OUR COLLECTIVE IMAGINATIONS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
