My grandmother, I (in the middle) and my mother sat in the back seat.  My parents friends sat in the front.  We were driving north, about four miles from town on a major road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver (male) noticed three bright objects &#39;hanging&#39; or &#39;hovering&#39; above the green wooded hills east of the road.  The objects were not far above the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver commented something like &#39;Do you see that?&#39;  The adults said &#39;yes.&#39;  The driver pulled the car over to the side of the road (facing north, east side of road.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ALL got out and stared at the objects.  (They were appx. 3 miles east &amp; a few hundred feet above the top of the hills).  The three objects hung in the sky for minutes while the adults made brief comments and stared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects were hanging at various altitudes.  One on top and to the north of that one and somewhat lower the second object and the third to the south of the first and slightly lower than the second.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After minutes, the top object suddenly flew up and out of sight.  The two lower objects remained unmoving.   After a few seconds one of the lower objects also flew up and out of sight.  And a few seconds later the third and last object shot upward and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother said these objects were silver in color and oval shaped.   At times the sun glinted off of them. (They would have been east of the sun which was facing their front (behind the road and car) during that afternoon time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a child (4-6 yrs. old).  My parents owned an electrical contracting business and were prominent in the local country club social group.  We lived in the best part of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our friends also owned a thriving photography business and all were prominent in city society.  My grandmother came from Europe and lived on a 5-acre estate. Our photographer friend went to the local newspaper to report this sighting.  An article appeared in this newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also...this photographer friend of our family was very close to an! inventor in this locale who had a great interest in aviation--and the sighting discussed above was talked about in great detail over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This one particular morning I had just finished my  fishing it was time to leave. As I walked up the stairway of the seawall I noticed a group of people looking upward. I glanced up and saw this huge Cigar shaped craft it apparently had come in off the gulf of Mexico. The size I estimated to be approximately 300 ft long. It was extremely low I estimated it to be no higher than 150 ft. It had no windows made no noise no apparent means of propulsion no type of emission.  It moved very slowly. One of the people in the crowd nudged me and said &#34;Am I seeing what I think I am seeing?&#34; After which I replied yes you are. This craft moved about a block away made its own cloud and disappeared. The weather was a perfectl;y clear day. In the next few days I did not see anything in the news media. I however called HUFON and reported my observation. The person I talked to said that particular craft had been sighted all over Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Peter B.

6/15/53 18:00|North Bend|WA|Circle|2 minutes|My cousin and I who were children at the time, watched a round, smooth, silent object which had a pinkish glow, come across his field f|9/26/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02550.html|4|ndxe195306| Summary : My cousin and I who were children at the time, watched a round, smooth, silent object which had a pinkish glow, come across his field from the direction of the Snoqualmie River.  It was about 20&#39;-30&#39; from the ground.  We were standing on his front porch.  It came in our direction and then stopped above a fruit tree directly across the driveway from where we were.  It was about the size of a VW Beetle, perfectly circular, with a triangular projection at the &#34;back.  My aunt had locked the front door to prevent us kids from running through the house.  I pounded on the door to get the adults to come out and see this thing.  My cousin said that when I started pounding and yelling, the object took off and streaked up over the mountain in the direction of the mountain (Rattlesnake mtn.), in the direction of Seattle.  Our parents brought us into the house and put us into different rooms and had us draw a picture of what we had seen.  Our pictures matched, and I remember that our par! ents believed that we had seen something.  The next day (as I remember it) my father told my mother that &#34;something &#34; was reported in the Seattle paper, streaking across the sky at about the right time for it to have been the thing we saw.  I was 9yo at the time as was my cousin.  We had both lived in Alaska and had watched airplanes and heliocopters landing near our home and knew that this was nothing like conventional aircraft.  It was perfectly silent; if we hadn&#39;t been looking we would never have known it was there.   It was completely featureless also. I remember people asking if there were windows or portholes or doors but we were firm that there were not.  We were very close to this object, no more than 50&#39; at the most.  It excited me and frightened me a little bit.  I thought that it stopped opposite us because it &#34;saw&#34; us.  I have never heard any other report of an object which looked like the one we saw.  It looked to me as though it had been manufactured, did not lo! ok like a natural object, was definitely not gaseous.  Anyone else out there ever see anything like this?  I am not sure of the date.  It is most likely that it was 1953 because I was still living in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area at the time and my family was visiting my cousin&#39;s family.  Interestingly and dissapointingly, my cousin does not remember the object as looking the way I describe it.  He now says it was silver and saucer-shaped.  It was not, and we agreed at the time on how it looked.  I remember being frustrated at not being able to really draw the way it looked.  I realize now that I couldn&#39;t replicate the geometrical precision of the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were children of the same age, and had no background as such.  We knew nothing about &#34;flying saucers&#34; except that we must have heard talk about them because I remember explaining that it was not a &#34;flying saucer&#34;, it was round and had a tail.  My father was an employee of Seattle City Light and my mother did not work outside the home.  I was an only child at the time.  My cousin was one of 4 children,  His father was a logger and his mother was employed but I don&#39;t remember at what at that time.  We were semi-sophisticated kids in that we had traveled to Alaska by stemship with our families several times and had had the experience of living on the fringes of civilization as well as in the Seattle area.  Perhaps because I was an only child, I have an excellent memory and clear early memories. I realize that this is OLD information and not at all scientific but I don&#39;t know anyone else who has seen something like this so &#34;Up close and personal&#34;.  If I hadn&#39;t seen this thing! , I would never believe the reports I&#39;ve read about the objects other people have seen.  I empathize with the skeptics, it&#39;s just too fantastic.  But, since I have seen it, I can no longer doubt that there is something more to this world than we now &#34;know&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/53 13:00|Fort Worth|TX|Sphere|5 min|A silver "dot"  jets from Carswell AFB chased in the early 50's.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42218.html|5|ndxe195306| A silver &#34;dot&#34;  jets from Carswell AFB chased in the early 50&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early 50&#39;s I was just a child, but I still remember the day when my Mother, two other neighborhood women, and a couple of kids where in our front yard and we saw the jets from Carswell AFB in the sky. Jets were a big deal in that day and time, so we all stopped what we were doing to get a look at the jets. I remember my Mother and the other neighbor women pointing at the jets and then one of them asked, &#34; What is that in front of them there?&#34; We all shaded our eyes and looked closer. All I could make out was a silver &#34;dot&#34;. &#34;Are the jets chasing that thing? Oh, my gush! Did you see that?&#34; One of the women asked. What I had saw  was three jets chaseing after a silver dot. The &#34;dot&#34; stopped, shot stright up from it&#39;s position, the jets flew under it, the &#34;dot&#34; dropped back to it&#39;s orginal position and then shot stright back in the direction it had appeared from and was out of sight by the time the jets had made a full  turn around. It was just: forward, up (jets flew under it and started to turning), down, and gone.  I remember one of the women said, &#34; it never turned around, it just went up and back down  and now it is gone...&#34; &#34; That thing was too fast to of been a helicopter or another plane&#34; My Mom stated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are estimated.

I do know it was early summer in the early 1950s.  I was approx 10 years old at the time.  I was outside on the front lawn of our home below the foothills in western Wenatchee, Washington.  My mother was doing yard work and both of my sisters (one younger/one older) were outside as well.  We looked up and saw a shiny, silver-colored saucer-shaped object zoom across the sky at a high speed, southeast to northwest. (It was CLEARLY visible.  It must have been fairly close or large - hard to estimate now.) I remember that we all stopped and watched it.  One of us asked my mother, &#34;What is that?&#34;  She responded, &#34;Oh, that must be one of those flying saucers we&#39;ve been hearing so much about.&#34;  A few seconds after the object disappeared over the horizon, a jet plane zoomed over in the same direction.  That&#39;s it.  It&#39;s a VERY clear memory for me and my sisters.  (Our mother passed in 1962.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We have arbitrarily assigned an imaginary date so that the case will &#34;sort&#34; to an approximate year.  If anyone can provide more information, we would be grateful.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My oldest sister was born at Walker AFB (Roswell) NM in 1952, I was born there as well in 1954.  My Dad, now deceased, was an Air Force Air Policeman and worked nights on the flightline at Walker.  Sometime between 52 and 54 a UFO landed on the flightline at Walker.  My mother told me of the morning he came home from work and he was terribly excited and at the same time freightened about something that had happened on the flightline that night.  He said a large unidentified craft landed directly on the flightline that night.  They had surrounded it for several hours.  There was no contact between the occupants and the base officials.  Finally, just as suddenly as it landed it took off and was gone.  Everyone who had been present for the event and had been told that the incident was to be classified top secret and that they would not speak of it to anyone. It also interesting to note that when my mother told me about this she said that during the time they were stationed at walker no one had ever mentioned the original Roswell incident.  That they heard about it years later on TV.  Seems odd that they would be there 3 or 4 years after the original event and no one ever talked about it even in passing.<n>

Opened eyes and turned head to see med grey disklike object hovering over space between parents and neighbours house; distance of less than fifty feet. Witness got up and observed object for 30 seconds then ran inside to alert parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was east Vancouver British Columbia Canada. The date was late spring or early summer. The weather was warm, clear and sunny with a cloudless sky. The witness was out of school for the summer after completing grade one. The witness was six years old. The witnesses mother had shown him how to use a kitchen chair as a back rest by turning it over and placing it on the front lawn of the house. A pillow was used for comfort. The witness on this day was eager to go outside to sit in the sun and was concerned about missing the sun even though it was before lunch. The witness had to drag the heavy chair outside by himself as the parents did not want to go outside. The witness rushed back in to get a pillow as a cushion for his back. He sat on the grass with the chair as a back rest. The witness was facing west with the house behind him. The witness closed his eyes. An undetermined length of time passed. Something caused the witness to open his eyes and immediately turn his head to the left. The witness observed a very strange object hovering over the space between his parents house and the next door neighbours house. The object was less than fifty feet from the witness. The object had the appearance of two soup bowls placed rim to rim with a dome on top the lower part of the object was rotating from left to right. The object was grey in colour. The object was noiseless. The witness looked at the object for approx. thirty seconds and thinking it was a type of aircraft rushed into the house to alert his father who was and enthusiastic observer of aircraft. The witness kept asking his parents to &#34;come out&#34; &#34;come out&#34;. The parents kept asking what it was. The witness could not describe the object as it was completely unknown to him. After several minutes all three went outside. The object was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to express our gratitude to the UFOBC group in Vancouver for sharing and submitting this report.
