I am an electronic (Retired) technician and know what I am talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the evening of April 25, 1966 (I am getting a lot older and want to leave this information with someone), at 8:25 pm over the city of Reading, PA, I witnessed the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was beautiful, a cloudless sky with the sun just having set in the west.  We were on daylight saving time.  The temperature was about 74 degrees with no wind and 100% visibility. The sighting lasted from 3 to 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what made me look up into the sky in the east at the right time but the object was at about an 80 degree angle and was a green fuzzy ball.  It descended in an arc, much like that of a rainbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First seen it was at an altitude of about 5000 feet.  It stopped at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet at a distance of about 10 miles.  Its decent took only about five seconds.  When it stopped at 1000 feet about ten miles away it started towards me at a very slow speed.  It took about 4 or 5 minutes until the object appeared over my head at about 100 feet at 85 degrees. I had a fantastic view from beginning to end and did not take my eyes off of this object until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a report to MUFON and never really heard anything from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make a long story short I will now tell you what it was that I saw without going into any more detail. It would take me too long to put all the information here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was clearly a vehicle that emitted electro-magnetic beams of energy which could be seen quite clearly in the form of lines of maxwell, which are magnetic lines of force.  Completely silent, the object was &lt; &gt; as you see here.  It was 10 to 12 feet high and 30 to 36 feet long. It moved from southwest to northeast at approximately 15 to 20 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One might ask how anyone can see a magnetic field!!  Simply, the spinning of the object was the key to the force of the field which made it visible to the naked eye.  I could go on and say much more but I will not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the government is misleading and knows and if they don&#39;t they better soon know the truth about this beautiful and wonderful invention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have several theories which I will not divulge at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was real, I am real, and I hope people will come to realize the truth<n>

We await photocopied materials from the witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 17th , 1966, one of the greatest UFO chases occured With police  in NE Ohio and Western PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 0510 hrs on April 17th, 1966 2 Portage County Deputies in one car were dispatched to drive towards the Summit County line to check out a call from Summit County Sheriff&#39;s Dept. about a strange light or craft in the sky, heading east down Route 224 toward Portage County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enroute they stopped to check on what appeared to be an abandoned car with antennas and full of &#34;radio &amp; electronic equipment&#34;. It had a strange emblem on the door in the shape of a diamond with lightning bolts and other symbols. While checking out the car, a large luminous object arouse from beyond the north bank of the State Route, and hovered above them. Both deputies described it as ice-cream cone shaped, with the &#39;ice cream&#39; being solid and the &#39;cone&#39;, pointing down, seeming to be mostly light. Both instinctivle jumped pack into the patrol car. The object then started moving east down Route 224 toward Atwater Center, and they started following it. They also called their radio operator who told them to keep it in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another deputy, in a single unit car was in Atwater at the intersection of Waterloo Rd &amp; Stroup Rd., and called to say he saw it, it was about 800 feet up and the &#34;cone&#34; of light beneath it appeared to be blue to purple in color. He heard no sound but noticed static on his radio until the object had passed several miles to the east. The 2 persuing deputies in car P-13 followed it east on 224 to the Deerfield circle, then SE on State Route 14. At the dinner on the circle, a night cook &amp; waitress both saw the object and attempted to hide behind a car in the parking lot. As the object proceeded down Route 14 across the corner of Mahoning County and into Columbiana County, 2 Salem patrolmen were sent to the edge of town to see what all the radio calls were about. They describe seeing a bright object, about 1000 feet up going from their left to right (or, as they were looking north, west to east), and it made no noise, but had a trail of bluish colored smoke or light trailing behind &amp; below it. They watched it for a few minutes and listened to the deputies on the radio, but the object veered east following Routr 165 and did not enter Salem city. After it had been out of their sight for 15 to 20 minutes, they both saw &amp; heard jets, 2 or 3, travelling at a high rate of speed from the northwest heading south then turning east as if folloing the object. There was the Youngstown 459th Troop Carrier Wing, Youngstown AFR located in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As P-13 approached the intersection of Route 165 and State Route 14,  a Patrolman from the city of East Palestine saw the object and had been listening to the radio. He pulled out behind P-13 and joined the chase. Both cars now stated that the speed was between 85 &amp; 105 MPH. As they approached the county line, the fell well behind the object a couple of times, and it would seem to slow down to &#39;wait&#39; for them. They crossed into PA where Route 14 becomes Route 51 and continued SE. A officer partoling at Conway PA saw the object coming and went down to Route 65 (51 becomes 65) to see if it was an aircraft having trouble. Being from PA his radio did not pick up the Ohio unit&#39;s chase. As the object shot overhead, he saw the apporaching Ohio cars. The object came to a hover over Harmony Township, and all 4 officers sat at a gas station to discuss what was going on. Then they heard the jets. One came in and flew over the object, while the other 2 started circling around. The Conway officer called his dispatch and asked him to call the Pittsburgh airport to see if they had any activity going on. Then as the first jet turned to make another pass over the object, the objects &#39;cone of light&#39; turned orange and it shot straight up into the air, and dissapeared in a couple of seconds. All 4 of the officers heard a high pitched winning sound, when it changed color, and their hairs all stood up as it shot up. Also all of their cars shut off at the same instant, though they all easily restarted when tried. The Conway radio operator called back and said some military man at the airport wanted to talk with them. They went to a nearby police station (Rochester) and took the call. The Rochester officer stated that the man said they had scrambled jets, but another man, a Colonel, as he identified himself, came on and said that there were no jets scrambled, and that they had probably been chasing the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the Portage deputies returned to Ravenna (where their HQ &amp; jail was) they were told to sit tight. A Maj. Quintanilla, USAF was driving up from Dayton to interview them. In the mean time the Sheriff started his own investigation into the events. In all, of all the officers involved (2 Portage deputies, 2 Salam patrolmen, 1 East Palestine patrolman, and 1 Conway Police officer), 6 of them, were interviewed by a detective from Portage County, then by Maj. Quintanilla, a Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (RET), William B. Weitzel (NICAP), Prof. William Powers of Northwestern University and Director of the Dearborn Observatory, and various newspaper reporters. The Detective that investigated this found elevated levels on his CD survey meter, and scourched earth in the field where the deputies claim it rose out of. And there were the photos taken by a local police chief (From Mantua) which were discounted by the &#34;official&#34; investigators, that this experienced detective found compelling. And there are the recorded tapes from the interviews, that never made it into the official government investigation because the Sheriff wanted his to be an independant investigation and not to come to the attention of the military - which it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a deputy at Portage County Ohio from 1985 - 1989, and came across these files while cleaning up old files for removal to the new facility. I was to dispose of all the case material that was not related to open cases or those involving deaths of violence. But this was just too good to  throw out. Much of the material is on the NICAP web site, just search under Portage County Ohio UFO Chase. However, what I found was the independant investigation the Sheriff had done, and which was never turned over to the investigators - at the request of the Sheriff himself. So I have witness statements made on the Sheriff office&#39;s report forms, the detectives report, and material never before examined by UFOlogists, or skeptics. This was a significant case in 1966, and the chase seen in &#34;close Encounters&#34; were the UFO goes over the lead actor&#39;s pick-up and it stalls, and as the object leaves it is being chased by police cars, was inspired by this very case. The Portage officers followed the object for 86 miles. It was chased by 6 police officers, seen by many civilian witnesses, was chased by Air Force jets, and resulted in 3 of the officers leaving the profession, 2 quit, one was fired and he got a divorice as well - all because of this chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am preparing to include this in a book,  with all of the new details, reports, and the evidence which was never before released, along with some other interesting events from Eastern Ohio / Western PA. But in the mean time I am sending copies of the documents and tapes to the UFO center for their examination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your prompt reply. The information in the material is interesting, and I would be glad to put it into report form. Some of the material I have is indeed in the NICAP database (Just do a search there under Portage County and you get lots of hits), but the vast majority of it came from the Sheriff&#39;s Office report, which again were in the detective&#39;s files, and according to deputies who participated in the investigation the material was never given to Maj. Quintanilla or to Mr. Keyhoe or the NICAP folks - it was just locked away in the detective division&#39;s files. The taped material is from reel-to-reel tapes of the interview of the 2 portage deputies involved (interview by Major Quintanilla of Project Blue Book), a Salem police officer and East Palestine police officer (both by Portage County Detectives), and some material that I cannot make out what it is. There are police reports, the original NICAP report, and some interview transcripts of 4 witnesses - all not in the NICAP data base. I did email NICAP, but was told that it is not an &#34;active site&#34; anymore - just a data repository. I could attach these to some emails, or better yet I could fax them if you have a number. As for the tapes, I have copied most onto cassette format, and can easily mail you a copy for you to keep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These files were not considered an active case, so I believe legally it would be OK to publish this stuff. I will, however, ask my lawyer to be sure I am not breaching any confidentiality rules (it was not a solved case either, so it had not ever been placed in the public domain file at the Sheriff&#39;s Office; and I want to be sure that I am not going to be liable for slander in any way). The telling of the story back in 1966 led to one deputy involved loosing his job, getting divorced, and he lived in poverty for most of the intervening years - so mentioning him again in a public forum MAY be a problem. At worst, you may have to withhold my identity until I get these questions answered. But I will get this stuff together in the next few days and either email or fax the documents, and mail you the tapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for your fast reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n>

Their altitude was high enough to prevent any real description but their formation.   When I reported back to the MCCC, he told me our findings were what he expected.  He told me that Cheyenne Mountain had just told him of eight UFO&#39;s over our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might note, that I later was told that Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City had eight UFO&#39;s reported over them the following night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The various sightings continued for almost a 30 day period.  At one time, we had a two man security crew posted at one of our silos.  When teams such as that, were posted,  they were equiped with a rather top heavy vehicle.  Usually a 4x4 Dodge Power Wagon with a camper mounted .  Because of this, when they were parked on the site, they would tie them down with guy wires to prevent them from being blown over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reported to me, a UFO hovered over the silo and over the teams vehicle.  It seems the vehicle began to shake as though it was being raised.. The guy wires prevented any further movement..<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that 30 day period, ranchers were driving the sheriff of Laramie County a bit crazy.  They were reporting UFO&#39;s and missing cattle..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard, sometime ago, that a member of my Air Police squadron had informed Mr. Bell of a landing site they had tried to preserve but were prevented from doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought I might let you know this was a bit more wide spread than it seems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

He told me to stand there and look up in the sky.  I thought he was pulling my leg because he was somewhat of a comedian.  I stood in the middle of the road and looked up at the sky.  Down came a huge craft from the low clouds.  It was covered in lights - large lights - like the kind you see on football fields.  I tried to make the shape out but because of the lights it was impossible to see what the shape of the craft was.  It made no sound and seemed to tilt.  It went back up into the clouds and disappeared.  That night on the radio it was announced that people had seen a meteor go from Vermont to Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was laying on my bed, looking out my window at the sky, about 10:30 PM. I notice an orangish light moving in the distance - heading in my direction.  It was unusual, so I ran and got my parents (I was 14 at the time).  They both came to my room, and we all looked out my window. By now, the thing was nearly overhead.  It looked low - maybe only a couple hundred feet high.  No sound.  My folks opened the window, and pushed me away from it.  I went to a northern exposure window, and watched this glowing disk continue northward.  It dropped three small whitish or glowing lights out, then continued northward and disappeared in the distance.  The whole event happened in a minute or less. Years later, I saw that same orange color while paging through a magazine about Auroras.  Ionized diatomic oxygen gives off that orange glow.  Whatever this thing was, it must have been electrically ionizing the air around it! One other thing.  This occurred about the same time as the Catalina Island sighting.  I have a feeling that one was a real sighting (too)!<n>

Bright light sucking water and splashing with 2 legged hairy spider like monsters with wet black eyes|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72958.html|9|ndxe196604| Bright light sucking water and splashing with 2 legged hairy spider like monsters with wet black eyes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping near a lake with a fellow scout.  I was awakened by splashing noises and water smells.  I looked out my tent door and saw a bright light gliding over the lake sucking up the water.  I was curious and frightened.  I laid face down and watched the light move over the water.  I started to worry about it and tried to wake up my tent partner. I could not wake him from his sleep and moved back towards the tent door but stopped.  I saw hairy 2 legged monsters.  I backed away from the tent door but could still see their images because the light was now closer.  I don&#39;t remember much more except that I have unending dreams of being pulled into the lake and emerging inside a cavern under the lake.  There was air, but it was hard to breathe it and I could see moving shadows.  The inside of the cavern had some kind of light source. In my dream I pulled out my scout flashlight with the rubber seal and point it toward the shadows and see spider like creatures, ! but hairy with tall thin legs. My light bothers them; I don&#39;t know why the light is an irritant.But, they move to my left and right as though they try to surround me. My flashlight dims over time and now I can see their wet black eyes. I hold back my tears and try to shout but I can&#39;t hear myself. Exhausted and with little light left they stick me with their pointy legs and smother my breath. I always wake up the same way I did that same morning after, soaked with sweat or lake water; I can&#39;t tell which.  I am scared to death every night I sleep, because I know they come in my dreams and I can&#39;t stop them.  I must tell you that I see myself like them in the mirror on occasion only to second look myself and see me normal again. I believe I was abducted but can&#39;t prove it. I was just a boy then and now I am in my 50&#39;s and still I am bothered with this horrible dream.  10 years ago I had a tumor removed from my body.  It was attached to my stomach. It weighed about a pound and! was about the size of a small orange.  The doctor said it was! an unus ual size and sent it to the lab for biopsy. That lab was flooded and the tumor was lost.  I have always wondered if that tumor was a spider sack?  I guess I will never know. If anyone has had similar dreams, I&#39;d like to know?  I do have these red splotchy spots on my legs that my doctor says is a rash.  I have had them for decades. These spots end at the knee. Maybe some one else form your index has the same and we could share.  I am old fashioned when it comes to computers. And I&#39;m too embarassed to let anyone know this fact, so I hope this is as good as your &#34;cut and paste&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It was a Saturday night; I and my best friend/classmate had begged off attending a slide show in the cafeteria, and were in our respective dorm rooms, studying.  Around 9:00, my friend was banging on my door and babbling in hysterics.  I let her in, and heard what I thought was an April fools joke about seeing a flying saucer.  I finally agreed to go to her room (which faced the back lawns and woods between the school and Chicopee) and look out the window.  There was nothing there but the woods and dark.  I was in the middle of saying &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as flying saucers&#34;, when a very large red glowing (like glowing plasma) &#34;cloud&#34; appeared over the trees at the edge of the woods.  Now I was hysterically laughing and babbling and pointing at this thing, while it descended slowly into the woods.  Once it had &#34;settled&#34;, we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  But that was only the beginning - a few moments later, we saw white saucer-like objects flying at very high speeds and at unbelievable angles.  They seemed to be able to go from about 1/2 mile to 3 miles away in an instant!  At one time during this incident, we counted as many as 11 objects in the air at once.  Their movement seemed to be centered very close to, or right over Chicopee, although it was hard to tell because of the tremendous distances they covered so quickly.  We never saw any of the objects again, although there were rumors in our dormitory that several girls had seen strange things in the sky.  It was very hush-hush; nobody wanted to be labelled a &#34;kook&#34;.  Understandably, my friend asked me never to discuss the incident.  It does take a bit of courage to report something this bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He said he and his girlfriend saw a UFO flying in the direction of my house and told me to run outside to see if I could see anything.  I did and looked all around; saw nothing.  He was extremely excited and wanted to know if we would pick them up and go out driving to look for this thing.  Ok, we did.  Drove back in the direction of where he thought it went.  Found a side gravel road where it was dark and sat there looking up at the sky.  It was very eerie; a very quiet, dark country road.  We sat there watching the sky.  I was on the passenger seat in front, my boyfriend on my left on driver&#39;s side; the other 2 in the back seat.  He said to look for a bright star-like object.  After approx. 20 minutes waiting.  I saw a bright object which I was fixated on.  The next instant it appeared directly near us in the sky; above the treetops toward the backside of the car.  I yelled to look and all of us stared at it.  It was a huge saucer-like object with red light blinking on and off around it.  After a few minutes it disappeared so fast we couldn&#39;t tell which direction it went. It was so unreal. But the 4 of us saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the date may be approximate.  PD))<n>
