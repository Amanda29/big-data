My husband (noW ex-husband) and I had been working in Westmont. We were headed to his Uncle&#39;S  house for a casual New Years Eve family gathering in Wheaton.  As we headed west on Warrenville Road we spotted a light suspended in the sky over the field next to the road.  It was a clear quiet night.  I begged my ex to pull over to the side of the road so we could get a better look at it.  There was nothing attached to the light...no tower beneath it; nothing from which it was suspended.  Once we stopped (as did a couple cars in front of us and 1 behind us) the light started scanning the field beneath it (EDGE OF mORTON aRBORETUM). I rolled down my window to listen for some type of engine noise...thinking maybe it was attached to a small aircraft (thinking manmade)...I could only hear a PULSATING humming/vibrating noise similar the noise of power line towers.  As I reached for the door handle to get out of the car my ! ex grabbed my jacket sleeve and said, &#34;no! Don&#39;t get out!&#34; I pleaded with him to back up so maybe I could see it better...as he put the car in reverse and slowly startED back the object stopped scanning the ground and the light was immediately extinguished like a camera shutter closes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point my ex shifted into gear and sped away. My ex would never discuss what we saw admit to anyone what we witnessed and asked me not to, fearing people would think we were &#34;nuts&#34;. The event really upset him.HOWEVER, I have shared it with many people and I was very surprised to learn that there are tons of &#34;nuts&#34; on the loose. Well, at least I&#39;m not alone! :) However, it would be nice to know who the others were in the cars that pulled off when we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THE EXPERIENCE BELOW:   Occurred : 1/31/2008 06:30 (Entered as : 01/31/08 06:30) Reported: 1/31/2008 5:36:54 AM 05:36 Posted: 2/14/2008 Location: Lisle, IL Shape: Light Duration:10 Seconds A solid light that changed sizes instantly and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 0630 hours.  I was driving eastbound on I88 going through Lisle, Illinois on my was to work. Just to my slight right so probably a Southeastern direction I was this solid light.  The light looked as if it was many miles away and somewhat high in the sky.  It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time.  As I watched the light it suddenly became 4-10 times larger then its initial size in less then a second.  A few seconds later the light returned to its original size and as I was grabbing my video camera I looked up and it was gone.  This all took place over a period of about 10 seconds.  I am a firefighter and I have never seen anything close to this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We started from Coffeville Missisippi on State Road 32 via Charleston to Webb. It was a very cold and extremely clear night. While riding we observed a large object traveling parallel to us at a speed slightly faster than we were going (approx 55 mph). This object was more turtle shaped than a saucer and large (maybe 4 or 5 times larger than our car). It was at a low altidude maybe 40 or 50 ft. It&#39;s color was a orange greenish glow. There were no windows or ports that we could determine. We observed it for approximately 5 minutes as it maintained a level path on our right side before decending into a swampy wooded area just outside of the town of Webb. We decided to tell no one and didn&#39;t for years. Later on we told this to our friends who we visited and they told us that there was another lady who also saw this object but was ridiculed when reporting it to friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upper deck 1975.  Witness was an Airforce personnel who worked part time named Luis I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a triangular bright looking star and watched it go straight, zig zag, zooming up and down.  I asked him is that a new air craft on Mc Dill AFB?  He said no!  A plane or craft we have cannot move like that.  No one was on the rooftop but us at that time so he told me never to tell because people would think we were nuts.  He had his career to think about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget it.  I was about 16 or so I believe.  I am now getting up in age so I want it known and wonder if any other people living in Tampa saw this?  We could not have been the only ones. It looked like a star it was so bright and high in the sky.  He said this thing must be larger than what we were seeing!  Just need someone to know this information in case anything ever happens to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is approximate.  PD))<n>

For obvious reasons I never reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling cross country from Houston TX, to San Diego, CA, I slept in El Paso Texas, then headed west on Route 10.   About 25 or 30 miles into Arizona, I stopped to stretch my legs in the desert.  The weather was exceptionally clear, stars were almost on the horizon and there was a full moon.  One maybe two cars passed in the roughly 15 minutes I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking South to Southeast, I saw an array of lights just over my right shoulder, close to Zenith, slightly to the West. I listened for a sound but there was none. I first thought it might be a helicopter. Its overall shape was indeterminate except for the elliptical/oval array of lights which were sharp and distinct. There were two (2) colors of lights, evenly spaced, alternating blush red, and a sort of mercury blue. For a minute or so it was motionless, perfectly stable as I tried to make out an overall shape, determine what it was and it’s altitude. Not knowing its altitude or size I couldn’t estimate either. I guessed that the elliptical shape of lights could be circular depending on its aspect or tilt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved purposefully but slightly to the North, then back just a little toward the South, and stopped. From a full stop it then instantly accelerated over the Eastern horizon in what I estimated to be about 4-5 Seconds. Its path was perfectly straight without any random motion or bobbling. I stood and waited for about a minute believing I’d hear a sonic boom but there was no sound, sonic boom or otherwise. A diffuse blue contrail was left in its flight path, perfectly illuminated by the moon. This gradually turned to very thin white puffs and disappeared. No other aircraft were in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about what I’d seen.  Thinking the Eastern mountain ranges were maybe 5K to 8K feet in altitude, it seemed to clear them by about 5K feet (estimate) so I assumed the craft was maybe at 12K-15K feet altitude. My confusion was how a craft or a missile could go from a full stop to 3 or 4 miles per second without any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not exactly an untrained observer.  For 10 years I worked on the development and launch of more than 20 rocket-borne and reconnaissance aircraft systems.  After that I worked on Apollo instrumentation systems and was at the Flight Control Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center in Houston during Apollo 15, 16 &amp; 17, and Skylab I, II, and III.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it’s worth to you, there you have it. It’s been a long time, but I can visualize it as if it happened today.<n>

The sky was very clear and we could see the object above a neighbors house, it was moving to the South.  It made no noise, had white lights that rotated around the sphere clockwise.  We could see the shape of the object against the black sky.  My brother and three friends followed the object to a  road outside of Providence. It stopped and they stopped.  It was directly above them and they could clearly see hyroglyphic-type writing on the shiny metalic surface - they were that close!  My brother took pictures and the object began to move again.  They were terrified and returned home. Only he was actually gone for hours longer than they can account for.  He won&#39;t talk about any of this to anyone.  He pretends it didn&#39;t happen but my family and I know what we saw! When the film was developed, all non-UFO  pictures developed normally but the UFO photos were all overexposed yet he used no flash and the pictures were taken at night.  Quite a few others saw this UFO that evening and everyone I have spoken with agrees with my description.  An investigator (from where I don&#39;t remember) came to our house and spoke with everyone individually and we drew pictures of the object.  I haven&#39;t seen one since but I check the skys nightly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
12/20/75 22:30||IN|Disk|15 minutes|We saw a saucer-shaped vehicle at night in Indiana in the winter of 1975.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56743.html|8|ndxe197512| We saw a saucer-shaped vehicle at night in Indiana in the winter of 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it was just a light in the distance that moved erratically. Sometimes it would stay in one spot, sometimes it would move quickly, more quickly than a helicopter or an airplane. Sometimes lights would flicker. We had to stop at a gas station to fill-up and we didn&#39;t even talk about this vehicle that we were following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back on the road, my cousin&#39;s wife was driving. She spotted it and it was closer because it was brighter. This time it crossed over to the passenger side of the highway and stayed in one spot. When we approached it, I rolled down the window. My cousin and I stuck our heads out the window and we saw it about a stone&#39;s throw off the highway, about the height of a water tower. There were windows around it, with what appeared to be lights on top, although they weren&#39;t lit. Right after we passed it, it took off with no sound and at an extremely high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Walking home late with hubby and suddenly noticed a very large blue light in the sky.  It seemed very low, perhaps just because of the size.  A fist held at arm&#39;s length would just about contain it.  It crossed our path on a diagonal, moving very slowly.  It continued (as best I am aware of) without any pauses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped just because it caught my attention.  My mind raced to explain what I was seeing.  The best I&#39;ve been able to come up with is a helicopter with an all-glass front that was illuminated so brightly from within that nothing was visible except the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this doesn&#39;t explain the hardest part to comprehend.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of how long I stood there frozen in my tracks.  I could not move.  I was scared and wanted to run, but I could not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I was walking (not running) home again.  The last I saw it, it was directly overhead.  I did not turn back to see it once I could move again (which makes no sense to me at all).  I had no fear of &#34;it&#34; following me.  I fully remembered all of what I&#39;ve written here; there was no amnesia of seeing this light.  The moon doesn&#39;t move that quickly across the sky and the fluidity of the movement (in my opinion) rules out anything like &#34;swamp gas.&#34; ~~~~~~~~ I saw another light in the late 70s in Virginia; it was green, smaller, and higher in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And in &#39;76 or &#39;77, a metallic object that was NOT shiny.  Sort of a rust color.  Could be termed cigar-shaped, or could be a disc seen at such an angle that it appeared elongated.  This was near Pittsburgh, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Illustration by witness did not survive the transfer to the database.  PD))<n>
12/18/75 00:30|Clermont|IN|Disk|10 minutes|Disk-shaped saucer over house w/ a lazer light focused on home|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70103.html|10|ndxe197512| Disk-shaped saucer over house w/ a lazer light focused on home<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on St Rd 136 towards the town of Clermont, Indiana when I saw 3 white lights low in the sky. As the airport is 15 mi. so., I didn&#39;t think too much of it at first other than the lights were too low for an aircraft on approach as well they didn&#39;t seem to be moving towards me, but me towards them. As I drove nearer the lights I stopped &amp; what I saw nearly took my breath away - permanently.  Suspended about 25 ft above a home, was a saucer.  There were 3 &#34;cones&#34; coming from the sides of the saucer: 1 in the middle and 2 others at 45 degree angles from the middle one.  At the tips of these cones were the white lights I&#39;d been watching.  On the underside of the cones were three colors: blue, red, green.  None of the lights were flashing, and there were no &#34;windows&#34;.  What terrified me most was that from the underside center of the saucer was the most incredible lazer of white light - about 4 inches wide focused on the roof of the house below.  I rolled down my window and sat to wait for another car to come to confirm for me I wasn&#39;t crazy; I even pinched myself hard thinking I might be dreaming.  There was NO sound at all coming from the saucer.   In 1975, Clermont was still a one-stoplight town on the outskirts of Indianapolis.  The saucer was just south of the Dairy Queen by about 3 or 4 houses.  After waiting 10 mins. for another car to come, I got scared and drove to the sheriff&#39;s station 2 blocks away but no one was there - at the time it was a 3 man operation.  I was so freaked out I drove around for half an hour before heading home.  The next night I was at a small gathering and hesitantly mentioned seeing a UFO when another friend said, &#34;I saw it too!&#34;  I told him, &#34;Okay - you go in another room and draw a picture of it and then we&#39;ll compare.&#34;  And by god he had the same picture w/ the cones and all!  He said he saw it around 23:30 flying towards downtown Indianapolis at a high rate of speed accompanied by 2 other saucers.  They flew directly east until they got to Merid! ian St ( divides the city E/W and goes N/S) whereby they took a 90 degree turn and sped down the center of the city!!  Hundreds if not thousands of people must have seen these saucers yet there was no mention of it in any media.  I believe the 12/20/75 sighting on your website is the same as mine - all I can remember is that it was likely a Thur or Fri nite and it was the week leading up to Christms. Of all the reports I&#39;ve read, none have ever mentioned anything about a lazer focused on a house anything and I&#39;ve always wondered these last 35 yrs what that white lazer could &#34;see&#34; for them. Oh, and the saucer was of a soft lustre like I&#39;ve never seen - like and egg painted painted a semi-matte silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Initially while walking along Atlantic Boulevard, I noticed the vapor trail of a south bound tri-jet (L-1011 OR DC-10) north of downtown. The estimated altitude was 35-40,00 feet. I then noticed a metallic booomerang shaped object approaching from east over the Atlantic Ocean to west. Initial altitude 20-25,000 feet. With amazing speed and rate of climb, it almost collided with the tri-jet heavy, The jet swived to avoid it, and the miss was so close that the vapor trail of the jet was broken by the object. I was truly terrified a mid-air collision was about to occur, but thankfully it didn&#39;t.<n>

12/1/75 04:00|Hollywood|CA|Disk|1 minute?|Classic Saucer over Hollywood at Christmas Season 1975|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12610.html|15|ndxe197512| Classic Saucer over Hollywood at Christmas Season 1975<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Christmas season 1975, and I&#39;d been living in an 1920s Bachelor  apartment building on Glencoe in the Hollywood Hills above the Cahuenga Pass, just south of the Hollywood Bowl.  From my 3rd story patio I had a terrific view of the Cahuenga Canyon - out across Hollywood and off toward the high rise buildings far off in Downtown Los Angeles. My 10 year old son was staying with me for the holiday and was asleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.  This night was one of those warm winter evenings, and the doors &amp; windows were wide open. It was about 4:00 AM when I got up to use the bathroom; then decided to step outside onto the patio to view the city light.  I was looking East &amp; South. I stood on the patio for a few moments and looked downward from my hilltop location - Then, I was amazed to see the lights in the Cahuenga Pass slowly began to vanish?  It appeared that these lights below me were being &#34;eclipsed&#34; by some large oval black shape which passed over them, as it moved Southward &amp; West around the mountain. &#34;Helicopter,&#34; I thought... or maybe &#34;The Goodyear Blimp?&#34;  But there wasn&#39;t any sound!  I listened for the &#39;copter&#39;s clatter, or the low-drone of the blimp...  but nothing. The shape kept moving around and below, across my path of vision.  It was probably 300 - 400 feet away.  I was very intrigued, as this made no sense, and no sound?  I could then see the general oval shape as the object passed and the canyon lights were again revealed behind it. Then, the object was directly before &amp; below me (maybe 100 feet below my eyelevel), when I suddenly thought... &#34;Zeus!  It&#39;s a flying saucer!!!&#34; -  and then, THE SHIP&#39;S LIGHTS POPPED ON!!! revealing a row of yellowish / pink WINDOWS?  which passed all around the thing! I tried to make some sense of it all ~ and I thought, &#34;It couldn&#39;t be the Good Year Blimp at 4:00 AM in the Morning!!!...&#34; &#34;It&#39;s a bloody Saucer!!!&#34; Then, 2 rows of Colored Lights (Red &amp; Blue, I think) popped-on, and started to &#34;marquee&#34; - first in one direction, then the other.  All the while, the Saucer continued to pass before my line of sight... I could see (sort-of) inside the Ship - but by now, I was positive this was all a strange hallucination.  So, I ran back inside the apartment and wakened my 10 year old son...  (Trying not to frighten him from sleep) &#34;Jaes!  Wake-up!  Quick!&#34; &#34;What is it, Dad?&#34; &#34;Quick!&#34; - I took his hand and we hurried back outside on the patio... but by now the saucer / object had passed out of view, and around the side of the Hollywood Hills to across West Hollywood and ??? I sat up with my son for a while &amp; we talked about what I&#39;d seen.  He believed me, but it was / is still hard for me to believe what I&#39;d seen.  Even 25 years later - I wonder?<n>
