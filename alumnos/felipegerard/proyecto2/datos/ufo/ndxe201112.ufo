12/31/11 23:59|Anderson|CA|Light|5-7 minutes|Moving lights that changed colors and sped away at a high rate of speed.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86249.html|1|ndxe201112| Moving lights that changed colors and sped away at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1-1-12 Report of UFO in Northern California skies, witnessed by 7 people Dec. 31st, 2011 at about midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Dec. 31st 2011 at my residence, at approximately midnight, 7 witnesses, including myself noticed 8 reddish/orange lights in the southern sky that appeared to be large stars that moved slowly in a westerly direction.  The light from them seemed to twinkle and they would sometimes fade in and out. They hovered still for a few minutes, then they started moving west, slowly twinkling/fading in and out, then they disappeared.  All 8 seemed to be at a similar distance from the horizon, but not in a parallel line (approximately where the sun would be at 3-4 p.m. at that time of year, but in the south).  The weather was calm with no clouds visible.  There was no commercial airline traffic visible.  In retrospect, I realized that I live in the flight path for commercial air traffic from the south into the Redding Airport.  It seemed odd that there were no flights that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they disappeared from the southern sky, 3 more of them appeared in the North Eastern sky, slowly rising from the horizon.  They behaved the same as the other’s, except that after a few minutes of hovering and flying around in the same area, they started moving south along the horizon, slowly moving higher in the night sky.  When they got about where the sun would be at 11a.m. at that time of year, they changed color to a white/opaque (like a ghost) and shot away in a southerly direction very fast. 2 of them seemed to follow each other in a south westerly direction and 1 went south by itself.<n>
12/31/11 23:59|Anderson|CA|Formation|10 minutes|Orange orbs seen in Anderson, CA.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96243.html|2|ndxe201112| Orange orbs seen in Anderson, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2-7-13 I’m writing again because I’ve read so many stories and seen videos of the &#34;orange orbs&#34; twinkling and moving mysteriously in the night sky, worldwide.  I can’t stop wondering what it was that I and my 26 year old and 18 year old sons and 4 other people witnessed in Anderson, CA,. on New Year’s Eve 2011 at about midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s what I do know, that none of us were drunk, other people in Anderson witnessed it too, they made no sound, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity, we all saw at least 8 of them fly together in the same direction but like they were dancing with each other, or playing &#34;catch me if you can,&#34; we saw them move towards us in the southern sky, we then saw them disappear, we then saw 3 of them re-appear in the eastern sky and make a triangle pattern, then 2 of them started to move away from the third, then change from orange to a white ghostly silhouette and suddenly dart away at a faster than humanly possible speed and disappeared in the sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted my story on this website a few days after this event and not surprisingly someone else from Anderson, CA, posted their story, too.  We spoke a little online about it, but I never met the other witnesses. I hope to hear from them again someday.  As this becomes a more common experience for people, I hope we keep the curiosity up.  Don’t become complacent, there is something out there.  It’s definitely not Chinese lanterns.  It could be a light trick or something to do with laser points of light.  It could very well be intelligent beings other than humans.  It did kind of creep us out and we did have thoughts about what if it’s something scary and unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen video and testimony from witnesses who have seen the same thing and had similar reactions to it from as far back as the 1990’s. It’s just more common to hear of it lately it seems.  It reminds me of what early man must have thought about weird things in the night sky.  They must of thought the Gods were angry or the world was going to end.  I’m not a religious man and I believe that when the world ends for man, it will likely be from our own doings and the world will go on without us just fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the meantime I’ll keep looking up and try not to have a wreck doing it.<n>
12/31/11 23:59|Taipei (Taiwan)||Unknown|42 seconds|2012 new years just before the clock striked 12 ufo flys around celebration of many people. VIDEO!|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86395.html|3|ndxe201112| 2012 newyears just before the clock striked 12 ufo flys around celebration of many people. VIDEO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not a witness this was on newyears night. And the only reason I am takeing the time to put this on here is.because there is several different videos on YouTube to verify the event in Taiwan! I want you to check it out yourself.  The video shows a glowing object move in very un natural ways around the building called 101. When I first saw this video I was skeptical but then I saw other videos on this all over YouTube from different camera angles that verify this was not a hoax. This was a mainstream newyear celebration with many people! .  Please take the time to go look up the video called &#34; UFO decends over Taipei, Taiwan fireworks, Jan 1, 2012. UFO Sighting News.  This is by far the most legitiment video I have ever seen. This is just insane and proboblly the best proof out there that were not alone!<n>

No strobe on the craft was seen as you would see on private or commercial aircraft. At first I thought the craft was low flying but the craft I believe was at very high altitude and moving at a high rate of speed  it almost looked like the craft for a second reflected the sun so I thought that perhaps it is a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft appeared on the same trajectory as the craft got closer and saw that it looks just like the first craft at this point I dismissed the first craft as being a satellite . The chararesitics were the same pale light  seemed to be at an extereme altitude. This craft appeared to look slow but again because of the high altitude, once you figure in the altitude you realize the the high rate of speed they ate traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third craft came in about 5mins later perhaps a little more SSE so I had move about 300 ft to get a better view of the object, the trajectory was the same South to North the object had the same chararestics as the first two objects no difference at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth object appeared about 7 mins later but was diffent that the first three the craft looked bigger you could just barely see the craft. The craft was illuminated very dimly with white lights that were pale this craft also looked very high in altitude so size of the craft was hard to to tell however the craft a triangular shape. None of the four crafts had any sound what so ever . I watched the sky for thirty more mins and did not see any other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note I see aircraft, commercial and military in the night skies quite often so I know what those objects look like. I am thinking what I saw may have been some sort of  military craft. Or perhaps some other  “earthly explanation  But I have not seen objects like this in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly, it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the fireworks started at the beach, we looked back to see what the ball was doing and it took off away so fast and then dissappeard.<n>

I had asked ly friend what time it was and he said it was 11:53 as i remember. We were walking up the street, he was texting, i was looking up at the sky wanderuosly and noticed a bright orange circular light. I screamed at my friend &#34;look! Look!&#34;  And pointed to it, he ignored me and kept texting. I looked back up and another one appeared and kept moving closer then went back real fast, I then ran to him and turned him around and said &#34;look!&#34; And pointed again. His face changed to a lost expression and he asked &#34;what is that?&#34; And I said idk I think it might be a meteor, it was really bright and getting closer, the other one stayed in place. We tried to run (thinking it was a meteor striking earth) and kept looking at it.  I noticed one of the lights got dimmer, and it was any airplane or meteor. It looked like a cell, only the dot in the center was red and the shell around it was orange, afte! r getting dim they both disappeared out of nowhere. The most strange part about this is that right when they disappeared we heard a bunch of people screaming &#34;happy new years!&#34; As if they disappeared right when it went from 2011 to 2012<n>

The appeared to be over Lake Union. The lights were circular, orange, shining, and fading in and out.  Sometimes disappearing and the re-appearing in another area close to the cluster.  Some moved up and down, left, right and diagonal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw them we all stopped in our tracks and watched them for about a full 5 minutes.  No pictures were taken or video.  There is a video on youtube some one else posted that looked like it was the same thing we saw.  The last minute we could see them they all seemed to trickle and flicker and fade away until they were all gone.  There were many small planes flying in the area.  I am sure to see the fireworks, and a couple helicopters that all made noise. The lights we saw were silent.<n>

I thought it was a plane comming at a weird angle , I live about 5 miles from airport,  and i noticed that the light was to bright for a plane.It was higher than the trees but at that time it looked about tree top level.I say about a thousand feet it turned out to be. No sound. As it passed over the tree I noticed another orange light then another until i could see about 10. They all were in a 2 by 2 one on top of each other seperated by maybe 200ft in formation. I ran to get the others inside home and all saw. At that time more just kept on coming by until they were 15. They seperated and changened formation . They all ended up in a line. Must have been going  5 miles an hour. They were moving slow. They never spead up. They just kept moving forward until we could not see them becouse of trees.! I took about 7 pictures and was able to zoom up on some. If you want to see them get my email. They look disc shape when zoomed up surounded by lights. 3 adults age 40,46,49, seven teenagers sophmores and juniors in high school witnessed. 40 year old(x-ray tech) 46 year old(jeweler) 49 year old (thearapist).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My driver was refusing to drive me home, so I began to walk South on Nelson Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes to midnight, I was walking East on Queens street and was almost at the intersection of Queens street and Tree Line Court, walking on foot, when I heard yelling from my west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately saw what looked like orange red glowing orbs floating from north to south in the air above where I was walking from. The glowing orange red craft were flying in linear formation, appeared to be like loose embers from a fire caught in a draught of the wind. Later on I found out that they would have been flying directly above a local police operation, a DUI checkpoint, and it seemed that they were openly trying to communicate with the police by flying directly above them and signaling in a very similar way to how the police cars were using their light array to flag down civilians who were suspected of drinking alcohol and driving or were driving faster than was the speed limit of that street, which is 45 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that these craft were about the size of a mid size house flying from north to south directly above US 41 Tamaimi trail, and that I observed them from their east from where I mentioned above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camera with me in my pocket so I began to take pictures, which I will send with the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, to be concise, Orange-Red spherical orb shaped craft flying in formation directly above a congested area parallel to a police DUI checkpoint on New Year’s eve 2011-2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up towards the East and saw 2 lights at about 30 degrees above the horizon. The lights were orange in color and brighter than aircraft landing lights. They were moving in tandem, with slight variations in proximity to each other, generally maintaining about 10 degrees of arch between them, from my perspective. I could not tell their size, how far away from me they were or their altitude, with no frame of reference. They were moving slowly from the north. They were moving faster than would be expected had they been wind driven, as it was a windless night. I followed them visually until they approached the apex of a neighboring house. I walked to the North end of the parking lot, in order to maintain visual contact. I watched them continue at the same previously described speed. They gradually arched upward and towards the Southwest, then faded into a fog bank that I presume ! was over the ocean. The objects made no sound. There was no discernible outline of a physical aircraft that I could see. The lights weren&#39;t perfectly round and even in tone, but more of a diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One unit remained for approximately 15 seconds hovering while the other three units disappeared, at which time this single unit began moving slowly in a northerly direction until it disappeared.<n>

We kept an eye on them and they would slowly disappear going straight up into the sky abouve us very quickly.  They would reappear coming from different directions one at a time about ten minuets apart. This went on for about an hour.  I got it on video and they looked like bright silent fireballs. We also saw them on Christmas eve about the same time at night.  Don&#39;t know what they are but are pretty strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can some one find out for the public what they are it looks like they are being sighted all over the world.<n>

Suddenly over the horizen in the western sky, appreared a bright orange light, followed by another and another.  We counted 13 in all, flying in formation toward the north.  All 13 lights were evenly spaced, same size, same color following each other.  We watched until they disapeared from view.  There was no noise, it was very silent out.  I tried to capture it on my video cell phone, but when I checked out the video, you can&#39;t see the orange lights.  You can see the moon and the reflection of the moon on the water, and the lights from the houses across the lake, but where we saw the orange lights, the sky looks pitch black.  The video didn&#39;t capture the lights.  We didn&#39;t call anyone, we were just dumbfounded.  I&#39;ll try to send a drawing of what it looked liked and a picture of our back yard to get an ide! a.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At my nine&#39;oclock there is still and ongoing a bright white led looking light hovering.  It&#39;s not a star since the stars are twinkling and they stand out as stars.  This craft seems to be moving or wobbling from right to left. Several fireballs seem to be within 25 or 50 miles of the constant light.  Since its new years eve and there a5re constant fireworks going on You can see clearly it isn&#39;t part of the show.  Very eerie, like a helicopter many miles above our home with no sound.<n>

At first I thought they were lights from a plane, because of the height in the sky.  But, I quickly realized that something was different, because there were 4 lights and the color was orange.  They couldn&#39;t have been lights from a plane.  The lights seemed to be traveling slowly, about the same speed as you would see a plan traveling in the sky.  3 of the lights were grouped together and equidistant from each other.  The 4th light was set a little further out from the group of the 3, but all traveling in the same plane and at the same speed.  I asked my wife to pull and I started to get my iphone ready to see if I could take a video.  By the time I got out of the car, the lights started to dim and dissapeared.  Almost like the lights were turned off.  They did not shoot off in the sky or anything like that, but just dissa! peared.  My wife also witnessed the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All my life I have been the biggest skeptic of &#34;UFO&#39;s.&#34; But this has changed my perspective on these type of sightings.  It was unlike anything that I have ever seen before, and something that I have no explanation for.<n>

Appeared to be approximately 20 degrees above the horizon and was in view for about one minute.  The light did not seem to fade as it travelled past our view.  There was no sound of engines etc and there was no breeze. The same light was seen about 25 mins later in the western sky.<n>

No sound was heard and it traveled in a fairly straight line.  There were no blinking lights as are typical to an airplane, instead it was a steady orange glow.  After approximately 30 seconds, it disappeared into the incoming fog. F or more clarification, it was not too foggy in our actual proximity, however, there was some light fog way overhead but mostly the fog was on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Those tiny faded stars start moving in a formation with no sound.  About 3 groups of 4 &#39;stars&#39;.   Sometimes each group they would be in line, sometimes form a triangle and suddenly they all moved like bees in a hive.  There was no tail, like meteor shower, and they were very pale light blue, just like small stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a skeptical person, and I was trying to compare to balloons, but it was dark and no wind, and these things were flying really fast.

It was by chance that I happened to go to the window and look out and see this, this past New Year&#39;s Eve. I couldn&#39;t sleep and was asking GOD to please help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then, immediately went to my window to look out, not even knowing why, but as soon as I did, I saw the UFO. I yelled at my husband and he finally came running out, and he thought he wasn&#39;t alone in the room, but he was.  He saw the light/craft too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, in the air that night were fireworks, and a spotlight, but nothing quite like this.  I couldn&#39;t tell you how big or anything it was, cause not sure exactly how high it was.  It was non-comparable to any aircraft and must have been enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget it.  Could not get a picture, cause didn&#39;t want to miss this phenomenal event.  My husband was also a witness.  Also, the moon after seeing this UFO disappear, was so bright white, like none other; and very low and! sitting in my backyard almost, just like the craft was above my yard!   A few days later, we saw a video on YouTube.com of the same night, and craft we witnessed.  So apparently, we were not the only ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad has also witnessed UFO&#39;s years ago, at least 2 in his lifetime. Thank you so much for this website.<n>

The light/sphere appreared randomly and moved across the sky only to disappear behind some clouds.  The color was green similar to that of a stoplight.  We were outside looking towards Prescott Valley from Diamond Valley when this occured.  Light/sphere moved in a perfectly horizontal line and did not blink or make any other movements.<n>

The dots kind of flickered from red to a white-ish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after a few seconds two of them disappeared and the other one stayed present for a few more seconds then disappeared as well.

The lights appeared to be round. I could see stars in between them.<n>

Then it move faster towards the north and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

It was around 9:30 pm.  It was a clear night.  Looking in a northerly direction, I noticed a reddish object moving to the right, in an easterly direction.  It was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  It was shaped like a paper lantern.  I pointed it out to my wife and nephew.  At first, we thought it was some type of firework someone down the street had set off.  It is hard to say how fast it was moving, but I believe it was faster than the international space station, which I have seen many times. We watched it from the front of the house and when it went behind the house, we ran to the backyard and watched it til it went out of sight.  We probably saw it for about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one object.  It was shaped like a Japanese paper lantern.  It was reddish in color, but the color was changing from deep red to almost orange.  It was bigger than anything else in the sky, even bigger than what Venus looks like when it is setting.  As best as I could tell, it moved in a straight line, no zig-zagging.  We did not hear any sound and we could not see any blinking lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 28 years of power plant experience, my wife has taught school 14 years and my nephew works at a chemical plant.  I have some knowledge of the night sky, having studied star charts so I could learn the constellations.  I also try to watch the space station when it comes over and I keep up with meteor showers and watch them, depending on my work schedule.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then out of the east came a large ball of light. It had a long tail on it and was moving very fast in a straight line. It was about the size of my thumb nail and had a width of my thumb and pointer finger span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tail was a deep turqouise closest to the oval and faded as it went down. It also seemed to be radiating a halo around the entire object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted a total of 3-4 seconds and was moving faster than I could take a picture, I had my camera by my side too and wish I could have captured it. It was like nothing I seen before and I&#39;ve seen my share of metors and metor showers. The direction and speed also ruled out the possibility of it being a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking down when i realized the porch lit up a little enough for me to look up to see what looked like a comet or fireball the size of a dime from where i was.  It moved from east to west for about 5-10 seconds.  As it was moving it looked like it changed colors from red to a sort of green.  There also looked to be flames falling from it.  There was no noise and then dissapeard.  I tried to look on the local news stations and the internet to see if anyone else saw it too.  I believe our local news station posted on thier website that someone reported the same thing some miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was on my back deck when I saw a small red glowing circular object about twice the size of the northern star at approximately 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon, moving south to north at a high rate of speed. The airport is approximately 10 airline miles north of my house so I see airplanes crossing the sky all the time and I would estimate this object traveled at least two to three times the rate of a normal passenger jet. Being New Year’s Eve I dismissed it as fireworks but it traveled on a flat trajectory across the sky at what had to be an extreme altitude. It took about ten seconds to cross my field of vision before it blinked out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went outside into the back yard and watched a circle of orange lights moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast about 45 degrees above the horizon for about seven to 10 seconds until they disappeared.  The lights appeared go out rather than fade with distance.  The size of the circle of lights was smaller than the moon and I believe that I could have covered the lights with my forefinger had I held out my arm.    We immediately noticed another set of circular red lights moving across the sky above us from south to north almost directly above us at the same rate of speed as the first, and then another.  We went through the house to the front lawn and there appeared to be 15 to 20 sets of circular lights high in the sky, much closer than stars but not moving - they are still there at 10:52 P! M.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5 miles south of Stoneman Lake, my girlfriend noticed a glowing sphere moving initially north and then northwest.  I was driving and peered under the top right section of the windshield and saw a large yellow sphere moving parallel to the car then moved very quickly in front and finally disappearing in front of the car.  This all took about 5 secs.  The yellow, slightly greenish sphere was fully illuminated and appeared like a huge falling star or giant fireball.  As it passed our car, the glowing appeared more in front of the sphere like only the semi-circle was lit.  Then when it was fully in the front windshied, only red lights were visible, which made me think it was a plane, but it disappeared in a cloudless night.  If it wasn&#39;t for the huge fireball like appearance, I would have thought it was a plane.  The relative size of! the vision was about two times the size of a full moon.  My girlfriend did see the sphere about 2 or 3 seconds more and said the color was changing from green to yellow, though I only saw a yellowish globe.  It traveled mostly parallel to the ground then made about a 30 degree rise as it crossed in front of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don’t really believe in this- UFO’s, however, it seems to be other worldly.  I believe Less in the American media than I do in UFO’s so I have Been lead to this sight to describe what I saw in the hopes of keeping others informed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a huge brilliant blue triangular object traveling Very Fast across the horizon; I was yelling at a friend and my son to look up in the sky.  To my dismay it disappeared leaving a big red ball of fire and two smaller red balls. At this time my friend and son were looking and two to three seconds later there was a sound as if something struck something.  My friend heard the sound but my son quickly dismissed it because in the opposing direction he saw fireworks declaring that must be the sound but my friend and I swore that the sound came from the direction I was looking in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, over the phone my friend and I did some internet research considering that it was a comet burning in the atmosphere. To my dismay, the news casters reported that several people called in saying they saw something in the sky. The reporters scoffed and joked saying it was space junk, or a falling satellite, or just people drinking too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is insulting and not believable. For starters, what I saw was brilliant and bright blue with a white glow. It was distinctively a triangle and moved faster than I ever seen from right to left leaving behind 3 red balls, one far larger than the other two. It was beautiful, nothing like I have ever seen. At the angle and height of the object it had to be bigger that 4 or 5 larger airplanes.  I haven’t seen anything this large I assumed it to be a meteor or a shooting star or Superman because it was a bright blue streak across the sky. LOL.  I joked that Superman was coming to rescue me.  My friend said I should make a wish. I feel comfortable to say my wish…it was for our planet and its salvation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what I saw but I ran into people in my community the next day that saw it as well. I am calling it a meteor but the more I think about it the more I think it was other worldly, unique and beautiful. Definitely not space junk…This was not that. Just thought I would let someone else that may know hear what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOLLOW UP: I went to Google earth and found the location of where I was and the direction I was looking they are as follows: I was facing N NE 34 51’52.16N 111 47’38.39W   elevation 4436 ft The object came from the NE directly NW till it was gone<n>

As soon as I looked the light was a very beautiful shining-glowing cyan color light.  The shape couldn&#39;t be distinguished but by the frame of the light was diamond/square shape.  The light was mesmerizing, as soon as I tried to take a picture with my iPhone it kept moving horizontally to the right and disappear.  There was no loud sound or any other lights, as this took place in the outskirts west of Albuquerque, NM.  The light was continuous there where no other colors or flashes.  If I had to compare on the size I&#39;ll say bigger than a car(sedan).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting, and we have changed the time above to reflect that fact.

We first saw them from our huge living room window and we ran out onto the deck outside. They were easily seen and moving faster than a small air craft could. They were completely silent. We watched five of them fly over ( almost directly overhead) and they were equally spaced, the exact same size and orange color and all five were silent.  There were no blinking lights on any of them.  There were also two more flying quite a distance behind the other five.  As they made the same flight pattern that the other five were on they curved out over the lake and headed East across Alton Bay.  Those two were quite a distance from us.  I grabbed my camera on my phone and took a picture of one and made an attempt to video the lights. When I zoomed in, the object appeared to be more of a tear drop shape, but the photo really wasn&#39;t fantastic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We at first thought it was a shooting star as it was traveling quicker than a plane would.   We both realized, simultaneously, that is was not a plane.  It kept traveling at a fast rate and the blue light seemed to have some green to the tint of its light.  It made an arched turn near and above Desert Mountain and than disappeared from sight.<n>

I turned and looked and said I dont know.  There were about 5 of them they were moving from south to north flying in a group style broken formation except for the front 3, they were in a parrallel formation, when all of a sudden about 6 more appeared and were flying in the same direction as they were following the other 5. Laura ran inside and got the boys out and we all stood on the back porch deck watching them fly across the sky, when about 5 to 6 more showed up flying in the same direction as they were following the others. We just watched them fly across the sky in awe wondering what we were seeing.! I decided to call 911 and told the dispatcher what we saw and she told me they would look into it and then we hung up, then I called channel 2 news and told them,(Kelly)and she said she would have the meteorologist look into it and thats about it. I decided to look up a ufo sighting sight on the internet and came across this page to tell you about what we saw. I hope that we can get some clearity on this situation and also to find out if anyone else saw what we saw,, thanks..<n>

Moved North, then South, then West. Lasted about 5 minutes and maybe less. After it moved about, it just disappeared. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  Definitely was not an airplane or a helicopter or a satellite or even a meteor or an asteroid;  I know because it&#39;s movements were too jerky and random to be anything like that.  After the jerky movements, it just vanished. There was no explosion or anything like that.  Just vanished.  The sighting was not extremely close to earth.  It was relatively high in the sky, however was not so small to be a star or planet but it was not close enough for me to distinctly make out its features and there was a sort of haze around it.<n>

But it was too dark.  I know it was not a firework. I have never  seen a firework look like that.  The object if I could guess its size, was half the size of a Volkswagen beetle.<n>

As I pulled my car up to the stop sign at the top of my hill, I glanced out towards the Sacramento Valley.  Off in the distance, I saw two large orange amber lights that looked about 5 miles away.  So I rolled down my window to get a better look at them because I never have seen anything like them before.  At the same time looking at them I was desparately trying to get my camera out of my bag to take a picture of these two lights.  These lights were exactly the same color and size and both moved in unison and speed.  One did not move faster or slower than the other.  As I watched them they both made a sharp turn at the exact same time and the lights flickered out.  I never got my picture of them before they disappered.<n>

My house faces North and the object was traveling very slowly primarily towards the East and moving away from me in a slightly Northward direction.  It was low; about the altitude you would see a helicopter or small engine plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe it is that it appeared the object was on fire (bright orangish-red) on the top surface in a dome shape and the glow extended very slightly downward.  It also appeared that the bright lights extended towards the front and the rear but in more of a pointed shape.  It was visible to me for about 2 or so minutes until it slowly faded out as it moved away from me.  It never seemed to change speeds and never seemed to change altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually do not do this (i.e. send out this type of thing), but I was very intrigued by it.  After checking this website, I read someone else’s account (Greer – 11/8/11) and it sounds almost exactly like what I saw tonight so I decided to send this in.  My family thought I was fooling around with them until I read the Greer sighting to them after I tried to explain what I saw.  Even though this is New Year’s Eve, I have only been drinking diet coke so my account is about as genuine as it can be.<n>

It would remain in one spot for about 10 minutes then would disappear.  After 3 of these similar episodes over a short period of about 90+ minutes, another was seen to rise and move towards the other similarly colored object in the sky.  Both eventually disappeared as they individually moved away at a distance the made it seems as though they moved away at a fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought was it was a helicopter hovering, but we could not hear any engine or noise.  It resembled a large object on fire at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am writing this, my wife observed another object with a similar glowing color that moved across the northern sky from right to left, then disappeared after about 10 minutes.

We live on the west side of the East Grand Traverse bay in Michigan. Our house is at the top of a 150 ft. tall cliff and we have a good view of the bay from all sides especially in the fall when the leaves are off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside at 6:30 pm on Dec. 31st  and looked to the north, from the west side of the house.  It was already very dark outside   I noticed some lights in the sky over the bay and thought they were stars. I then realized there were no stars as it was overcast and the lights were something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed one that was over land moving west to east toward the bay, I could see it through section of woods behind our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran around to the lake side of the house and the moving orange orb joined 4 others over the bay. I tried to get a video with my phone but it did not turn out as it was too low of quality.  They were spread out to the north of our home directly over the four mile wide bay and I estimate they were one mile north at a high elevation of maybe 1,000 ft.  This lasted for about 3 minutes and they were spread out in a pattern with three across horizontal and two more under them randomly spaced.  Then they moved on north through the clouds and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no noise.<n>

This stood out as different, as was not flashing red/white lights and was not as bright as an airplane’s lights. Kept watching through the windshield, and then overhead briefly through my sunroof. Had to keep briefly checking the road and looked away, then within 5 seconds, I turned right onto a side street and parked. I saw the ball of light do a tight U-turn and head southeast. From my point of view, it seemed to slightly waver at times and didn’t appear solid. Within 20 seconds from it turning, it just vanished.  I kept watching to make sure it didn’t reappear and it didn’t.  Total time I watched was about 5 minutes, and looked at my watch right after it vanished at 635pm MST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear evening.  When the ball of light vanished, I could see the moon and planet (I think Jupiter) were just to its left and way off behind it.  Originally, the object was coming towards me starting at about 45 degrees above the east horizon and finally overhead at 90 degrees above.  When it vanished it was approx 45 degrees above the SSE horizon.  It moved slowly like any typical small airplane.  (It’s size relative to a star or moon?)  --  from the angle I saw it, it was about 1/10th of the moon, yet I was seeing it much closer at a height of small airplane, perhaps 300 - 400 feet above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I did not have time to check Heaven-Above for satellites at that time, but know that satellites don’t change directions or appear red.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were larger than stars,light yellow, and they were not blinking and just as my boyfriend made a joke about it being a UFO, a third, even brighter one appeared--and by &#34;appeared,&#34; I mean it was just all of a sudden there--over those two and made a perfect triangle. And they stayed like that, perfectly still, for about two or three minutes before they began to spin and rotate kinda slowly. I think they were maintaining their perfect triangle shape but the shape seemed to morph as it spun in the sky. And then one of them shot off to the right and disappeared and it was just two that were sort of orbiting each other. They stayed like that for a while and then another floated over and took its place and it continued like this for like 15 minutes until they all floated away fr! om one another and eventually faded away. We decided to keep walking while keeping our eyes on it but we eventually lost sight. Then a couple minutes later we saw the same thing a few miles over. As we were walking further down the road we saw the same thing again even further over, again. We never saw two of these formations at once so we can&#39;t say how many there actually were, but we did see a formation in various, distinctly different spots within a very short amount of time. We then decided to go get some food. We were in there for about half an hour to forty-five minutes and when we came out, we saw another two-light formation over the parking lot. We watched it for about a minute before going to the other side of the plaza, which obscured our view. The store we were meaning to go to was closed, though, so we headed back around. By the time we got back, the lights had completely vanished. It only took about a minute and a half. The last formation we saw was another two! -lighter over the bay before we went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not blink like most aircraft; sometimes they did not even move--just hovered, stationary, above the city in a perfect triangle. There seemed to always be a main &#34;tip&#34; of the triangle that the whole formation rotated around. This one was always the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first noticed the lights about 3 weeks ago. They seem to linger in the same general vicinity nightly, east of my home at about 10 O&#39;clock. They are readily visible on a clear night. The lights appear to be strobe-like, alternating blue, red, white and green in no fixed pattern. Tonight my wife noticed one of the objects was lower and nearer our location than previously, and urged me with conviction, to report the sightings. I estimate the nearest object to be rather large, and about 20 miles or less away, as I write this report. Originally both objects appeared to be near Florence SC roughly 40 miles away. We have viewed the objects with binoculars but that provides nominal improvement to the image. (wish we had a telescope)<n>

While admiring some of the houses around us, we noticed a pair of lights hanging next to each other in the air over Berkeley (north of our position). Right as I was joking that the lights must&#39;ve been spacecraft, a third light appeared above the other two, forming a perfect triangle.  We sat and watched as the lights very gradually moved around in formation, occasionally hanging in the same spot for minutes at a time, and then rearranging position.  After a while, the lights appeared to fly off over the bay, only to return again from seemingly nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We attempted to photograph the lights with our phones several times to no avail. The cameras in our phones were just too weak to make out the relatively minute dots of light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights had finally faded completely, we began to walk down toward the El Cerrito plaza, only to see the lights again several degrees east of where we&#39;d seen them before. The lights continued their dance in the sky throughout our walk from the hills to the plaza (20~ minutes). The lights presumably were still there when we went into the shops at the plaza at around 18:15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 19:00, we noticed the triangular lights again, this time over Richmond (south of our position). We watched them sit completely still from several minutes, and then continued to the store to buy New Year&#39;s supplies. When we came out from the shop moments later (it as closed early for New Year&#39;s) the lights had completely disappeared from the skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing the event, there were occasional (possibly coincidental) issues with our television and phone signals.<n>

After the object flew directly above my head and I need to turn around to view it, the shape of the object appeared, circular and a matte black finish.  The light which appeared to be in the back of this object slowly and steadily became dimmer and the object itself much more visible.  Before I knew it, the object vanished into thin with no evidence of it being there in the first place. No noise was every produced from the object and there was no contrail, the exhaust from jet engines.  Always was a believer in this sort of thing and always wanted to be a person who had an experience like this.  Needless to say it was the most amazing site I&#39;ve ever noticed.<n>

At first, he thought it was just a nearby helicopter, since military aircraft/helicopters frequently fly over our house. The light really caught the witness&#39;s attention when it zig-zagged three times, each time moving a distance of six or seven degrees in a fraction of a second. The witness reported seeing two rows red and green blinking lights, but this could have been due to atmospheric instability. The witness then ran inside and got two more people (including the author of this report). The point of light was still visible and appeared to be stationary. From time to time, however, it would wobble rapidly from side to side, rapidly oscillating an angular distance of one to two degrees. The light slowly got dimmer. The craft remained stationary for an hour, descending at a rate slightly faster than the nearby stars, moving closer and closer to the nea! rest star (Deneb, in Cygnus). It was roughly the same brightness as Deneb.  Everyone got cold and went inside, but two people went outside to look for it again about 85 minute after the initial sighting.  The point of light wasn&#39;t where it was previously. As they searched, the two observers spotted movement in their peripheral vision and automatically directed their attention to it. A point of light about 30 degrees to the left of the place where the first point of light was moved rapidly overhead, crossing the entire sky in under a second, and then disappeared behind the trees. One witness, formerly in the Air Force, said the point moved at least 100 times faster than any aircraft he&#39;d ever seen.  The point of light did not change intensity, color or shape as it moved. There was no trail behind it and both witnesses are certain it wasn&#39;t a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Site Location: 35.7772536260909N, 86.7728685713739W  Atmospheric Conditions: No clouds, but very poor seeing / high atmospheric instability  Apparent Magnitude of Object: Initially, reported to rival brightness of Jupiter, but got dimmer.

I live in the high desert where the city lights do not interrupt the cosmos at night.  I was out on the front porch (facing south)smoking a cigarette. I happened to look to my left (east)and in the immediate hill range of the valley, I saw a fireball that was very big considering how close it was.  It shot behind the local hill within a second. I don&#39;t know what on earth it was, however, it was bizarre!!!  It was the color of fire with definite layers of color.  From what I recall, from center to outward, the colors went from the hues of red, orange, yellow then a bright blue aura.  There was no tail following the object and it was large, very large.  It was very close as it appeared to be in the Morongo Valley itself which is only a stretch of about 7 or so miles. It looked like a star, only amplified in size to where it looked like the size of a small cabin on top of a hill.  The object was round and was ! definitely traveling north.  I just now came to this website, and that is my story.  My father in law called out on the local HAM radio channel to see if anyone seen it, but there was only one response who did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I spotted a bright round reddish-orange fireball around magnitude -15 about 1/3 the dia. of the moon traveling north at about 2,000 ft and 200 mph. It stayed the same size, brightness and shape, the outer edges looked like it was flickering like a fire. I first thought it was a jet on fire and called my wife and daughter out to see it. After watching it for a minute we reallized there was no sound, smoke or trail coming off of it. We got out two binoculars and could not see any more detail, we watched it for about four to five minutes heading north toward sanford slowly getting dimmer and finally disapearing into a cloudbank. We saw several Jets nearby making thier final approach into OIA Airport and could easly tell it looked quit a bit larger and was traveling opposite of the approach path. We are advide astronomers and astrophotographers and we have never seen anything like this, we know what Iridium flares and such looks like. It was by far the best thing we have ever seen!<n>

As I continuing driving to rt 206 ,  I had pulled over onto rt 206 and others cars where looking toward the south also.  This happened  Friday evening December 30, 2011 about 7:20pm.  These orange objects in the sky about 3000 ft high, some brighter than others, coming from the south east,off the horizon.  The size that I can compare it to would be like small private plane.  One object would be always brighter, that would take the lead or follow behind the others in a group of six or more, other orange objects would be flying be themselves, a few would look red.  These objects would be very visible and than suddenly disappear into the atmosphere.  They were coming out of the south east and it probably lasted about 20 minutes and their where about seventy five of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I had seen this is on a rural county road.  The area is rural, farmland and mountains.  I was driving in my Dodge neon and than I pulled over with others and step out of my car and watch these objects that I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.<n>

The first pair was a set of red lights closely spaced together, the left one a little higher than the right one,  they were close together than they flew west about 500 ft.  we followed them with the car and stopped in front of them and took video footage.  they hovered then made their way back east and disappeared from sight...  2 more came from the west these did go back and forth (west to east and back) like the first 2 these just followed the same path as the previous two.  Each one changed colors from red to white to yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While we were unloading the car my Son in law said look at that and he was pointing at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was overcast and below the clouds was three round orange glowing objects in a triangle formation. I had my Sony Cybershot camera in my pocket. I took it out switched it to video and pressed the start button. After about a minute one of the orbs moved into the clouds. It was at this time I noticed the camera wasn’t recording so I pushed the start button again and recorded for about a minute and when I stopped the recording the orbs went into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took another load into the house and when we came back out they were back. I took 5 photos and 1 minute of video and they left again. Having a small camera the videos and one of the shots are a little shaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs were about a quarter mile away and looked about ½ inch across. orange in color lighter in color in the center. They were in a triangle formation and moving in a slow clockwise rotation then one of them moved into the clouds at which time they stopped rotating. When they returned there were only 2 of them from the time we first saw them until they went into the clouds the last time was about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared over a rooftop.  The object seemed to float toward us in our direction.  It was flickering and was amber in color. There was only one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to make quick darting movements from right to left and then back in line. as the object approached it seemed to dim.  It is hard to describe but I think it was rising.  As the object was directly over us, it completely dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object at that time.  My roommate observed the object dart off to the south and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video and photos will be released as well.

More than one object can appear always in the same sky location. It is oriented by finding the Big Dipper and the December moon; the objects will be between them from the ground location in New Cumberland. The recording of video/audio picks up a humming sound of electronic chatter or interference,it does not seem to affect the video quality.  The event has also happened the following evening and on through the night. Still photos are grainy and show blurring of white with blue lighting.  Have 2 videos of the event as described.  There were 18 completely different objects on the 2nd evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have seen these in the past summer but attributed them to the airplane approach to Greater Pittsburgh Airport, but these are not following flight paths or landing approaches, though in the same vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the best stills printed reveals a light pattern resembling the outspread wings of a goose in flight, yet it is difficult to say that the object sits between the &#34;wings.&#34; The observers are security employees used to being awake and alert, and observed this going into 3rd shift.  The 2nd evening of activity was on a night off from work. The observers are 35 to 40 year old white males, with an aversion to being labelled odd or drunk or crazy. Puzzled more than anything else.<n>

The light was, by my guess, 4 or 5 miles away. The light was too high above the trees and houses to be a light on a pole or a decoration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we were in the car, it’s hard to tell whether or not the light moved as well.  There were no other lights with or on the light to define it as an airplane. The road we took was long, 5 miles or so.  From turning onto that road to the end of the road, the light went from bright to dim to finally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the night sky was full of clouds, there were no star light nor moon to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing: My father and I have seen this light twice. On 12/28/2011 at 5pm (17:00) and 12/29/2011 at 8pm (20:00). Both on the same road in the exact same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time we saw this, I tried taking a picture with my cell, but the footage made it show two very dim lights. I’m not sure if there were two lights. From the naked eye, I only saw one.<n>

The lights were all of the same intensity and my first impression was the sort of lights you might see arranged on a water tower, but I knew that there was not such structure in the direction we were looking.  As we continued to walk toward the lights, they began to move away slowly, in unison, and after moving for a few seconds, they disappeared, not because they had moved too far away to be seen, but because they appeared to go out .  Shortly afterward, a pair of lights of identical appearance and intensity to the initial group of lights appeared low on the horizon, also moving in unison in the same, upward diagonal direction as the first group of lights.  As we continued to walk toward the lights, they b! ecame hidden behind a building in front of us, and did not reappear.  We also saw another light, low on the horizon, which seemed to be following the pair of lights, but it also became obscured by the building.  Although we continued to look at the sky, none of the lights reappeared.  There was no sound.  Also, the space between the lights was quite significant and it was impossible that the lights could have been on an airplane.  The lights were yellowish in hue, did not fluctuate in intensity, and moved slowly as one group.  It was not possible to tell how far away the lights were.  Nor was it possible to determine whether the lights belonged to one large object or several smaller objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object made no noise whatsoever, and seemed as if it was moving back and forth.  The object stayed in the sky about 5 minutes before disappearing.<n>

I stopped people on the street and made them look as well..they were dumbfounded. then they gained altitude rapidly and were gone.I called the LAPD, AND ABC news, both said they have heard nothing and were not interested in my pic.  I went to the link below and found exact matches to what Ive seen, all over the country-orange, triangular formation..spheres..  ALL in December.  Even more interesting...tons in the San Fernando Valley (where I live). In my pic, they only appear white..but in person they were bright orange. think I&#39;m nuts?  I bet you&#39;ll see them too- Im not saying they were driven by aliens, they could be military drones..honestly I dont know what they were..but I saw them.<n>

It was traveling at roughly 30-45 mph.  The object was thought to be a bag but as it traveled across the sky its form never varied.  I followed it as far as I could into the horizon and I was able to see that the object was rotating horizontally much like a helicopter blade. The rotation speed was about once every second.  It is hard to describe the appearance of the object.  It was clearly visible in the early night sky, yet it was almost translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was flying kind of low in the sky and I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane cause it didn&#39;t look like it or sound like it and I know airplanes don&#39;t fly that low. It had a sound that didn&#39;t sound like and airplane or a helicopter and it was a sound I never heard before. And it had a flashing red light and it looked like it was about to land somewhere. While it was flying across the sky I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. After it disappeared, for about 15 minutes I was trying to figure out if it was an helicopter or a UFO.<n>

I noticed some objects in the air.  They were too far away to get a good view.  I then turned North onto Casa Grande /Maricopa Road.  I was heading up to a Circle K Gas Station to get some gas.  I still saw the objects in the air but still at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned into the Gas Station and the objects became closer. This Gas Station is located on John Wayne  Boulevard.  I saw the objects quite clearly.  There were 3 objects.  They were moving, two were coming at each other and were moving around.  There were 3 flying objects. They glowed like a red fire  glow.  The disc was red with Yellow in the middle band and red again on the outside. of object and Red in the center.  One object circled another and one stayed still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything this fast before.  They acted like they were watching us. I had a cashier from the Station with me and she got scared and went back into the store.  Another man was there he got totally freaked out and left the store.  I talked to a police officer, he was mad because he had missed this event as he always looks for these things on his patrol. He is the person that gave me your contact number.  I watched this from 9:30 to 10:15.  Two had flown away and one stayed there and started moving toward Phoenix.<n>

12/28/11 21:00|Chattanooga|TN|Fireball|15-20 minutes|Four glowing orange orbs float over the city|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87137.html|92|ndxe201112| Four glowing orange orbs float over the city<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone to bed early that night, 9:00 P.M.,  I was tired from work.  I had not yet fallen asleep when my two dogs started to growl and bark.  As I listened, one dog started to bark very loudly and was pacing rapidly all through the house.  My other dog, who NEVER barks or growls, began growling as if it were in extreme defesive mode.  I was still in bed and soon realized they were reacting to a dog outside and a few blocks away.  This other dog (outside) was freaking out so bad it sounded like it was being killed.  (This was included only because it got my attention. I am not saying the lights caused the dogs to bark, although it was very abnormal)  This got my attention and I turned over to look out my 4 ft. x 4 ft. window by my bed.  Up in the sky I saw an orange light. I was not wearing my glasses and the image was blurred, but I could immediatly see that it was unusual.  I stared, squintng, trying to adjust my focus thinking what the hell is it.  I ju! mped out of bed, grabbed my glasses, got back in bed, and watched. It hadn&#39;t moved.  I couldn&#39;t wrap my mind around it at first, I have been interested in UFOs my whole life, but to see one is mind bending!   First I deduced that it was not a reflection of light on my window as no lights were on in my house. Second, not a helicopter or plane or star or planet, this looked like it was a huge star that had come to Earth.  I was amazed, I leaned down to get a bigger view of the sky, as my roof eave was obstructing.  There was another!  I literally said &#34;Oh shit!&#34; I jumped up grabbed my phone and ran outside in my boxer shorts.  I live on a mountainside, three quarters of the way up to the top, with good views of thecity below.  Once outside I could see the huge clear open sky with FOUR round lights in a straight line! Just above the city to the left. I looked around and nobody was outside watching, I felt they should be so I let out a &#34;WHOOOO!!&#34; but no one heard.  The lights wer! e equally spaced, their height looked like they were level wit! h the to p of the mountain.  Which is not that high as the mountain is barely classified as a mountain.  The line of lights appeared as if it was around a mile long from the first light to the last but there really is no way to tell I guess. But they DID appear to be inside the semi-circular mountain range surrounding the city below. So to me they seemed close. I was unbelievably excited!  I stared at the lights trying to understand.  They were all the same.  I am assuming they were spheres,  because if they were discs or two dimensional circles they would have had to be facing me dead on because they appeared as a round circle of light.  The light did not glare as normal lights do. It seemed to be a ball of light that was contained within itself with a dull look almost like it was pulling in light instead of giving it off. there was no sound. There was movent within the orbs, I could not tell whether there were rotating lights inside or if there was a swirling effect and  changing co! lor from red to orange rapidly.  Basically it looked like four giant fireballs floating still in an evenly spaced long line.  I pointed my camera phone at one of the lights, all four would not fit in the frame, and took a picture. The result looked like a black sky.  I was frantic trying to fumble with my phone, I did not want to take my eyes off the lights.  I took another picture, my media storage had been reached and it did not let me save the second picture!! I couldn&#39;t believe it and did not want to waste time with deleting pictures.  By this time one of the lights, I do not remember which, started to  move slowly.  Maintaining the same distance, it moved into a triangular position with two other orbs forming an equal lateral triangle. T  he forth orb started to move slowly into position between two orbs and outside the triangle.  Seconds later all orbs moved simultaneously very slow from west to east right over the city. Anyone that looked up at that time would have seen them.  They passed over the city and &amp;#8206;Saturday, &amp;#8206;February &amp;#8206;11, &amp;#8206;2012phone. I realised I got a picture, it looks like a u-shaped light that is different colors. I put it on my computer and it&#39;s a little clearer, but my camera phone isn&#39;t great.  Although you can tell it is not a plane.  A few minutes later I actually called the police which I normally would not do.  I wanted to see if they had recieved any other calls about it.  He did not seem to care, although he did ask me a question or two.  I called my brother right after as the lights were headed towards his house, but he didn&#39;t see anything.  A couple of days later, I was on YOUTUBE and found a video: &#34;UFO OVER CHATTANOOGA 12/28/11&#34; the same date as my sighting.! The video shows exactly what I saw except ther are three lights.  This made me feel good to know that some one else saw them.  His location was the opposite of my view.  There is also a video of ufo over chattanooga that is a hoax, japanese candle balloons.  They don&#39;t even come close to what  I saw.  I have always read about UFO witnesses saying that it was liked nothing they had ever seen. Now I know what they mean. I am a capenter.<n>

At about 9:30 pm my daughter, who is only 8 yrs old, was looking out our bay window and asked me to come look at this yellow/orange light in the sky.  I said, oh it&#39;s probably just a helicopter but as I pulled back the drapes to reveal the enitre line of sight from the window, I was astonished to see that the sky was full of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were clearly moving and all of them seemed to be moving in the same direction, across the mountain from the SouthWest heading NorthEast.  The mountain we live on is some 2300 in elevation and the lights were not too far higher than that, but clearly above the mountain, as they passed over the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and his wife live next door and we called them to come out on the porch and look. They both witnessed the event as well.  My father (68) and myself (40) have lived on the mountain for most of our entire lives, on the brow of the mountain since 1980 and neither of us have ever experienced anything like what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked every night since and have not seen anything at all in the night skies other than distant planes and helicopters that rarely, if ever, come across the mountain.  Most all commercial flights into the city approach from the South (atlanta) and are visible way off on the horizon flying direclty north into the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested in recieveing some feedback about what we experienced.  I will go on and say that since this night, we have been watching a lot of internet and TV shows about UFO sightings and we found out experience very similar to the &#34;Lights Over Phoenix&#34; experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

The object was similar to cylindrical in shape and had what appeared to be landing legs protruding from the bottom of it.  The object remained in the location for less than one minute, as they turned another bend in the road, the object was gone.  They continued to watch for it, but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/28/11 15:00|Beacon|NY|Diamond|30-40 seconds|Huge and hanging right over the bridge entrance|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87416.html|96|ndxe201112| Huge and hanging right over the bridge entrance<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t want to be the first person to talk about this sighting so I’ve been scanning the net for the last 2 months hoping someone else would post about it.  This kind of thing makes you doubt your own sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving east on 84 headed towards Connecticut, about 5 miles back before the bridge, I had seen something strange. It almost looked like a derby hat hanging (I know goofy but that’s what it reminded me of) in the sky but from a “straight’ on perspective. I could see the bulge in the middle and then what sort of looked like a brim sticking out at the sides. It was weird but I was doing 75 mph and it quickly passed in and out of my field of vision because of mountains and hills that the road cuts through. By the time I got to the Bridge itself I had forgotten all about it. As the highway bears right, just when you’re approaching the bridge, I came around that bend and there in the Sky right above the highway was a massive object, I mean huge in relation to the bridge and the skyline behind it. I couldn’t just slam on the brakes because I was in traffic but I looked up as I went underneath it and it looked to me to be almost Diamond shaped and a matte gray, as I passed fr! om underneath I flipped up my rearview to see if I could see it more, but it was gone.. This all transpired in about 30 seconds. I know I wasn’t hallucinating because I looked around to see if anyone else was looking and the people in the cars around me were also looking up and then back at the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the Toll collector I asked her if she had seen it and she said “I finally saw one” she was beaming.. I asked her again because this is a very surreal experience, even for someone like me that has always wanted to see one. And she confirmed that it sort of came from nowhere and then just as suddenly disappeared.  The weirdest thing about it, it looked aquatic almost like a manta ray and had 2 black circles underneath that looked empty just black holes. It was completely still and silent, and really freaked me out... I wondered if it wasn’t a military craft as there’s  a base close and it was that color, but the woman at the toll booth seemed pretty positive it was a UFO.   I tried to snap a pic but all I got was the roofline of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were just south of Santa Barbara,  I was just taking pictures out the passenger window as we were moving south on the freeway.  I did not see this object until I went through my pictures later.  You can see a small dark spot between the ocean rigs, if you zoom in it is appears to be saucer shaped.    I have a great camera (canon 7d 18 megapixels) and I took several pictures of the coast and I can zoom into objects and see what they are like Helicopters, kites, airplanes, birds but this one I cannot explain.  If anyone can scientifically examine this closer please do.  I would be very interested to see if this is a flying saucer, UFO.<n>

They were freaked out claiming that there was a bright flash of light like a camera flash that filled up all four of the kitchen windows which are on opposite walls.  I told them it was probably lightening or a transformer as it was rainy and a bit windy but no power was out and nothing seemed amiss when I looked around outside moments later. I asked them if they heard anything and my oldest daugher and her cousin whom are pre-teens said there was now way it was lightening and it didn&#39;t make a sound.  They were so scared and told me that you couldn&#39;t even see out the window it was so bright.  I still insisted it was probably a transformer or lightening and they kept saying, no...it was like a camera flash and then it happened again lots of times.  The other strange things were the animals, they could have been se! nsing the fear in the kids but they refused to go down the stairs and came running up the first time with the kids; the cats were hiding upstairs...I don&#39;t know, but I still have chills and do not want to look outside my kitchen window at the field behind my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I found it odd that it didn&#39;t move and pulled over to the side of the road after making my turn.  I got out of my car to look at it and then noticed it was moving very slowly and then made a 90 degree turn away from me going North.  As it moved away it seemed to dim out like a flashlight on low batteries and then disappear into the night.<n>

The sky was blue with a lot of scattered fluffy white clouds, temperature was warm for December-in the 50&#39;s. All of a sudden I saw two reddish orange round objects.  They kind of looked like fireballs, but were traveling together.  They came down from the sky, hovered, moved to the left together-then shot back up into the clouds.  I was just sitting there while driving, with my mouth open in astonishment!  I wondered what the other people thought if they just saw the same thing I had!  It definitely did not look like anything I had ever seen before, in broad daylight.<n>

The glowing ball of yellow-white light was stationary for about 3-4 seconds then, it suddenly accelerated moving West to East over the mountain range.  Acceleration was very rapid and the object appeared to wink out at the end of sighting. This was not a comet or meteor entering the atmosphere.  The object was stationary for at least a few seconds before the rapid acceleration over the mountain range and it did have a tail or a trail behind it.  The object also was not a plane or a helicopter as it had no blinking lights, just solid lights, and the acceleration was incredibly fast from a stationary position, I would say several thousand miles per hour if I had to guess.<n>

Craft was close enough to be with in ear shot (flying at normally observed height range) but no sound (or very quiet for this matter) was emitted. A small private plane off in the distance confirmed that it (although much further away) displayed the traditional red, green and white light configuration. Moments later a much larger triangular craft at a higher altitude than previous craft started to come from the SW to NE direction appeared in sight. Upon spotting this brightly lit craft, I ran outside, my father also witnessing the very little sound, and clear triangular shape. The craft appeared to be rather large, with a flashing center red light and 3 bright white lights near the front and several bright white lights near the rear in a horizontal line.

Then we seen another one come straight out of the tree line in the same spot not zig-zag, but just slowly raise straight up.  Then a third one same spot raised up slowly, by this time the first one had almost disapeared.  Then the fourth alot closer to the third than the rest.  They all pulsated, no noise, really creepy.

12/26/11 21:15|Buffalo|NY|Formation|10 seconds|Four dimly lit triangular objects whistle as they pass low over Buffalo, NY|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86109.html|112|ndxe201112| Four dimly lit triangular objects whistle as they pass low over Buffalo, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were standing on the roof of a 10-story building at night, around 9:15 on December 26th (2011) in Buffalo, NY.  I noticed four dimly lit objects over the city, moving in a straight line from the direction of Lake Erie towards the northeast.  At first glance I thought these were the lights on the wings of a far away commercial aircraft, but appeared too low in the sky and were approaching too quickly. I noticed a corresponding whistling sound as they approached.  The sound was not unlike the sound from those whistling Nerf balls.  It was changing and varied, as if there were more than one Nerf ball sounding at once. It was not loud, but clearly audible.  I could then see that there were four separate objects.  They were black or dark gray, seemingly lit on the underside from the lights of the city. There was also the dim yellow light coming from each, probably coming from the leading tip of the object, because the light was less visible once th! e objects passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four objects were flying very near to one another in a flexible delta formation. The formation was like a small flock of birds; imperfect and changing, but they were moving inexplicably quickly with no visible wings.  I noticed them just before they were directly overhead, and were out of sight and earshot within 10 seconds.  I was not able to discern the shape clearly, but my best guess would be rounded triangles, similar to the “flying wing” design of the F117 Nighthawk. They all appeared identical to one another. As they passed, the sounds diminished accordingly, and I quickly lost track of them in the night sky.  Both my friend and I were duly creeped out and went back inside immediately.<n>

I ran in the house and got my husband and there were only 3 but as we watched the bottom one (3) move  towards the second one and then it was gone leaving only two that one moved towards the last one left and then they were all gone. it was the strangest thing because you thought maybe helicopter/plane but we could here no noise and by the time the third one disappeared into the second one we knew the second one was going to move towards the last one and disappear and sure enough that is what happened.  And you could ask yourself maybe it disappeared in a cloud but they were all plain as day and you could see it move and disappear the last one was there until the next to last moved towards and reached it.  I tried to take pictures but nothing on my digital camera I was sure I had taken pictures (maybe in the excitment I missed the button)<n>

The number is an approximate guess as a row of townhouses was in my line of sight just below the lights.  I positioned myself to make sure I wasnt just seeing ambient lights reflecting onto the house that appeared to be beneath the lights but as I did it became obvious the lights were indeed in the sky.  I brought my dog inside the house and called for my wife.  By the time she came outside,  I tried to point her at the lights but she was focusing on local air traffic.  Ilookid in the exact same spot I first saw the objects bt by this time only one was visible.  It disappeared before I could get my wife to see it.  I drove to a local spot with exceptional views for miles but saw nothing but standard aviation traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This triggered my attention, and I seemed to be more aware of the sky since it was so dark and there were no lights on I75.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15-20 minutes after I had noticed that the moon had completely disappeared I was driving and I saw a form maybe about 100-300 feet above the road going over my car.  It was large and in a diamond-square shape.  The corners of the object were illuminating a light blue color, and there seemed to be some sort of digital pattern on the bottom lighting up a light blue as well, but this section was more faint and the lighting was sporadic in different areas of the object.  There seemed to be a haze of blue around the object that seemed to be caused by a faint blue light lining the circumference of the form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be traveling very low to the ground and was moving slow (in relation to a car going about 75 MPH.)  It was moving in the opposite direction of me, going East.<n>

My wife and I were driving on highway 59 (also known as the Southwest Freeway) and we saw a bright stationary light in the sky almost directly in front of us.  The sky was generally clear with very few wispy clouds.  We watched it and noticed that it didn&#39;t seem to move at all, and was very bright- like a large star in the sky.  It was a white circular light, shaped like a circle.  after about 30 seconds, it seemed to turn into a thin grey diagonal line and then disappeared.  We kept searching for it, but it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this from the car headed on Highway 59 south, just north of Beltway 8 (also known as the Sam Houston Tollway).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The brightness of the object caught my eye and I originally watched as I thought this must be light reflecting off a plane however within 3 seconds the object had just disappeared. There was no contrail and the object appeared to be at an high altitude and in the distance so I heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, a brightly reflecting oval shape drew my attention when I stepped outside around 3:30 pm this afternoon in Albany, New York. The object was moving away from my vantage point and the object had vanished within 3 to 5 seconds of me noticing it and observing it directly as I originally thought it was a plane. I had fixed my gaze on the object as I believed it was so shiny due to the sun&#39;s reflection. The shiny decreased iinstantaneously into a blackish color as the object &#34;vanished&#34; into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was some kind of low flying plane or helicopter, but it was fuzzy in appearance and flaring outward in all directions. It moved slowly. Soon afterwards it flew directly over me, and behind the cloud deck off to the northeast. Next about 20 seconds later, I saw two more orange lights traveling in formation, heading on the same course as the first object.  The two objects appeared from the same direction, same course, same speed, and same altitude, flying in a single file pattern. As I tried to get a closer look at them, I noticed that each was a fuzzy, glowing, light orange ball or orb. They did not appear to have any solid noticeable center, and their outlines were faint and semitransparent (almost halo-like). These objects made no sound at all, had no beacons or flashing! lights on them, and just seemed to float along. Their speed would be equivalent to a small plane or helicopter. They were not moving very fast. But these lights were definitely not aircraft. I have no idea how large they may have been or how far away they actually were. What is interesting is that when the objects were directly overhead, I noticed a slight wobble and floating movement (strange propulsion), in which one of objects moved slightly away from the other one, slowing down for a moment and then speeding up again to meet back in formation with the other object.  After a few seconds they continued to travel at the same speed towards the northeast.  My thoughts were that these two strange orange orbs were following, or catching up with the first orange orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stared at it as it was flying smoothly and right above the houses. It was about 1500 ft away from me.  I saw red lights that was very bright and was not blinking just big red lights on the bottom of the object.  As it was flying it looked like it landing near a tree and I waited for another 5 min but it disappeared.  And there was no sound from this object either but I also thought I heard aircraft engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My friend and I thought they were stars at first, but then theyv started moving erratically. They move in one direction then back and the opposite direction and sometimes make a spiraling motion on the horizontal axis. They are there when night falls and they are there all night long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two nights ago I, my friend and his mother were observing the ufo&#39;s when I noticed a light blink on on the horizon. Upon closer inspection we saw that it was a small clam-shell shaped silver craft that we assumed to be an unmanned drone of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft have the ability to maintain a spatial position within the atmosphere (hover) they can move front to back, side to side, in zig-zags, in short they appear to have total and complete control over spatial movement within our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not have the resources ourselves to properly investigate this phenomenon but we would love to know what these craft are and encourage others to observe the night sky for stars that appear to be wiggling or moving in short straight lines and document everything you can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the meantime we will seek HD cameras and telescopes to investigate this phenomenon and we will share what we find.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was only one large round light on and the light pointing down appeared to be pointing straight ahead. My first thought was that it was a small plane getting ready to land.  As I had never seen a landing strip there I thought it was odd. As I got closer I realized the light was pointing straight down and not forward. I then realized the object was just floating there and I thought maybe it was a street lamp.  Then the other two round lights lit up. The dim one in the back flashed bright and then struggled to light up all the way.  This is when I really got a feel for the size of the object and it&#39;s height as the lights were large, spaced pretty far apart and appeared to be part of the same surface. I drove back by the spot the next day in search of a logical explanation. There were no lamps close to that height and in fact it was hovering directly over an empty field that I believe belongs to the ranch n! earby.<n>

I hollered for my wife who was in another room as I thought it might be a plane on fire.  I ran downstairs and on to our driveway as the object was approaching and passing directly over my house at about 1000 feet or so. (estimate)  The object was a fairly large glowing orange fireball with what appeared a &#34;hot&#34; white core.  It was not like any flame or fire I have ever seen before. It did not produce any smoke or emissions that I could see--the fireball was completely silent.  It was on a straight trajectory at a consisent speed of approximatley 15 mph---it appeared the flame was propelling its movement--I could no detect any mechanical structure around the flame---it was a clear, calm, starry night, and the flame emitted a rectangular shaped lit area around the top of it with what appeared some type of heat waves around the flame which were lit up againts the black sky! ---the fire was from three to ten feet in size...my wife also saw this fire from the window--she is from China and says she has never seen anythihng like it--that makes two of us.  I am very familiar with aviation, astronomy, meteors, and as a broadcaster and journalist for 25 years, I  am a keen observer.  This was not a Chinese lantern, a plane, a flare, a meteor, a hot air ballon, lightning, or a piece of debris.  I have seen similar descriptions on this website.  Please feel free to contact me to learn more.  I&#39;d like to learn more and find some answers. Thank you!<n>

About 15 minutes ago, I went out with my wife, into our back yard in Delray Beach, Florida.  Our back yard has another residence about 60 - 75 feet north of where we were standing.  I noticed what I thought was an aircraft to the north when two more bright red objects appeared over the roof of the residence to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the USMC air-wing.  I grew up studying aircraft of all types.  I know what they look like day, or night.  They were red and white, but not blinking steadily.  They appeared more like a twinkling between red and white, only far brighter than any navigational lights I&#39;ve ever seen.  I would have said they were fireworks, but fireworks don&#39;t fly off at an upward angle like these did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my wife&#39;s attention, saying: &#34;Look at that!&#34;, while pointing at the two new red objects.  They were gaining altitude and heading west at about a 25 degree angle from the horizontal.  They another one appeared over the roof.  And another, and still another.   There were six in all.  They weren&#39;t in any formation unless it was so staggered it didn&#39;t look like a formation, but they all originated at approximately the same place and all were on a relatively similar, but not exact trajectory.  After about 8 - 10 minutes they had disappeared one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my wife, Nor I have ever seen anything like these things, and I&#39;m familiar enough with all types of aircraft to know aircraft when I see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At air shows I can point at a B-17, tell that it&#39;s a G model, recall that there were just over 12,000 made and it has four Wright 16-20 1200HP engines and a crew of 10.  At one air show, a group of old timers were looking up asking what the aircraft were that were flying over at about 10,000 ft.  I looked up and told them they were OV-10s.  I&#39;ve met those that know more about aircraft than I do, but not too often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former USMC.  PD))<n>

I saw a orange sphere traveling across the horizon from west to east.  The object made no sound at all and moved much faster than the wind could carry it.  It was moving slower than a plane but fast enough for me to tell that it was being propelled by something. after about 15 seconds it disappeared. Then another one appeared in the western part of the horizon.  It took the exact same path as the first orb, and faded away in the east.  I observed a total of 5 of these orbs traveling across the sky in the same way. The person who told me to come outside saw a total of 7 orbs.  There were a total of 4 people that witnessed this. It was the weirdest thing that I have ever seen. I have been trying to figure out what these were.  There is no possible way that these were Chinese lanterns.  They were moving way too fast, and they were following a straight horizontal path.<n>

As we drove west up 11800 South (west of Herriman High School) toward Bacchus Highway, I noticed a large light in the sky. I wondered at first if this was an airplane, due to its brightness, however the object didn’t appear to move. It remained stationary in the sky, slightly elevated above the top of the mountain range.  I pointed it out to my spouse who could clearly see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light the entire time during our drive back home, about 15-20 minutes. The light was still visible by the time we arrived home. I quickly went inside to get my small video camera and went out onto the stairs behind our house. I was able to film the object for approximately 5-6 minutes. I am not very talented when it comes filming, so the video is shaky. I had to zoom out and in several times, but once I was able to locate it in the viewfinder I saw it fairly clearly. I watched the object as closely as I could. It appeared to grow larger and smaller, possibly brighter and dimmer, but always quite bright. When it appeared larger, I could just make out a smaller ball of more concentrated light in the center. I was able to film what appeared to be something solid moving across the front of the object from left to right, which obstructed the light. It reminded me a bit of a lunar eclipse, but the dark form blocking the light in front of the object wasn’t as big as t! he object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for about 5-6 minutes on camera, it gently dimmed and vanished. I waited with the camera rolling for about one more minute to see if it would come back, but it was cold and I decided to go inside without seeing it again. I checked outside several times that night to see if it had re-appeared, but I never saw it.  I have been looking for it every day since, and I haven’t seen it again.  I know there is other amateur video on YouTube of a strikingly similar object hovering over the same mountain range, yet filmed from Tooele, which is on the other side of the mountain range from where I filmed my object. The skeptic in me says it was some sort of extremely bright light they use at Kennecott for mining, but I’m fairly certain it wasn’t touching the mountain and I haven&#39;t seen it before in the five years we have lived out here. I would like to send in the video I shot, but I&#39;m not sure how to do that via email.<n>

As I&#39;m waiting, 2 cars stop in the middle of the road in front of my  house and both drivers get out of their car.  One dog did not have a leash and ran towards the people standing in the road. As I tried to corral my little Maltese, my neighbors frantically told me to &#34;look! look! Over there!!&#34;.  I turn to look what they are pointing at and there in the sky 182 degrees to the south of my house was 10 to 15 reddish/orange circular lights staggered vertically.  There was no sound, and it was obvious these were not from an airplane of any sort.  As we watched, slowly every light dispersed into the darkness over a minute and a half to two minutes.  There is not a single cloud in the sky tonight and what is most strange to me is the fact that they simply disappeared into thin air. They didnt dissapear behind trees, or clouds or simply because they were too far a! way but just.. vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had the chills since I&#39;ve been outside and they don&#39;t stop, this was truely a phenomenon and certainly something I&#39;ve never witnessed in my lifetime.<n>

She looked toward the north and noticed something and brought it to my immediate attention.  The object was a bright glowing red light with what seemed to be two yellow or orange colored lights that would fade into the red light from both sides suggesting that they were outer lights that were rotating around the bright red light.  The object moved in an eastbound direction for about three to four (3-4) minutes, then stopped and hovered in place for about another minute or two, then moved toward the northeast into clouds and faded into the clouds which took about another minute.  No further visual of it was seen after.  During the time of us witnessing the sighting, we heard no sounds.  We also called her son outside who also witnessed it moving into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It continued to move slowly and it gradually faded away.  The two red lights were very small but a roundness could be seen.<n>

At that moment I could see what had obviousy there all the time.  To the left of the car a huge space ship hovered over the trees.  I could only see it for the duration of the light from the lightening.  I wondered if I really saw it and shook my head.  At that time my neice yelled OMG!  I kept driving.  Some of the ship purtruded into the road.  It was a metalic with lights in front and stories as a high rise would have.  It was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear, cloudless, moonless night. As we faced the west (with the big dipper behind us) both of us saw what at first seemed to be a slowly falling star coming from behind us moving slightly NW. But as it travelled in front of us, we could see it was flying, not falling, across the sky toward the horizon, from a higher altitude to a lower altitude (eg: cruising altitude to incoming altitude).  It was a round ball of white light followed by a tail (it was not connected to the light).  The tail had blue tint and was very long, appearing like a vapor.  The tail was the width of the light at the beginning and gradually fanned out about three times the width. It looked like a comet would look if my son and I were in outer space observing it from approx 1- 2 miles away. It made no sound, but both of us felt as if we heard something.  At the same time, we both admitted that we felt what we heard, as if it came from within us - my son articulated it best saying it was the &#34;energy&#34; of what we saw that affected our senses.  To me it felt/sounded like a whoosh. To my son, he sensed a rumbling.  The light and the tails intensified as it flew, seeming to glow. It did not fade or fall. It simply disappeared<n>

When I pulled up my street on my way home I noticed a glowing light above Norad that I had never noticed before. At first I thought it might be a helicopter or something because it was just hovering there.  I couldn’t make out any kind of shape the whole thing illuminated and had a kind of yellowish orange glow to it.  I only saw it for about 20 seconds and then it took off.  It had a trail of light behind it kind of like when you see a shooting star and then it was gone.  I’m not sure what it was but when I walked in my house I said that either I just saw Santa Clause or a UFO but both sound kind of crazy.  I just hope maybe I can find some answers because it was definitely interesting.<n>

Lots of angles, silver or grey in color.  It merged from one to three lights, maybe off and on, or maybe even zig sagged.  It was definitely a craft without sound, and moved extremely slow.

It continued to do this for 15 minutes.  Then a helicopter which appeared to be a military helicopter showed up from the north and the object dropped in altitude and very quickly headed east.  While the object was in site it would remain visable for a minute or so then disappeared and re-appear in  a different location. We did take photographs  of the object and upon zooming in we see a few different things.  In one picture when zoomed in the object is a purple (like the purple from a black light) circle (kinda looks like a blood cell under a microscope) there is a light purple haze around the object.  In another the object is the same color but is long and narrow in the front and has spheres at the rear.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move how this object moved and then for it to t! ake off when a helicopter came near seemed strange.<n>

From 22.00 hours onwards and from 10.000 feet upwards on different tracks and altitudes.  Their appearances are different from conventional aircraft moving along the sky since no strobe lights or anti-collision lights are visible (not even with binoculars magnifying 20 X) and no sounds are heard.  The lights are frequently switched on or off.  When off, you will see a small speck of light moving along.  Their speeds are that of a normal jet aircraft or slightly higher and they don’t seem to follow the normal air routes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to the correct date.

He could see the lights reflecting off the trash can.  He turned around and saw a very large round object swaying in the sky. He described it&#39;s movement as a fish swimming in water. He ran in the house for us to come out quick and look at this thing in the sky. My mother and I ran outside and saw the object. My husband informed us that it is much further away at this point.  It was like NOTHING I have ever seen before. Definitely no flying craft I&#39;ve ever witnessed before.  It changed from purple to green to red to blue and swayed in the clear night sky. It went from up and down, side to side and did loops within seconds. It looked like a fiber optic light. It was not blinking it changed colors from one into the other. I made my husband run in the house to get a camera, by the time he came back out it looked like it landed f! ar away in the distance maybe toward the West Mesa. It was a trip, I still almost can&#39;t believe what I saw. Neither can my husband or my mother. Something I will never forget!<n>

Immediately we noticed a very bright red light in the sky.  It pulsated and moved very slowly, and then changed direction multiple times.  We were sure it was not a planet or star. Both of us had never seen a craft that dimmed and brightened like that in the sky. There was no audible noise coming from it, but it looked to be high in the sky.  It lasted until we left.  We joked that it was Rudulph the Reindeer&#39;s nose flashing in the sky, but we really don&#39;t have any explanation for it.<n>

I immediately run outside with my binoculars (being a ufo freak) and in a matter of a minute I see a long bar like shaped craft.  Moving extremely oddly in the sky almost cloaked with the darkness of the sky, with lights all along the entire craft. A plane that flew by about 3 minutes afterwards was about the size of one, of  the lights on the craft in size comparison. The craft had about anywhere from 8 to 16 lights all along it. That where each about the size of a regular plane. When I confronted my girlfriend, she explained the same thing only it moved its lights into a triangle formation before it was too far in the sky for her to see anymore. Like i said, the craft was almost cloaked to blend with the sky and wasn&#39;t noticeable, unless you looked at the right spot in the sky at the right time.<n>

The object was &#34;outlined&#34; in blue and violet lights.  As it was traveling just above tree level and passed directly overhead, we could see that it was actually changing shape, and it was making no noise what so ever.  I watched through a set of binoculars as this object began to change both shape and altitude, more closely resembling a snake or a string of christmas lights serpentining it&#39;s way through the sky as it gained altitude. The witnesses included myself, a housewife and mother, my mother who works for a prominent surgeon in the area, and my father, an established businessman in the area.  This same object was also seen by my husband from his location at our home, several blocks away from my parent&#39;s house<n>

We were about 5 minutes from their home when I noticed a diamond shape of 4 red orbs in the night sky.  They were much farther away than planes or clouds, but much closer than stars.  I pointed the orbs out to my husband and both of us were confused about what we were seeing.  We arrived at my parents’ home, watching the red orbs during the entire drive.  When we reached their driveway, my husband ran inside to get my parents to come outside and look at what we were seeing.  I pulled out my phone to take pictures and got out of the car for a better look.  As I pointed my phone toward the sky I realized I couldn’t see the red orbs on the camera of my phone.  When I looked away from my phone and back at the sky, one of the 4 orbs was gone…there were only 3 left.  I decided to stare at the orbs and watch what they! did, rather than try to take pictures.  As I was staring at the orbs, each one faded out to black – they didn’t move around the sky, they just “turned off,” so to speak.  My husband and parents did not make it outside in time to see them…they had disappeared by that time, in a matter of maybe 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been searching the internet for answers since this happened, but didn’t think to report the occurrence until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory on 06/20/12, when he discussed this happening more frequently across the country since June of 2011 – and he was describing something very similar to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.  I look forward to an explanation…if one ever comes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound , no lights. The only light was what was reflecting off the craft from the streetlights and such on the ground. This happened near the intersection of county line rd and rte.309.

As I was driving down my street to my house, I saw 6 orange lights in the sky.  I was thinking at first they were Christmas lights someone had figured out how string high up in the sky across the street, but realized they were too high to be hung using the telephone poles.  My next thought was that they were strung somehow using the church steeple on one side; but couldn&#39;t figure out what was holding them up on the other side of the street.  I parked my truck, walked to the top of the driveway. I was planning on walking down to the church (1 block down) to see how they had strung the light across the street.  When I got to the top of my driveway, only 3 lights were left in the sky.  Not only that, but they were no longer crossing the street, they were now hovering over the homes one block up to the left.  I walked a couple houses up to get a better look. I realized the lights were forming a triangle! shaped object.  Then I realized I could acutally see the object against the dark sky.  It was a long, thin triangle about the size of the block it was hovering over.  It was also completley silent.  It was hovering and then began a lazy spin.  The tip of the triangle was spinning away from me.  I saw the two base corner lights.  The right base light faded, then the left base light.  It seemed to take a long time for the left base light to fade out.  When I realized there was an actual triangle shaped object hovering over the block of homes, I also realized that I must have first seen two triangle objects over the street.  I also realized that this meant the tips of the triangles were in the middle of the street, the bases on either side.  That is the only way to describe the lights I saw across the street.  Two vertical from each other on either side and two in the middle of the street.  I looked around to see if there was anyone else in the street who might have seen this! as well, and of course, there wasn&#39;t.  Neither did a car pass! by duri ng this time.  The area where I saw the triangle hovering is a quiet block of homes, however, the street they face is a pretty busy local street.  I would be surprised if I was the only one who saw this.  I&#39;m going to listen to the 10:00 news to see if anyone else reported this, but that&#39;s probably futile.  I also know there are two airfields in the immediate area. One is Lambert Airfield, the other is Scott AirForce base.  I do remember a few years ago (8 or so maybe?) there was a report of a UFO that made the news on the Illinois side of the river.  I cannot identify what I saw, but I know I saw something I&#39;ve never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Anyway, the lights were moving it the sky.  As I pulled up to my driveway I looked behind me as I pulled in and saw another light and it faded into the sky very slowly in the same spot.  Then about 3 minutes later, I saw the same type of orange light and it looked like it came from the ground and proceeded to go higher in the sky and just slowly went higher in the sky and then disappeared again.  I heard no fireworks blowing off or any sounds at all that resembled fire works.  I believe that this lights could have been UFO.<n>

According to my computer, the photo was taken at 11:49 am local time. (This time seems right to me because I remember we were there in the late morning.) I haven&#39;t edited the photo in any way - this is the raw image I downloaded from my digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I briefly visited the geyser as tourists. We didn&#39;t notice anything unusual in the sky at the time and we didn&#39;t hear any unusual noises. I only noticed this strange object when I later uploaded the photo from my camera phone (an iPhone 4) to my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that we were both distracted at the time because we were watching the geyser itself, which makes hissing and splashes noises as it shoots hot water from underground. There were several other tourists there and from memory they were all acting normal. I don&#39;t remember anyone pointing out anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several other photos of the geyser and several short videos. The object does not appear in any of the other photos or the videos. Interestingly, the image I have emailed you is time-stamped as exactly 11:49:05 on my computer. The next photo I took is time-stamped 11:49:08 (which I assume means it was taken anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds later). The object is nowhere to be seen in that next photo, even though I took it from the same standing position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For this reason I really doubt that this object is dirt or grease on the camera lens. The object also appears to be reflecting the sun, so I believe it was something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose this could be a helicopter or other aircraft or even a bird or bug, but the explanation isn&#39;t obvious.<n>

Sky was dark, pre-dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:45am on the morning of 12/24/2011 I was in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I noticed a bright deep blue light in the NNE sky.  As I watched, the light seemed to dance, circling and turning, rising and falling, and changing color from a bright deep blue to a bright vibrant red.  The light appeared to stretch and change shape (elongate) briefly as it changed color and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the object to be quite some distance from my location so I was unable to determine the size/shape of the light.  Nor could I hear any sounds emanating from the light. The changes in direction however were precise and deliberate.  From my perspective the light seemed to be traveling very fast and change direction using a VERY tight radius. The light would change color from blue to red and then back to blue. There were NO “blinking” lights associated with this light, and on occasion the light seemed to disappear only to reappear in another similar area but traveling in a different direction.<n>

As I drove under Interstate 75 I noticed a very large Brite shimmering light to the east, slightly southeast.  As I approached my turn on Lena rd I realized this object was changing colors rapidly from red to blue to green to yellow and pulsating.  It was hovering like a helicopter but much too large.  I drive a jeep and had the top off so had a very good view of this object.  I turned onto Lena rd and pulled off the west side to observe the object.  It stopped pulsating and began to change from one solid color to the next. It was silent and appeared to expand in size as I watched it for appx 3 minutes.  A fog bank came off the dairy farm and put a stop to my view of this object.  I started my jeep back up and began to head south on Lena rd hoping to get past the fog to view object again,  When The sky lit up with a white flash. Object was gone when I waa in a spot where I would be able to see i! t again.  Anyone (100&#39;s of cars/people)traveling on I75 or East on rt64 had too see this.  It was HUGE!!! I told no one of this. 0331exmc<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Well I saw it again this morning, this time in the Western sky over the gulf of mexico. Same object but much, much farther away. This time I was able to view it through binoculars for appx 30 minutes. Actually got my wife out of bed and made her watch it with me. I am a little freaked out as to what the heck this was. This time with the aid of 16x32 power and also 7x50 power bino&#39;s I was able too observe many, much smaller points of light dance all around the larger object. The large object again pulsated and changed from red to blue to green to yellow. It Appeared to remain stationary for the 1st 20 minutes of observation as the smaller red and blue points of light danced all around the large object. Had too be at least 10 to 12 of them but they were so fast and erratic in their movement that it was hard to confirm an exact count. After ap! px 20 minutes the small points of light just merged into the Large object and it slowly began to drift up and to the south. From my location/angle it appeared to rise in the sky about a foot and drift to the south about 4 feet. Then it just dissappeared like someone turned off a light. No flash, No nothing, just there one second gone the next. So now my wife and I are both freaked out a little and as we take our dogs for their morning walk as I proceed to tell her about my Dec 23rd sighting that occured the previous morning. Same object without the little light&#39;s dancing and much, much closer/larger. When we got home from walking the dogs I went back outside to see if anything had returned to the area in the sky we saw the object. Saw nothing at first but then I thought I might be seeing some twinkling lights around the same general area in the sky. Looked through the Bino&#39;s and saw 2 Military jets flying all around the area flying larger and larger circles. The scale of th! e jets were that of the small dancing light making the scale o! f the la rger object HUGE!!! This went on for appx 25mins then they headed out over the Gulf of Mexico out of site. Just like yesterday someone else had too see this. Any body looking to the west towards the Gukl around the same time could not have possibly missed these lights. They were very distinct and Bright. 0331exmc<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it might be a hang-glider or a big kite.  It seemed to be a swept back arc with a darker front edge just floating north above Oakland towards Lake Merrit.  No lights, not fast moving.. balloon?  Giant Condor?  I could not of course tell how high it was, but I got the feeling it was a couple of thousand feet up.  Anything less would not explain the size of the thing.<n>

I was up early this morning becuase I did not plug in my vehicle and it is 15 below at this time. I went outside my cabin at 0200 hours to plug in my Jeep. It is a crystal clear night and I always take the time to observe the sky when it is clear.  As I was outside, I noticed something that I have not seen before. It seemed to be a bright orb like object that was either flikering or pulsating blue and red lights. It seemed like it was hovering over the tanana river.  It was kinda jerky in movement. It would hover with that jerky like motion for a while, then would clearly move. When I say clearly move, what I mean is that may cabin is surrounded by tall spruce trees, and as it would move I would have to relocate to see thru the trees.  It would move and then hover with that jerky like motion. Not a sound. clearly pulsating blue and red lights. Initi! ally it scared the crap out of me once I realized that I could not rationalize what I was looking at.  I went inside, locked my doors, and turned on my outside lights. after about ten minutes, I went back outside and it was still in the same general area, doing the same thing I observed before.  As I write this, it is 0246 hrs and it is clearly still out there. It seems to be over the river at a angle of about 20 degrees above the horizon.  I tried to call the state Mufon Rep that lives about fifty miles from here in Nanana but did not have any luck.  I then called the assistant state rep and was able to leave a message as I was observing the object.  There was a second object noticed in a different location, but I focused on the one that I was able to clearly see.  The Fairbanks International Airport is a few miles accross the river and I observe aircraft on a regular basis and am familiar with there flight patterns and charactoristics. This was no aircraft. The last time I went! outside to check, I did see a obvious aircraft flying at a hi! gher alt itude. They are still there.<n>

12/23/11 22:58|Grass Valley|CA|Other|9 minutes|Red lights shining on a black or invisible flying/stationary object.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85948.html|200|ndxe201112| Red lights shining on a black or invisible flying/stationary object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2258 hours I was driving heading South West on Hwy 49 coming down the mountain from Gold Flat/Ridge Road, I saw a flying object threw my front windshield with three constant red lights hovering in the sky close to the ground above tree tops.  It would stop then move toward me in a slow fluid motion then stop move toward me then  stop again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Taking the Hwy off ramp at Brunswick Road I waited at the stop light, and when it turned green turned left heading over the bridge East.  It seemed to me the stationary craft was very close to my destination so I decided to check it out.  I turned right on to Plaza Drive drove past the Flyers gas station.  At this moment I saw the craft start to move so I stopped in the road behind Perko&#39;s diner, shut off the engine, turned off the head lights, and got out of the vehicle, and stood behind the door.  The craft now had three lights but as it turned it revealed a forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a complete 340 degree turn like a glider would (no sound) in a 20 foot diameter.  My approximation of distance is 300 yards, 170 feet from ground, over a wilderness area, (using the local cedar  trees as a guide), and only blackness between the red lights.  The lights made a X like any respective airplane would, and one was clearly definable as the front since motion forward stayed with that light.  From my estimation the lights were 20 feet apart, and they did not illuminate what they were attached to.  It was only 20 feet above the cedar tree tops, and completed its turn ending heading in a North East direction. It  looked to me that is was traveling at 2 Mph top, in a slightly lowering altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Losing sight of it behind trees I did not see it a gene. I did try to relocate it by estimating the drop speed, speed, and direction, but was unsuccessful.  Note- there is a local air port in the direction it was heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have gone threw a mired of emotions and thoughts about this. I have questioned myself over and over, on what exactly I had seen. The main point I keep reminding myself is that most of the time I watched this craft it was fixed motionless in the sky, and to the best of my knowledge we do not have that ability on our air craft. Second was the silence, it made no noise at all, and the traffic noise that might have masked that was almost nonexistent.  I will have to recall this account, and the main thing I will recall is that I can only classify what I saw as a unidentified flying object.<n>

This craft seemed to pace the flow of traffic as we traveled north bound just prior to Acton CA a small township community which rest in a small bowl like valley.  At arms length this craft seem to be approx. the size of a standard house large ceiling air vent, at 500 feet high over the freeway.  The craft gave off a brillant array of white/ red/ (blue/green) colors.  I noticed a large spot light type light in front and to the rear of the craft, which may or may not be the direction of travel of this craft, as when I first noticed UFO it traveled in a north by north/west direction, within a split second it shot northbound out of sight approx. 1/4 mile only to return over our car in less than a second.  I open my sun roof in our ML-350 Mercedes Benz, and lost sight of the craft for a second or two but noticed the craft seemed to ! be pacing our car, I should make mention this SUV/ML-350 has radar function which may of helped the craft pace our car in the begining of the sighting and just prior to speeding forward the 1/4 mile, again hard to tell because of the octagon shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moreover, the spotlight in the front and end of the craft always remain on, the circumference of the craft displayed red lights over box like windows which were white, blue lights circled the craft.  This craft then traveled in a north/west direction and gave the appearance of rest on top of a medium size hill 1 &amp; 1/2 miles away.  In conclusion, I have a history of childhood UFO abduction, inside the craft which was investigated by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, 1973 inturn my case was transfered to (MUFON) Beverly Hills, CA Mufon Chapter, investigators the Late Idabel Epperson and her investigator daughter Marylin Epperson. Finally, it should be noted in 1964/67 while serving my country as a United States Marine, Camp Pendleton, San Diego, CA I was subjected to a (MILABS) experience, along with other Marines, as we were taken via military bus with blacken windows &amp; black curtains over the black painted windows. We went to a desert location where a UFO craft was housed.<n>

The two distinct lights eventually separated and continued to travel towards the ESE and gaining altitude.  Shortly after the lights separated, approximately 12 more lights came over the horizon following the same path.  At this point, I grabbed my camera to started taking photos.  After the main cluster of lights faded off at a much higher altitude than where they started, two more stray lights came over the horizon and followed the same path.

When i was driving i first saw it. It was emitting a huge white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds of looking at it it shot up about 5 thousand feet in the sky in about .2 seconds. It wasnt high in the sky.  Pron no more than 7,000 feet.  There werew clouds out and it was in front of the clouds.  It moved very smoothly like it somehow controled the gravity around it.  It had cycles of where it was bright white to where it was yellowish/red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you where looking up in the  sky it was a little below the tree line and above the horrizon. I also saw planes flying toward it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes must have been 1/100 of the size of the obeject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after about 40-45 min the light dimmed and I saw it vanish .<n>

Next a second bright light appeared. The two sphere shaped glowing lites began to &#34;dance&#34; with eachother in the sky (not very high up.)  They swirled around almost like in crazy eight patterns.  They continuously changed colors from lavendar, to blue, to pink, as if going thru the whole color spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of this dancing motion, one at a time they shot off in an arc into the distance and disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As she was driving to my house. When she arrived, I went outside and looked in the sky and observed two bright orange lights, larger than the brightest star visible, basically hovering in the sky above the Beacon Hill of Hillyard. One object was perfectly still in the southern part of the sky while the other object moved slowly and silently from east to west then stopped and went straight up into the sky until it disappeared.  The object to the south remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 seconds later, another bright orange ball appeared out of the East at what appeared to be a very low altitude and appeared to be heading right towards us. There was absolutely no sound associated with it. People were pulled over in their car and a man came running over to me asking if I was seeing what he was seeing. I grabbed my digital camera and attempted to video the event but could not get anything recorded. I was able to get some still pictures of the last object before it and the object to the south disappeared.<n>

My friend said it was probably a star popping through a clearing in the clouds, so we watched for a couple seconds. The light returned and appeared as a brilliant white spotlight which at first we took to be a helicopter,until the light blinked out and instantly a triangle formation of bright white lights flared on,the whole object appeared to move to the left at an unbelievable rate of speed and vanished.  There was no sound that we heard and whatever it was it was close enough that we should have heard something.<n>

We were driving south on S.W. Del Rio blvd thru and upper lower to lower middle class neighborhood on the way to the restaurant  which is on Port Saint Lucie blvd at the end of S.W.Del Rio blvd.  About half way thru out our trip we all noticed three very intense pulsating lights in a evenly spaced horizontal line about 45 degrees above the horizon to the right side of the road we were on.  There seem to be a fourth object more to the right of the other and farther away because its light was smaller and deep red. As we drove closer, I turned right down a side road to roll down the window and turn of the car to see if they made any sound.  The three lights were pulsating red, magenta, pink and sometimes white in the center.  They  seem to be less then a mile away at the closest time and made no sound and no smoke. The night sky was mostly clear with a few small patchy clouds.  As we watched the three lights were all moving in a left to right (west) direction and then rearranged themselves into a triangle shape (two on top and one on the bottom).  The forth was moving farther away and getting harder to see as it went behind a small cloud.  The three lights stayed in a triangle shape for about 45 seconds while moving to the west together.  Then one at a time each light went father away about 45 degrees up and to the south towards a small cloud that was lighter then the sky so I could see that there was no other structure connected to the light i.e. wings or balloon etc.  One at a time they apparently followed the path of the fourth light but the three went thru the cloud and I noticed as each one would then become just a dim red light as distance and the cloud thickness changed its intensity.  The cloud was beginning to dissipate as the last light went thru it.  I waited to see were they would come out from the other side, but they never did.  I could see all ar! ound top and bottom of this now very small cloud and saw none of the red lights emerge out from behind the cloud.  About 45 seconds later a small airplane was flying a vector from the south east to the north west and was at the same level of the small cloud. I waited to see if the plane would fly in front or behind of the cloud, It flew behind it so I could gage that the plane was no more then 2 miles away when it  was behind and next to the cloud.  The plane lights were ver familiar looking and very different from the 4 lights.  Furthermore, after 2 days of thinking about it I had never seen lights any where every that looked like the 4 we saw.<n>

All the dogs stayed by to door so I decided to go out and see what was going on.  I walked past our deck and saw the ship.  It flew right over my house just above the trees.  The object was the legth of a football field with the width of about 30 feet and it did cast a shadow flying over.  The front of the object was flat divided in 3 rectangles which lit up by white neon outlining the ship.  The side of the ship was also lit up in white neon with 18 rectangles in total again the top 6 rectangles were smaller than the bottom 12.  Bottom of the ship was dark black with neon white outline.   The back of the object looked the same as the front.  The object made no noise but was moving very fast.  Had no visible means of propolsion.  I live close to Intercontinental Airport and you can see the jet propolsion at night.  As soon as the object passed over the dogs went ou! t in the yard, I stayed up to see if another one was passing by but nothing and went to bed around 4:00 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My partner was letting the dogs out into the backyard and as he exited the house he right away noticed lights in the sky moving from NW to SE.  He took an image with his cell phone of the five objects in a formation.  He then looked up and saw 2 more objects move in fast (from the NW) to join the first five.  He re-entered the house to alert me to come out and look.  We went out the front door and to the front yard where we looked to the SW and saw the objects hovering in formation low in the sky.   The 6th and 7th object were hovering to the low right of the first five.  Some of the first five objects (or lights on one object) now started fading/ disappearing.  An 8th object came (from the NW) and slowly moved along the area where the others were now fading/ disappearing.  Then it too disappeared.  I took one 30 second cell phone video and my partner took 3 of them.  One of his shows the 7 objects and o! ne of his shows the final 8th object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving in a steady line, rising like an aircraft gaining altitude. The color of the light was not the standard aviation red, but an orange color, with a tinge of white, that flickered rather than strobed. It was not a color typically produced by electric lights or LED&#39;s. At first I thought it was Mars, but it was too bright and it was moving. About an inch behind it (from my perception) there was an intermittent white flash - a tiny light the size of a satellite, but following the orange light. As the orange light rose, it began to fade and eventually disappeared, as did the white light. I also caught a red light of the same size as the white light flash only once. This was a standard aviation/LED red and could have been an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
12/22/11 20:00|Palestine/Elkhart|TX|Unknown|continuous|It both amazes and agravates me that no one in my area has reported or talked about the strange red and white lights in the sky at nigh|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86005.html|224|ndxe201112| It both amazes and agravates me that no one in my area has reported or talked about the strange red and white lights in the sky at night, when the sky is clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported several weeks ago, and I followed it up with a phone call a few days later.  I was told what I had seen was not a UFO, but no other explanation was given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen as many as ten of these objects in the skies on several occasions, and they are NOT stars, airplanes, satellites, Northern Lights, Southern Lights or anything I have encounted in my 65 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned, I have seen as many as ten of these objects in a matter of only a few minuts, as they do not normally move a lot.  They normally remain in a particular area of the sky and make circular movements, and travel both vertically and horizontally for short distances, and remind me of a kite flying in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects always have a red light and a white light and at first glance one might think they were a star.  Upon closer examination and observance, you will discover they are definitely not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in east texas and I can travel ten miles to the nearest city to me and observe the objects all during the short excursion.  I have to be careful not to cause a traffic accident on the highway while observing the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have, on occasion seen the red light turn briefly to blue and a short time later it returns to red again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually the red light sits atop the white light, but I have on occasion seen the opposite with the red on bottom and white on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once saw two of these objects which appeared to be reasonably close to the ground, one in the south and one in the west.  As I was watching the two, the one from the south began to move very quickly to intercept the one in the west.  As they drew near, they both went black for a few seconds and then the one from the south disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are we so complacent and apathetic that we just do not want to get involved?  Or could it be that we are afraid of what people might think of us if we report this strange occurence?  Whatever the reason, I am perturbed about the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion this could be our military using equipment which is not widely known to the public, or this could be actual and very real UFO&#39;s from elsewhere in the vast universe in which we live.  I cannot believe another country has invaded our air space and our military  knowing nothing of it.  I also cannot believe the military would not be aware of strange objects in the skies for at least the past six weeks in my area of the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the hell is going on here?  Does anyone care?  Have there been too many sightings which turned out to be something natural and explainable that we now just assume this is a hoax or the rantings of an nut? I assure you that I am not a UFO freak, and the report in November to this organization was the first ever for me as I had never encountered anything to report until that time.  This is my second report, and I expect this to get as much attention as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have a camera capable of capturing the images of these objects, but I am sure someone in my area would have that equipment.  Why not call someone who can investigate and take snaps or footage of the objects so we could learn what is going on?  I do not know any scientists or astromomers and I do not intend to go to the local high school and ask the science teacher to bear witness that what I am seeing is, indeed real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t take me seriously, but one day I will look back and say:  &#34;I told you so back in November of 2011.&#34;  Are we so prideful and arrogant that we believe, in this day and age, that we are the only possible life form capable of intelligence and the ability to travel beyond our own planetary system?  If this is the case, then heaven help us when we learn the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose this could possibly cause a panic if we learn that we are not alone in the universe, but to ignore the possiblity is unforgivable in my opinion.  Will someone please investigate these objects and expain to the rest of us what they are?  Please?<n>

The orbs definently weren&#39;t any aircraft I&#39;ve seen before, they moved as if they were floating in the sky without a care.  Moving left to right and then progressing up with ease definently told me these weren&#39;t  normal aircraft.  The colors were of an amberish orange, almost like an oranger darker sun but still very bright.  Shape wise I would say they were circular orbs, we almost thought they were stars at first but then we saw the movement.  Not only did me and my girlfriend see them but we got my mom, sister, and her friend to come out and look at them and they all were astonished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They just slowly progressed up to the sky not in any pattern, other than kinda of a ladder formation where one was higher than the other and so forth, where the last two at the lowest to earth passed by eachother as if they were going to combine but didn&#39;t and stayed relatively on the same plain line as they progressed up.  These orbs slowly dissapeared into the sky as they progressed higher slowly flickering in and out of light then completely gone, but what I find most interesting is four of the orbs dissapeared generally low while the fifth orb that was higher than the others from the start of taking off, continued to fly the highest and was the last to be seen.  Figuratively this all lasted about 15 to 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a &#34;UFO&#34; and I was quite intrigued. I&#39;ve always been interested in extraterrestials and the unexplained since I was a kid but I never really had experience with the subjects, just kind of spectating on the side from what I would hear and see.  But once I saw those orbs I knew for sure there&#39;s way more I don&#39;t know about this world and it sparked an interest in me to see what else is out there and if this occurence was common or not.  What I found was that it wasn&#39;t something new, this occurence has happened all over the world for a few years now.  Ever since then I&#39;ve been looking at youtube every other day for new sighting caught on tape, as well as theories of extraterrestials and the new coming age of enlightenment. I&#39;m excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, lastly I have noticed alot of aircraft flying over Boise recently, especially military helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was around 7  P.M. Dec. 22nd, 2011. We looked over the horizon and noticed a red circle of bright light in the sky. As it flew up it would shift in color to an orange glowing orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked back to the point of origin and another red one was coming. As it flew up it also shifted into an orange glowing orb. This would happen six more times until there were 8 total glowing orange orbs or circles in a diagonal formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 20 other observers with cell phone cameras gazed on what we were experiencing.

Temperature: approximately mid forties degrees F.. Wind speed about 5mph - omnidirectional (changing directions occasionally from NW towards due W with occasional breeze from a Southwesterly direction)- perhaps MVR visibility (NOAA reference).<n> <n><n> <n><n> EVENT SUMMARY: Event occurred from 18:57 hours to about 19:12 hours EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a brilliant, sharp blue light - ironically the exact color as an illuminated blue Christmas tree bulb / house bulb - drop rapidly from the sky and execute manuevers at low altitude that I can only describe as being like the irradic flight of an insect (a housefly perhaps). The object dipped in and out of the cloud deck several times - on several occassions perhaps even coming down to ground level -as it disappeared during those moments behind the distant tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was joined by a second identical object - and both objects dipped up and down in flight - occasionally going above the cloud deck to dip back down to extreme low altitude. The objects later returned to above the cloud deck - only occassionally to peak to a visible position just below the deck as they appeared to move more towards the southwest - and away from my range of vision. The objects were not fireworks - nor were they any form of conventional remotely controlled vehicle that I am aware of, as their speed of manueverability was outstanding, and unbelievable, almost surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were distant - about approximately between 1/5th and 1/3rd miles away from my position on South Main Street. They were to the South West of my position. The objects appeared only to be brilliant, sharp lights - as I could not see a superstructure or siluetted outlined around them - I assume as a function of distance. The objects were strictly vibrant / electric blue, and no other color - with the exception that they appeared to become of a lighter tone from time to time, particularly as they positioned themselves at low altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would suggest that you please cross reference this sighting with other sightings from this general area - on this date - for validation, and that you should also make inquiries to local police departments and local airports concerning any possible phoned reports that may have been recieved - as I am positive that I could NOT have been the only observer.<n>

I called my friends (2) people and they both are watching. The shape is a mix of traingle and diamond (it is very high) it looks like it has 3 spikes coming off a side. There seems to be some type of strand of light that retracts, it goes out and back in from what seems to be the back side. It has lights that flash every 20 seconds or so on all sides at different times. Whaite, Red &amp; Blue. The whole &#34;thing&#34; is lit like a star. I cannot determine shape. At first I thought it was a satellite but satellites don&#39;t move like this. It has gone in all different directions. Slowly and VERY quickly, to complete stop. I feel crazy but I have NEVER seen something like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Very bright, much bigger than flight light I have ever seen.   It stayed there for almost 1 hour. I called my sister and her husband, and 2 other people near my place. We kept looking, so long that made our neck tired.  I managed to make some photos on my blackberry hand phone, but now the hand phone is not working and still to get it repaired now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was a UFO, no doubt about that, Actually it was the second time I saw, first time  around the same date, Dec 23, 2010 about the same time, as I came to Padang for new year. I was in the car with 2 friends.  We could not stop because we had to catch Maghrib prayer.  Please do not forget, many times in Padang we see big dark circle around the sun, like ring, with color gradation from dark to light, specially when earthquake happened many times in 2010 and 2011.  Me, myself saw it 3 times. Very scary, felt like the end of the world.<n>

It was big and bright,could see an object within the light,  What ever it was in side that arora was domed on top and had three rounded off level surfaces on the bottom.   My son I watch this object in front of us for only a minute afraid of the actions we were facing.  Object began moving away from the road to the right and back towards the hills were I first noticed it.  We Watched it for another 5 to 10 minutes till the sphere of light disappeared beyond the tree lines<n>

Now there are Helicopters flying all over the place?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my hot tub with a friend and we thought we saw a shooting star but then it was still there and going so fast yet not fading at all, it continued towards the east here in Downtown Boise Idaho and then suddenly it fled off to the south so fast that we have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the kicker, there are helicopters flying all over the same pattern that the UFO had flown and have been going in circles all night now for 3 hours. I never EVER hear them this late over here near Hyde park. Something is clearly going on, the choppers seem to keep going in the SAME EXACT pattern as the AMBER LIGHT we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was LARGE, it seemed akin to the afterburner from a fighter jet, but NO SOUND and the speed was so fast that if it had been a jet of any kind it would have broken the sound barrier. I use to live next to &#34;top gun&#34; in San Diego CA, so I am quite familiar with the sounds and speed of the f-14 and other fighter jets. This was NOTHING like those at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not one to write in to a UFO sight, and to be honest I would not be doing it had I not noticed these helicopters flying all over the place tonight. I have gone out 3 times now to see over 5 choppers flying around and again EXACTLY where we saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is NOT the 1st time I have seen something like this, back in 1995 I was in Ocotillo Wells and 7 of us saw a formation of 9 lights that hovered in the sky for 35 min, BRIGHT, and silent. We at one point thought they were flares but they never dropped from the sky. Having been there only at night at that point we figured there were mountains and some lights were on top of them, however when we woke the next morning, there were no mountains in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever we saw tonight has sparked the interest of the helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just looked up other peoples sightings in the area and here is what I found and it seems this is NOT the 1st time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlID.html  http://www.examiner.com/ufo-in-national/probe-appears-200-feet-over-idaho-park-and-morphes-into-egg-and-boomerang<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to find anything on your site dealing with Boise Idaho?<n>

If I hadn’t been looking in just the right spot I would have missed it. It flew across the entire horizon in about 5 seconds heading NE (30 degrees). I couldn’t determine wither or not it was three separate lights or a whole craft, I want to say that it was not a formation because I didn’t observe any stars within the possible area of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the orbs was more of a dark brown than a dark red. Determining the size of the craft was more difficult, from my perspective the craft was 1 1/2“ to 2” in size.  Regardless of the craft’s size and altitude it traveled at incredible speeds with no sound.  Human aircraft was in the area but I didn’t see any.<n>
12/21/11 21:00|Bellingham|WA|Sphere|15-30 min.|Bright star-like object, thought it was a star until jet seemed to engage....|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85989.html|238|ndxe201112| Bright star-like object, thought it was a star until jet seemed to engage....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed something tonight that I still have a hard time really accepting, but it is what I saw and it was really amazing, to be honest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was (I have no checked to see if it is still there, it hadnt left when I had..) a rather bright object in the sky, that was pulsating / flashing various colors.  Blue, red, whites, greens, yellows. All colors, similiar to that of a twinkling star.  I initially felt it WAS a twinkling star. No movement, just oddly large and had VERY erratic color movement, it would dim out completely and come back at times. So I called my father down to see it, and as we watched, we saw  a jet off to the left of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bear in mind this was at 9:00 pm tonight here in Bellingham WA, so we couldnt actually see the jet, just the red flashing wing light indicating its presence, and occassionally its green light. We noticed it was flying below but towards the object.. and as it was about to pass, it did a very dramatic curve up towards the object, and as it did it left a trail of very bright orange behind it, like that of possibly afterburner? Or even missile trail, although it trailed behind the craft so my guess is afterburner, and I mean this thing did a sideways U shape in the sky back towards the object. As it did the jet itself was rather bright, I am not sure why this is, perhaps just the light off it. The object reacted however, this was the first time it moved. It veered fairly quickly to its left, meanwhile the jet retracted and headed back towards us, which was parallel to the direction it was originally heading, which we found quite odd. It flew nearby and passed over, and the objec! t remained in the sky. We noticed other jets circling the area, but none of them appeared to engage, rather one of them turned towards us and again flew over head, the other I am not sure where it went, I lost it in the nights sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I try to remain skeptical, but I know my aircraft, and I know what I saw.  No commercial airliner is going to pull that U in the sky like that in the first place, and the fact it did it to go directly at the object...?  That&#39;s just too much to over look.  I stayed for awhile longer, but w/ nothing going on besides the objects rather beautiful pulse, I went back inside, it was freezing out.  To most my story will be crazy, or they will come up w/ an explanation..  But nothing explains that jet doing what it did in regards to the &#39;star&#39;, and the &#34;star&#34; MOVING.  That was a RUSH to watch, I was in complete amazement.  My father was dumbfounded as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, long story. But it&#39;s just something incredible to me.  I wish I could&#39;ve seen more, or own a camera (I do have a cell phone, but its ancient, it cannot record video...) and wish more people would&#39;ve seen it, it seems like people are sometimes oblivious to what goes on in the sky above them …<n>

I was inside the house waiting for my 3 friends as they were on the front porch smoking.   My 1 friend ran in the house and said &amp;quot;the lights are back, you gotta see this.&amp;quot;   I ran out to the driveway and looked up....could not believe what I was looking at.  I was looking at 5 large red orb lights moving in formation very slowly south to north toward the Bend Airport.  The lights were about 500 feet over us and just south of us by maybe 1000 feet.  this was a very close up view and I kept thinking OMG, it&#39;s like a mothership out of Star Wars.  The night was very dark and clear, new moon.  I could not see an outline of an aircraft, just large red orb lights about 100 feet or so aprt, in formation or perhaps attached together as one large craft.  I believe it was one large craft, as they were totally syncronized.  The lights moved north toward ! the airport at probably 20 mph or so, then made a 90 degree turn east and moved out into the desert.  We watched for about 15-20 minutes, until they were so far out, we didnt have as good a view.  As the lights turned east, the lights went from one long 5 light row, to intermittent blinking and triangular formations, with up to 8 or 10 lights.  The night was calm, no wind at all.  The night was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop and this craft was silent.  The distance from side to side of the lights was hundreds of  feet wide.  The same friends have seen these lights on several ocassions and have had numerous sightings, day and night in this area for many years and have seen massive motherships (for lack of a better description) in broad daylight.  From reading other reports, I know others are seeing the same lights.....  I am a Christian KJV AV1611 Bible believer and do not pay too much mind to this sort of thing, but know exactly what I saw and it is not like anything I! have ever seen before and nothing like this is know to exist ! publicly ... the lights looked just like the famous &amp;quot;lights over phoenix, AZ, which have been dismissed as weather balloons.  Rest assured, these were no weather balloons and neither were the lights over Phoenix..... As I said, it was so dark, we could not see an outline of a craft, just felt like the lights were attached to one and it was like nothing know to man, more like sci-fi stuff.... enormous!!!  I do not wish to be contacted, but just want to share my experience, as I see others are witnessing the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I heard a whistle sound and I looked up and saw a black Dimond shaped craft wiz by over head pretty high in the sky.  I saw it clearly, as it was a very clear day outside. Almost instantly all of the electronics on the boat started acting weird.  Soon after this is saw alot of strange aircraft activity in the sky in the area. I saw two different AWAX planes with the spinning radars on top, I saw one low flying jet, looked like a 737. It was flying so low I could see that it was painted metallic green and it had some unusual looking attachment on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I saw what looked to be three army helicopters flying over the nearby hills on either side of where I was located. The electronics on the boat acted weird for at least two hours. I couldn&#39;t get a good phone signal at all until 1800. This activity i thought was very weird. And having the strange electronic inter! ference following it was extra weird.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a shooting star but when I looked at it, it was the same shape and size of the other too lights and it moved extremely fast, faster that any thing I have ever seen.  When it was gone I watched the other two lights closely until I made it home.  They seemed to glow now and then and turn orange. I kept thinking that they must be starts but I have never seen stars that did this.<n>

While I was thinking of what it could be I dozed off and when I woke up 20 mins later It was gone. We bot agreed the light looked to be At least a few thousand feet in the air.

No detail, just a light.  Really impressed me as a plane, as plenty of small aircraft fly over my area near Montgomery Field.  As it got closer it got bigger - no sound, and it was moving in a straight line.  Then it started slowly dripping small globs of red-orange light straight down (in direction of ground).  This continued for about a minute, then with the final &#34;drip&#34; the thing was extinguished itself and disappeared.  By that time it had moved from SW to W sky.  Strangely, this was the second time I&#39;d seen this happen: about a year ago, an identical thing took place around 2am high in sky moving from S to N...that time it did not extinguish itself, but kept moving, got smaller, and finally disappeared into the N sky..plenty of &#34;drips&#34; that time, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The course it seemed to be on didn&#39;t look as if it had any intentions on landing. I watched this object for at least a min or 2 when I went to reach for my phone.  I looked up after dialing a friend  &amp; it disappeared.  I stared at the area to catch any sign of movement &amp; there was nothing.  I went inside to tell a associate of mine about it then decided to go back out onto the porch to see if it returned.  I stood there for about 2-3 mins when I saw movement out the corner of my eye.  It seemed to be the same light because it was coming from the direction the first disappeared in.  The only difference this time is it gradually slowed down almost to a stop &amp; when it picked up speed again it kind of went in a diagonal slant slowing, stopping &amp; then going til it cloaked out near the M<n>

It stood still for a while and then was slowly getting dimmer.  Then it finally disappeared completely.  I stood and watched for a while to see if it would come back but it didn&#39;t.  It was just the night sky then, and I was in disbelief.  The weather was clear - no clouds at all - only the night sky with the stars (the ones you can see in the City anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/20/11 18:45|Mayville|ND|Light|15 MIN|Slow moving Ball of White Light with several different other colors attached above small town in ND|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86037.html|252|ndxe201112| Slow moving Ball of White Light with several different other colors attached above small town in ND<n> <n><n> <n><n> The town of Mayville is approximately 4 miles WSW (almost West) of my house as the crow flies. My driveway is .2 miles straight and the entrance faces Mayville. At 18:45 I went to walk to the mail box. Above the grain bin lights of Mayville, I noticed a Ball of White light with Red, Blue, and Green intermittent lights which weren’t blinking, just appearing then disappearing in a seemingly random pattern. At first I thought it may have been a Helicopter, no noise, it was just hovering. I then noticed 3 single engine prop planes (used extensively in the area for crop dusting). These 3 planes were coming from different directions. You could hear their engine noises. Their flight pattern suggested there was a destination – one was heading North, one heading East, the other heading South. Their moving lights and sound suggested they were close to Mayville at the normal altitude. The light I saw was moving slowly toward the West and in comparison to the Prop plane! s was extremely bright. After ruling out a helicopter, I thought it might have been a star. A star cannot move and the cloud cover was at first above the light then the light went into the cloud cover. You could see a ‘glow’ from the clouds. This was ruled out when it disappeared into the low flying clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He called me to the front porch and I instantly saw the two orbs.  (The orbs were far up in the sky probably about the same height that a plane would fly)  They seemed to be doing figure eights in the sky, they would move up then all of a sudden move to the left making sharp right angle turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the activity happened in one small area of the sky for about 5 minutes then the orb on the left shot off and out of sight. The other stayed in the sky about 15 minutes maybe longer, at that point it became too eerie and we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later stuck my head outside probably about 7 p.m., and didn&#39;t see anything more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my husband and I work as healthcare professionals and this was our first sighting.<n>

At first we asked ourselves, &#34;what was that?&#34;  I was on the phone with my mother as we were coming home from college when my girlfriend yelled aloud multiple times, &#34;what is that?!  What is that?!&#34;  The object which appeared around 20ft in circumference which lied behind a line of trees to our right. The object appeared a extremely bright white light; almost the luminosity of an extremely bright star.  It remained stationary, did not move whatsoever, and the back roads of Fulton County is pitch Black and has no sort of artifical lighting.  As we passed the object and proceeded under an underpass I looked into my rearview mirror to get a second glance at the object to see absolutely nothing. My girlfriend and I were dumbstruck. Coming from someone who does not believe in the paranormal, I m! ight be changing my mind.<n>

It would take either light about 2-3 seconds to do a complete lap. Every few laps one of the lights would pass the other. I reported the event to the Will County Sheriff, at that time there were no other calls. No objects or craft were seen. It was cloudy in the morning with little wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Estimated altitude upon initial contact was 8,000 AGL.  The object was not an aircraft as it did not have anti collision lights and its rate of descent was frightning.  The object was not a meteor as its parabolic trajectory was too steep to march the Earth&#39;s curvature.  Contact was lost as the aircraft disappeared behind trees lining the street.  I am a science teacher, pilot, and very familier with the physics of flight.  What caught my attention was the high velocity and rate of descent which covered a 70 degree sky arc in approximately 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I want to type this out while it&#39;s still fresh in my mind.  I am not joking here, at the same time I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ET.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just taking the garbage out, at 11:40pm and looked up at the sky like I always do to see the position of the planets and such--because I&#39;m an amateur Astronomer. And there I saw two identical, ribbon like objects appearing to be light in color, each wider than a jumbo jet, no lights, gliding North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to compare them to known aircraft, I would say they were like giant flying wings, or super wide wing span gliders--but they almost appeared to fly and look more like parasails.  They weren&#39;t point towards the front at all like a chevron, just one super wide strip of aircraft, more like parenthesis shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were nearly overhead they were easy to see, and as they passed they became more and more difficult to see due to the NYC haze. Basically, they flew between my location on 35th Street in Astoria and LaGuardia Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for engine noise and thought I could hear jets, but I&#39;m near LaGuardia so of course I hear jets all the time.  It would be more remarkable if I didn&#39;t hear the faint sound of jet engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other aircraft in the sky that I could see from my position, certainly none displaying their lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell how high they were flying due to the fact that they were unrecognizable aircraft with no lights, but they were not at high altitude. If I had to guess, I would say they were just high enough to clear the Manhattan skyline if they wanted to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them moved straight across North to South, while the one next to it appeared to bank towards the Southeast for a moment before returning to it&#39;s position along side the accompanying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not moving fast or sporadically.  They were obviously being piloted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very rarely I see military planes flying in twos along this route, but these were not airplanes of any design I&#39;ve ever seen--even given my overall love for the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15 minutes ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say it took about five to eight minutes for them to move across my piece of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have run in to get my camera and take a picture or video, but it was very dark and the objects would be gone before I had a chance to take the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I watched it for a couple minutes and it didn&#39;t look like it was moving. There is an alley behind our house [which in on an exact east/west alignment] and I moved to place telephone wires between me and the light so I could gauge any movement. It was moving, but very slowly. I ran into the house to get binoculars and tell my husband about the light. The binoculars I grabbed SUCK! And I also wear glasses. But he came out with the larger 10xm binoculars and our little Panasonic camera and a monopod. By the time he came out the light had moved from where I initially spotted it in the west. [It would have  been slightly north west from my standing location.] It was moving in a due east direction when I realized it was moving and when I came out from alerting my hubby, it had moved a good hand-span eastward. My husband was taking a &#39;movie&#39; as well as look! ing through the better binoculars and then the light took a southward turn for a half hand-span and turned southwest at that point. There were spotty clouds in the south and southwest and Jupiter was visible in a large break in those clouds and the yellow light appeared to be maybe going higher, because it seemed to be getting smaller but it was heading for that clearing and Jupiter. My husband said it was appearing smaller because it was entering the cloud cover. He also said it looked like the light was in a plus-sign configuration and that it was more orange than yellow and had panels on it. It was NOT blinking. He thought it might be an &#39;air-ship&#39;. I said, &#34;what the heck is an air-ship?&#34; and he indicated like a blimp or dirigible, but it was so high and then the plus-sign configuration would sort of cancel that out. Eventually Jupiter was swallowed by the clouds and so was the light. We came back inside and looked up NASA and the local news and nothing was indicated as ! anyone else seeing this light [as of today at 7:30 p.m. there ! has stil l been no posts or news of anyone else seeing this that we can find!] The &#34;movie&#34; he took is sort of  like one of those hand-held movies...sort of jerky and blurry at times, but you can clearly see the plus-sign shape and that the lights or panels or whatever are not blinking like an airplane. during the seemingly endlessly slow movement of this whatever it was, there were other airplanes in the sky, both heard and seen. We are within several miles of a small airfield and live near a hospital trauma center with a Lifeflight copter that frequently flies overhead. This light was not like anything I&#39;ve ever seen before and it was so SLOW. And the odd movement where it was heading in an apparently West to East line and then changed directions to move diagonaly from it&#39;s overhead spot towards the southwest was especially confusing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was NOT airplane or helicopter.  Front light moved slowly at first and stopped just above highway just before Snydersville exit on Rt 209/33. Lights were aligned from East to West, spaced about 1/2 mile to 1 mile apart.  There was no sound, and airplanes going in same direction near craft gave accurate size comparison.  I am an avid amateur astronomer, and these were NOT planets nor stars. I drove under the nearest one, the one furthest eastward.  I pulled off of Snydersville exit to get gas, and several people were observing the lights. At this time the light moved again.  I only observed the front one move, slightly to the south then quickly to the north, and then stop, and to my knowledge there are no (unclassified) aircraft that can do that, or make the maneuvers that it made.  What was the most unsettling and what took my attention the most is the lack of any sound coming from the craft. I was coming from Stroudsburg Pa when I first noticed these lights, and thought them to be airplanes or helicopters.  As I drove about 4 to 6 miles closer, I realized they were not. There were other craft in the sky, but I was able to correctly identify all of them as planes except for the 3 strange lights.<n>

I have watched many satellites from his porch, including watching the space station go over a few years back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted what I assumed to be a satellite (just a small steady white light) moving in a straight line, at a consistent speed, from east to west overhead.  I followed it’s trajectory with my eyes across the sky, glad that I had spotted one and planning to watch it until it disappeared behind the trees to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went normally until it had crossed about 75% of the sky within my vision, and then it stopped.  The light did not change in any way.  It did not sparkle or flash…it just stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stare at it until I finished my cigarette, and it did not move again.<n>

The craft hung in the sky without moving for a good 30 minutes. I followed the craft to the West for the next 15 minutes, when it sped up and headed for Hayfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft had a set of perimeter lights and two large red lights or lasers around the back of it. I would guess it to be aprox. 100 to 200 feet or more in width. It would also tip up a few degrees at times on one side (dip) All the lights would go off and on at times.  Airplanes came by from the Airport but nothing was reported in the local news. It was also observed by my wife and another car that stopped.<n>

Thought maybe a falling star?  Several seconds later another strobe flash of white light only stronger directed toward the ground. Caught both of these flashes in my peripheral vision.  Looked at this area of the sky for several seconds and a dim glowing ball of light appeared slightly larger and rounder than a star, traveled south in a straight line for a very short time (5 seconds)and disappeared.  Objects speed was very slow.<n>

The Light was traveling from north to south very slowly.  This light was like nothing I have ever seen.  As it passed over head myself and witnesses could say it wasn&#39;t a plane because we would have seen flashing lights underneath the object.  Upon zooming in on the light it was multi-colored, and had what looked like, rapid changing lights.  The lights were orange, yellow and red, which seemed to be moving very fast in all directions and changing form.  Taking a closer look at the video and slowing it down it appeared to keep making the form of a triangle.  It doesn&#39;t make sense why these light which looked independent of one another made a bright amber orange light in the sky.  There was no sound emitted from the object, its rate of speed remained constant from north to south and disappeared over the hills.<n>

I ran inside to grab my 3 friends thinking a plane had crashed. When we all got out side we noticed while  looking up at the sky we saw 30-40 star-sized lights changing colors, some blue to green, some blue to orange. As we observed the sky we noticed that the lights we saw were darting randomly  around the sky like nothing we had ever seen. Zig-zagging and moving up and down. Also shooting beams of light through the sky. We stood out there watching them do this for three hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later after going inside I noticed blinking white lights from a window coming from  the same place the white orb was seen. I went out side and saw two orange orbs side by side float up from behind a tree line, move about 500ft right and then quickly fall to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first dismissed it as an airplane since I live with a few miles of an international airport but it kept flying closer and closer.  Eventually, after a minute or two, it headed right over my head and was heading from the northwest to the southeast. As it was passing over my head, there was no noise coming from the light/fireball and after a few minutes, the fireball passed out of sight.<n>

It went so fast I felt very uneasy. I could see it moving but knew no plane goes that fast!  I had trouble adjusting to what I had just seen.I questioned the sighting but knew it was the real thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound emanating from the vehicle. I looked back to where the two vehicles had been (hovering?) and only the one remained. So, I am sure I saw two of these UFOs. Although I suspect the remaining vehicle was a recognized U.S. Air Craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

During the day we noticed military activity many miles south-southeast of the beach, where we could see and hear naval ships firing artillery.  Around noon we also watched as two jets soared overhead, to and from the ocean, turning and banking as jets do.  (We have no knowledge of a connection between the military activity and the sighting.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, after we finished work and had had dinner, my two colleagues and I decided to explore the old fort where we were staying.  After roaming around for about 40 minutes, we walked onto a broad patch of lawn behind one of the structures where we stood and talked for at least half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the sighting occurred, we were discussing the constellations and were aiming my iPhone into the sky, using the SkyView app to reveal star names and constellations.  At about 10:00PM while all three of us were simultaneously staring upward, we noticed two bright (but small) lights appear from the western horizon, swiftly cross the sky, and fade away into the eastern horizon.  They were moving at a very rapid pace, one light following the other’s path at the same speed.  It appeared as though they were very high up in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise that could be heard, and they simply looked like two points of solid light following each other. My colleagues and I are geologists and marine scientists. We have seen our fair share of planes, shooting stars, jets, helicopters, satellites, and bugs, and what we saw was none of these. Immediately after acknowledging that we all three saw the two lights, we agreed that they could have been none of those things, based on their apparent altitude, speed, as well as the lack of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself have always been a UFO enthusiast, and in my 22 years of living I had never seen anything that I would confidently call a UFO, until that night.<n>

The velocity/speed was greater than that of a commercial aircraft based on my observations of commercial aircraft flight speeds from the ground.  The object continued its path heading east by southeast for a about 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Then it appeared to turn north by northeast.  At this point the bright white light disappeared.  What was amazing was that the white light was &#34;replaced&#34; by an orange fire-like color which lasted for a few seconds.

I shined my flashlight up towards the sky and saw a large diamond shaped object. It had colored lights around it&#39;s border and 2 (two) white spotlights on the front of the craft. The object turned around as if it were searching for the source of the flashlight.  The spotlights of the craft lit up the entire backyard as well as 2 of our neighbors yards and houses.  The craft was yellow in color. It turned back around after searching back for the source of the light and quickly disappeared into the night. The object was flying very low, just above the treeline in the back yard (approximately 50&#39; off the ground).  The object was about the size of a baseball field, in length and width. It had a center hump on the object. When the object disappeared there was nothing more than a small cloud of smoke.  The object made no noise what so ever but when the spotlights on the object searched the grounds it made a &#34;pshhh&#34; sound.  The grass didn&#39;t even look green, it appeared dead from the brightness of the lights.<n>
12/17/11 18:35|Austin|MN|Formation|5-8 min|20+ red to orange lights (formation) seen in southern Minnesota sky.  Three witnesses,|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85920.html|304|ndxe201112| 20+ red to orange lights (formation) seen in southern Minnesota sky.  Three witnesses,<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving on the south central side of Austin, MN. in front of the water treatment plan, I noticed in the WNW skyline 3 reddish lights, stacked on top of each other.  I thought it looked like cellular tower lights, but I was not aware of a tower in that area.  I then noticed the three lights were moving toward me, from the low horizon, to about 45 degrees off the horizon, to overhead.  As that group of 3-4 lights approached, the formation widened, and out of the same spot on the horizon, three to four more lights appeared, stacked like the others (looking like a radio tower).  I pulled the car over, assuming these were formations of military helicopters.  There were two other witnesses in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of the car as the first group passed over head.  I was surprised that the speed was faster than helicopters would be traveling, more the speed of jet aircraft.  I am a private pilot, so have a good sense of speed and altitude.  The first group appeared to be at a higher altitude as they passed overhead than I presumed, when I originally got out of the car.  I would guess at 8,000 to 12,000 ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first formation passed over head, the reddish color was now more of an orange color.  There was no sound, which I found to be odd.  The second group passed over about 10 seconds later.  Same course and speed as the first.  Then I noticed a third group coming up from the horizon, same spot.  I then got back in the car, drove about a half block north, turned west on the next street and pulled over to see if more were coming.  There were, no longer however in a formation (as the first three groups were).  Now they were coming in line, about 5-7 second separation.  I lost count of how many were passing over head in single file.  I am guessing we saw an additional 8-12 objects pass over head.  All at the same speed, same separation, course and same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the color changed from the initial view just above the horizon being reddish, to more orange as they approached  over head.   As they passed by, looking back the ESE, they were still orange, but a much dimmer and well defined spec of light.  As the approached, the red was as bright as a radio tower light, as they got closer, and over head, as bright, but an orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear at the time, and visibility of the stars was excellent.  There were no other lights on these aircraft, no red/green navigation lights or strobe lights, which I thought was odd, as even if these were military aircraft, they would typically have standard aircraft lighting on while flying in domestic US airspace.<n>

Object followed altitude-gaining trajectory while moving south, then turned west. Lights disappeared after object reached very high altitude and turned west. At least fifteen other identical objects followed exact same path at 20-60 second intervals, seemingly being launched from shoreline or water.  Objects were silent and sometimes three or four were visible at once, all originating from location that could not be identified from our vantage point on Venice Beach. At first we thought them to be small airplanes or helicopters, but trajectory, flight, frequency and location disproved that.  Called Venice airport and newsroom, but could not get any information on what these objects were.<n>

This light has appeared for the last 2 nights at 6:30 and ending around 7:48 pm.Last night the light was first noticed around 6:30 pm. The light grew brighter as the sky darkened and eventually started pulsating to every color inthe rainbow every  2 seconds then turning dark yellow with this red stuff seemingly dripping from the bottom.Then it began to fade and abruptly disappeared at 7:48pm. That was nothing compared to what happened tonight. The light promptly appeared at 6:30 pm slightly higher than where it was last night.As the sun  went down the light began to grow very bright with these pointed rays coming out of it looking like a star that goes on top of a christmas tree.  This light was lighting up the night sky.  The light began moving west toward ala  Moana then disappearing far out to sea off Barber&#39;s Point a! t again 7:48 pm.I am absolutely sure the same phenomena wil occur again tomorrow at 6:30 pm ending at precisely 6:30 pm ending at 7:48 pm.Watch the sky-It WILL happen tomorrow.<n>

Can anyone explain what we are seeing?<n>

I live on the East Coast of Central Florida, approx 9 miles west of Kennedy Space Center and the Atlantic Ocean.  In the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright orange streak out over the ocean (East of my location).  I then turned and directly watched this light continue from a south to north direction until it was out of my sight.  It began as an orange fireball, and rapidly changed color to a bright blue-green as it left my line of sight.  It was moving way too slowly to be a meteor, yet seemed rather fast to be an aircraft as I know one.  I&#39;m assuming that it may have been an object falling from orbit.  I have spent quite some time in the desert and on the ocean, and this was extremely out of the ordinary, and was way too bright to be anything ordinary.<n>

I told my wife that this star is sure bright tonight, and I looked to the south of us and that&#39;s when I seen this ball of light moving rather slow.

This light had no flashing lights to indicate a plane or helicopter. Its white light was visible from any direction that we observed it from.  This object  was moving from south to north intersecting the areas normal air traffic into St. Louis, which is usually from the west or south west as the planes approach Lambert International Airport.  We observed the object as it approached a normal sized, flashing air craft coming into St. Louis, as this object neared the plane the light from the globe simply flashed out of existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was brighter than a plane, space station, planet, star, or helicopter.  Their was no smoke trail to indicate a meter rite, and it was much to slow.  It had 360* light source no mater if viewed from front or back.  It passed in front of  us off the horizon by 18 inches in the night sky and their was no sound, nothing.  Their were no cars, or other things in the back ground.  We where NOT drunk.  Their was nothing to obscure our vision, though it was partly cloudy.  I was wearing  glasses but the rest of my family was not.  Nothing was in our ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where going to go look at Christmas lights.  When my brother pointed it out, it looked like nothing we have ever seen in the sky before.  As we watched the object came close to a plane and it was flying higher than the plane.  It had to be at least  3 to 4 times bigger than the plane.  When the plane got closer the lights blinked off.  The light was to bright to disappear behind a cloud and not seen again.<n>

The objects were tear drop shaped with a bright yellow and organe light that was almost brighter than the sun, making the shape of a cross; as they made thier way east and over the community in which I live thier light got dimmer and the teardrop shape than came into place.  The objects also had a variety of blue and white lights that seemed to have had thier own sequence and were flahsing as they floated/hovered over the community.  I could hear the witnesses say they seen stuff falling down into the community but standing almost under the object was unable to see anything falling into any of my neighbors yards.  The objects proceeded to move east bound towards Broadus, MT, as they hover! ed over the moon they let out a blue pulse was almost like seeing a fire work in the sky and than continued to slowly hover east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Objects appeared to be at several thousand feet, I figure possibly someone could have launched some type of flare or firework and maybe this is what I saw burnout, however while I was watching these objects I didnt see parachute or anything that would have suspended them in the air.

On 11/16/2001 I went out to do an ATM transaction. But because of lost card number I ignored going bank.  In this time I looked sky like ever (I like astronomy and observing sky) and see and I saw a big object with orange light in sky. I have some information about sky. That was not like moon so other objects like stars, planets, handmade balloons, aircraft and so helicopter (I will describe that why).   First time I watch it I guess it’s a tower end light (light for prevent aircraft accident) but I know there good there was not any tower. So its altitude was very higher than any tower I could imagine.  Because I was not ready to visit a UFO more than minute I just checking that.  Then I decided to take a picture. I took one picture (setting mobile for photography takes time).  After one picture I decided to set my phone camera fo! r take video. I started my video camera and look at its screen and so I didn’t see anything. (Later when I was watching my video I saw object was in video for some seconds with changing its lights. then object disappeared.  I returned home and opened my pc, because of fogy sky I couldn’t see any space object like stars and others, so I had to use  a good astronomy software named TheSky 6 when is see that’s screen I afraid because, software was showing that in north east of me was not any planet or moon. Jupiter and Uranus was in west of me. So magnitude of Jupiter was about 1/10 of object that I observed. It was not airplane because of it was in fix position for minutes. It was not helicopter because of no sound in quit night. It was not moon because of position so its size was about 1/5 of moon and moon didn’t rise yet. It was not handmade balloon because no (fire flicker) I know balloons. So when I watch video I saw color changing before disappear (orange to white and vice! versa. My higher option is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a new email for some personal reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving home when my family and I noticed three bright orange lights shaped in a triangle.  And they were moving slowly (north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to drive we got closer and we spotted another bright orange light a head of the triangular set of lights.  But the strange thing about it they were all moving at the same time and pace.  It was clear that it wasn&#39;t a plane because it looked so close like as if a house near by had a very large antenna on the top of the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we got closer we realized it was above us!!  It was above the intersection of all the traffic!!   Traffic had pulled over and started taking pictures of the sighting with their cellphones.  And then it just vanished. It was pretty cool!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still stoked about it, my kids have so many questions...<n>

We watched the light and a second one appeared next to the other one. In the blink of an eye they were right on the side of our car.  They hovered over the area for @5 mins, then a third one appeared in the blink of an eye next to the other two.  They made no sound what so ever.  Two lights left and the third stayed and they made until they were almost out of sight, then the third one left faster then I have ever seen anything fly.<n>

The objects were bright white lights that seemed to flicker a green color every so often, but mainly looked white.  They seemed to sit in the sky without moving until they glided outward from one another in a fashion that I have never seen any other flying object copy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least five objects that I saw.  Eventually they all seemed to have vanished and I and the rest of the onlookers had given up on trying to spot them.  After this I immediately called the hot line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about ten to five minuets after the disappearance of the objects, I went back outside to look again.  And there they were (seemed like less than before) spread across the tree line.  I then tried to drive and get closer to the objects but I had lost sight of them during my drive.  That is the extent of my sighting.<n>

12/16/11 18:13|Lamartine|WI|Flash|6 Minutes|Incredibly bright, pulsating red and white lights in tandem|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86101.html|332|ndxe201112| Incredibly bright, pulsating red and white lights in tandem<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve submitted this same thing to MUFON on the night it happened but was on this site today and saw others in the approximate area who saw strange things in the sky this night so I thought I&#39;d put it on here too: My and my daughter&#39;s sighting is approximately 13 minutes after the one seen in Berlin, WI, and about 28 minutes after the one in Coloma, WI. From my calculations, this would mean the craft was headed in a southeasterly direction and then headed northeast after our sighting. The only thing I would like to change from my original MUFON report of several days ago is that my daughter insists she saw beams of light shooting down from the craft(s), when she says in my report that &#34;they&#39;re taking pictures.&#34; I was so stunned by the brightness of the flashes that I may have missed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving north-northwest to Fond du Lac, WI, from Waupun, on US 151, roughly halfway between the two cities, closer to Lamartine. It was dark at 6:13 pm when I noticed to my left this incredibly bright, pulsating red light, followed a moment later by an equally bright white light. It was so stunning, I said to my daughter, sitting beside me, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; I would estimate these lights to be a few miles away, probably 30 degrees off the horizon. My daughter said, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s a plane,&#34; and we kept driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These did not appear to be standard aircraft lighting, with a steady blinking or steady white or red lights, anti-collision type lights. I couldn&#39;t stop looking at them! The light would blink fast red, then fast white off to the red&#39;s left (my right), and then there would be a moment of blackness from the night. From what I know about aircraft, there are supposed to be steady &#34;on&#34; lights, which there was nothing of. No green light on the wingtip, for instance, and this object wasn&#39;t near enough an airport to be landing with those lights: If another pilot had seen them, he/she would have been blinded, I&#39;m sure of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was these lights were coming towards us, heading southeast, but as I watched them flashing, I thought maybe it&#39;s standing still. It didn&#39;t look like any lights I&#39;d seen on aircraft before. &#34;That&#39;s no plane,&#34; I said. The red lights would pulsate very fast...then a second later, the white, almost like they were communicating with each other. What was even more amazing was the size of this. At the distance I think we were seeing these lights, the distance between the red and white lights was very wide, wider than an aircraft wing would have been at that distance (about 3-4 miles, estimated). The red light appeared to be a little above the white, as if it were on top of the craft, and the white light off to the right of the craft, as on a wing (from my perspective). I&#39;d estimate that they were a penny-width apart, when you hold your fingers out at arm&#39;s length. If it were two different aircraft, they were flying in perfect formation, but I got the feeling it w! as one craft and it was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we tried to make sense of the lights in the sky, the object appeared to change course and was now headed back the way it came: Not moving/banking like an ordinary aircraft but rather just reversing course and the bright, pulsing lights moved farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and we watched the lights for several moments on the side of the highway. I tried to get a picture of it but my cell phone didn&#39;t take a great photo of it. It was after my attempt to take a photo that the lights appeared to now move in a northeasterly direction, going just north of Fond du Lac, banking a little. We followed them until our vision was obscured by trees in Lamartine. The lights were approximately 3-5 miles away, I&#39;m sure, but as bright as a camera flash. In fact, my daughter kept repeating, &#34;They&#39;re taking pictures! They&#39;re taking pictures!&#34; I don&#39;t know if they were or not, but that is the intensity of the lights, a camera flash, where it momentarily blinds the eye. I distinctly remember trying to see if the lights projected downward, like it was scanning the ground, but could see nothing like that. Even the red flashing light was intense. We had a clear, unobstructed view of these lights for several minutes before the trees obscured our view, bu! t we did see them for a time afterward, until they faded from view. Entire sighting lasted from 6:13 pm until 6:19 pm. (Central Standard Time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated time watching these lights, about 6 minutes. The pulsating never varied, always the red for one second, then the white for a second, and these were exactly equal in time pulsing, then nothing, black. Then back again, and always the same very wide distance apart, a bit on an angle. At times we thought it was one craft, and other times we thought they could be two. It looked like the aircraft banked at one moment before we lost sight of it behind the trees. When we came to the other side of the stand of trees, the lights were very faint and far away. It seemed in no great hurry, and was headed in the direction of Oshkosh/Appleton, over Lake Winnebago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not scared or concerned, just amazed at these pulsating lights. My daughter and I haven&#39;t spoken of it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a very large aircraft, I would be happy to know it.  As it is, I&#39;m not sure what we saw but it was definitely something unusual.  This is the third report I&#39;m filing with MUFON in the past 2 1/2 years. We&#39;re seeing some interesting things in this area.<n>

They seemed to be a medium brightness flame color.  They appeared to be pretty high but very close, as it took over a minute for me to drive directly beneath them, which is about a mile or two.  I did not notice any shape outside of the flame colored lights with the star lit sky as the background as I was passing beneath them.  Unfortunately, since I was in my car I did not hear anything.  A minute or two later I pulled over at an eye doctors office in that area but did not see the lights again.  I waited for 15 minutes and witnessed a few planes fly overhead, none of which resembled what I had seen earlier.  I also dialed 911 to report the sighting and was transferred to state police, who stated that I was the only caller regarding the issue.  It’s hard to believe since there is! a nearby shopping center with a perfect view of the sky above the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notice three white lights one in the front and two in the back with a red light in between the two in he back and it was flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a plane it was flying too low and no sound and so close it was crazy I had to question myself all day.<n>
12/16/11 06:00|Bloomington|CA|Unknown|4 minutes|2 or more UFO's on video at sunrise|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85942.html|336|ndxe201112| 2 or more UFO&#39;s on video at sunrise<n> <n><n> <n><n> The security camera in the driveway recorded what appear to be at least 2 or more unidentified flying objects.  It was an especially windy morning and the sun was just rising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the camera: The camera self-adjusts to color from night to day.  The camera is a Sony PTZ but I couldn’t zoom in any farther as the camera is in a fixed location; I can only zoom to the center of that view.  The camera is facing east.  I can only save whole minutes of video to the Lorex HD/system.  Sorry for the long wait before it actually starts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO’s seem to be coming in straight towards the camera, which is facing east, and also recede in the same direction from whence it/they came.  From the video it seems that first there is one UFO and then another just pops into view at 06:01:52.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may be more than 2 objects.  It’s really difficult to tell as the wind keeps blowing the tree branches which partly obscure the view towards the end.  I don’t believe these objects to be planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, basically UFO appears from the east and then another UFO slowly comes into the view just to the left of the first one.  Then the first one is not really visible when a UFO suddenly pops into view again just to the left of the second one.  Then possibly the first and second one merges.  It&#39;s hard to tell if one is just behind the other or if it has merged with it instead or left altogether.  All then seem to come a bit closer before finally receding in the same direction that it/they came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport, Ontario International (ONT), in nearby Ontario but the flight airways are more to the right/south coming in over Riverside.  Also, airplanes don&#39;t stay in one place as these objects did.  While helicopters can hover in place these objects do not fit the shape and made no sound.  At any rate I didn&#39;t notice any red or green lights that aircraft are required to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m above average intelligence and not prone to making things up.  The video is 128mb avi file format.<n>

It was VERY bright but not that large and I called my sister over and she saw it also.  We went over to the window and watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very slow (like a snail in the sky) heading south then it turned and started heading west, still moving extremely slow.

I was with my girlfriend almost home and I spotted something in the sky hovering less than a mile high up in the sky.  It looked like a dim yet bright lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it to her and she started to freak out a little and was like &#34;wait...I think it&#39;s a remote plane&#34; and I was like...no way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we went under it and went out of our view, we looked around and saw cars slowing down to look at it.  After it got in to our view again (in my driver mirror) both my girl and I was looking at it and about ~5-7 seconds later it just shot up really freaking fast and just kept going up and went out of sight in about 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.<n>

Both military rotor wing and fixed wing jets.  They were seemingly flying in some pattern as if they were looking for something.  Standing on my steps I saw a very bright round light moving south to north probably 400 feet in the air.  It made no sound, was not blinking, just a white light.  The aircraft were in the immediate area of this object, as if they were trying to observe it also.  This same type of sighting happened on Dec 14 2011 near St George SC.<n>
12/15/11 21:01|Cochran|GA|Unknown|Has not ended as of yet|Yellow Green and red light moves in a zigzagging pattern in a straight line above Georgia.|12/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85874.html|341|ndxe201112| Yellow Green and red light moves in a zigzagging pattern in a straight line above Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> December 15, 2011 current time 11:37 p.m. at around 9:00 p.m., I was alerted by my aunt to come out back in the yard. She had excitement and fears in her face as she said come quickly but be quite I don’t want to scare it away. Bare footed I ran out with her and stopped next to my uncle as he was on the phone with a neighbor asking,” what is it?  Do you know?”  My aunt tapped me on the shoulder and pointed.  I looked up and could see a star blinking, but at closer examination with my binoculars I seen even more.  There was a yellow light on top a green light on bottom and one red light that blinked every 3 to 4 seconds starting from the bottom to the top.  I was unable to see shapes of the craft are a number of lights it was just too far away.  I did however notice a pattern in its movement. It moved on a Y axis or straight line.  On this straight line it moved in a zigzagging manner.  Picture a line with a lightning bolt over laid on the line.  The bolt is the direc! tion of travel it moved in. I unfortunately could not see the craft actually travel as I would blink it appeared to teleport from one point to another on the bolt. Now all this is being viewed through a high powered set of binoculars. The curious part of this to me is the object would return to its place of origin.  The object never moved forward or backwards only up and down and side to side in a zigzagging manner. The three of us viewed this object between two pine trees.  The object set roughly ten foot from the top we where about 120 yards away from the pine trees.  The pines in question stand approximately 45 to 55 feet a piece.  The object was on the right side of the moon in a south eastern direction towards the Roddy, and Dubois (pronounced do-boys) area of the North Dodge county region of Middle Georgia below Cochran.  At the time I counted 4 aircraft in the sky around the area and the aircraft came in clearly than the object but at the same level as the object on a hor! izontal grid.  The odd part was during the air traffic the obje! ct stopp ed moving it was not until the aircraft moved a certain distance away that it started back to moving in its pattern. It is currently 12:17 and the object is still there in the same spot dancing happily in the Eastern sky above Georgia. If I may make a hypothesis this could be nothing more than a star or group of gases, but for a moment I would like to think that not all UFO’s or Alien life forms are like ourselves maybe an asteroids contains a life form or maybe certain stars are alive that we have yet to examine. Space could be the Ocean inversed without life forms but with large coral formations holding single cell organisms and hiding secrets.<n>

With the lights on facing the north I looked to the west and thought I seen a satellite I pointed out and realized it was not a satellite because the shine of the sun would reflect upon from the west as I would see the shade side.  It seemed to look as if there were airplane lights on it but one red flash then the rear flashed after repetitively around once each per second we also seen three lights, the direction of the un identified object looked as if the lights were not on wings, there was also 2 white lights parallel to each other and another in front near red flashing light, we knew it was not an airplane because the lights in the rear and the direction of the plane would be going in opposite direction at the same time it also was changing directions just as the un identified object left sight we looked to the west again and seen a second object coming from the same direction possibly a little farther south, this object flew in almost a straight line but yet to be going faster than a satellite, it also had the same type of lighting not 1 minute later a third had come the same path as the first, as it turned north at what seemed the same co ordinates facing now south east we seen the first a little higher up but farther away as the third followed continuing north east, the second object had faded into the sky so that you couldn’t see the lights just the red flash per second.  These objects were all going the same speed as each other, yet to still be faster and lower flying than a satellite. Seemed the two were going towards Hudson bay after they turned and coming from Regina going to northern Quebec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object looked larger than an airplane possibly wider than a transit bus’s length and possibly triple its length between the back and front may be larger in size it’s hard to give definite size th! ough seemed like it was flying low was hard to caption exact s! ize only seen its lights   My friend will also be mailing in a report shortly,  Best regards<n>

Also I could make out the shape of the craft, it was a cigar/triangle shape with windows on the top.  IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTER! I know a lot about helicopters and non look like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day later my friend told me his dad had seen some strange lights in Bowling Green with similar description.<n>

I noticed a golden light in the sky that divided into 2 lights.  Then one disappeared and the one that was left divided into two again.  It almost made like a &#39;w&#39; shape when it separated. I was thinking, could it be a flare or firework, but it sure didn&#39;t look like any of those.  Also, I don&#39;t see much movement from it other then it separating.  Within about 30 or 40 seconds, it all disappeared.  It was not a star. It was a bright golden hue.   My town has a population of about 15000 or so, and there&#39;s no airplanes close to us either.<n>

I stepped out toward the field next to my house to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment the light flashed brightly and expanded into long horizontal cylinder shaped light, with the center still a glowing orange ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began moving steadily in my direction when I moved inside out of fear.  I came back outside after about ten minutes and did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After scanning the sky I noticed a similar orange ball, except it was way up in the sky and appeared to be far away, hovering above town.<n>

At about mile marker 64 on I-95 South, an extremely bright burst of white lights appeared then disappeared within a second.  It appeared to be relatively close and positioned about 2 o&#39;clock from my direction.  The light burst was extremely bright and actually burned into my eye&#39;s like looking at the Sun then closing your eye&#39;s and you can still see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, it was a circle of small lights that instantly shot super bright laser type lights to the center forming a small center light burst then black.  I thought maybe it was a military flare, but there was zero heat up, zero cool down and no residual smoke.  Just instant on then off burst of light. It looked like the Star Wars type hyperspace special effects, except much shorter (instant).  About 5 minutes later, it appeared again at about 3 o&#39;clock (position) then one last time just slightly behind me.  There is a miltita! ry proving ground about 20-30 south where I saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this some kind of military deal?<n>

It was pretty quiet out. I just happened to look up in the sky and I saw a boomerang shaped bright blue/silvery light streak across the sky very fast.  Before it left my field of vision it abruptly disappeared and was no longer visible.  It made no noise.  I think it was pretty close because I am nearsighted although it did appear pretty small from where I stood.  The whole event only lasted a few seconds but it was definitely there.<n>

O ur lo|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88454.html|350|ndxe201112| My grandson and I was traveling south bound on I_85 from Charlotte, NC toward Atlanta, Ga on 12/15/11 sometime around 12:00 AM.  Our location was somewhere close to South Carolina and North Carlina line (?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A row of 3 or so white lights appeared just in front of our vehicle approx 3 to 5 hundreds yards (?) away traveling at a smooth but very quick speed.  It crossed from left to right from a cell tower to another tower on other side of expressway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to travel back across highway toward another cell tower further down the highway, then traveled south bound, following I-85 until it eventually dissappeared from our view on the horizon. It took about 12 to 17 seconds from first site to end of site.  No sounds, no hesitation, just a very smooth flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The row of lights never changed even though it moved from right to left then left to right, then traveling straight away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never encountered anything like this before and has me checking the skies most nights.  I&#39;ve searched online for sitings on this date but not found any such reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandson and I agreed the speed to be extremely fast due to the time it took to travel from our location to horizon, which we couldn&#39;t agree on.  He seemed to think the horizon was 50 or more miles away and I thought it could be no more than 10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even at 5 miles an object to travel that far in less than 12 to 17 seconds would be traveling at a very high rate of speed.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white circle|12/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85865.html|351|ndxe201112| On December 14th I was outside walking around my neighborhood with a friend of mine.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white circle quickly flying across the sky.  It was enormous, at least 1.5 times the size of the moon.  It was a circle and was completely white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It zoomed from behind me and went about 3/4ths of the way across the horizon before completely disappearing.  I asked my friend if he saw it and he had not.  I just assumed it was my imagination then and forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half an hour later, I was sitting on a bench by myself listening to some music and gazing at the stars when I noticed a huge blue circle zoom across the sky.  It had a blue edge to it with a black center with what looked like blue electric bolts connecting in the center of it.  It was massive and like the first, disappeared about three quarters of the way across the horizon before entirely vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stupified, I stared at the sky for the next half hour when I saw a shooting sta! r, so I know what that looks like, so I am positive I did not confuse the two.  Picture of the second one is posted below.  It was the one that I saw perfectly clear.<n>

My first thought was that it was a meteor but before I could even complete that thought, it changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw is difficult to explain. It was massive. Clearly looked like it had a cigar shaped body. And it was moving really fast. Faster than anything I’ve ever seen. And it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m terrible with distance but in terms of height, it was up not that high up and it was descending fast at a sharp angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next few moments, my mind kept asking what type of craft is that?  There were two red lights, lights, on its rear and it looked powerful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Into entered into a cloud formation and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a writer; my entire education is in film. While I do believe in the UFO phenomena, that our universe must compliment life that is not only human, and that our ancestors possibly were visited and interfered with by beings from other places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of that said, I am a rational man.  I want what I saw to be explainable within the framework of our scientific understanding while at the same time, if I trust my instincts and the awe, jaw-dropping moment this created, I can’t help but believe it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time, all of four to five seconds, tops, I stood there asking myself ‘What ((deleted)) is that?’  I have seen shooting stars and meteors.  While there is a chance that this was a meteor, it didn’t look like one.  There was no streaks left in the sky, there was nothing protruding outward from this at all.  Only two red lights, and this thing looked like it was firing towards earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, Berkeley is like most suburban neighborhoods where so few people walk the streets at night.  Thus, when I turned around to see if anyone else just witnessed what I did, there was no one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it were a meteor, there seems to be no reporting from the science community.  This would have made some impression because of its magnificence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend found this discussion forum (http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ndio4/i_think_i_just_saw_a_meteor/) where a woman in San Jose speaks of seeing a meteor but then she says that it looked like a bottle rocket shooting towards earth. I think her mind is trying to make sense of what she witnessed, and seemingly we witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I have. It was so brief and brilliantly impressive.<n>

The saucer was bright white and had small red lights that lined the outer rim of the disk.  There were at least 10 police cars and several semis involved in the escort and in the middle was the UFO, being lit up by spotlights the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When contacting the police about what it might have been, they simply said they had a crashed Semi that needed to be taken off the Interstate…   Semis are not pure white and definitely are NOT disk shaped!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report.  We believe that the object may be the same one that was reported from Kansas, one day earlier.  It appears to be some type of UAV device.  It was photographed by news media, and it had a conventional landing gear and tires.  PD))<n>

I come from new york and have recently moved down to Florida I am amazed on seeing a clear sky full of stars, accept this night there was a over cast and very few many stars out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up i saw a bright ball of fire floating up and to left, I originally thought it was a flare or one of those lanterns that you can light and they fly away.  Until it stopped and was just hovering the clous was behind it and it was bright yellow and orange like fire, I grabbed my cell phone and took a picture of it and as soon as i took a picture it started to move slow, so I took one more shot and it shot into the sky and it was gone.  I have seen planes and helicopters my whole life. I Never seen anything do what it did that night.<n>

It wasn&#39;t too big, maybe 1 foot by 1 foot or bigger, but not too big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprised to see that, and suddenly it turned off and moved up the street where it turned right to my apartment&#39;s street.

I saw that It was like a squared silhouette and then it disappeared, I guess it went flying forwards to the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying over the buildings, not at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really close to Karlovo Namesti in Prague, Czech Republic.<n>

As I followed behind him, he unexpectedly sped up around a sharp curve and proceeded to slam on his brakes.  He hopped out of his truck, sprinted to my vehicle and out of breath, he yelled, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  I listened skeptically as he told me he spotted three bright lights hovering above the clear cut to our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:57 PM: Before I could tell him that I’d have to see it to believe it, a bright light moved slowly, from left to right, below the tree tops in front of us.  This perfectly round light faded out of sight near the top of a group of tall pines.  My attitude immediately shifted from skeptical to alert mixed with a little fear.  We hopped in and drove on to our destination, which was still a solid 1.5 miles straight through the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8:02 PM:  My eyes were glued, and my head was on a swivel.  My windows and windshield were completely fogged over due to my body temperature’s rising.  The floating objects did not make us wait long to confirm their existence once again.  Around the same altitude as the first, two lights appeared to our right, creeping along together.  The other driver pointed toward the lights, and I stopped my vehicle.  The two yellow circles continued moving for a few seconds, then stopped.  When they resumed movement, one light disappeared, while the other remained in motion and faded out of sight.  I wiped the fog off my window as we carried on down the path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8:10 PM:  Convinced the encounter was over, I spotted two more floating lights to my left.  I beeped my horn to notify the other driver I was stopping.  They flew at the same altitude, but they were now in a completely different set of tall pines.  Being in high alert mode, I realized that the lights seemed to be reacting to us (disappearing as we initially rounded the corner, appearing up ahead of us, moving towards our rear whenever we stopped).  Similar to the first pair, one light disappeared while the other slowly flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The yellow lights were constant, with no flashing or flickering.  Even though they were moving slowly, they seed to leave a lighted tail behind them (similar to a comet).  There was no noise of any kind associated with their presence, even though they seemed to be within a 100 yard radius of our trucks.  They stopped and started multiple times, displaying their ability to &#34;hover.&#34;<n>

I remembered that there is going to be a pretty good meteor shower on 12/14 so I looked up to see if there was anything I could see.  As I was watching the sky, I did actually see about 4 shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking almost straight up when something different from what I had seen of the shooting stars showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what it could possibly be.  We have planes flying over our home all time because we live near an airport so I have seen my fair share of lights in the sky.  This object was totally unfamiliar to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a pentagon shape made up of 6 orb-like dull green (swamp green) spheres.  I couldn&#39;t see the actual object (if there was one); only the spheres that made up the shape.  The spheres were located at each point of the pentagon and one in the middle of the object.  The reason I say &#34;orb-like&#34; is because they didn&#39;t emit any light as I would expect them to.  When it came into view, it was as if it were coming out of a cloak.  I could see the object for about 2 seconds (flying straight) before it vanished the same way it came into view (cloaked).  If you were in the dark with a flashlight and something passed by the beam of light, that&#39;s what it looked like except a light shining on this object would have made it more visible in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took a second for me to realize I could have just witnessed a UFO.  I contemplated in my mind what it could possibly have been to no avail.  I stayed outside for a little longer to see if it came back or more could be visible but there was nothing else.  There was not much time to analyze more detail of what I had just seen as it was here and gone so fast (about the speed of a shooting star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finished my cigarette and went inside but didn&#39;t tell my wife about it immediately.  I cleaned up the living room a little bit, grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen. I drew out the shape of the pentagram and showed it to my wife.  I said, &#34;I just saw this in the sky.&#34;  She asked if it had any lights on it and I said no then gave her the description from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside with my camera to try to take some long exposure shots of the sky to see if I could catch anything else but didn&#39;t see anything more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to make sure I remembered what I saw, so explaining it to my wife was my backup.  This morning, I decided to make an animated GIF image of what I had seen.  I tried to make it as accurate as possible so I used a background image of last nights sky.<n>

I looked out the window thinking I would see the sun rising.  Instead, it was more than 20 lights on the mountain side flashing in a pattern very brightly.  They were from one end of the mountain to the other.  Right in the middle of all the lights there was the brightest of them all flashing its own pattern of lights.  This would go on for another two hours.  They would also move around the mountain in a triangular shape then turn all one color.  Orange and red and white where what they would use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the little ones would turn red the others on top would send a white signal to the others and they would turn red.  There was the brightest light on the very tip, it would flash the brightest white light to all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they would form patterns altogether and flash differently! I wish I could provide pictures. It was something we have never seen before. When the sun started to c! ome up around 7:20 am, they weren&#39;t really flashing anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked as if they would try to get into the trees on the mountain to hide a little!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end there were lights coming from above our house that were heading towards the mountain then would disappear in a fast movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see them again!<n>

Even though the light shined directly on me nothing was lit up as far as myself or the area around me.  The object in question went further away with the bright light facing me, than like  leveled out  and  started going in a  sort of a northwest direction  than  it  just disappeared without getting smaller.  Like  someone turned the lights off.  It was kind of overcast up in the sky.

I fired 23 continuous frames in high speed mode using a RC D700 Nikon.  I focused on the stars and started taking a series of rapid fire images.  I had to focus on a star, and set the lens to manual, then start the burst of frames with the remote control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I loaded the data into the computer, one of the objects thought to be a star was in motion.

I noticed that it was much brighter than earlier because the moon was visible in the NE sky (the cloud cover had mostly cleared).  As I was looking northward to see how much the cloud cover had cleared, I noticed a bright orangish light become visible over/between some houses to the NNW of mine.  The light was intensely orange, but not like a flare or roman candle, roughly roundish in shape, and initially was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm&#39;s length (roughly a quarter-inch in diameter).  It initially attracted my attention because it was much brighter than the usual planes and helicopters that fly overhead, and because of the odd color which was unlike the usual air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to arc upwards and towards me before moving parallel eastward above two houses across the street, then gained altitude and disappeared to the north.  It was visible for approximately two minutes, moving at a slow, steady pace.  As the light moved eastward, it became more yellow-orange in color (though orange was still the primary color) and seemed to strobe slightly or perhaps flicker like flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the light, I watched it for 20-30 seconds before backing up on my deck to the door and yelling for my wife to come see it too.   She arrived promptly and was able to view it for approximately 45 seconds.  We went back in at 8:04pm after spending roughly 60 seconds after it disappeared watching to see if anything else became visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about it overnight, I suppose the object could have been a Chinese lantern.  The light never looked like flame and seemed a lot brighter than that relative to its distance, but I suppose it could have been a glow inside a paper orb.  The apparent direction (SouthEast, East, then North) could have been an illusion and the actual direction more of a straight eastward arc with the light burning brightly at first (thus larger), then lessening (thus seeming to move northwards).  However, if so the launch was pretty much a failure (the lantern would have risen in one neighborhood and burned out in another a mile or so apart).<n>

I was in the passenger&#39;s side and I looked out the window towards the East.  Then I looked up and see two bright objects that were going really fast towards each other.  I told my sister &#34;they&#39;re about to collide!&#34; She then looks out and sees them about to collide too. Then right before they hit they turned really fast and started spinning around each other.  We turned East on County Road 42 and pulled the car over at 6:01 eastern standard time and called my mom to report it. We looked out the window as I was talking to my mom and they fly apart and they started to hover. When they were hovering they looked like big bright stars or big balls of light, as if you were looking at a planet (smaller than the moon but bigger than a star and really bright).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for about a minute before pulling away but we were still watching them hover. We watched them for about 5 minutes more before we pulled over again.  We then got out of the car and took some pictures on my sister&#39;s phone.  We then got some pizza for dinner and went home. We then went inside and told our parents.  We went back outside and looked into the sky. We showed our parents where we thought there was one UFO still there, we couldn&#39;t find the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After eating and talking about it, my mom said we could go out to the airport and see if anything has been reported.   So we get back into the car and drive back on 15 going north and turn east onto county road 42 again following the same path as before.  We showed her where we pulled over and then drove on to the airport nearby.  The airport was closed so we went to where the sheriff&#39;s dept had been but there was no one to talk to there either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we drove home and when we got back,  both lights were gone.  I then called the National UFO reporting center and reported it.<n>

Then he yelled that they were about to hit.  I lean forward as I’m driving and look up just in time to see what looked like to be two super bright huge stars flying towards each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden they began sort of colliding and going in really fast circles around each other. It lasted maybe 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned left, going east onto County Road 42, they flew back away from each other and stayed stationary in the sky.  I put my flashers on and pulled to the side of the road.  A random person coming the other way stopped to see if we were alright.  I said yes and they continued driving.  I got out of the car and looked up and they were still, as if they were planets.  We kept an eye on them the whole time we were out and until we got home.<n>

I download my iPhone photos and to see my surprise I saw a cluster of 3 white lights high above. I was taking photos using the passenger mirror. This is no trick.  Also I seen a orb on 12/3/2011 next to a charter plane.  Near Portland airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Time: 7:16pm Day/Night:  Nighttime   No. of Witnesses:  1 Duration: 1 minute   Appearance / Description of Object(s)  cluster of 3 balls of light UFO in the sky behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at it taking photo&#39;s it was so blurry it was pulsating. Just all 3 big balls of light together.  No unusual sounds.  There were no beams at the time just what I described. It didn&#39;t move by the photo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of Object(s)  The scale of the one light, comparing to a plane just over my head just about tree level was around the size of a street light.  There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Area / Surroundings We are near a think rural area.  Close to Route 112 about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height. Also the nearest airport is 3.5 miles.  It is a charter plane airport only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description &amp; Details I am educated in the UFO and abductions for 6 years now.  This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months.  I am a amateur photographer as well and have a sharp eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The family on 12/11/2011 stopped at a house full of lights.  It probably lit up the sky!  We are near a think rural area. We were near Route 112 north about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 7:16pm.  No moon. Clear sky, a few stars. We were listening to music.  Everything was working in the van and running.  I put down my window where it was a unusual warm December. I put the side window down.  The kids were pointing and looking out our van window. I thought it was cute so I took many photo&#39;s less than 1 minute.  I do remember quickly, only because I was into watching and listening my kids. The object in the sky in the mirror was very blurry to the naked eye. It was pulsating. Just said to myself, what the heck is that. So I ignored it. The closet thing I can describe was a strobe light. I have seen all planes shapes and sizes. During the day and night. For 3 years I even lived next to a airport. I know it was no plane. There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light. Just all 3 big balls of light together. No unusual sounds outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I download them and always delete no good photo&#39;s. To my surprise, there it was clear as day a I got 7 total with the mirror shot. The first one the UFO is not there. Then the next 6 in the mirror there is a cluster of 3 white lights, and what the camera got was a clear shot of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? no, I seen them all in the sky night and day and know there sounds. I seen a commit and watch satellites as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Background I have my HS diploma. I took 2 year of business clerical. I flagged for about 3 years. I am a artist and photographer. I love details in all art work. I am married for 10 years and love being a mom /HM. I hope someday to volunteer for my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Views on UFOs, before and after sighting I am educated in the UFO and abductions for 6 years now. This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months. my first was 2005. I was looking at stars and seen one &#34;star&#34; same color and size, move close to another &#34;star&#34; and at the same time they took off in a blink of an eye. I always believe, even as a child growing up in a sheltered life. I just know. I read all reports and books on the subject and want to work in this field down the road. I also watch many tv shows about real sightings. I will also add my other photo&#39;s another day. There&#39;s something going on in Maine. I also seen a report and a photo of a UFO on 12/11/2011. I also studying when I can on Ancient History, abductions. I am a amateur photographer as well and have a sharp eye.<n>

It was odd in that the light was there for such a long time.  I could not determine the distance the dot of light was from me, but when I first noticed it is was about 30 deg. above the horizon and 20 degrees south of east.  Over the 50 minutes I watched it it slowly moved to the south until it was about 50 degrees south of east.  I tried to get a short movie of it, but as I looked at what I captured today, I don&#39;t see any image from my camera.  Other info is:  I believe it was a long ways off, maybe a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It twinkled.  It looked like white, then green, then blueish light and repeating those colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed this at 9:30 PM and watched it until 10:20 PM when I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a small aircraft that was going approx. due south that was east of me by a half mile and they might have seen what I saw if they looked to their left.  That aircraft flew by around 9:50, but I did not note the exact time.  The airport near here may know about that small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to guess what it was I would say it was a helicopter hoovering high in the sky.<n>

I dont know if it was the S-R Blackbird or not. i did not have enough time to take out my camera to take a picture.  I dont know if it left a trail it was too dark to tell.

I wouldn&#39;t have given it a second look until I noticed a sharp blue color radiating from the light source.  My wife and I then stood outside our home and observed the object which constantly changed from red to bright blue, and briefly to white.  It seemed to move slowly around in a small circle for several turns before moving a short distance across the sky and repeating the process.  We continued to observe the object until it went below the tree line in the distance.  There was no sound, and normal air traffic was visible in the area which made it easier for us to quickly determine that it wasn&#39;t a plane.  As I stated before, its ability to fade from vibrant red to blue is what made this object stand out to me.  I could tell it was at a relatively  high altitude due to the fact that it would become briefly obscured by a nearby cloud.  I have ! never observed an object moving through the sky in such a manner, and clearly have no idea what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

12/10/11 17:30|Ocotillo Wells (Near)|CA|Light|about 3 hrs|More "Ghost Lights" in Anza- Borrego|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87194.html|401|ndxe201112| More &#34;Ghost Lights&#34; in Anza- Borrego<n> <n><n> <n><n> This series of sitings took place on Dec.10, 2011, from approximately 5:30PM-10PM. There were three separate, distinct sitings in different areas of the visible expanse as well as numerous sitings of lights following airliners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only recently filed a report with The National UFO Reporting Center of a sighting which I had in 1994 in the exact same location.  I erroneously called the campground &#34;Mountain Springs&#34; in that recounting but actually it was MOUNTAIN PALM SPRINGS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after sunset, while still barely light, perhaps at 5:30 pm on this date, while facing east from the Mountain Palm Springs Campground in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego County, I observed a series of lights abruptly appear at the crest of a nearby mountain called &#34;the Coyote Mountains&#34;. I estimate that it is roughly seven air miles from the campground. The lights were clearly at the crest of the mountain as I could still plainly see its outline. The lights were arranged roughly the same as on an automobile ( Which I assumed that it was) two amber lights froward ( There was a smog haze that evening so I was not surprised that headlights might appear amber.) and two smaller amber lights in the rear of the &#34;vehicle&#34; instead of the legal red. I assumed that it was a dune buggy as that is a general area of their use or perhaps a military, ranger or Border Patrol truck.The &#34;vehicle&#34; made an emergency stop as if in fear that it would plunge over a cliff which i! t would have had it ben a car. It sat there momentarily and then slowly backed-down or &#34;lowered&#34; itself out of my sight but then briefly partly returned just to as quickly retreat. I did not see it again.. I thought little of it and reminded myself to check the map again tomorrow to try to determine its size. I did use my binoculars ( 10x52) at the time but the distance between the &#34;headlights&#34; could not be determined at night. The following day, using both my binoculars and the detailed map I realized that the &#34;headlamps&#34; had to have been many yards apart ( 100 plus yards?) and could therefore not have been a motor vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only a short time later, with the darkness near complete, I observed another set of lights rise up rather slowly over the next mountain farther away, called Superstition Mtn. It was perhaps ten plus air miles distant from me. This light lasted much longer, also made a very slow retraction behind that mountain only to return doing this maybe three times. Through the binoculars the light or object appeared to be a giant flower type of shape with the &#34;stem&#34; and backside of the &#34;blossom&#34; not lit but the petals were amber convex lights. Another way to describe it was as if the lights were part of a honeycomb in the center of the flower. Due to the distance away it must have been a huge object. The altitude of these two mountains are maybe 2500 feet and both completely surrounded by desert very near sea level. This object appeared to face north, that is the lights were faced in that direction and I was west of it observing in profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, it gets worse (or better depending on your interest.). At 7:00 PM ( This time I wrote the time down) a dancing light that looked much like a star or planet appeared to the north of my position in an area that I know has no geographical feature. It was one of the first &#34;stars&#34; to appear that night but as it moved up and down and side to side in a kind of rough oval maneuver I knew it must be an aircraft. However I could not understand why a helicopter ( No other aircraft that I know of could make this jerky maneuver) would waste its time doing this for one hour when it finally apparently disappeared. My attention was drawn else wear so I did not see it depart. The following morning I checked that area out ( Though I already knew it well) and determined that it could not have been something in the far distance on a mountain as they are more than thirty miles away and below the horizon from my relative location. It appeared to be roughly over an area called Box Canyon. It! s location and motions exactly matches descriptions of one of the so-called &#34;ghost lights&#34; famous in Anza-Borrego folklore of which information is easily found on the web. No one knows what they are though there are many strange theories and/or excuses from actual ghost spirits to bizarre pseudo-scientific theories involving metallurgy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more. This area is a flyway for aircraft heading from the east to San Diego and or Hawaii as well as military aircraft to and from the many bases to the north in California and into or from bases in Arizona. There is also visible air traffic to and from LAX and destinations beyond. Of course there are also some general aviation aircraft in this mix. As I watched these obvious aircraft I noted that each and nearly everyone was either being followed or led by a small white dot of light that &#34;flitted&#34; about in its general flight path as opposed to the smooth movements of the known airplane. I tried to objectively explain this to myself but could not. Naturally as with previous long term sightings I grew bored and turned in for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the days that followed numerous military helicopters, armed with rocket pods and door gunners, scoured this area at low altitude.  I followed them up to the location of Box Canyon where two actually touched their skids down on a craggy mountain top not two hundred of yards from me. They were unable to set down there so I found it strange that they would perform that dangerous maneuver. They then went over this rise and could be heard landing or perhaps hovering on the other side out of my view. I believe that they did not like me viewing them especially with my binoculars. There were no markings on these craft but they were painted in military camouflage. Also, this is important, this is NOT a military base or practice area but a state park yet they spent several days flying in and amongst these dangerous canyons! Those who are pilots understand this. There are many thousands of square miles to practice combat activity yet here they were instead. I identified all of these ! military craft as Huey Hog gunships and concluded that they were likely USMC or Reserve. The venerable Huey, though a quality craft, has been considered obsolete for decades though still in use especially with the Marine Corp. Notably, USMSC and USN air bases are not that far distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed in this campground for five nights and did NOT witness ANY of these phenomenon again that week. After exploring other campgrounds for more than one week in Borrego and the Southern Mojave as well as SW Arizona, where I saw no unusual activity at all, I returned to Mountain Palm Springs again for two nights and observed no other phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I had  an inexpensive digital video camera with me I consciously decided not to use it as it is old and has poor pixelation. Any lights witnessed would not appear unusual in a video. Indeed I am frustrated by digital video and still-photography in this regard. Footage of unusual night time aerial activity is not well documented this way. Old fashioned film is much better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am planning to return on March 13, 2012 for a further investigation.<n>

I went out, with another of my neighbour, to her place and we found her in a shocked position.  She asked us to see up and we saw 2 oddly shaped things flying in the sky.  They looked like a box but their shape did not match that of a typical box i.e. cube or cuboid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing we noticed was a circular disc of white colour vertically around that orange coloured box.  Any seperate features like doors or windows were not visible.  Both these box-like planes moved, infact rotated on its circular ring (like a ball), at a constant speed of about 300kmph.  We could guess their speed because of an aeroplane which was about to land at the Chandigarh airport, and these things passed from right in front of that plane.  Distance between them and the airplane at the nearest point would definitely had been less than a thousand feet.  They were at equal height with that plane and produced no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their size was more or less equal to that plane (height more than the plane but lesser in length).  Their flying path was north-south while airplane&#39;s path was east-west.  It was a clear saturday evening with the sunset still an hour and a half away.  There were no fog or clouds in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our apartment is situated immediately next to the Chandigarh airport and I have been living here since june, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t take any photograph as the only camera we have is in the mobile of my son and he had gone to a relative&#39;s place with my parents just few minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate time or date.

There is a tree line across the street and the light seemed to come up from behind them.  The light was gaining altitude very slowly and the red light was pulsing.  I did not hear any noise or sounds.  There is a helicopter pad about 1-2 miles from my house.  I am very familiar with the sounds and lights as they often do night flights.  This red pulsing light immediately got my attention because it was much brighter than any of the lights I have seen from the helicopters over the past 10 years and because I have only seen much smaller white lights on the helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red pulsing light was much brighter and much larger even though it was not directly above my house.

Flying South over Allston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommates and I (we are all engineering students), were on our deck, and I noticed an orange object coming in our direction.  The object was moving south-southeast and flew directly over us. No real definition of shape could be made out other than the fact that it was glowing and flickering. The shape seemed to be an oval or circular type shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially we suspected a possible plane on fire or something of that nature, but the plane was flying AWAY from the airport and not falling in altitude.  Constant speed was maintained. I&#39;m not able to say exactly how fast it was moving, but it was fairly quick.  About 30 seconds after flying directly over us, the object steered in the south-southwestern direction and seemed to gain stay very horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most detailed memory of the event is when the object flew directly over us and it seemed to be on fire. It was fairly low altitude.  The object was also very blurry.<n>

It was a cloudy that night. I was facing toward the south &amp; I happen to catch a row of six circular white lights moving slowly downwards. The object was about a block away. I pointed at the object to show my neighbors &amp; to make sure I wasn’t the only one seeing it.Their mouths dropped when they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving downwards in a diagonal direction to the right &amp; was moving around in a circular motion while doing this. It was a relatively large object, I wouldn’t say larger than the moon though, maybe half the size of the moon if you were looking at the two side by side in the sky.  It was moving really slow at first so I ran off the porch &amp; snapped a couple of pictures of it on my iPhone.  It looked like it was pretty close to the surface, definitely not the height a plane would be traveling at. It started to pick up speed &amp; soon it vanished behind the trees.  I tried running around the corner to see if I could look through the trees, but didn’t catch any suspicious lights.  The neighborhood dogs started barking &amp; I heard a strange ringing in my left ear.  After that I got freaked out &amp; ran back to my neighbor’s porch.<n>

While driving I notice a flickering red orb to the left of my vehicle,just behind some trees less than a  few meters away.  A red flag immediately went off in my mind, since there were no roads parallel to the one I was travelling in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb travelled exactly the speed of my car winding along the roadside as my vehicle had to make  a left and a right to follow the path of the road.  My vehicle had to stop since the road was still blocked in preparations for repairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects flew straight past my car following the road and then made a right.  I remember being so terrified but curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called one of my friends at the time to stay on the phone with me.  The road that the orbs flew into was accessible to me from another path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive took me about 15 minutes all the while I kept searching for signs of the o! rbs.  At last I reached an empty field and there above it were two flickering red orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Terrified I sat in my car with my windows down listening for any noises there were none.  They just flickered in silence no higher than 20 feet, seemed about half a meter in diameter.   All the time I was on the phone with a friend telling her what was happening, eventually my fear and her concerns convinced  me to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These events are all true and I am more than willing to take any lie detector test.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am from Trinidad, ((specialty and level deleted)) school teacher.  I believe an investigation needs to be done.  But people never report things here for fear of being horrendously ridiculed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched thru Meade binoculars with a built in digital video camera.  My brother and his girlfriend were watching too and also my three kids ages 12, 10 and 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two aunts next door also saw and described the same sight.  It had flashing like colors of red, blue, green, yellow, eventually purple and aqua that seemed to come from the top of the craft.  It seemed to have a triangular look to part of it but there seemed to be more to the object that couldn&#39;t be distinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors seemed to illuminate from the inside and seemed to have an outer layer that spun around causing the colors to seem to blink very rapid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving so slowly that for awhile it seemed it wasn&#39;t moving.  After it slowly made its way high up into the sky we noticed an airplane approaching from the south towards the object and the pl! ane was going FAST!   The plane passed by not too far from the object and just kept flying. Awhile later we noticed four other crafts farther away but not so high.  They had the same type lights and were ascending slowly too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the first object for over two hours and after a few hours it just looked like the brightest star in the sky.  Then we saw the others and watched them for a while and then we went to bed.<n>

It was very bright, so I asked my husband to bring up his star chart on his phone, to see what star it was.  I went outside and angled the phone to the sky and there was not a star on it that showed that it should have been there.  Surprised by this, I went back inside and grabbed my video camera.  I took a few minutes of film of it olny, because my battery was going dead, but within 15 min. it was gone.  Just vanished! It was a clear night, but very cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported a sighting about a month ago, and this one looked just like the other one, but not seadly moving and without the helicoper present.<n>

I looked and seen a light. Green.  Then it went out and another and another and again and again.  Maybe more than eight.  Clearly not moving much and hovering silently. When it was over I went back in. 20min later I again heard another sonic boom over the ocean and looked again.  Those lights I never seen again, but I looked up and seen high flying jets really moving over and out to see.  About 8 of them.  They had blinking lights typical, but the other ones looked like they were screwing with people.  On off.  On for longer and off. Over here.  Over there. No excuse for the pattern they used or didn&#39;t use.  They had to have been wanted everyone to see. Who knows.  Lights looked normal, but the behavior was what caught my attention. Same lights seen in holden beach video on the internet is like what I seen. That&#39;s it. I guess that was a two event moment.  The other high flying jets riding in pair formation aproxamently 8 were hauling butt  but, high altitude and American. Stealth maybe??  But what were the lights before they flew over? I couldn&#39;t get my phone to record before they were gone or lights out.  True?<n>

Then the first one disappeared and a forth appeared to the right of the two that were connected.  After that, they all disappeared.  We got out of the car, and we saw the flashing lights which appeared to be military jets - they were moving very fast.  At first we saw two, and then a third.  They were flying back and forth across the sky (in all different directions).  As we watched, one of them appeared to have a red light shoot out from the side of it (I think this could have been another jet that had been flying close to the other, but I&#39;m not sure.

It was moving towards the ground it seemed, and it couldn&#39;t have been very high because of how ridiculously fast it was going.  There was also a pretty dense cloud cover in the direction i was looking and it looked like it was below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In what to include in this form, it says to describe my background.  I&#39;m not totally sure if that means my credibility as far as my story goes or my surroundings as to where i was at the moment, but its reasonably dark outside and there were no cars or anything on my street and in a completely different direction from the closest airport.  And as far as my credibility goes, I&#39;m just an average guy, and somewhat of a skeptic, and it freaked me out enough to Google what to do when i want to report something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars before, and tons of airplanes and helicopters, and i have definitely never seen anything like that before.  My mom said about a month ago she saw 15-20 lights behind my house that seemed to be moving really slowly together like it was one big object, but i dismissed it as being airplanes or something.<n>

I came out onto the balcony at around 10:30pm EST to smoke a cigarette and immediately saw 3 bright orange/red lights in a perfect triangular formation in the sky, over the ocean, more so in the Northern direction.  I yelled for my roommates to come look.  The lights blinked at each other almost like they were communicating something.  The intervals of blinking were not consistent at all and the lights were not normal color, or brightness for any aircraft. after about 10 seconds of me watching, the lights disappeared immediately.  About 30 seconds later 5 to 7 smaller white lights were in the same area.  These lights were blinking irregular intervals also. Sometimes what appeared to be just one light, would all of a sudden turn to 3 lights in a cluster, but then again, not arranged in any normal way that a normal aircrafts running lights would be arranged.  I&#39;m positive these white li! ghts were traveling high speeds due to the amount of distance it covered in a small amount of time, compared to how high, and far they were.  It looked as if there were vague silhouettes I could see around each object as they blinked.  They darted across the sky heading south then abruptly turned back north  as if they were being chased and continued until all the lights vanished. They did not fade away, and there were no clouds.  They just stopped. I could not distinguish a shape of the aircraft because it was nighttime, but i could see the formations, lights, speeds, etc.  I am the type of person who you cannot convince something is real by just telling me.  I like facts and details.  I will try my best to catch this on HD camera, because this is not a rare occurrence for this area for some reason.<n>

I remain skeptical about it but I am curious and I cannot conceive any reasonable explanation for what I saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the home of my sister, in a northwesterly direction, I observed some lighted object.  I saw red, blue and green lights as well as a constant white glow coming from the object.  The flickering which I observed could be a atmospheric distortion, though the colors did seem to alternate or flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be hovering above the mountain range which is near Monarch Mountain.  It did appear to make some lateral and vertical changes of position but primarily remained fixed in it&#39;s position.  Near the end of the 30 minutes which I spent watching, an aircraft overflew the house and traveled seemingly near to but above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am told that this is a frequent occurance, and that the objects often have very rapid changes of position both lateral and vertical relative to the observer.  One observer has reported having been chased or attacked by them on one occasion.<n>

It appeared to be too close to be a star but also not moving,so I decided to check on it once in a while. The next time I looked at it,about 10 minutes later,it had moved a considerable distance west towards Shell Lake. My boyfriend also saw it. He walked outside and told me to come look at it out there because it has gotten closer and lower in the sky. It was close enough for us to see the colors. My boyfriend estimated it to be between 1 and 2 miles away in the woods. They were flashing red,green,and blue. It was round or maybe oval. We both watched it very slowly make its way to the ground. It was in and out of view for us,as it was moving through trees. It moved so slowly that we went back inside our apartment. About 5 minutes later my boyfriend looked outside a different window and saw the light completely gone,followed by an explosion of light that illuminated all the trees ar! ound it. He said it was a big area of light.  The light explosion only lasted only a few seconds. We assumed it landed,and shut its lights off because we were unable to see it anymore. Later on we were driving to the gas station and saw it moving east towards Long Lake higher up in the sky. We have both seen this same flashing colors type of light multiple times,usually while driving. We have sighted it in Long Lake,Spooner,Shell Lake,and Rice Lake. It is usually hovering or moving slowly. It usually appears mostly blue in the sky. There has been no order to the days we have sseen it,just at random. They have all been in December of 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were “Am I really seeing this?” the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large; it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I’m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.  I’m trying to recall my story of my first encounter of the flying object.<n>

Over towards the ridge of sea tac and tukwila was a bright light in the sky.  Just over horizon, about the same distance as a plane in landing mode.  The orb of light was a stand still for about four min.  The light was very bright and then would dim down to a tiny star size speck then get bright and full orb again.  It looked like it might have had some red.  And green lights spinning around it but the white orb was so bright.  I looked up on the internet if a plane can look like it is at a stand still and.  Found out yes but only if the plane and air are the same speed.   Planes were coming in for landings at the same time this object was in the sky.. I have tried to think of all logical explanations.  It was very strange.  It was also a very clear night so the light couldn&#39;t have been reflecting off the clouds to give the orbed look.  Four days earlier at the same time (9pm) my roomie and husband (I was as! leep) saw the exact same orb and l didn&#39;t believe them. Now I do. Since it was near the airport you could hear the planes but not the orbed light. It made no sound. Plz look into this. Thank-youit was also too dark to take pictures.

My girlfriend and I were astonished at what we we&#39;re seeing and my heart dropped because I felt something serious was happening my first that was asteroids but they were movie to oddly then I realized there were human aircraft all over converging to thees figures within 10 minutes of seeing this I counted 15 human aircraft as the human aircraft moved in thees figures increased in speed and manuverd away almost got higher into the ski they one bye one disappeared in the groups they were in human aircraft has in creased since then I have counted 30 as of now very high to very low in the sky I asked a some! one else to look in the sky and tell me what they noticed and they agreed that there were a were a abnormal amount of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it don&#39;t know what this was and while it was amazing to witness it was also very frightening I also have video taped this as best as I could on my phone but I don&#39;t feel it is of any credit to what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I definately just witnessed the same this as this person did on 8-12-11.  It was like 25 objects or so.  They were all flying from The direction of Edewood and were flying towards the direction of Forest Hill.  Flying directly over the center of Bel Air.  It was definately pretty scary!! Not sure what it was but it looked wierd as crap.  It was flying from the direction of the military base here so it could have been from that.  I dont know but it was pretty amazing to watch.<n>

After about 4 minutes when I finished washing the baby I took  her to the living room to feed her, as I was sitting on the couch putting her pajamas, I looked to the backyard thru the glass doors in the living room and I saw something I will never forget or seem before, aqua color lights illuminated the whole yard I could see everything in the yard like it was daytime but aq! ua color.  At the same time that I was seeing the yard illuminated I felt the vibration again on the tile floor and I heard the noise again. The light lasted about 6 seconds, then it was dark.  Then after 1 minute my son came running from his room in tears and trembling, his whole body could not stop shivering, he started telling me &#34;Mommy I saw a blue light thru my window so looked outside the window and I saw a round shape thing, all silver with blue rectangular lights around the middle and it was floating in the air, and I also saw sparks coming out of the electricity post in the corner as this thing went by.  While my son is shaking telling me this in the living room, my daughter, my son and I see the yard light up again, and then for the third time felt the vibration and heard the noise, then after a few seconds the light went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started trembling holding my daughter and son,  then I called my husband and tried to explain, he said call the police.  I called 911 right ! away and told them that something strange was outside my house! and abo ut the lights and vibration, about 20 minutes later I heard a helicopter circling around the house, and them it left. They cops never came in cars or talk to me. My son saw this object from about 10 feet away.<n>

It was brighter then the North Star which was also in my line of sight looking South West &amp; up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned a few inches to the South West to see the moon the light was still dropping to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned quickly and mentioned it to the person on the phone as I watched it drop slowly, then quickly disappear to the South West (as if it took a quick right turn).<n>

But having witnessed many shooting stars from my permanent home it wouldn’t have been visible for that long when I was slowing down the car to watch this super bright white object descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterward it straightened out horizontally for a second or two and then disappeared completely. No more abnormally bright sphere present in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate exclaims to me, &#34;Did you see that!&#34;   I reply,  &#34;Yes, we just saw a UFO!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Approximately at 6:17 pm, there was a bright orange light that came from the north east heading south at a 45 degree angle.  It was like a ball of light, but it was not round.   It was bigger than a planet but smaller then the moon.  It stopped a few hundred feet above the neighborhood that is north of the beach.  It hovered in one place for a minute to two minutes.  I could not hear if it made a sound because I was walking right next to the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then headed upwards at another 45 degree angle away from me towards the northern direction.

We took the next exit ramp to get back north-bound on the 805 to try and film it, but the phone camera wasn&#39;t equipped to handle the distance and low light.  As we got closer to the bridge where it hovered, it began to ascend straight up (perpendicular to the bridge) and then it stopped to change direction to ~45 degrees up, and westwardly. It turned from an orange glow to a bright red the farther it went.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
12/4/11 02:00|Seaton (UK/England)||Unknown|30 minutes|Strange orange light moving erratically around the Orion's belt location, dec 2011.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85653.html|472|ndxe201112| Strange orange light moving erratically around the Orion&#39;s belt location, dec 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: December, 4, 2011  Location: Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom  Summary: Strange light, orange - red in colour. Mainly just above Orion&#39;s belt but moving constantly with erratic movements. Somewhat similar to a Chinese lantern however I&#39;ve set lanterns off. I watched this light for a length of time, any Chinese lantern would of burnt out long before. Nothing like a satellite or meteorite I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Time: 02.10am Day/Night: Night time No. of Witnesses: 2 Duration: 30 minutes minimum  Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Definitely orangey-red in colour. Size I couldn&#39;t even guess nor the shape except it definitely didn&#39;t look spherical. Sorry I can&#39;t be more precise. The brightness varied. It kept fading and brightening up again. At one point it became quite bright before fading again, that&#39;s when I saw some kind of non spherical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of Object(s):  Afraid I couldn&#39;t even hazard a guess. Estimating sizes I just can&#39;t do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Area / Surroundings:  I live right on the South coast of England. A little town called Seaton. Very small town, very very little light pollution and to my knowledge no military bases in the surrounding area nor power plants. No weather or research stations. Just a quiet little seaside fishing areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description &amp; Details:  So I was having a smoke from my balcony and saw this. As I said. It was most definitely an Orange-Red colour, very bright and clear. I first noticed it just above Orion&#39;s belt and to the left. At first I thought it was simply something you could see at this time of year, a planet maybe or a bright star of note. I thought I was seeing things at first, but after watching for some time it was definitely moving. It&#39;s movement was erratic, there seemed to be no pattern as such except a vague circular motion as it travelled right towards Orion&#39;s belt. It stayed there for sometime, flitting up, down, left and right in no particular order. The whole time it was getting brighter as if moving closer or becoming more intense and then fading again until it disappeared. This is when I thought it was a Chinese lantern. Just as I was about to head back in after finishing my smoke, it suddenly appeared again, this time lower down and back left of Orion&#39;s belt. It made the same vague circula! r movement before fading and appearing back above Orion&#39;s belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to get my phone, but, unfortunately the video cam on it wasn&#39;t good enough to get any footage. I ran in, checked the internet. Several things are visible in our skies around this time of year but none of them correlate to what I was seeing and definitely nothing matching the movement. So I went back to the balcony to watch. It was still above Orion&#39;s belt, flitting about in all directions still. It didn&#39;t seem to stay in one place statically. It wasn&#39;t moving particular fast, but definitely enough to notice it was never static. While I was watching this second time it almost looked as if it was coming closer. For a brief couple of second whatever it was looked like it turned and I could clearly see some kind of shape. It wasn&#39;t just a spherical item, it definitely had shape. What shape exactly I can&#39;t be sure of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in to contact a couple of friends to see if they could see it as well. Unfortunately just as I&#39;d sent the message our skies became overcast and clouds prevented me from seeing anything. This has happened literally within the hour. I was watching it for a good 20 minutes - half an hour before trying to see if anyone else could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object?  I can&#39;t be 100% sure obviously. But I have checked charts online and various websites. I can&#39;t find anything that could explain something of this colour, distance or location for this time of the year. It didn&#39;t resemble a meteorite or satellite in any way I&#39;ve seen before and a Chinese lantern would of burnt out within the time I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a believer in life other than ours.  I believe in a lot of spiritual beliefs, energy based beliefs, the paranormal.  Anything where there is no proof that it cannot exist,  I believe however I haven&#39;t ever seen any UFO sightings to my knowledge before this encounter.<n>

He came in and asked me to come out side with him to look at this light he saw in the sky. We both went out side and started to check out the light. At the begining I thought it was a plane but then I notice that it was not since it didn&#39;t have any of the strobe light blinkers only the redish amber light surronding it. It moved straight really slowlly then it moved to the right it stoped for about 1 to 2 minutes, then it started to move left really slowly. We then saw that the craft starting to drop some kind of smaller lights the same color we counted about five or so. It was also making some king of pulsating huming noice. All of a sudden the lights went from amber red to bright white lights for about 15 seconds. The craft keeps moving east at a steady slow speed droping a few more amber lights then the craft started to get higher until it dissapear, unf! ortunately we did not have a camera to take pictures or video tape it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object we saw had no distinguishable features, it was just bright. I then pulled over and we watched it for about 3-6 minutes. We were facing East/Southeast at this time.  The light was heading north towards our location and the veered east and appeared to stop in mid air. It then reversed its heading and went back to where it made its initial turn. It then just stayed there.  During this time I had rolled down my window and there was no sound, neither propeller or jet. The object then appeared to be getting dim, losing about half of its brightness.  Then all of the sudden something (it was to undistinguishable for us to tell if it had broken off, or was some part of the craft) came off of the craft going straight down towards earth.  This new object was the same color as the origin! al object but looked like a mortar being shot on the 4th of July but about half way down it completely disappeared.  Then about 3-5 seconds later, the original object disappeared as well.  We stayed and watched for about a minute longer, but nothing more happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know how to explain this.  The object was slowly moving and making irregular turns and stops in mid air.  My head was out the window, and there was no sound that would come from an aircraft, there was no plane in sight.  This was also a cloudy night with no visible stars, or known aircraft.  The object was brighter than any star and much larger. We would really like to be contacted by an investigator that could possibly help explain what we saw, because we&#39;re at a loss.<n>

I checked the internet just now and so far, nothing on the news. I was driving West on 256 just past I-65. I realize this was relatively close to the Clark Co. airport, but at this height 40-60 feet it would have been crashing and either much too large or much to close to one another. It was not moving.  I rolled down the window and slowed to nearly a stop to look and listen. It/they were completely silent, triangular shaped, and 40 feet in length from lights at the points. Lights were orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is strange is the fact that just moments before on the North side of 265, just past 65 in Clark County I had seen an extremely bright, white light near the trailer park approximately the size of an Olympic swimming pool (but round in shape) that came from nowhere, lasted maybe three seconds and went out like a switch was flipped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at the Charlestown Road exit to get a look and the hovering object(s) had vanished. I know at least four other cars in front of me saw it too, they slowed down and I could even see a passenger in one car point at it as if to ask, &#34;Do you see that too?&#34;  I am quite shaken, and a little sick to my stomach.  This wasn&#39;t anything remotely resembling any &#39;normal&#39; aircraft in shape and wasn&#39;t like any plane or a helicopter I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 seconds before the events, the radio broadcast of the Big Ten Championship game that I was listening too cut out. I thought it was a broadcast error and turned off the radio. I didn&#39;t turn the radio back on for several minutes after the event. The broadcast was back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a male. Mid thirties. Caucasian. Married. Children. College educated.  Employed.  I don&#39;t care about any kind of recognition, in fact I would prefer none.  But I would love an explanation of what I just saw. I will answer questions if you need more info.<n>

I immediately looked up and saw something either solid black or something of no mass at all.  What I did see was 3 lights, like very bright stars, in the formation of a triangle flying towards the ocean(east).  I live 3 blocks off the ocean right in the center of jacksonville beach, near the outdoor amphitheater.  The triangle object, or 3 lights in perfect formation slowly glided away from us heading east over the ocean.  The ocean-spray atmosphere made it harder to see the the object as it flew away, but it was definitely something very bright and very large with intelligence controlling it&#39;s motion and direction.  I&#39;d say it was about 1,000 to 2,000 feet off the ground(about helicopter flying altitude maybe); and it was huge, probably hundreds of feet between each point of the triangle.  Oh and there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And he said he didn’t think so but he didn’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we were talking about it and I said to him that I thought it was a U.F.O. which I wasn’t using the term as a flying saucer but as something that was unidentifiable and flying/falling and it was a object, it was in our view for less then 5 seconds and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area we were in and where it disappeared was a clear night and nothing to disappear behind such as buildings or trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time and date of the sighting was on December 3, 2011 between 7:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. not sure of the exact time because I didn’t think to look at the clock until after we got to our destination in Vienna Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were three people in the airplane. Two of us were pilots with around 100 hours, and one other person who was not a pilot.  As we took off and turned towards the proper heading we notice three bright lights off the left wing south of the airport.  At first glance we thought it was a large jet then we noticed there were not any position lights, beacon, etc., and the craft was entirely too low to be a craft of that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we paid more attention we noticed there appeared to be three different craft in a tight formation.   This gave us the last clue that these craft were probably not anything we’ve ever seen before.  Flying in a tight formation at night is dangerous, and keeping it that consistent would be nearly impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were climbing out of three thousand feet and I would estimate the three UFOs were at one thousand feet above the ground.    As we looked down on the three craft they seemed to cycle positions in the formation, cut hard to the left, and took off over the city.  All the people in the plane lost sight of the craft at this point.<n>

As it descended towards the horizon, it broke into three distinct lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had me on my cell phone at that point, and I came out on our deck to observe.  I saw the three lights.  From our vantage point, they seemed to be just West of AK Steel.   The lights hovered for several minutes in various triangular formations, sometimes flickering out and reappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4 minutes, the lights were falling towards the horizon.  At some point, one light appeared to move to the east almost directly over AK Steel.   All lights gradually lowered and flickered out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I videotaped the event on my iPhone.

It was an obvious light with no tail or aura and was larger than a shooting star. It was large round and neon lime green.  I slowed and watched it until it split into two separate lights one shooting up and one shooting down and then both lights disappeared.

I drive around the island all night patrolling, taking breaks every so often to stretch my legs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing some rounds I parked my patrol vehicle on a small street facing South-East at 11:10pm.  I was looking down at my I-pod when I heard rain drops hitting the roof of the car.  I look up and see it, doing a double take thinking in that first split second it was a jumbo jet or something because of the immense size of this thing.  Then as I looked more it become clear it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was U-shaped like a horse-shoe with 6 or 7 gold lights along the bottom edge.  It was, or at least it appeared to be, about a quarter mile away and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  Making no sound at all, moving at a steady slow pace, it flew from SSE to NNW.  It seemed to be following the cloud cover from the rain storm.  I saw it for only about 10 seconds until it just vanished before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last few seconds I saw it I was outside of the car so I know it wasn’t light reflections of something on the wind-shield of the car.  I immediately got back in the car and drove NNW trying to follow its path to see it again.  I got as far as I could without crash into the damn Gulf-of-Mexico, having never seen it again.  I’m hating myself for not even thinking about taking a picture the entire time I observed it, I didn’t want to take my eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to see if I could find anyone else that may have seen it but could not see anyone out and about.  The rain was a huge factor considering how many people would stand outside in the rain looking up at the sky, not many.

Not to mention I could lose my job over this, but at this point I don’t care.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen planes, blimps, ultra-lights, kites, Chinese lanterns, balloons, shooting stars and helicopters before, but never anything like this before in my life.

I was not able to get any pictures or video because the encounter was so quick if I would have hesitated to look up into the sky I would have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that day I had an intense feeling of being watched. It felt almost as if there was someone watching my every move through out the day. As I drove down the highway from Northern Indiana back down to Muncie I had noticed a blue orb hovering in the sky. At first I thought nothing of it thinking it was just a nearby radio tower or an airplane. As time progressed I kept looking up to see if it was still there and it was. Suddenly the orb started to move erratically in the sky and the light had gotten brighter and brighter the faster it moved. All of the sudden it shot forward in tremendous speed behind a cloud and all I could see after that was a large explosion of blue light. I have not seen the Space Craft since or had the feeling of being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb sat there hovering in the sky around 1 hour before darting off in 30 seconds or less.<n>

Vermont pm sighting of a VERY bright, solid, slow moving, silent. light, that appeared 2 stop and changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am located in Southern Vt, 30 north from the Mass boarder, and 15 minutes east of the New York boarder. While resting on our bed this evening, a light in a West facing window caught my attention as &#34;out of the ordinary&#34;.  I got out of bed, as did my VERY level headed, boyfriend to watch it. Within a moment or two, perplexed, we both headed down stairs, and outside to try and see &#34;it&#34; more clearly and get a better understanding of what we were viewing.  The light appeared to remain consistent for the duration of our observation of it. It was a Strong, Bright, Solid (not blinking, pulsating or flashing), Orange light that cast 8-10 brigth rays.  It is a relatively dark evening, and there is a color in the pm sky (a steel dark dark grey black) that, along with the lack of any other objects, (ie stars, planets, satelittes, other flying objects) makes me think that there must be some cloud cover.  If there is cloud cover, this light appeared to be below the clou! ds. It moved from west to east, steadily at first, and...well not quickly.  For most of the viewing there was nothing but silence.  Silence to the point of having mentioned it at the time to the person I was with. While we watched it, the silent moving light traveled from the east side of our house, to above our fields. While this occured it was completely silent. It then seemed to stop moving.  Our eyes no longer needed to track it.  After what I would guess was maybe 10 seconds, it appeared to start moving again, but instead of moving in a consistently straight path (as it had looked to be doing), it appeared as thought it was going to return back from the direction in which it came. It then, appeared to stop again.   And when the movement resumed it was once again heading in the direction of New Hampshire..  The light remained BRIGHT orange with no fluctuation in its solidity, or cast rays,  throughout the sighting, and only appeared to change size as it disappeared over the! mountains. We sit on 30 acres of fields, and have a funamenal! view of the sky. LOTS of sky...big, wide, open, sky.  As our sighting began to reach its conclusion, this light, for the first time, went from being consistently one size, to steadily reducing in appearence. Its departure seemed to happen more quickly than any movement prior.  Keep in mind it is dark, and therefor any specifics about its appearence are non existent. It was well toward our east when, as the light &#34;shrunk&#34; we heard a distant sound that reminded us of what a jet again would sound like. THAT one factor left the gentleman with whom I was with, to say (slowly, and as if he was trying to convince himself) &#34;um , well, must be a plane...that noise....&#34; and with a befuddled look, he slowly turned and headed back inside and upstairs.  I dont NOT know what we saw. But I do know it was not an airplane. It was NOT anything I have seen prior to this evening.  It was NOT anything I will expect to see again. Lights on planes blink. One can hear planes traveling overhead, and not ju! st when they appear to be at their furthest distance from you of the entire sighting. Planes (especially planes with no airports around) are not seen with one solid Bright orange light, void of any other lights.  And planes do not stop, and with very little appearence of turning, change direction. This was very personal. If I am the only person to call THIS light a complete, and utterly unexplainable annomily, so be it.  This was a DEFINING event for me. One that I suspect I will remember every detail of, while renting this body.<n>

It was flying west at approximately 3-400 feet, around 60 knots. My first impression was that it was probably one of the several Piper Cubs or Cessna 150s that frequently travel &#34;low and slow&#34; in the area, but this was unique given its appearance, the time of day and (most notably) its lack of sound; the craft was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to its lack of noise, I then suspected it was a hot air balloon, but I can say with 100% certainty there was no inflatable apparatus of any sort.  The craft was rectangular (oriented vertically) in profile, with the lower rim or base of the craft containing 8-10 orange/amber lights evenly spaced. The body of the craft had a soft glow that internally illuminated.  It was traveling at a level altitude, ruling out the theory that it was a stray inflatable/balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed it through our front window has it passed over our neighborhood (Milford Historic District).  It was moving so slow that by the time we ran outside, it was almost 1 street over and extremely easy to see.  As it continued, I moved to our attic which allows me an unobstructed view of downtown Milford.  The craft appeared to hover briefly over the downtown, then proceeded to make a gradual northern assent until I lost visual contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been an avid aviation enthusiast for 30+ years and usually have no trouble identifying aircraft.  I can say with 100% certainty that this is like nothing I have ever seen before.  Quite fantastic.

Lauderdale on  Dec. 2, 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> On friday night, Dec 2,2011, about 9:15pm, I seen a bright white light, kinda oval shaped hovering over Ft.Lauderdale/Sunrise/Pompano Bch area.  It was about as high as a ten story building and it was not a plane/helicopter/blimp!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it form my 6th story balcony, the light dimmed, as if it went into a cloud or was flying away, then it shot across the sky,not to far but far enough, and the bright light came back and it began to hover again. It did this twice, that I saw. Then it started to move slowly, horizontally through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost track of it because of the way my building is situtated. I tried to use my camera phone, but its not a smart phone so it didnt work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I,ve been checking on-line and no one has reported anything!! Is there anyway to find out what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was planes flying high above, someone else had to have seen this!<n>

Then hover over pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 2, 2011 at approximately 9:20 pm, In a very rural area of Georgia, I witnessed what seemed to be two huge, bright headlights in the distance hovering very low directly over a neighbor’s house.  I sat in my drive way and watched the object fly very low, just above the wood line toward me until it was just above me to my left. The lights were still very bright shining in my eyes. We then pulled out of my drive way, and turned left.  We stopped at a stop sign about 300 yds. from my driveway. The craft was still very low.  We turned off the truck, and headlights.  The object slowly rose straight up into the air, making barley any noise at all. We turned left at the stop sign, parked, and got out of the truck. We watched the Craft hovering high in the sky above our pasture. About 30 minutes later we returned to my house and could still see the object. We could now see different colors, lime green, yellow, white, and bright blue. There was a thin band of l! ight at the bottom, with a very bright circle light orbiting around the thin strip. I could tell it was a circle because the bright light would travel around the small band of light, disappear, and reappear on the other side of the object. As of now, the object is still hovering high in the sky above my pasture. We attempted to take a picture, and video, once we all stopped freaking out. The object looks so small in the pictures that you can’t really make out the band of lights, with the brighter light orbiting around it.<n>

College degree.  I am a business development executive in the technology industry for many years now.  Have never filed a report like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, a little over an hour ago, I was standing in my driveway with my neighbor and my 6 year old son.  We had a small fire going in a fire ring at the end of my driveway, and were standing around it.  It was chilly tonight, but the sky was crystal clear, not a cloud in sight, a thousand stars, and a half moon somewhat low in the sky.  A nice night to hang out with a neighbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the stars from my vantage point.  I was facing southeast, the moon was to my right slightly, my eye caught movement and was not immediately identified, but after a few seconds of trying to triangulate at what had caught my attention, I noticed an occlusion of stars in a somewhat broad chevron v shaped pattern, moving forward as you would naturally envision a chevron flying.  Soon after, I also discerned a slight, very dim light blue glue surrounding the chevron, and the chevron was an ever so subtle different shade of black than the surrounding night sky.  It was close, it had no lights or strobes or anything. It was very hard to see. But it was unquestionably there. It made no noise.  It appeared to be at a height of at least 10,000 feet, and possibly as high as 50,000 feet, it appeared to be moving at about 500 mph, directly south.  It could have been a little bigger than a 747, or an aircraft carrier, depending on how high it was. The glow was what really freake! d me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked it for a short time, but it faded with light from the moon as it neared that body in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented to my neighbor and my son that I had just seen a UFO, and laughed. I described it to them, they both looked up, but it was long gone. I told my wife when I came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no evidence, no proof, but I don&#39;t make up stories on this stuff, nor am I a UFO nut. I am open minded. Perhaps it was an air force secret plane. All I know is that it was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional information.  We live under a major air traffic lane of aircraft flying southeast from Philly, New York, Boston, Europe.  We see aircraft flying all the time, in a very predictable pattern, with aircraft I easily identify. The sighting was not in this pattern, nor was it a commercial or military aircraft. This was not normal.<n>

Bright lights hovering very low to ground, and house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 2, 2011 at 9:00 pm I witnessed a UFO in rural Georgia.  I was in the driveway, of my girlfriend’s house about to leave.  Two bright lights hovered over a distant neighbor’s home. The Lights appeared to be like headlights of a car, except they were floating in the air and one light was about the size of a vehicle.  As we watched the lights the object moved very low toward us, coming down the wood line.  It appeared that the object was going to scrape its bottom on the trees. We pulled out of the driveway, turning left toward the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at a stop sign approximately 500 ft. from the driveway.  We turned the truck and headlights off.  The object was still hovering very low.  But slowly it rose straight up into the air.  The object made a very faint noise as it rose up.  We turned left at the stop sign and parked the truck. We got out, and saw it hovering above my girlfriends pasture.  We watched it there for a few minutes then returned back to her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back at her house we could now see different colors on the object.  There was a thin band of light at the bottom with an even brighter, bigger, circular light rotating around the band of light.  We looked at it through binoculars, but the object was to high in the sky at this point to see any good details.  From just looking at the object all you could see at the point was color changes, from green, to yellow, to white, to bright blue.  The object is still hovering in the sky. Now the object is very high though.<n>

Exact direction was unknown and it was at about a 45 degree angle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a plane, but there was no noise coming from the object. We knew there would have to be as this object couldn’t have been more than 100-200 yards up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were discussing what it could be, a blue neon looking trail emitted from the object.  At ground level this blue beam looked about 5-6 inches long, but had to have been close to 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this blue beam emitted from it (at this point the light was in plain sight, near no tree line) it vanished and could not be located again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned we saw low flying helicopters in the area.  We don’t know if they were in any relation to what we saw.<n>

Location is farmland without localized ambient lighting.  6:10pm, clear skies.  From the 9 o’clock position (which would be from the east) a round bright white flaming firelight the size of 1/32 of the moon, coming down at a less than 30 degree angle and traveling with the arc of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 13 year old daughter says “Wow Mom a shooting star”.  I pull car over as it passes at the 12 o clock position in front of the car.  At the 2 o clock position white sparkle rocks start breaking off from the main round body until the 2:30 position where the entire object blows into lots of small white pieces and fizzles out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entire sequence takes 10 to 12 seconds.  My first and second impression was that it was a hospital or news helicopter like a Jet Ranger, traveling low, fast and with landing/search light on coming at us.  As ! it passed us I then believed it to be a rotorcraft with trouble as evidenced by the ending “explosion” and destruction of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am have 60+ hours in Cessna 152 aircraft and am familiar with various small aircraft.   I am an attorney and familiar with factual reporting and expert witness testimony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before – it was SO bright, large and deliberate in movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called local Charlotte, N.C. TV station WBTV at about 6:30pm to report what I witnessed and to see if others had called in similar reports.  None had.   I have never witnessed anything like this.  It was amazing.<n>

12/2/11 11:00|Gatineau (Canada)||Rectangle|5 min|Rectangular craft, blue light underneath in center, two white lights, fire blossom in the sky|12/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85882.html|505|ndxe201112| Rectangular craft, blue light underneath in center, two white lights, fireblossom in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t really know who to tell but something really odd passed over my house last night. I got a very good look at it. I also contacted Peter Davenport and he suggested I post my information here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside smoking at 11pm when something that seemed like a firecracker blossomed in the sky.  It was a red blossom.  However it didn&#39;t fall apart like a firecracker does at the end in a shower of sparks, it simply stayed in the sky and started coming closer to my house, I live in the woods so lets just say it had my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the really interesting stuff started happening. The &#39;&#39;craft&#39;&#39; flew at low level I&#39;d say 300 feet over the trees.( it was night however) It had a rectangular shape who&#39;s edges seemed to dissapear in shadows and was very hard to distinguish. In the middle and centre (underneath)of it was a blue light (like a spotlight in intensity). Behind this light also on the belly was a white light. There was also a white light in front of this blue light. The lights seemed to follow a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;&#39;craft&#39;&#39; passed right beside me over my head. It was making no noise but when it got close I heard a humming noise barely discernible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving quite slowly when it was over me so I got a very good clear look from close. (about 2 to 3 hundred feet over my head it seemed)  This is when I clearly saw the black rectangular shape edged in shadows.  The lights seemed to change in intensity, I got a red glimpse also, coming as if from lights on the sides( it was only seen as a periodic red glow on the sides of the craft.  It seemed the size of a small plane, bigger than a 4 person plane.(it was however night so size was impossible to judge, big though)  At first I thought it could be a remote control flying toy but when it got close enough and I saw the size I knew this was impossible. When it passed me I got a glimpse of the rear of it. I believe this was part of the propulsion system.  It was another yellow light but extremely bright, like a mini sun or globe. The intensity of the bright globe made me think of a jet engine firing without any fire coming out of it. It was a glowing globe of light.  The craft left no exhaust in the sky. I believe this intense glowing light in the rear was the propulsion system because when the craft accelerated this seemed to get brighter. This is what really got me freaked out: when it was 500 feet passed me it accelerated incredibly fast and zig zagged downward (toward the trees) at extremely high speed and dissapeared in a quick flash. I went finished my smoke, went inside, immediately closed the game I had been playing on my computer and went online and on google typed in some of the things I saw trying to figure out what kind of thing I had just seen. I also called one of my best friends who laughed a little at how weirded out I was. I ended up on this UFO report sigt and started reading the last ones from 2011 and some from 2010. I was freaked out by the fact that almost all of them had part of what I had seen but it was obvious from the reports that whatever was being described seemed to correspond to a part of what I had seen. I also heard a helicopter pass over my house several minutes later, which makes no sense at that time of night. My experience seemed longer and more complete than the ones reported. This is making me think i’m in a movie or something but the day before I was babysitting my moms dog and he started barking and growling uncontrollably for a long period of time at 2am the night before. I only thought there could be a link between the craft and the dog today...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here I guess is another report of the rectangular craft that seems described in the 2011 reports I read on web site, only what I saw seems to have many of the elements that were described and was a little different than some others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt really know who I should tell about this so hopefully it interests someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The Object was orange in color, retanglar in shape at first but, yet transparent, I could see trees through it, floating across the center,diagonally across my back yard.  It was approx. 20 inches long and 15 wide, floating about 15 meters above the ground when I noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I noticed it, it stop,dropped @ a forty five degree level, even with the top of the den windows top level.  Once @ top window level it changed shape to oval, the color changed from orange to a golden yellow and became very bright.  The object centerd the three set den windows and begin a downward decent.  It noticed me looking at it and came to search for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> part 2-  As stated earlier, I was lying on the floor in 6ft in front of the tv and 8ft from the set of den windows, when I noticed the object in my back yard.  Once I saw the object, it stop, dropped in a forty five degree angle to the middle of the den window set sa though it was looking for me. Here is where it gets strange.  Once in position it changes shape from rectangle to oval, changes color from orange to a golden yellow and gets extremely bright as it starts a downward decent. With a pillow, only my head is uncovered as I did not move, I froze in position,covered with a throw &amp; blanket. The object probed the my den and me.  Not knowing what to expect, I waited approx.30 minutes before I got up. Being a career firefighter and military man, I never knew the fear I experienced tonight.  My privacy and home was invaded without my permission.  Who or what would do that, and why.  I am retired and believe in God.Nothing is the same!<n>

12/1/11 21:00|Seoul (South Korea)||Light|unknown|Multiple lights seen by multiple witnesses in Seoul|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85623.html|515|ndxe201112| multiple lights seen by multiple witnesses in Seoul<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow up to the sighting that I reported on November 27th.  I told my colleagues about my sighting of an orange ball of light flying low overhead in the middle of the city.  It was mostly met with skepticism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also not that I work in the news industry here in Seoul.  Well, my coworkers told me about a report yesterday by YTN, which is the biggest 24 hr. news channel in the country.  Last night there were multiple sightings of multiple lights moving about the city.  The original story is in Korea and is short. I provided a rough translation of the original report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s noteworthy that a channel like YTN does not usually report on events such as UFOs.  The fact that there were many lights and witnesses makes this case very interesting.  It also adds more credibility to what I saw a few days before. I think my coworkers believe my story more now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems something is going on here in Seoul.  I suspect it may be military, maybe some kind of experimental drones to keep an eye on North Korea?   Here is a rough translation of the news report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Files of reports streamed through last night... saying that Seoul residents saw UFOs in different areas of Seoul  Multiple lights were seen by many people in Seoul last night... which hovered in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Interview: Mr. Ha Haesung, Seoul Resident]  I reported as mysterious lights in the sky. I suspect the objects which I saw could be UFO... or something related to...&#34;&#34;  Files of reports have been released by ordinary citizens... claiming that they have observed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that similar incidents happened in places around Seoul including Yonhee-dong, ahhyeondong, sinsudong, Gongdeok, Chungjeongro, Namdaemun, Hannam-dong, and other places in Seoul simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Air Force confirmed that there was no trainning at that time of night in Seoul... saying the hovering lights were not related to any planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO experts have seen the light of the problems result, the ground is likely to have been a light in the shot man naenwatseupnida the results of the analysis. (I think they are trying to explain that the lights could have come from the ground…But it really seems unlikely)   The military is also turned on the lights in the past as a suspected UFO UFO cases in the past admitted there were times when deda Dawn and I-because she did not reveal features.  (Here, I think they are saying the military has shined search lights before)<n>

I noticed an orange-colored light appear in the distance, but I originally wrote it off as an incoming commercial flight due to the nearby airport.  Then I saw the light &#34;shudder&#34; off and reappear a few moments later just to the right of where it had originally appeared.  I watched as it shuddered off a second time.  I kept my eyes glued to the sky, and I noticed the light once more about a mile down the road near the Tanger outlet center on 501 near Carolina Forest.  Upon arriving home a few minutes later, a close friend of mine contacted me after spotting the same light near her home (not far from where I had last seen it), describing exactly what I saw.<n>

I head a noise that sounded similar to a low flying airplane.  It almost sounded like a whale call. I looked up and saw 3 low-flying lights moving very slow.  I turned around and called for the other 2 people inside (my brother and his girlfriend).  They came outside immediately (took about 15 seconds), it was already roughly a half mile away.  It hovered for about a minute and a half before it moved out of site.  In roughly 2 minutes what looked to be several military airplanes headed in the same direction. I called my grandmother at this time and could hear an echo in my phone.  We tried to get on the internet on our phones and it did not work, there has never been an issue getting on the internet in this area before.  We live about a half hour from Dulles Airport, we see airplanes all day, everyday, and this did not look or sound like anything we have ever seen or heard before.<n>

I even double checked to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  3 lights in a triangular formation.  Shortly after this realization and watching the first formation moving from my field of view I noticed another formation of 3 lights identical to the first following the first on the same flight path.  These were not planes. I live fairly close to an airport and have seen every kind of plane imaginable at night and these almost appeared to be 3 points on large solid objects. (immensely large)  They were completely silent, moved at a fairly fast speed (as they were out of my view within 15 - 20mins time.) and as they passed directly overhead it appeared as they may be much lower in altitude than I first thought, but I can&#39;t say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

So I told my friend, who thought I was joking about it, I convince him that I&#39;m not kidding and  to pull over so we can get a good look at it driving about 1/5 a mile east of where I initially saw it.  There were jets in the sky around the same time,  The trail of the object was much much shorter and fatter and the was a very bright orange which seem to engulf the front of it as if were burning, compared to the jets that were flying by.   The jets also had trails but those were skinny longer also orange due the light of the sun from the time of day, and seemed to be moving across the sky faster than this object as the object but the object was too far for me to confirm that it wasn&#39;t jet, but if it wasn&#39;t ufo related I would say that it was more likely to be some for debris or a satellite as I am sure it seem to descending or falling down from a very high altitude perhaps 2-3 miles from where we were moving south south west of vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred at the time and date listed on the report 12/1/11 at about 5:10 pm est<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came in as soon as I got home and looked up on the internet to see if anyone had posted anything about but found nothing related to it but searching for it did lead me to your site and I decided that I would report about it there.<n> <n><n> That&#39;s all there is<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It had constant flickering light and was lower than the stars in the sky.  I didnt have to focus on it it so much to tell that it was moving.  It moved up and down and it a circular motion at times in one spot, and at times a little over to the side. by almost daylight it had moved so much that it was much further away than where it was when I first saw it like heading towards Center Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also another one like that but it was smaller and adjacent to the other.  It was moving as well. I had seen things like this before and now it seems others are starting to say they&#34;ve seen similar things too.  Am starting to see it more often now.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky and studied it to see if it was a star or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband brought out binoculars and we noticed that it was a triangle shaped object with 3 round lights that was changing in rotation.  There were 4-5 beams that came down from the object, and the beams changed with rotation.  Several times the object would appear to have a red or blueish green glow around it.  The object was hovering for the most part, but would make rapid movement and zip to the side.  Then hover for a few seconds in that spot, before zipping back to the other side.  It would also appear to lower down in elevation then rise back to higher elevation, mostly in a zig-zag pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was directly to the west, which would place it either above the city of Seattle or out over the Puget Sound.  There was absolutely no sound associated with this object.
