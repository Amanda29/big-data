Perhaps these items were Chinese lanterns, perhaps not.  Their disappearance at the same spot in the sky seems inexplicable to me.<n>

Tonight as I was admiring the clear night and getting ready for NYE cheers echoing the city, I noticed there were 3-4 of these tiny little fireballs that looked the same size as most stars and especially similar in color to the planet Mars but a brighter lumens than the planet.  Their color was flaming and flickering, whilst they glided in a diagonal-like ascension.  One by one they were out of sight, gliding slowly until they disappeared.  It was hard to see how far they were from me, but they looked like they were quite far up in the sky, thus their size was so tiny.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like them before, and I assume there could have been more before I got to that viewpoint and started my gazing...I skygaze at the night sky quite a bit, and have never seen anything like these before.  It made me feel both calm and curious, I didn&#39;t feel a threat just a sort of inner peace and surreal amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our elevation in San Francisco is at sea level, so not sure what these may have looked like from higher altitudes.<n>

We saw an orange orb seem to shoot upward from the west ending up in Northwest Direction (Las Cruces,NM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orb hovered,seemed to come closer,then backed away and  moved slowly left to right.  Shortly after, we saw a second one and they were in close proximity to each other,moving in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After midnight 3 more appeared,slowly hovering around each other. At one point all 5 aligned forming a    straight slanted line.  My daughter felt it looked as one big craft,with lights at its edge at this point.  They all slowly dimmed out, except one.  (During the course of this entire experience,they would dim to the size of a small orange star, less bright-but mainly stayed larger &amp; glowing orange).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes later, the only orb left stopped moving, about 5 seconds later,two orbs appeared below it,forming an acute triangle,it hovered for about 15 seconds.  The other 2 orbs were hovering off to the triangles left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN the orb on the top of the  triangle moved upward to its right aligning itself with the bottom right orb.  The bottom left orb started moving further to its left forming a right triangle.  It stayed this way for about 5 seconds, then we looked away to get down from the roof (as other child became very concerned and upset).  We looked up again and they(all 5) were still hovering slowly around in no particular order.  They remained a very bright glowing orange.<n>
12/31/13 23:50|San Francisco|CA|Sphere|15 minutes|5 pink/orange lights rising over Bernal Hill in San Francisco.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105967.html|5|ndxe201312| 5 pink/orange lights rising over Bernal Hill in San Francisco<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a small dinner party of 4 on New Years Eve 2013 in San Francisco.  Every year we decide go up to our deck which overlooks the Bay and Bernal Hill for the fireworks around the city.  We decided to head up to the deck at around 23:50.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all talking with one another then we noticed the lights coming up over the top of the hill and one of them swooped down in front of the hill and hovered.  The others were moving into diamond and triangular shapes.  They continued to hover when the fireworks around the city were going off as if watching a show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to get creepy so we all decided to go inside. I posted what I had saw on Facebook and noticed the next day it wasn&#39;t just us that saw them, so did hundreds of others around the state.  I can say for sure that they were not chinese lanterns.  They were wobbling up and down like a dot but stationary at all times.  It seemed like there was a thin transparent layer or curtain between us and them which made them look and feel surreal.  Very strange!<n>

12/31/13 23:50|Nässjö (Sweden)||Other|70 minutes|No clue what it is, but at least i have film.  Thats your job to work it out.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105879.html|7|ndxe201312| No clue what it is, but at least i have film.  That&#39;s your job to work it out<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:50 i saw out of my living room window a bright slow moving light.  I thought at first it was a falling metorite, and i grabbed my phone to film it and ran outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i realised it was moving to slow to be a metorite.  Maybe it was a flare that someone had set of and was being blown by the wind.  But it changed direction and it was then i started filming.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited another 10 minutes and then 2 appeared together and separated, i started filming, and the first one i saw rejoined them.  I continued to film them until the smoke from fireworks blocked out what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again i waited for the smoke to clear, and suddenly one flow over my head.  It was a bright red ball.  The alltitude of the object was hard to say, but at least 300 meters above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then came another about 5 mins after and looking at it longer it was red, but the core was white.  There was no flashing lights, there was no sound,  It moved to slow for  a plane.  About a minute later another followed, and they seemed to regroup just outside the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had friends who live over there, and i contacted them if they coule see the strange lights. They said they could, but then because they have been drinking, they started fooling around saying it was helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since when has the swedish airforce had helicopters which are silent, and if it was a night exercise, then they would not have a big red light glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not under the influence of any substance we have young kids,plus the wife is a antisocial bitch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video, taken with my mobile, i tried to include references to prove it was not any hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the internet today to see if anybody else had reported anything. And found a film on youtube, exact similar to what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said she looked out the window, and saw it, but dismissed it as nothing. But maybe because her head is so far up her arse, she does not give a shit. But i know what i saw, and what i filmed, and it was not ,military or commercial or private aircraft.<n>
12/31/13 23:45|Bush|LA|Light|4-8 minutes|New Year's Eve UFO.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106188.html|8|ndxe201312| New Year&#39;s Eve UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was not going to report this, I really didn&#39;t know how, but I can&#39;t shake it from my mind and after a brief google search and reading a report from the same night, similar to mine, I have no choice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 15 minutes before New Year&#39;s Day and I stepped outside to see if any neighbors were shooting fireworks.  While looking up I noticed one orangish orb coming from the south moving at a decent pace.  No flashing.  No pulsing.  Solid orange orb.  When suddenly it split into two.   Was absolutely no sound.  I live in the country and could not hear a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called for my girlfriend from inside. She came running out to see the second object disappear behind a tree heading west and the first object stayed straight north.  We watched the first object until it fell behind a treeline and we could no longer see it.  It never strayed from it&#39;s straight line.  There is an airport nearby so I see regular commercial airline traffic.  This was no airplane.  It did not have its strobes on and the landing lights are bright white, not orange.  And commercial airlines most definitely do NOT split into two aircrafts.  Anyway, that&#39;s my story.  I know what I saw.<n>

I had walked out of the bar and was crossing the street when I looked up and saw three red shaped objects in the sky.  They were very small because they were at a great distance.  They were in a right triangle formation and none of the lights were pulsating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What got me was that they were all stationary, they did not move and like I said they were in a triangle formation with a lot of space between them.  It did not look like they were real close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued walking across the street and a few minutes later when I walked back I did not see them in the sky at all.  I had been drinking that night but I didn&#39;t have that much at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw.  I could see all the stars and then these three red lights stood out right in the middle of them.  I&#39;m 21 and I&#39;ve never seen UFO&#39;s before but on December 31, 2013, shortly before midnight I saw what I saw.<n>

I went inside to get my camera when I came back outside there were more lights.  They seemed to travel in two&#39;s and three&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was a slight breeze from the west and a slow drizzly rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to remain in formation until they disappeared into the clouds.  When they first came from the east they were white then changed to orange and then red and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife first thought they were planes but, there were no other lights.  There were no sounds at all.  One time there were six lights they looked like they were in a formation of a triangle.  The speed was like a jetliner coming in for a landing at an airport not fast and not slow either. There was no erratic movement of any kind very smooth moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for 15 minutes until they stopped coming. I took several pictures but I couldn&#39;t keep the camera still.  There were twenty to twenty five lights in all.  I have never seen anything like  that.  We thought they might be floating lanterns but the wind was going in the opposite direction.<n>
12/31/13 23:40|Taylors|SC|Fireball|1-2 minutes|3 reddish-orange lights in the sky.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105926.html|12|ndxe201312| 3 reddish-orange lights in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 11 oclock hour on New Years Eve night, my girlfriend and I were sitting at our firepit enjoying the fire when she noticed something in the sky.  As I spotted it my first thought was maybe it is a police helicopter using infared to track any criminal activity. But I did not not hear any blades rotating, there was no noise at all. Suddenly there were 2 more lights with it.  I can best describe these lights as round, reddish-orange balls of light.  They did not change color or pulsate and they seem to be flying in a tight formation.  They seem to move very slow as we tried to figure out what we were seeing.  I grabbed her phone to try and get video of these lights but I could not see them through the lens.  We were both shaken up a bit as we were seeing this and all I could do is watch to see what they might do next.  This is where I was most shocked.  I had my eyes locked on these 3 objects and like that...they were gone!  It was like someone hit a switch and tu! rned the lights off.  They never got out of formation , nor did they move left or right, up or down.  They just disappeared all together.  My girlfriend and I have investigated the paranormal on the side for awhile now and I will tell you that I have seen alot of strange things, but nothing like this.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure this out and there is no explanation that I can come up with.  In my research I have found that many people have reported seeing these same lights and what is really strange is that I came across a report stating that someone saw something very similar on the same night, around the same time, somewhere in Sweden!  I will definetly be watching the skies more often now as I hope to see them again and hopefully get some footage this time.  I emailed one of the local news stations here to ask if they had any reports of the same thing but have got no response.  Believe it or not, I know what I saw with my own eyes.  I am glad that I got to expe! rience something like this as it was one of the most amazing t! hings I have ever seen.<n>

We were outside lighting fireworks and we live near the beach.  When we first saw it we assumed it was a flare but when it did not descend and began to gain speed we realized it was not.  It was very bright and orange, it was silent.  It began to make large jumps east and west while it was traveling south.  Never have seen anything like this.<n>

Before they were able to bring in the New Year together, they left her mother and father&#39;s home early today due to her parents being too tired to stay awake any longer, their being very elderly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes into the trip back to my wife&#39;s sister&#39;s home they reported UFO&#39;s in formation flying at incredible speeds.  The craft did some darting in and out of formation manuvering.  My wife rulled out any type of light show or lazer show since the objects flew off into the horizon and then returned five times within the fifteen minute episode.  They pulled off to the side of the road at one point in order to get out of their car and watch this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in the opposite direction of Minsk away from any city area and over rural farmland. My wife called me to report this.<n>

We first saw one of them moving through the sky (sort of wavering) and then it stopped.  The light started to dim and we could see the object was round, then the light went out and I could sort of see it still before it vanished.  When the first craft stopped moving (before it vanished) we noticed a second one through the trees.  This one wasn&#39;t moving, it was staying still, it did not start moving until the first one vanished, instead it started moving east towards us, was coming closer (the light got brighter).  This one also dropped from its original position (it dropped a hundred feet?) and then it started on the same track that the first one did. It moved towards the center of our view, stopped, then the light started dimming (appearing to go farther into the sky).  The light went out and I could again see that it was a round object before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object floated toward the south end of Chena Ridge and disappeared.  This was totally unlike any firework I’ve ever seen. Reminded me of a lantern but I don’t think so.  I’ve seen other UFO’s in this area; this one just floated instead of moving quickly around and clustering with others, but I know there are different kinds.  I wonder if anyone else saw this?<n>

It re-emerged later after midnight doing the same thing for another 10 minutes.  It was somewhere between the TIA airport and Ybor City.  Fireworks were going off around it for New Year&#39;s Eve but it did not seem impacted by them and it was unclear how close it was to the fireworks due to the distance.  5 people on my balcony witnessed it as did several people on a neighbor&#39;s balcony.<n>

Then for the next 8 minutes the craft just stood still, or flying in tight circles.  Thought it could be a helicopter, but went outside there was no sound.  Should of heard some aircraft engine sound.  Then it was gone.  Searched the night sky with a binocular, but did not see anything.  First time I ever saw an aircraft not with a bright white light, but a bright ORANGE light.  It flew so fast to get this spot over the Sourland mountains only to hover, then poof it was gone.

On this particular evening, he looked outside the front door and heard some neighbors talking in their driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went outside to make sure things were okay when he saw the lights just above the Bridger horizon, traveling east.  He ran inside, told me to come outside, and ran back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I joined him in the driveway and observed three lights traveling at the same speed, in the same direction, at the same &#34;altitude&#34;, and disappeared into the clouds.  I only saw three of the lights, he saw a total of 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I confirmed with a friend who is a pilot that small planes would have had flashing lights.  There was no sound, no flashing lights, just a steady orange glow moving across the sky, just above the mountain horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am wondering if they were the celebratory lanterns.  That would be the last logical explanation before considering an E.T. source.<n>

Before getting into my car, I looked up and noticed how crystal clear the sky was.  I then looked to the west and noticed two objects flying towards me.  They were almost side by side, the one on the left being slightly ahead of the other.  They seemed a bit bright, but I assumed they were military planes on a special mission for New Year’s Eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started to drive towards the west, I couldn’t help but keep looking up at the objects. After three minutes, I was absolutely convinced they weren’t planes.  While looking over the tree tops further southwest, I thought I saw two more objects in the distance!  I drove a bit more to get a better view, but only the original two remained.  I pulled over to the side of the road, rolled down my window, and got out my phone to record some video.  The orange colored objects seemed quite small from where I was, but I could tell they were angular.  Perhaps triangle-like, their point located in the front of the craft.  They glowed like fire. The one on the right was still slightly trailing the other, but they were going at the same speed.  After a couple minutes, the UFOs faded into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not get much at all on camera.  Disappointed, I started my vehicle, and began driving west again.  I immediately saw two identical objects flying in the same formation in front of me!  Once again, I pulled over, got out my phone and began recording.  This time I was able to get a much better shot.  I watched them for another four minutes, and just like the others, they soon faded into the night sky.<n>

It also seemed to have dropped something that looked like orange lava coming from under it.  It moved fast and changed to white then back to orange.  After about 10 minutes it disappeared.  My mother and i are not much on believing in UFO&#39;s but this was extremely strange to see.<n>

At first I thought they were fireworks because it being new years, there was a lot of fireworks going off that night, but  it seemed they were on an eastward course.  They looked like orange flames in a ball and moved up and down slightly like a fly moves so I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  They continued heading east and the one in the  rear started dropping blue light orbs out the bottom of it. I am unsure of how many orbs were dropped or if it was only one.  As they proceeded eastward one by one they faded out til their light was completely gone.  This sighting lasted a good couple minutes but through the whole experience I never thought to pull my phone out to record it.<n>

I live in the west side of the Salt Lake valley near the mountain.  I only live about a five minute drive to my place of employment, while driving I noticed what I thought was an airplane in the distance out over the mountain. It was a different colored light than what is the normal green and red, it was a dark amber color almost orange.  I didn’t think much of it until I realized it was on my side of the Oquirrh Mountains (less than two miles away) and could not have been an airplane, so I pulled into a church parking lot to watch it.  My second guess was it could have been a helicopter, but I couldn’t hear it make any sound.  The strange light went lower behind a mountain called hogs back losing sight of it so off to work I went. I have a co-worker that lives near where I do and she called me asking if I saw the strange orange light up against the mountain that was leaving a lit up trail in the nig! ht sky, I confirmed that I did.  I left the building I work in to go look for the strange light. It was midnight and all the New Years Eve fireworks lit up the sky.  I could see the amber light again near the mountain now moving in a weird circular pattern, my co-worker confirmed this as we were still on the phone with each other I asked her if it could have been fireworks, she told me she had been watching it for a while and it wasn’t. I decided to call a family member who lived in an apartment building in the same area asking her if she could see a strange amber light up against the mountain.  She was skeptical in asking me “is this another one of you weird UFO things”.  I just ask her to look for it and tell me what it was doing, she got silent for few seconds as she confirmed by saying “yea that’s weird its up by your house against the mountain moving sporadically, yea that’s cool”.  She confirmed that it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got off the phone, I noticed that it was now sitting still (hovering) in the sky after a minute or so it drop! ped down out of sight behind some trees in the distance, my family member later confirmed when we discussed it the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, was about the size of a small car, and looked to be covered in light.  From when I first noticed it until I couldn’t see it anymore was approx 45 minutes, it came in intervals that were sporadic.<n>

I am not sure if there was anymore before or after because I came inside to to look up if any military ops was going on.

Appeared below a ragged cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the northeast portion of Dayton, OH and on the evening of 31 Dec 13, I went to take out the trash at 10:00PM and noticed a line of lights moving fairly low over our neighborhood and my property.  We had a broken cloud deck at between 1000-1500 feet and these lights were clearly visible so they were below the clouds.  There was a ragged string of lights, 12-15 in total, bright orange-red, in a ragged line moving from S-SW to N-NW, TOTALLY SILENT when they went over our house, so I know they weren&#39;t powered aircraft or helicopters.  Balloons?  Hardly - they moved too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group of lights at the head of the line seemed to stop and some of the followers caught up and then the line began to fade out.  The last lights in line were over our house and you could see that they were  climbing up in altitude into the cloud deck.  Total time was on the order of five minutes.  I called my wife to come out and take a look; she saw them and went back into t! he house to get her camera, but she couldn&#39;t get any shots of them - just points of light to the camera optics.  First time I&#39;ve ever seen anything like this and I know what I didn&#39;t see - no airplane, no helicopter, no balloon.  I’ve got several degrees, my first is a degree in aerospace engineering and I’m also a retired Air Force pilot, so I think I should be a credible witness.<n>

It started with these 2 orange/red balls of light/orbs going south to north in Denton County Texas.  The objects stayed at the same altitude and were flying right next to each other, appearing to be in formation. I did not see where they appeared from but we did watch them travel across the sky over about 1 and a half minutes before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2-3 minutes later, 2 more appeared from the south heading on the same path. Again taking about 1-2 minutes before disappearing.  One was on the same course as the first two, and the other headed down and out of sight behind some trees.  I could not tell exactly how far away it was but seemed to be about a half mile to a mile to the west of my location.  I was able to get a video of that one on my phone, but it was pretty dark so there isn’t any perspective to the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first 4, I went inside and got my 2 sons to come out and they witnessed the last 3 objects we saw.  These all came one at a time.  Took about the same amount of time to travel across the sky and all disappeared around the same area as the first 3 that were going south to north.  They all seemed to be following the same flight path and appeared about 2-3 minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited and watched for more but that was all we saw that night.  This all took place over a period of about 15-20 minutes.  I have no idea what they may have been, but the consensus among us all was that they were not any sort of aircraft we had ever seen. Nor were they any type of firework.  I am happy to send the video but doubt it would provide any clarification.<n>

It was diffuse and appeared to be magnetic/electrical.

It flickered and moved, but did not behave like any heat lighting I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that my friend had seen it as well and we both became a little bit weirded-out.

Since the only scale I had for the object was the night sky and planets and stars, I could not determine the object’s size or altitude.  The object continued tracking Southwest for a few seconds, and as it did, it began to glow a bright reddish-orange color.  It could be best described as the color seen in NASA spacecraft re-entry animations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then made a precise turn when it appeared near the background of the Easternmost star in Orion’s belt, and at what appeared to be a nearly 45 degree angle toward the East-Northeast at a higher rate of speed and moved away from my line of sight.  I made an effort to re-acquire it visually, but was unable to do so due to a building blocking my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to observe a specific object shape, and I do not know if there were several lights on it, or if it was simply one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have listed the event duration as 5-10 seconds, however, I must admit that the sight of the object was immediately disconcerting since it did not behave in an aerodynamic way. The actual duration could have been simply 5 seconds, given the apparent rate of speed of the object. I estimated that rate of speed to be extraordinarily high, since I also estimated the altitude of the object to be high as well, given that I could not even determine its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that the object moved in exacting straight lines both Southwest and East-Northeast. The object did not make arced or rounded movements. The object also did not demonstrate the motions of anything organic like a bird or insect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The immediate shift in motion of the object eliminated my first conclusion that I had witnessed a shooting star.  Also, the color on the object became brighter as it moved East-Northeast, rather than fading.  I have done an exhaustive search for any optical illusions that could explain the change of direction and found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to disabuse anyone investigating this of the notion that I viewed this as a metaphysical or spiritual occurrence.  I did not “feel” the object, have “psychic communication” with it, or in any way view it as a sign or contact.  It was merely an observation of an object moving in a way that I cannot explain, and that startled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am able to make this report as a result of immediately recording the time, my location, and observations, since I maintain a personal and professional notebook while I am working.<n>
12/31/13 21:30|Tigard (near)|OR|Fireball|~1 hour|Large orange fireball witnessed on New Year's Eve near Tigard, OR|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105875.html|47|ndxe201312| Large orange fireball witnessed on New Year&#39;s Eve near Tigard, OR<n> <n><n> <n><n> My housemate and I were returning home after a late night at the office (a health care practice) and a quick bite to eat on the way.  We were 100% sober (even as this was later in the evening on New Year’s Eve).  Driving south on Barbur Blvd very near home my friend (the driver) exclaimed that there was a bright orange object in the sky up over the car.  I quickly looked up to see the very bright orange object, brightly lit and moving very slowly from the west side of the road in an easterly direction.  I told the driver to stop the car but it really wasn’t safe to do so until we arrived at our driveway about a minute after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon jumping out of the car the object appeared to move in our direction and seemed to flare up in brightness slightly.  It was immediately obvious this was something quite unusual and unconventional/non-ordinary.  In the distance, I noticed a small aircraft (just the lights) approach in our direction from the SW somewhat toward the object and I remember wondering if the pilot was actually seeing this object and attempting to come closer to investigate.  The orange object (upon having moved essentially overhead where we were) suddenly then traveled upwards, becoming smaller and smaller (in the clear night sky) until it simply disappeared.  Interestingly, the small aircraft seemed to veer off of its seemingly interceptive trajectory at that time and proceeded to fly almost straight north and eventually disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then went indoors and put everything away to settle in for the evening.  After about 15 minutes I suddenly felt the need to go back outside again and found that the object had returned over our driveway (though likely several hundred feet up—I am a bad judge of distance, however), bright as ever.  It moved slightly and stopped a couple of times and by the time I got my housemate to come back outside again it seemed to quickly fade from view.  There were at least 3 or 4 more occasions in the next hour where I went back outside to find the object in the sky again, roughly in the same location.  I eventually stopped trying to go back outside once fog moved in to the area and obscured the sky and surroundings.  I estimate this to have been a little after 22:30 o’clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound, glowed with variable brightness/intensity—from quite brilliant to extremely dim, then brilliant again—with no flashing lights of any kind, seemed fairly large in size (certainly larger than a Chinese lantern…possibly larger than a helicopter) and appeared to move slowly/deliberately and/or hover rather than exhibit accelerative speed, except when it swiftly traveled straight up and disappeared the first time.  Although we initially somehow assumed it was probably spherical in shape it at times seemed to reveal a more elongated general appearance.  The darkness of the sky and the brightness of the object made this very difficult to clearly determine.  I also couldn’t help but feel it was somehow oddly “aware” of us standing there viewing it, as it appeared to be drawn to our location.  It seemed to make some directional movement toward me whenever I stepped outside to view it and it also seemed to flare in response to the attention and our efforts to! talk to it.  I am open to the reasonable possibility that this aspect of things may just be some sort of coincidence, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my iPhone 5 to take a few quick snapshots, though the resolution (as is often the case at times like this) was fairly poor.  One picture does seem to suggest a more “rod-shaped” form when enlarged.  I attempted a zoom shot in one that seemed to exhibit a more “fuzzy spherical form”.  Another still seemed to resemble a “clustered spherical form”.  I will forward these pics to you in a separate email.<n>

She came running in to get me saying there was something in the sky.  I went out and there were probably 20 bright orange lights on the horizon against the San Bernardino Mountains south toward Crestline, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed they were putting out a brush fire in the mountains but as I watched the lights slowly rose up so that they were above the mountains.  I ran into the house to get my husband.  When he came out there were probably only about 10 left in the sky and as we watched they disappeared one by one in no discernible pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the next day and there were no fires in the area nor had Vandenburg AFB launched anything that night according to their web site. Although it was New Year&#39;s Eve, none of us had anything alcoholic to drink.<n>

I immediately spotted a single light-orange orb in the southwest part of the sky moving northeast at a moderate rate of speed.  It didn’t appear to be at a high altitude –maybe a couple of hundred feet above the ground (although I’m certainly not the best judge of distances).  If I were to have held up my thumb, it would have been just a bit smaller than the size of my thumbnail.  It passed to the west of me and I followed its path as it headed northeast until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was extremely bright.  I saw no blinking lights around it, as you see on planes. It had no form, like a plane, simply a brilliant ball of light.  And, what struck me as the strangest thing of all, was that it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I spend many nights outside on the patio star-gazing.  Since we are very close to the flight path of Louisville International Airport, Bowman Field, and a TV station that has a helicopter landing pad, my husband and I are very familiar with all types of aircraft at all levels of altitude.  Even though we live relatively close to the city and the light pollution can sometimes be a problem, we can also spot satellites as they pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite our familiarity with the aircraft/spacecraft that fly over our home (we’ve lived here for 8 years), I couldn’t identify this as anything I’d ever seen in the past.  I remember asking myself, “What IS that?”  When it had disappeared (after being visible to me for about 45 seconds), I walked back inside and mentioned to my husband that I’d just seen something that I’d never seen before in my life.  I wondered silently to myself if I’d seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, while checking the Internet, I found reports of people in California on New Year’s Eve spotting light orange orbs of light that were completely silent.  I was stunned.  I believe I saw exactly the same thing in Louisville, KY. (END)<n>

Too far away, not high enough and obstructed view, I was unable to see fireworks.  So since I was out there I looked up to see the stars and saw red/orange flashing lights in the shape of a &#34;top&#34;.  At arms length it was the size of a quarter.  As I watched it move, I ruled out that it was a plane, helicopter or blimp, as it changed direction spontaneously.  It was so mesmerizing to witness something that my mind could not logically comprehend.  When I decided it was a UFO it darted to the east, then vanished without a trace.  There was no smoke or sound, but I kept looking to watch it reappear. it never did.  And then I basically thought that I was crazy!  No, not really!

About 10 minutes later, the second fireball passed over taking the same path as the first one.  To guess, they were probably 2,000 feet high, orange and yellow, and could have been meteors.  What we saw was identical to the report of 12/22/13 from North Palm Beach, FL except for the direction of travel of the object.  NPB is a 2 minute drive from where our sighting was.  They followed the flight path taken by planes making a landing approach to West Palm Beach International Airport, except they were at at least twice the altitude of a landing plane.  We noticed two planes take a slightly different approach after the fireballs went by.  Instead of heading SW, they took a more of a due south approach and then banked hard to the west, maybe avoiding these objects. Interesting.<n>

As the object moved, the red area that encircled the middle was almost a translucent red, like an aura but well defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stared at it, the object started to slow down and hover over me, for about 2-3 seconds.

I spotted four unidentifiable orange lights in the skies above 1525 SE Geary St, located in Albany Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small orange light, about equal in size to the lights you might see on a passing airplane and at about the same elevation, was seen suspended in place in the west sky, alone and unmoving.  Two of my co-workers spotted the light and we observed it for approximately a minute before a second orange light appeared to rise slowly from directly below the first light, and then moved into place just to the left (south) of the first light.  Once in position directly left of the first light, the second light stayed motionless in the air, the same as the first.  We observed these two lights for about five minutes, until the second light traveled increasing its elevation while moving away west, until it was no longer visible.  The first light remained in it&#39;s position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after the exit of the second light, a third light, of equal size and hue as the first two was spotted in the northeast sky, at about the same elevation and distance from our location as the first two.  This light also remained motionless in the sky.  We observed this third light as well as the first for another minute or so before a fourth light appears in the sky to the right (east) of the third light and just slightly above it.  This light again was the same hue, size, and height as the first three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light remained in position next to the third for about two to five minutes before traveling up in elevation and away from us towards the northeast, in the same manner as the second light.  About five minutes after that, the third light disappeared, heading up and away just as the third light had done.  The first light remained in it&#39;s position for another few minutes before also traveling up and away in the westward direction, just like the secon! d light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights were the same hue, size,  and distance from our position.  The light was orange, like the color of flame, and solid, not blinking.  The lights all moved very slowly and in directions a commercial airplane could not, such as straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are personally acquainted with this witness, and we consider him to be highly reliable.

I noticed two orange lights hovering in the sky directly across from us.  They looked to be over the New Glenn Hwy., which is just west of the store.  I fumbled around trying to get into the car while watching the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got into our vehicle I pointed out the lights to my husband.  I pulled out of our parking space and started to leave, when my husband asked me to pull over so we could watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching, a third light appeared.  They all seemed to be at the same height, and in a v formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband continued to watch as I attempted to call my son who has told me about seeing the same type of thing, on three separate occasions in Eagle River since 2010.  My husband said that as he was watching, the light that was in the center moved directly over the light that was furthest South.  The northern most light faded away first, then the light that was on the bottom of the remaining two started to fade.  The top light then began to fade and actually faded completely before the bottom light faded completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted approximately five to seven minutes.  The lights looked to me to be about a hundred to a hundred and fifty yards across from the light furthest south to the light furthest north while they were in the v formation.  If the lights were indeed over the New Glenn, they were only about 1/8-1/4 mile away, and they seemed to be just over the tree line to the west of the highway.  We rolled down the windows and didn&#39;t hear any typical aircraft noise.  There was typical traffic noise, but at that proximity I would have expected to hear something from them if they were helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son who I had tried to contact was working at the time, but he said that he saw orange lights in the same general area as he was driving home from work at around 11:20.

College education. Worked in commercial real estate before staying at home with the children.  I&#39;m an avid sky watcher.  It&#39;s not something I invest a lot of time in, but I&#39;m always looking.  I&#39;m fascinated with the general beauty of stars and night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went to the National Observatory south of Tucson and learned how to look at stars and find cool things like tracking a satellite.  It is of note that I live close to Cecil Wright Airfield and NAS JAX.  So I see all types of aircraft daily.  So when I had a errand to run before New Years, I took notice of the sky.  There were minor fireworks.  And stars in the sky.  But I noticed a red ball of light traveling at a steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m not a pilot, I cannot judge the height or speed of this object.  But it appeared to float in the night sky.  At a steady speed.  Not high enough to be an airliner.  But maybe the height of an helicopter, but with no sound.  I was transfixed by this object, ! trying to put it as some sort of military object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another floated behind it. The path looked like a northeast to southwest.  But again, I&#39;m only guessing.  This was followed by 2 more for a total of 4.  It lasted about 7 minutes from what I witnessed. And I was able to get pictures with my iPhone 5s.  But the ball of light appears white/yellow in pictures, but was a very bright red with my naked eye.  The objects disappeared from sight within that 7 minute window.  And I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  Maybe it&#39;s a military exercise or something?  Very weird<n>

My first thoughts were &#34;Hey, it&#39;s New Years Eve, maybe it&#39;s some kind of celebratory blimp or something,&#34; but as I continued staring at it while I drove, the shape wasn&#39;t like anything I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I just about veered off the road since I couldn&#39;t bring my eyes away from it, it began to fall north, slowly making its way across the sky and fading into an orange, star-like shape, disappearing into the atmosphere.  I&#39;d always thought the notion of UFOs was ridiculous and imaginative hoaxes, I couldn&#39;t come up with any kind of explanation for the phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious if anyone else saw this strange object that night.<n>

12/31/13 20:00|New Port Richey|FL|Disk|15-20 minutes|Orange balls of light zoomed in are orange pulsating hexagonal shaped discs.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106439.html|72|ndxe201312| Orange balls of light zoomed in are orange pulsating hexagonal shaped discs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it&#39;s been over two weeks since I&#39;ve seen these craft but I&#39;m reading other reports that are very similar to what I saw.  I first noticed an orange orb in the sky when I was chatting on the phone with a friend.  I quickly hung up after I told her what I saw but by the time I got my camera out it had moved too far away to get a good shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling down Little rd. talking to my sister when I saw the orange craft/orb out the driver&#39;s side window.  This time I quickly pulled my car onto a side street and got my camera and began filming.  To the naked eye it looked like an orange orb but zoomed in it was a orange pulsating disc, hexagonal in shape.It headed in a SW direction and kept going until it disappeared out of sight.  I got into my car and pulled into the WAWA (gas/convenience store) at Little and Ridge rd.  When I came out I noticed what looked like a plane flying very low in a circular pattern, almost as if it was looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets exciting and crazy. I pulled back onto Little rd. heading east and stopped at the light. Looking out my window on my side I saw it coming again, and it was at a low altitude, maybe no more than 500 feet up.  I actually shoved my car into park ( the light even turned green but no one was behind me) and started shooting video.  I got out of my car and right there in the intersection I&#39;m filming this orange ball of light.  Zoomed in it was the same orange pulsating disc that almost appeared to be an organism, like it was alive, making small jumps, up and down and sideways.  I filmed until it got out of view.  There was a black Jeep to my left and when I noticed the window was open a bit I yelled to the two people inside&#34;  Look a UFO&#34;.  They were oblivious to the event but then looked up and said &#34;wow&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it continues to get crazier.  From the same exact direction, same altitude, here it comes again.  Orange ball of light to the naked eye...zoomed in, orange pulsating disc, no sound. It wasn&#39;t moving fast and wasn&#39;t moving slow, just a steady pace.  If it was on the road I&#39;d say maybe no more than 50 miles an hour, if that.  And low and behold, behind the first one comes a second one, orange ball of light.  This time the jeep had left and there was a young girl in a subcompact sitting at the light. I yelled &#34;look at the UFO&#34; and she also looked up and said something.  WOW, people need to pay attention to their surroundings.  This second one was slightly lower than the first, silent, orange orb traveling in a SW direction. I filmed this one also.  These orange orbs did a flyover at Little and Ridge rd. at least 4 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening around 10-10:30 pm while walking down Alico pass where it intersects with Starkey blvd. I saw two orange orbs flying low but this time they were pretty far away.  One was flying a little lower than the the lead one, and it soon disappeared from sight.  I did get video of this episode but it was far away and only for a few brief moments before it too disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll put my hand on a stack of Holy Bibles what I&#39;m saying is true.  This was the most exciting sighting I&#39;ve had recently.  Actually, I&#39;ve seen a few unusual craft in the sky lately.  Not sure why and I&#39;m not crazy because video doesn&#39;t lie.  I will be making a short documentary about my sightings and posting on Youtube.  I&#39;ll let you know when this happens.<n>

Went over our head and continued west..no sound but lit as if illuminated by light.  Absolutely silent.  No wind that night and definitely not fireworks. we don&#39;t drink..this was definitely not something we have ever seen before. It changed course slightly after flying over our heads..was moving forward..  Absolutely no wind ..clear perfect weather.<n>

12/31/13 19:54|Selah|WA|Fireball|10-15 minutes|4 fireballs in night sky.  Shape seen.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105801.html|75|ndxe201312| 4 fireballs in night sky. Shape seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had stepped out onto my front porch which faces south to have a cigarette.  I looked at the sky as usual and while looking at the night sky I observed first a single fireball appear from the tree line to the west and  slowly, without sound gain altitude.  I opened the front door and yelled for my Husband to come see the fireball.  As he and our daughter stepped outside a second fireball appeared at the tree line in almost the same location as the original.  This fireball also began to gain altitude but veered slightly to the north then back south in an almost zigzag like pattern.  At this time the original fireball was very high in the sky and travelling in a southern direction and then faded to the point we could no longer see it with our eyes.  Just before the original fireball faded a third fireball was visible from the tree line  where the first two had originated.  Also travelling in a similar pattern to the first two fireballs.  Without losing eyesight of t! he fireballs I reached into my sweater pocket and pulled out my iPhone to record this phenomina.  Unfortunately it was too dark outside and the fireballs to far in the distance for my iPhone to capture them.  My husband stated that it was odd there were no manmade aircraft in the sky.  It was unnaturally quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the third fireball fade into the night sky, we went back inside.  We were inside for about 2 minutes and I opened the front door and stepped back outside to see if it would occur again and behold there was a fourth fireball just clearing the tree line in the west but instead of going up it moved east in the direction of where we were. And slowly it began to veer to the south and gain altitude, but it seemed to move much slower than the first three. As it turned it did not appear to be a fireball anymore. The shape of the fourth fireball we had seen was like a circle or oval with a triangular fin on top and two triangular fins on the bottom creating a large! r triangular shape. This fireball did not go up and fade out, ! it conti nued to turn south and then back west before disappearing from sight.<n>
12/31/13 19:30|Santa Cruz|CA|Fireball|5 minutes|Reddish/Orange ball of light seen over Monterey Bay.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105940.html|76|ndxe201312| Reddish/Orange ball of light seen over Monterey Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, three friends and I were leaving the Crow’s Nest restaurant adjacent the harbor in Santa Cruz, CA after having New Year’s Eve dinner.  We’d started about 5:00 and enjoyed a good meal and conversation.  None of us had had anything to drink, and we wanted to get home relatively early.  We’re not big revelers…  While we walked through the parking lot to our cars, I looked to the southwest, out over Monterey Bay, and noticed a reddish-orange, round ball of light in the sky.  I initially took it to be aircraft headlights, as there is a flight path that crosses the bay heading to SFO and planes’ lights can often be seen.  I reconsidered almost immediately though and mentioned it to my wife and friends, joking that there was a UFO in the sky.  They all looked and saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me reconsider my observation was, first, its color.  Plane headlights are white.  This was definitely a reddish orange.  Secondly, there was no apparent movement.  Planes usually have at least some offset of their flight path relative to the viewer that causes some appearance of lateral movement.  This had none.  It stood still in the air.  Third, it appeared wider than the aircraft lights one normally sees in the sky at night.  I’d guess that it looked nearly as wide as a pencil eraser held at arm’s length.  It was about 30 degrees about the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed fixed in place for several minutes while we chatted and readied to leave.  This enhanced its oddness to us, so we were all watching it when, in the course of a few seconds, it grew brighter and larger, then disappeared.  I thought I recalled it moving slightly to the right as it brightened, but my wife doesn’t remember that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, I suggested that it must have been a Chinese lantern.  I’ve heard of such being floated in the night sky before, and being mistaken for UFO’s, but I’ve never knowingly seen one.  It seemed plausible at the time though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d of left it at that but for catching you on C2C yesterday (1/1/14) describing multiple reports of what sounds remarkably like what we witnessed.  We were startled to hear you talk of many reddish orange balls of light being reported in the last day, because this is exactly what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew then that I needed to write this, my first ever UFO sighting report.<n>

First thought was fire works that are always launched around my neighborhood for New Years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After capturing the video, I took the dogs back in and came back out to clean up when I noticed the second red object where I captured the second shorter video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First object was sited at 19:24 EST 12/31/13.  It was originally thought to be a firework launch but after 20-30 seconds it did not exhibit the signs that would be associated with a firework display.  Video capture was started with a Samsung Galaxy S3 and 87 seconds of video was captured as it traveled from the NE to the W from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was spherical and had a red glow with no visible com trail or flashing strobe lights.  There was no turning or course changes and it maintain a constant travel speed as best as could be discerned from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was spotted 7 minutes later following the same visual line from the NE to the W.  The second object was captured on video for 52 seconds before being obscured by cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object looked just as the first one did, same visual speed and path with no course changes or discerning differences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of the objects exhibited the fireball characteristics that I have seen in other videos though I do know from what I have read that we are passing through the tail debris of one of the comets we had running through our solar system this last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what they were but would like to know.<n>

The object appeared to be approximately five to six thousand feet in altitude and four to five miles west-southwest of downtown Clarkston, Washington.  The object appeared to flicker a bit during the nine minute observation of the object before it finally dimmed out completely.  At the object’s brightest (when I first observed it), it appeared to be about the intensity of the planet, Venus, shortly after sunset.  The object appeared to travel east, then reverse direction and ascend slightly before dimming out to the point where it was no longer visible.  It dimmed out completely at 19:01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was most definitely not an aircraft of any sort.  The object did not have a rotating beacon, strobes, or any other position (navigation) lights required for nighttime flight. I am a commercial pilot with single engine and multi-engine ratings, as well as an FAA certificated flight instructor, so I’m very familiar with what aircraft of all sorts look like in both daytime and nighttime flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then gazed towards the north-western sky and began seeing what at first I thought was a plane coming from the west towards me.  Suddenl, that light, which was mostly orange &amp; red began slowing down and came to a full stop.  Within some 15 seconds a second one approached and it too came to a stop at what appeared a safe distance from the first.  Then about 30 seconds later a third appeared and came to a stop down from the other two lights.  The three combined lights formed a perfect diamond.  Some 30 seconds or so later the first light started to become dimmer until it disappeared.  The two other lights did the same and also disappeared. Finally about a minute later a 4th light appeared and came to a stop at about the center of where the three previous lights had been.  It hovered there for a good minute before it too started to become dim and it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and son along with our granddaughter saw these lights.  They did not get to see the first three, but did see when the two were disappearing and also witnessed the fourth light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone else witnessed this sighting this evening?<n>
12/31/13 18:10|Hartford|CT|Unknown|15 minutes|UFO over State Capitol.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105784.html|83|ndxe201312| UFO over State Captiol<n> <n><n> <n><n> New Years eve Fireworks Show at 6:10pm at Bushnell Park in Hartford, before the show started we saw a large object, couldn&#39;t tell if it was V shaped like b-2 or saucer shaped given the angle and line of sight but in the sky made a bit of a line shape, with multiple colored lights of a reddish orange color and a Green color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to hover behind the Capitol Building before falling rapidly then disappearing.  What struck as as odd to cancel out what it could be are; though a plane or helicopter has the same colored lights, these lights seemed to alternate and if it were a plane then the a single light stretched across the entirety of both wings, aside from Medical helicopters from the hospital on the other side of town the capitol is a no fly zone this didnt take the shape of a helicopter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise from the craft, which lifestar (local medical helicopter name) makes quite the noise when in the city area, we also canceled out the chanc! e of it being part of the fire works display, being it was before they went off, and was in the wrong direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then shortly after the fireworks display started, and lucky enough to have my camera out with recording capabilities, the obeject was seen again this time on the other side of the captiol.  unfortunately in video mode my camera has no zoom ability nor night vision, and appears as like that of a star in the sky.  Though the object can be seen between the space of the capitol and where the fireworks were going off.  Additionally towards the end of the encounter the object started a rapid descent, then a dead stop then it did it again and vanished, what strikes me odd is where the object vanished is a point of open sky, nothing between me and the object for it to hide behind, with a few flashes it was gone.  The other object flashing below and to the right of it is a warning strobe on a flag pole, of the no fly zone.  Some people noticed i was pointing my camera away from the fireworks which drew some curiosity but was answered when they saw the object themselves, i was lucky to get audio of two of these cases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i&#39;ve already uploaded it to youtube and will provide a link upon request.<n>

I thought it was just Mars or another planet but it was very unusually bright and specifically caught my eye because it kept appearing elongated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving at the time so I could not get a very good look but it wasn&#39;t so significant that I thought it was a UFO at the time. I was sure it was a planet (Mars because of orange color) but had never seen one so bright or appear lengthened.  I also thought for a minute it was plane coming toward me but kept looking to see if it changed shape or moved like a plane does when it fly&#39;s toward you but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I watched a local California news broadcast that I learned that objects or these objects had been spotted by many others all over the state on New Years Eve.<n>
12/31/13 17:50|Chanhassen|MN|Triangle|5:00|Driving down the highway and saw two objects both having white triangular lights beneath with a red pulsating light in the middle.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105777.html|85|ndxe201312| Driving down the highway and saw two objects both having white triangular lights beneath with a red pulsating light in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me say I consider myself to be an amateur Ufologist. I have done quite a bit of research, reading witness reports from a variety of people (ie: military personnel, government officials, citizens, etc.) and have watched many documentaries as well as UFO craft caught on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 5:50 PM on dec 31, 2013, I was drivng westward home from work and just got onto highway 212, and while I approached the &#34;eden prairie road&#34; exit near chanhassen I at first noticed only one light in the sky to my right, roughly 200-300 feet in the air.  Because of my UFO interest, I daily see objects in the sky and try to figure out what they are out of curiosity, always keeping an eye out for something which is possibly an ET craft.  I am very skeptical, usually concluding most objects are planes, helicopters, or some other known craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this first object appeared as a single light to my right, staying in the same position in the sky, but as I got closer and approached it I noticed three white lights in a triangular pattern underneath. At first I was shocked, thinking &#34;its probably just a helicopter.&#34; Once I got even closer I saw another object with the same set of lights to my left, both appeared to be hovering close to the highway not moving, the one to the left of my was almost directly over the high way. I was travelling at about 50 MPH so I approached them relatively quickly. As I approached  even closer, within about 400 feet I saw both of them had a blinking red light in the middle of the three lights. They were within 500 feet of one another at about the same altitude. I started approaching both of them, but because the object to the right was not as directly over the high way I could not see as clear under it, but I did see same lights on both of them. I passed the first object to the ! right, it stayed in the same spot. I came closer to the second object to my left and once I was nearly directly under it I saw the &#34;shape&#34; of the lights more clear. Three white, stable lights in a triangular pattern with a red light in the middle, all of them were &#34;symmetrical&#34; and evenly distributed within a very close proximity of one another. In my estimate these objects were maybe 20 or 30 feet in diameter overall. The red light was more of a pulsating light, not a quick blink, but rather a more soft pulsation. The lights all looked like the same size. I could not see any &#34;outline&#34; of the objects as it was dark outside, there were absolutely no other lights as far as I could see. I was careful as I could be driving but kept my eye on these objects and got a very good look at the second one to my left. It did not move, no rotating, no altitude change. I kept driving and as I got away it stayed there. As I got off on powers blvd exit and took! a right heading north, I looked to my right and saw three bri! ght whit e balls of light travelling at a fast speed, moving up and down casually performing very odd and almost unearthly maneuvers. I put my eye on the road, passed a few trees to the right which blocked my view, and looked again and the objects had vanished. I have seen videos of supposed ET craft &#34;ascending&#34; out of earths atmosphere in clusters, and even &#34;taking off&#34; and incredibly highspeeds, essentially vanishing, and the way these three craft were elegantly travelling was identical to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not hallucinating, there were hundreds of cars travelling on this road as it was rush hour. I am certain there are others who saw these objects and possibly took photo/video, as I did not. If anyone who reads this report and saw the same thing I urge you to make your own report so others know they are not alone.<n>

There were two and they were so bright white that it was hard to look directly at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not vary in intensity much from the time we first saw them until the last picture was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to blow them up and it looks like something around the lights but I can not make out what is there.  I do not think they were UFOs but I sure do not know what they were.

The apartment is on the second floor with no other buildings obstructing the view from this window, so the object was possibly 1/2 mile to 1 mile away and quite high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one light, then two, then a third in a triangle formation that was spread out length-wise.  I first thought it was a blimp, but that made no sense as there were no games going on that night in LA that I was aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the window and the lights started to spread out more.  One went higher, the other went further away and the third one kept drifting ahead on its original course.  The one that rose higher came more toward us.  We turned off the TV and heard no helicopter rotors.  There were no spotlights either, which would be expected if they were choppers flying in formation like that.  There were no blinking lights... not police lights or anything news choppers would have had.  They were just glowing red dots in the sky that were moving slowly along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of them flew out of sight because trees closer to us obscured them.  But the third one just seemed to be there for a moment, then we looked away for a second to get a phone to try filming them and when we looked again, the 3rd object had vanished, even though it had been moving very slowly and was in the open sky with no trees to slip behind anywhere near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange indeed.  Neither of us had any logical explanation for what we’d seen.  We kept watch for a few minutes longer, but the objects never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No reports of this in the Los Angeles news today or on the internet anywhere.  Would love to know if anyone else saw this.<n>

At first I thought it was a secret us military plane of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flew over my house really slow than sat over my house for about 3 minutes then it disappeared into the sky like no one ever saw it.  At first my friend was leaving to go home then he said, “Hey, come and look at this!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I started to freak out and I ran to my house and told my grandmother what I had encountered she said oh my god really?  And I said yes well I went back outside and it was still hovering over my house and then I told my sister what happened and she also freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went to my neighbor who was recording a video of it and she tried to save the video and for some reason she could not save it and I thought that was weird.  So my friend who encountered it first talked to my neighbor and she saw it too and she said it was a UFO and that is what I said too so it’s still a mystery from that night what I saw.<n>

However as I got closer it remained stationary. Being in the passenger seat I put my head out the window to a clear sky and could clearly see the triangular dark structure of it with its green white and red lights flashing.  I although music was playing low I could not hear a sound from the object.  Then when we got under the object it flew in the opposite direction to what I thought the front of it was.  I got  my friend to then pull  over and the object was no longer visible.  The  highway is very dark so the skies are clearly lit with stars and the weather is very cold but  sky is clear I clouds as well.  I expect other cars on highway might have seen it too.<n>

Wave after wave of the balls came together and then climbed in a string upward into the sky until they went out of sight.

They were much higher up and over the sea to the north west of Marco (probably off the coast near Naples or Fort Myers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked at first as if they were parachutes moving down towards the surface.  I realized that they could not be because they were too far out to sea and were very high up.

I must have taken my eye off the for a second because then I saw both objects take off in a vertical direction out over the gulf at a high speed.

They appeared to stay the same distance apart with the black one a li! ttle lower and behind the bright one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for several minutes as they disappeared into the distance.

I heard a “wrrring” sound and looked up to see a square flying object. It was flying around the apartment buildings, through trees and at various heights.  I was walking my dog and the object would come over and hover over me.  It would then migrate very high very quickly.  It would go around buildings of which a simple toy could not have done due to no visibility when it would approach the back of the buildings.  I was watching it, but I could not see any person in the area.  I watched it for about 15 minutes, of which it came and hover over me again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best that I can estimate, it was between 2 to 3 feet square.  It appeared to have four landing “legs” and you could hear the engine.  At times it was very slow and at times extremely fast.  Again, I looked around and could not see any person.  After about 15 minutes I went back in the building and did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen it since until about 0400 this morning, 1/8/2014.  I was up in my apartment, but had no lights on and saw several flashes from the outside.  This continued for about 2 hours.  I live on the third floor of the apartments.<n>

They appeared literally out of nowhere in the south, hovered around and after a while, they exited almost straight up getting smaller very quickly until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures with my phone and the results are pretty good.  (Should have taken video).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a definite BRIGHT Orange.  Not white or any other shade.  BRIGHT GLOWING orange.  I have never reported anything before but these were NOT a satellites or jet-airplane type craft.  They hovered like a helicopter except far too high in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Certainly.  Thank you for your support.  Our “cabin” is very near Lake Wenatchee State Park, WA, with minimal city light illumination.  I am ((deleted)) years old, am semi-retired from owning a ((deleted)) corporation and this is my 3rd UFO viewing in my lifetime.  The first when I was a child, the next was here (same location) about 10 years ago.  This was a very distinctive non-normal sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The discs were very bright red-orange and hovered…they did not fly in any sort of a straight line like an airplane or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note the color difference.  The white is a star, the orange discs were the moving ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again think you and kind regards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

New years eve 12/31/13, we ended up seeing three before the night was over.  When you first catch glimpse of it you see this bright orange object cruising across the sky.  The three on New Years night were not as clear to me as the one on 12/29/13.  That one was very clear to me and looked to be on fire.  All I can say is weird.  Very curious to know what they are!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

At approximately 10:30 on December 29, 2013 I was walking with my two children and a neighbour and we all noticed an orange glowing light in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was maybe one of the planets because it was relatively large; however it was noticeably larger than any planet I&#39;ve observed and was visibly moving.  For another split moment I thought maybe it was some sort of fireball - such was the colour and shape.  However its movement seemed steady and the shape/size consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there appeared to be a very slight crescent glow (where the bright spot would be at the top centre of the crescent).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light traveled south and at first it seemed to be maybe nearing us slightly, but then appeared to travel away from us while still moving south.  Overall it was moving slowly - like an aircraft a few miles away.  Then it disappeared by fading out over a period of maybe 5 seconds (overall our sighting time might have been around 30 seconds - we didn&#39;t see it appear so don&#39;t know how long it was visible).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights around the orange &#39;ball&#39; as we all wondered if it was the front lights (landing lights?) of an aircraft.  There is a private airport nearby that has small jets and other aircraft frequenting it.  The light however was definitely orange, not the clear/white we normally observe.  Also there were no accompanying flashing lights.  Also there was no sound; and it was a quiet evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some clouds in the sky, however it was mostly clear in this area at the time.  There were stars visible in the sky.  Later in the evening at around 11:00 we went outside to watch the sky again, but clouds at that point covered almost all of the visible sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ultimately thought that maybe it was one of those floating lanterns and landed on that conclusion.  Hopefully this information is helpful.<n>

They were silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was strange so I called my partner in the house and told her to come out and look.  She came out and after a few seconds the orange round lights scattered in the sky.  Some flew to the right and some to the left of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get a pair of binoculars and looked at two of the orange lights to my left.  One began to make quick movement up and down almost as though it were scanning my body (I know this sounds weird).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave the binoculars to my partner so she could watch them.  We both stayed on the porch for about 10 minutes watching them make sudden movements and then standing still in the sky.  When I went in the house there was only one remaining that was visible.  I don&#39;t know where the ! others went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked ourselves into believing that it must have been a military exercise until we saw on the news tonight that some people in California also saw it and their description was the same as what we saw.  We decided we better report that we saw it here in Indiana also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers of this event are both middle aged and both have a professional backgrounds, no mental illness, and have never seen something like this before and have never made a report about UFOs in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lap top that I am on does not have a word processor installed so I had to type this directly instead of copy and paste.

I noticed some were faster than others and all were travelling faster than the clouds which were moving in the same direction however these were moving twice the speed if not faster than the wind.  This continued until about 30 had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the height these were I would estimate the crafts at around 10-12 feet in circumference.  The brightness if these were Chinese lanterns would be at about 1000 candles at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a certain amount of time of watching them they all headed to the same place out East and would disappear.<n>

The entire event lasted over five minutes, long enough that we attempted to run inside and grab our cameras.  Sadly our camera only had enough battery life to capture one photo, while everything else in the frame is still the object blurred and appears as a curved orange line, we assume this is due to how the object was pulsing, while watching with our naked eyes it appeared round and full of light.  After snapping the photo we stood in the street barefoot in our robes and watched until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should add, without giving too much personal information away, that my husband works at Stennis Space Center (30 minutes from our home) and has never encountered anything in his career to relate this object to.  The object was silent and much lower than any planes that fly in our area.<n>

I have never seen an aircraft of this configuration or one at that altitude before, and I have looked at many typical aircraft types in those skies.  This craft was a triangular shape--I could barely make out the outline against the dark sky--and it had 3 solid white lights on the bottom side (one at each point of the triangle).  I suspect it was at about the altitude that single engine small planes are at, but there is no way for me to know; and the size of it is unknown, but I am guessing it was very large.  It was travelling at a high rate of speed because it was only visible for roughly 6 seconds before it went out of sight into the light pollution in the NE sky.  No engine noise was heard like you would expect from a large jet engine and for a craft going that fast.<n>

It the hovered very high above the skyline, made a circle, then dropped below the building and went right to left very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the shape of the craft, kind of like a satellite where you usually just see the light. I see planes, blimps, satellites, luminaries,  and other known objects quite often, I have never seen something move like this fast and covering this distance.  New drone or military would be my guess...weird. Talked with several folks that say it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

A bright light resembling an LED, somewhat shimmering red and green but not flashing or blinking, came from behind us overhead. It moved in a very direct line, quickly, from southwest to northeast.  I would guess an altitude of 1-3 miles.  At a point about 5 miles from us, it came to an abrupt stop.  It then made several squarish maneuvers in a small area and then stopped again.  Each time it stopped it was for about 30 seconds. It then proceeded south, quickly again, and came to a stop again.  It performed the same moves as mentioned.  It then dropped straight down until it was out of sight because of homes nearby.  I would estimate that it dropped in the area over Lake St Clair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was very clear and dark and cold.  No cloud cover.  There were several aircraft also visible.  This made the comparison very stark.  It seemed to all of us that this object was not at all similar to any standard aircraft, including helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired construction company owner from NC. My son is head of facilities maintenance at Coleman Young Itn&#39;l Airport.  The neighbor works for GM and the brother-in-law is a route salesman.  The niece is about 13 yrs old. to the best of my knowledge everyone there has a reasonable education. Nobody was drunk or on drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the episode we also called out several others (4-5 more people) that were visiting inside.  All adults.  They also watched but only for a minute or so.<n>

My wife noticed a couple of orange light objects in the sky.  I slowed down and the pulled the car over and we all watched.  Two or three orange lights moved across the sky in a manner faster than an aircraft would but not too fast.  The lights moved toward each other and then one passed the other one.  They then seemed to stay in about the same relative location, what appeared flame like came out of both of them, they both moved directly upward until they could no longer be seen.  During this same time a couple of much larger, dark geometric shaped objects moved across the sky much lower.  They appeared to have mass and thickness.  These objects had no lights on them only appeared visible by the night sky.  The dark objects moved in the same direction as the lights from the southeast to the northwest.  The dark objects moved at a steady speed across the sky.<n>

Though as they moved across the sky, there was a light to medium gust of wind at which didn&#39;t seem to effect their line of motion, in other words, the wind didn&#39;t push the objects.<n>

I ran out to the beach to get a better view but didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I saw another reddish-orange orb originate around the apache pier and was traveling south towards me.  It was about the same height as the previous orb.  When it was almost directly overhead it turned east towards the ocean, as it flew into a small low flying cloud it began to fade out but I could still see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb changed to an off white or a greyish white and began twirling downward until it hit the water.  As it was falling I noticed one end had 2 rounded globes, like on a heart and the other end was smaller but didnt see to much detail on that end, I ran to the waters edge and approximately 40&#39; to 50&#39;away from me it hit the water.  It looked to be about 2-1/2 to 3 foot across the widest part.  I watched it float for maybe 5 minutes.  I then left to get my wife and when we returned it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after we returned home, I went back out on the porch and another reddish-orange glowing orb flew over the same condo and faded out almost directly overhead and turned off white or greyish white and continued over the apartment and out of sight.  We went outside but couldn&#39;t see or find anything.<n>

Living on the flight path of the Philly airport I see and hear jets of all types every minute or so as they approach and know all of the flight paths of even the jets going over at 30 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was solid with no strobes or color changes and moving slowly with an occasional hesitation and drift then back on a straight course again. It was above the normal landing approach height and crossing over their path, it was also below the height of the jets already at high altitude passing over, unless it was the size of a football stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never in my life seen anything like this.  Too big and bright for any kind of satellite which I Googled to compare.  I tried to video it on my cell but couldn&#39;t capture it as I was fumbling as I was trying to get to my video app and watch the light at the same time.  :(<n>

I noticed out of the corner of my eye, what appeared to be a star moving.  In comparison the light was as big as a star in the sky, but way brighter.  I guess it to have been cloud height.  It jutted forward with amazing speed, stopped for a brief second, then went up and down while moving forward across the sky.  Suddenly it stopped, backed up a little ways and then did a complete and perfect circle flying backwards in the sky. It moved like fluid if that makes sense.  After the circle it just floated straight ahead until the light went out or it went into cloud cover, i am not sure.  Was heading due east.<n>
12/28/13 17:10|Rocky Mount|VA|Changing|10 minutes|Black hovering object seen in daylight hours.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105570.html|156|ndxe201312| Black hovering object seen in daylight hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out cutting firewood in my in-laws back yard about a 20-30 minutes before dark and I looked up hill and between the house and some tall trees through the opening I saw what appeared to be a very large helicopter off in the distance.  It appeared so large that I thought it might be a chinook (I think that is the one with dual rotors.)  I looked at it for 5 to 10 seconds and then when I didn’t hear it, I asked my wife “what is that contraption flying towards us?”   It did not make a sound which had me interested in it.  It seemed to be traveling at normal helicopter speed what ever that is (80-120mph??)  Like a medevac helicopter when you see them approach and fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to get larger and then went out of view behind the house.  I walked up the hill some to get a better view of it as it came back into my line of site my wife was standing right next to me further up the hill.  When it appeared again,(maybe 10-20 seconds after going out of view) it was actually out beyond the house not precisely over it.  By this time it was clearly black in color with the shape undefined.  The top appeared to be narrower than the bottom and it seemed to me to be oscillating very slightly.  (this very well could be just my brain trying to make sense of what I was seeing based on past experience only small electric drones move in that way with little or no sound)After this seemingly normal speed (for a large helicopter) approach it came to what appeared to be a slow deceleration until it came to a complete stop roughly 500 feet from where I was standing and maybe 300-400 feet in the air. It stayed there for maybe a minute or two with very little mov! ement.  It seemed as if it saw us standing in the yard looking at it and came to a slow stop.  After the one or two minutes it began moving again it moved up in a very different direction than it was going before it came to a stop.  It moved at a very steep angle almost directly away from us.  It took 3-5 minutes to finally go out of view.  I stood and watched it the whole entire time to see if it would eventually dart away or make some other kind of unusual maneuver but it did not.  It seemed to go directly away in a straight line from me up into the sky until passing out of view.  (surpass my ability to see it in the distance) From the time it came over the house to stopping it appeared to be much smaller than when we first saw it. Even though it was a lot closer it appeared to be smaller. So for the time it took to disappear I would guess it was traveling at 10-20 mph as it went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on feeling after it appeared over the house I estimate its size to be about 3ft by 3ft, black in color, with an indiscernible shape.<n>

As it did so, I noticed beyond and behind the plane at some further distance, approximately 5 white dots in an erratic formation, rather like balloons, or birds flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the time it took me to estimate how many there were, they blinked out and vanished.  At first I thought maybe they were seagulls, further away than the plane, but then, had seagulls travelled beyond my range of vision, I don&#39;t think they would have all instantly vanished at exactly the same time, but would rather, have faded from view, and changed their distance relative to one another.<n>

I went into my kids room to turn off their tv and I went to close their window blinds, and I seen what I that was a bright star.  Then I noticed there where clouds behind the bright light.  As i noticed this it pulsed like strobe for just a couple of seconds, then it seemed like it went from a white light to a soft yellow..it was at a good distance from me but I could tell it was big.  I ran and grabbed my cell and started snapping pics as fast as my cell would let me.  I zoomed in as far as my phone would let me.  I could see what I thought where flashes and thought my eyes where just playing with me as I snapped away pics.  I could only see the bright object on the right as I pointed and aimed the camera.  It was not until I looked through the pics I seen the other spheres.  The big bright one does not move.  The others moved around it.  At one point it looked like they where flashing some kind of communication between each other.  I do not believe it is one object because the lights moved around as they flashed.  This is not my first time I have seen something like this.  I&#39;m just thankful I had a camera this time.  At the end of the spheres flashing the bright one on the right is the last to leave, and it just kind of fades away.  I couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night and watched for it but I did not see it again.  I am sending everything I have.  I tried to hold it as steady as possible.  Any streaks of movement was from me I believe.  They did not move around. Just would flash and appear in a different spot.<n>

There was several tractor trailers headed East/South that may have seen as well.  Emitted no sound and was gone as fast as it appeared.  This was just like another sighting earlier this year but the object headed  West this time and not North, same light same duration.<n>

One was like a normal aircraft but was to high for a normal airliner and like a weird light pattern.  It has rectangle LED style light all under the wings.  At some point those lights turned off to like make it look like a normal aircraft.  But it was very high up to where if it was normal lights I wouldn&#39;t be able to see it because those lights would of been turned off at that altitude.    The other ship I saw looked like a mother ship that you would see off the movies.  It had no lights and I had to look and stare at it to see it.  It did not move and it just hovered at a high altitude.  It looked black and it was like a cylinder shape with massive size wings.  I  was talking to a friend on Skype and I went out there for a second time to turn on my cam.  He saw the mother ship style thing.  Then that is when I saw the second ship that I talked above above.  The wings of the LED style craft looked to leaned back to be a normal aircraft.  The mother ship style thing looked MASSIVE at that high altitude.  I would guess it would be at a altitude of around 30 to 50 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We took Imperial highway.  We we up high on the side of a large hill and to the right we could see all of Anaheim.  There were houses to the right also but we were above them.  I was staring out the window and all of a sudden an aircraft appeared.  It was so close to us, super close.  I stared at it for 10 seconds with my jaw opened before alerting my boyfriend who was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After he looked over it was there for 2 seconds more and zipped away so far that it was almost completely out of sight.  Visually it was two massive lights that appeared to be orbiting around an object in the center.  The lights were bright green and blue.  Whatever was in between them was too dark for me to see in such a short amount of time.  There was no sound at all..when i first stared at it it was so close-like right outside the window and after 10 seconds it zipped away so far that i couldn&#39;t see it.  If it was a plane or helicopter i would have been able to watch it gradually fly away- not immediately.  So cool.<n>

I had just about made it to the junction of CORNELIUS and CHAMBERLAIN and saw a very large, low-Flying V-shaped object in the sky, with bright, orange-yellow lights on each end or point of the V or triangle. The object was stationary and huge in the sky.  When I spotted this object, I was on the phone with my father who lives close by.  I told him tO go outside and look. He saw the object and couldn&#39;t identify it either (and he was in the Airforce).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, this aircraft was completely still, and then it started moving Southbound.  I crossed Cornelius and stopped my car to get a pic, but it vanished.  One blinking light in the middle . . . I&#39;d say no more than 100 or 200 feet up.  Anyone else see this?

This was against the wind currents at that time and no cloud cover.  The light was of greater intensity than any current star, planet, or aircraft typically sighted at this time of year and did NOT change color, shape, size or speed during the duration.  As if someone lit a roadflare and flown it across the sky.  A video of the object was made but is grainy, not really showing anything useful and no where near as bright as the object appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was observed coming from the direction of the object.  As the object got closer, it was going to go into an area that was obstructed by trees in my yard.  Once it became obscured, it disappeared.  I visibly scanned the area for several minutes from different perspectives to see if the object had changed direction or intensity in light but never saw anything else.  The amount of time from when the object was spotted to when it was lost or disappeared was around 1 minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later, at  2115 (9:15 PM), the object, or another one just like it, reappeared in the same area/location as the first one and traveled in approximately the same direction/speed as the original( horizon to very close to my location).  It had the same color and intensity as the original one 30 minutes prior.  I first observed the second object from the same location as the first, and it to, was in the process of being obscured by the treeline.  I moved very quickly to change perspective in order to continue observing the object.  This change in one location to another was less than three seconds.  Again, during that change in vantage point, the object disappeared in the same spot as the first one.  Again, a visual scan from multiple vantage points within several seconds of the disappearance yielded nothing, no other aircraft in the area, no sounds of any kind from the object, no change in surroundings.  A continued visual scan of all surroundings for the nex! t hour Clouds moved in from opposite direction) yielded no further sitings.  No video was taken of second object.<n>

So for me it was becoming a very personal experience, and I tend to internalize deeply-felt emotions, so I didn’t feel the time was right to bring it up.  On the night of December 27, I had a sudden change of heart.  I went outside at 7:00 with my dogs (two labs).  As soon as I opened the door they went charging off through the snow, barking and howling with a viciousness I’d never heard from them before.  Every dog (I think ten in total) on the five additional farms within two miles of our place was barking and howling in the same aggressive manner.  We have lots of coyotes around here, and when the pack comes through our yard the dogs have a very distinct way of responding to them.  When they bark, they sound stern, gruff, and assertive.  This was nothing like that. They were snarling and shrieking at a fever pitch. Canine hysteria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up in the northwestern sky, I saw a bright orange “star,” once again out of place in the stellar grid.  Within five seconds it started to move, heading south and then southeast.  The faster it went, the brighter it became.  Then I saw a bright white flash roughly 15 degrees due west.  It was the shape of a massive halo, and there was a tiny white pinprick of light in the center.  It started to pulse like a camera flash as the orange light passed before it.  This caused the orange light to accelerate, freakishly fast.  The halo continued to pulsate, about once every three seconds for around 30 seconds, while remaining stationary.  Each pulse of light remained visible for just a fraction of a second, but it never wavered or decreased in intensity.  It was more luminous than a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I ran inside and told my Dad:  “Come look at the UFOs!” He came out immediately.  I brought a monocular and we watched the orange light race across the sky, heading southeast. The white halo, however had disappeared.  As I was telling my dad what it had looked like, he pointed out another “star” which started to move.  At first it was white, and then turned orange, following the first light on a southeastern trajectory.  When they disappeared, we were left listening to the dogs howling and snarling hysterically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:10 my dad went to bed (he gets up early), taking our dogs in with him.  I stayed out, scanning the skies for anything unusual. By 7:15 the skies were being crisscrossed by a total of six aircraft with orange strobe lights.  It was roughly the same color orange as the UFOs. However, there was a distinct difference.  The UFOs were faster, they could remain stationary, they changed colors, and they displayed no strobe flashes.  Two of the aircraft flew in single file from north to south, two side by side from northwest to southeast, and two in single file from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:30 PM while looking southeast, I saw two orange lights pass through the constellation Orion. I cannot say whether or not they were the same ones my dad and I had seen moments before.  Both were firing (or emitting) white beams of light (this may sound silly, but they were just like the laser beams you’d see in Star Wars, only white).  I don’t think they were meteors because they emanated directly from the orange lights.  One was in close pursuit of the other, and it looked like they were firing on each other.  After four of these beams were fired in quick succession, the big white pulsating halo appeared in the center of Orion and flashed twice.  Once again, it was brighter than a full moon.  After the second flash, the two orange lights rapidly diminished to white, then became invisible.  The halo never pulsated again.  The dogs on the neighboring farms were still howling and barking hysterically.  I was left feeling stunned, then overwhelmed.  Then I wept, which is not something I do on a regular basis.  By 8:00 the dogs quit howling.  It was a windy night and I was unable to sleep.<n>

Above it was a very bright light I thought was a star.  The light was stationary while watching the aircraft.  After a few minutes I started walking again.I got winded and stopped again a few minutes later and looked up to watch the aircraft and saw the &#34;star&#34; now moving at a good speed towards the southeast. I watched it til it faded from sight.  I have a set of Swarovski 10x binoculars(very good optics)and looked at the light thru them when I first saw it moving.  It was just a very bright white light with no shape.<n>

I stopped and sat on a ridge overlooking a wetland to the north and a grassy swale to the south.  To the south there were several deer emerging from a clump of willows.  I was observing them through a monocular.  I stayed out after sunset to look for owls (I’m a birder) and, realizing that the full moon was about to rise, I turned to the east and waited.  It was partly-cloudy; long, trailing stratus formations rolling off to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fifteen degrees above the northeastern horizon I noticed an emerging “star” which I immediately sensed as being out of place (too early and too bright to be Jupiter).  After ten seconds of observation, it became brighter than Venus (which was itself clearly visible in the southwest).  At first it was amber, but then grew to a bright, blazing hunter-orange.  After 20-30 seconds of observation it started to spin downwards, from the northeast to the southeast, in wide looping arcs.  It did this for roughly one minute.  Upon completing its fifth arc, it shot across the northeastern sky at a baffling speed as if it had been launched from a sling.  As soon as it disappeared from view, the top of the moon (bright orange as well) peaked over the horizon. It seemed as if it were aimed directly at the moonrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out again the following night, but saw nothing.<n>

Heard a very loud sound that was similar to thunder, checked the sky, it couldn&#39;t be thunder.  Decided it had to be a reallllly loud truck in the distance.  But wait- there are no trucks around here.  About a minute or less after I heard the loud sound in the sky, saw a bright falling thing that at first, I thought was a star I could make a wish on, then when I saw it was green I thought it was a plane going down.  It got bigger and at the end of the three seconds looked like a big bright green (like the go light on a stoplight, but a little bigger) ball of light falling from the sky.  It disappeared as soon as it hit the fog layer.  (I live way up high above the fog)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I was taking pictures, the object was on my left from where i was standing and was moving to my right.  Then this object starting flying upwards for about 20 seconds and disappeared.  What i did noticeabout this UFO was that there was no strobe lights it was just one solid orange color it was glowing in the sky sort of like a shine from a fire but i doubted it was fire until investigated and seen recent reports of a mystical &#34;ufo fireball&#34; and then stated to believe that’s what i saw.  When i was snapping the pictures the object was in motion.  If you rewiew my pictures and zoom in on every picture you’ll see the orange orb.  On the pictures that show the tree was when the object was flying upwards, on these pictures i had the camera on slow shutter speed at 2 seconds i believe i took pictures of a UFO.  I would please like everyone to review my pictures and my report.<n>

It was dark, with stars out last night, clear sky.  It had a lot of red flashing lights on it.  It was white in color with red lights.  It appeared to have a criss-crossing of lines on it, almost looking like a snowflake.  It would sit motionless for a while, then move jerkingly through the sky.  Finally it went too far for me to be able to keep watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/26/13 23:00|Batesville|MS|Unknown|10 minutes|Mysterious Lights seen over field; Caught on Video.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105604.html|198|ndxe201312| Mysterious Lights seen over field; Caught on Video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 2 miles off of Interstate 55 and exit 246 (&#34;North Batesville&#34;), numerous unidentified flying objects were seen.  Me and my Father were outside, and upon looking to the North (directly North), we noticed multiple lights over a vast field on the North side of Highway 35.  We immediately got our video camera and prepared to take video.  By the time we cut the camera on, and then got back outside to bein filming, the object(s) started moving.  They seem intelligent, as they began to span out as we started recording from our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects move extremely fast and are much larger than an airplane.  The Panola County Airport is down the road a small distance and we see airplanes and helicopters all the time---  This was neither.  I have no knowledge of any aircraft that can go from a dead stand-still and move a couple miles within seconds.  And the G-Force would be unbearable, in my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects also can stop on a dime and begin traveling in the opposite direction.  They are some form of intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting a couple of video clips, the objects slowly vanished one by one.  They seemed to, flash and burn off.  It was at one point four different lights visible, all of which appear (through camera and binoculars) to blink a red, white, green/blue pattern.  The lights seem to move independently.  In addition, at the beginning of filming, we noticed a motor vehicle driver was stopped, facing North, on a road meeting Highway 35.  I believe he/she observed the lights also, but after a few moments, they left the scene going Westbound on Highway 35 towards Interstate 55.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year near this time, we experienced the same lights, and their was atleast 4 witnesses at that point. We were unable to capture video last year, and are and were shocked we captured the clips this year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure why the river and Sardis Lake seems to be a hot spot, but its obviously a lot of activity, from personal experience and from reading others reports after this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other notes...: There was no, I repeat NO noise from these objects. And no traffic on the Highway, other than the one driver who came from a nearby road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain any of this. But I know what I saw, and so does my Father. And if you do not believe me, my video will prove, if nothing else, what we seen. But, our video nor my testimony can completely concrete what exactly was seen. It is vast possibilities, but low probabilities of anything other than, an extra-terrestrial of some sort.<n>

The color was orange-red glow, circular or spherical but out of focus -fuzzy . Size seemed larger than aircraft on approach to SL International .  It was the impression that they were moving towards our location getting bigger.  If behind the aircraft that was on approach they would be very large ,  if between the aircraft and our location maybe they would be size of an aircraft -jet liner .  Looking at it with binoculars which are pre-set to look at distant aircraft or the mountain range on the other side of the valley they seemed out of focus .  The image was quite a bit larger than expected .  Not out of focus blur but many red separate individual red concentric protrusions in the circle .  It was observed momentarily with the binoculars then handed off to the second observer while the camera wa! s fetched (30 seconds) .  The objects didn’t seemed to be moving towards us after a few moments  but moving away maybe about a 90 degrees turn running parallel to the aircraft on approach to SLC and getting smaller but rising up still holding the original shape and color and still in tandem.  The objects were fading fast and loosing color while rising up going in the same direction as the jet liner on approach .  About 5 disappointing pictures were captured showing color of the two objects and maybe direction but out of focus and blurry.  The action happened very fast and no time to think about  camera settings.  We’re pleased with the experience and believe it to be stimulating .<n>

I shouted &#34;LOOK!&#34; as the lights were so unusual with such a flight path and at such slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought it could be a hoax, but then as the yrotated in fixed orbit with each other, the top most light ball, very rapidly went upwards and away from the other 2 lights, then the lower 2 lights leveled out to a flat plane, then as it became level with the horizon, a single red light began to blink between the 2 white lights that were left behind. At this point I simply thought, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s a plane.&#34;  But in the morning realized that did not explain the fixed orbit rotation of all 3 lights initially, then the single orb that flew up and away rapidly.  While my common sense tried to kick in and tell me this was only an aircraft, the more it did not make ! sense.  I am totally bummed I had not seen in a few seconds sooner and wish I had stopped the car to see the whole sequence of events, as we were looking to park the car.  What is funny is that I saw enough for myself to convince me it was something different, but as soon as I shouted &#34;LOOK!&#34; and my gf looked, it began acting more like an aircraft except for the 1 light I could not explain.  Totally confused and amazed all at once.  An awesome start to 2014   :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noted an RV at the bottom of this mountain with a similar sun glare.  Very familar with this area and knowing that no shiny object could be atop that mountain I stopped the vehicle to get a better look.  The object then moved a short distance and the glare abated.  The object was plainly visible as a large solid white ball larger than the RV still in view.  This object moved slowly over the top of the mountain and down out of sight into the canyon behind.<n>

I saw a bluish solid circle of light hovering over the tree line.  It was hard to determine the size relative to the trees but as I was travelling 35 mph and it didn&#39;t appear to move...it seemed large and motionless.  I immediately felt apprehensive to the point of dread.  I told my passenger to look and as he looked up, the object shot down to the ground...which scared him and me too.  We went to the Allatoona boat ramp to see if we could see what had fallen out of the sky...but it was cold and creepy and we didn&#39;t see any evidence of anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine my surprise when I found this website and spotted very similar sitings by others close by.  I have always felt safe living in this area, but now I find myself much more cautious...and now I&#39;m keeping the gun close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In relation to the moon, if the moon was a quarter the circle of light was a nickel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of the object reminded me of those annoying blue halogen headlights and was definitely not a natural light source.  It didn&#39;t look like any aircraft, balloon, Chinese lantern, or drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moonlight made it possible to see that there was no other craft attached to the light.  It just hung there like someone shining a superbright flashlight into the world from somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object dropped at a speed that seemed inconsistent with falling.  It was so fast it was like someone ripped it down from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Upon paying further attention I noticed 2 other red lights.  They were in a large triangular shape formation.  The red lights were very bright and I had never seen them before in the sky.  As I watched them I was covered in goosebumps.  After maybe 2 minutes the 3 lights began to change their color to &#34;starlight color&#34;  If there was only one of them doing this I could have passed it off as the red shift of a star. but not all three at once.  The final  thing that happened was the all began to dim and disappear at the same time.  The light that was to the right then cam back &#34;on&#34; for about 10 seconds then was gone.  Needless to say.....I will be looking for it again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/25/13 23:05|Elgin|IL|Cylinder|~3 minutes|A cylinder shaped object with a reddish glow and yellow fireball clusters moves slowly across the sky.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105657.html|221|ndxe201312| A cylinder shaped object with a reddish glow and yellow fireball clusters moves slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard which is on the north side of my property.  I observed what at first I believed to be fireworks ascending from the west.  I observed a reddish glow with what appeared to be a yellowish fireball in the center.  Being Christmas I assumed that one of the neighbors had lit a firework, as they do on holidays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light continued to ascend and moved in an easterly path almost directly over my backyard.  It maintained an elevation of approx. 150 feet and continued in an almost due east direction.  The speed of this object was slow, guessing about 10 to 15 miles per hour.  I observed this object as it went further away from me until it appeared to fade into the low cloud cover about 1 to 2 miles east of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of this object seemed to be fluctuating a bit, but mainly appeared to be of a cylinder shape.  The description I gave to the local police was that it kind of looked like a red jellyfish with a cluster of 2 or 3 fireballs in the center of it floating across the sky. At one point as this object wavered there appeared to be lines extending from the top of the cylinder down the sides in a uniform manner.  Similar to the tentacles of jellyfish.  However there was a defined bottom to the lines almost like a veil. It almost appeared that the red aura was from the illumination of the center fireball cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the size of this object, but I roughly guess that the top to bottom length was about 5 feet and that the diameter was about 3 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, there was no sound detectable by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.<n>
12/25/13 22:38|Saint Paul|MN|Light|25-35 seconds|Red and Green light bars seen at low elevation.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106291.html|222|ndxe201312| Red and Green light bars seen at low elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on 25 December 2013 at 22:38 hours Central Time (I have changed the other witnesses name for this record)  I am a taxi driver in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  I was dispatched to pick up a regular customer at a popular large night spot near Grand and Victoria Avenues.  I pulled into the long driveway that goes from Grand to the alley between Grand and Summit Ave.  I was facing north seated in my cab.  I saw John, the regular I was sent to pick up, standing in the patio area.  He was smoking a cigarette and talking to someone.  He held up his finger indicating I should wait a moment.  No problem, John is a very generous and regular customer so I had no problem giving him a moment to conclude his activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through the windshield and saw at about 25 degrees up two horizontal bars of light. The upper one was red, the lower was green.  They were of equal length. There appeared to be 8 or so &#34;bulbs&#34; in each bar, however the both bars were uniformly illuminated their respective colors so they may not have been bulbs.  There appeared to be a small reflection or dim light situated between the two bars.  The space between the two bars (where I saw the dim reflection/light) was about 2/3ds the height of the bars.  I cannot say the length of the bars but If I had to guess I&#39;d say 20 feet, but since I didn&#39;t know how high up/far away the bars were dimensions are hard to speculate about. I did not seem very high up in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not detect any body or outline behind the light bars.  The sky was the darkest navy blue/black it can probably be.  I have checked, and the moon was on the other side of the planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So while I am noticing these lights John has made it around and clambered into the cab. I immediately ask John, &#34;John, what the hell is that?&#34; while pointing through the windshield at the light bars. At first he glanced and said, &#34;An airplane.&#34;  I then said,&#34;Doesn&#39;t look like any airplane I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;  Then there was a very brief pause. John then said,&#34;OH, WAIT.&#34; as he gathered in what he was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a second or so before John got in the cab, the red light bar turned off, then turned on.  The green light bar followed suit.  John witnessed the second round of the bars turning off and on in turn. Once again - red off, red on, green off, green on.  At this point we are both just staring.  This is when the really odd bit comes in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light bars moved off to the northeast and disappeared behind the giant trees on Summit Ave. Now, I was in the Navy and I have seen, and even once, been on a helicopter. This did not move like a helicopter.  There was no gradient in the speed.  By this I mean it went from completely stationary to moving off at, I&#39;d say 40 mph.  I heard no noise at all. John audibly gasped when it moved, I expect it is because it just didn&#39;t look right in terms of that kind of instantaneous movement; it was at speed immediately.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when those bars moved off like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done some checking and no aircraft I can find has such illumination.  In fact using these color lights in this fashion is a violation of FAA regs.  According to my understanding green is meant to indicate the right wingtip/side only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> John and I looked at each other with a HOLY S**t look on our faces.  I shook my head and put the cab in gear to take John to his destination.  We both scanned the sky to the north as we proceeded toward downtown.  We didn&#39;t see anything else in the sky the rest of the way to John&#39;s. I dropped John off, he didn&#39;t say anything.  He looked a little disturbed by our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes or so after we saw the lights a low bank of clouds rolled in over the city.  This bank of clouds had a very distinct leading edge.  I thought these clouds a bit odd too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sit here now wondering what it is I saw. Any ideas would be appreciated greatly.<n>

He pointed out what seemed to be flickering star. as we watched it darted up and down, left and right, diagonal and it was FAST.  it was pretty far away so at the speed it was moving was pretty intense to look as quick as it did from our point of view.  He said he had been watching for about 30 min.  It stuck with me more because he is an ex-military helicopter pilot- and might know a thing or two about flight.  I drove back over to my restaurant to show the kitchen guys, 2 waiters a busser, a kitchen guy and even 3 customers (the waiter told them) came out to see.  At that point there were 2 &#39;fireballs&#39; and one had a light shining down on the water.  It was really far out we could not make out the shape or what the light was on other than the water.  After a few min we all went back inside then a second kitchen guy wanted to see, when we went back out there were 3. the far left one was the most volatile moving erratically.  The middle one was the brightest but slower to move and would appear and disappear randomly.  The far right one was the most calm and the one with the light.  The light turned off, it went straight up then diagonal out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now i am afraid to go to sleep!<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone knows what else that could be that would be welcomed!!<n>

12/25/13 21:30|Port Richey|FL|Light|5-10 Minutes|Red light or ball at low altitude moving at the speed of a helicopter but with no sound whatsoever.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105658.html|227|ndxe201312| Red light or ball at low altitude moving at the speed of a helicopter but with no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:30pm on Christmas day  I was walking the dog in a northerly direction up our street and noticed at a distance what appeared to be a low flying plane or helicopter except that the light/s were very unusual (the sky was clear and the temp was about 60 degrees F).  It was flying at a low altitude about a mile or two in front of me in a SSE direction.  It gradually circled west and flew directly towards me from the east.  I figured it was a police helicopter or similar but there was no sound.  By this time I was returning to my house heading south back down our street when it flew directly overhead heading west.  I fully expected to hear some kind of engine noise but there was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mostly a bright red light and moving at about 75mph like the speed of a helicopter.  I witnessed this for about a minute or two until it disappeared heading west towards the coast.  I hurried back down the street to my house thinking how I was going to explain this to my wife.  As I approached the driveway I looked up and there it was again heading east to west but slightly north of me, not directly overhead.  I rushed in to the house and persuaded my wife and son to quickly come outside so they could witness it too.  Sure enough they saw it as clear as I did the first time and the three of us watched it fade into the darkness heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured it may have circled around twice but it is quite possible the second sighting could have been another identical object because I never saw it circle back from the first time.  I went and fetched my binoculars and stayed outside for a while but never saw it again.  It is hard to determine the size of it but the closest thing would be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mostly red with hints of orange and yellow like a fireball but it flew smoothly and slowly like a light aircraft.  I am retired, educated and well traveled and was skeptical about UFO&#39;s until that moment.  I am still trying to convince myself it was a man powered craft but the evidence supports the UFO theory.  Being Christmas day I thought of convincing my six year old son that it was Santa in his sleigh but thought better of it!  He said &#34;Dad, I think it&#39;s an alien&#34;.<n>

They did not appear to be airplanes because there was no engine sounds and the lights were orange and they were not following typical flight paths that I&#39;ve seen with planes.  They were in a loose v formation/ obtuse triangle.  I saw stars in between the 3 lights so I knew it was not a single craft.  The light in the more northern position suddenly made a relatively sharp turn and headed north/northeast.  The other 2 continued NW and began to cross cross paths until the tree line of a western mountain/hill blocked my view.<n>

It flew across the sky, from the east to west; our pool area faces south and we were able to watch it as it crossed the night sky to the south of us.  It moved at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to determine the altitude of the object, but it could not have been more than several thousand feet.  There were no flashing lights.  It made absolutely no noise.  It was a bright, illuminated, reddish-orange object and it flew on a level course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 35-40 second sighting, our neighbor’s dog began barking (this could have been a response to our excited conversation during the sighting).<n>

They flew in single file formation about 30-60 seconds apart.  They made no sound and had no strobes or other lights that you would typically find on commercial aircraft.  All five of the lights faded in a flickering manner and disappeared in the same location.  They appeared to be very high in altitude and might have been climbing at the time they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching aircraft fly over Huntington Beach at night for more than 30 years and I&#39;ve never seen a set of lights like these from this location.  I&#39;m also sure they were not Chinese lanterns because they covered too much distance in a very short period of time.  Their speed also appeared to be steady and it didn&#39;t appear to change.<n>

He hollered into the house where the rest of us were and told us to come look at this weird orange light.  Myself, my mother, my 14 year old son, my older brother, all came outside to see what he was talking about.  He pointed up at the night sky and we all saw this orange light moving across the sky in a southern direction almost overhead of the house.  We watched it move by for several minutes. It appeared to be maybe 1,500 feet or so in altitude.  When it got to about 30 degrees off the horizon it just started fading out and then disappeared  My son just got a gopro camera for Christmas so he was filing it with that.  My mother filmed it with her digital video camera.  I took some shots with my Iphone.  After it went out about 5 min later we saw a second orange light coming from the North from Phoenix heading due south but it had a red appearance in the front but by the time it came over us it was also completely orange.  You couldn&#39;t make out a shape other then it was a round orange ball of light.  It was also at about 1,500-2,000 feet and traveled slowly and went out at about the same location as the first one.  My mother who was filming it on her video camera and zooming in on it said after it went out she could see it turn sharply to the right and disappear.  We have video and still shots of the orange lights.  We discussed whether these were just Chinese lanterns we saw but since we have seen those before none of us felt they were.  It was a clear night and there was no wind at ground level.  I base the altitude based on my Cessna flying experience in this area.  The objects took about 5 minutes to transverse the sky from our initial sighting  until it went out and was no longer visible.  It went over the Villages at Rancho El Dorado subdivison in Maricopa, AZ Pinal County.<n>

It was moving in a South East direction.  It was a solid bright white light when it started moving.  As it began to increase speed it faded to an orange and then red before changing direction to a easterly heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction change was immediate, unlike a plane which must bank to turn.  This thing was going one way and then bang went the other direction before blinking out.  It was very shocking.<n>

The night is clear, no clouds, not a lot of stars are visible due to city lights, my grandson, 11 and granddaughter, 8 are witnesses.  I pulled off to the side of the road and we watched the lights until they disappeared.<n>

We rounded a turn to a clearing overlooking a valley and spotted approximately 7 brightly lit red-orange orbs about 700 feet off the ground in a fairly random formation.  No sounds were audible from said objects.  No flashing or other light features; they were a solid, even color and brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be stationary initially, but after we passed the area I checked my mirrors to see if they were still there and they were over the road, so evidently they were moving quite slowly.  We thought maybe they were the beacons atop radio towers at first but realized that towers are generally lit down their masts as well, not just the top.  My wife was watching them out the rear window of the car and eventually they passed over the road and disappeared over a hill.  The whole experience was over in 5 minutes or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are familiar with airplanes, hot air balloons and helicopters; but the lighting looked nothing like any aircraft we&#39;ve ever seen, and that&#39;s saying something because we live 2 miles from an airbase and major airport.<n>

One time coming home from work I noticed a very bright object in the sky.  Since I have seen this object many times I jokingly said to myself &#34; OK fellows I&#39;m headed home if you want to get some pictures please follow me&#34;.  It appeared to move as I drove home.  It was appearing out of my right passenger side window. When I turned down a street closer to where I live, low and behold...there it was, a bright ball of light in the sky.  I pulled over onto the grass and got my Canon camera.  I leaned on my car and carefully zoomed in with the camera at 140x magnification.  To the naked eye it looked like a star.  With the camera zoomed in, it appeared to be a large pulsating disc with rings in it.  It also appeared to a have a darker center, sometimes going from small to slightly larger.  Sometimes it looked circular, other times it looked octagonal.  It looked like a large pulsating, living, organism.  ! I stopped filming and went home where I noticed it again, low on the horizon just above the tree line but far away.  I got out the camera again and this time the pulsating disc shrunk into a ball of light.  At one point it appeared to have some sort of flashing tail, appearing only for a few seconds at a time.  The tail always pointed in an upward direction.  I have filmed these pulsating discs many times over the last week or so.  Usually they always shrink into a ball of light almost as if they know someone is filming them.  I have never witnessed such incredible phenomenon in my whole life.  These discs look like what the astronauts have filmed at the Space Station, large pulsating discs flying in space where the International Space Station is.  I&#39;d be curious to see what an astronomer would think of my video.  Maybe they can be rationally explained, maybe not.  That&#39;s why they are termed &#34; UFO&#39;s&#34;.<n>

I thought it was a helicopter.  Then I saw the second one.  I peeked out the blinds and saw 3 red/orange lights making the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the back door telling mom I think I see something out side.  We opened the sliding door to our back yard.  And we saw the 3 lights making the triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off the volume on the TV and we didn&#39;t hear a single noise coming from the thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see a star right above our back yard, and another star over one of the duplex&#39;s across our back yard. But I couldn&#39;t see any stars between the 3 lights.  So I think they were on the corners of something solid. But I couldn&#39;t see anything solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going south over the duplex&#39;s back yards, when it came to the end of the back yards, it seemed to bank and spin to turn south east over the town houses at the end of our block.  I remembered my iPod. When I got back to the door, the iPod couldn&#39;t&#39; see the lights at all so it wouldn&#39;t take a picture of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we heard a plane flying over head, we could hear the plane and see the lights and flashing lights on the plane, the plane looked higher in the sky then the triangle thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran up stairs and looked out my mom&#39;s bedroom window to watch it slowly move out of town and the rear lights winked out of sight.  Then the front light eventually winked out as well.<n>

At the time, we saw several commercial aircraft at the same heigh or lower.  Her parent&#39;s home is on the flightpath for George Bush Intercontinental Airport.  The balls appeared to be flying at a similar altitude and heading as the airplanes.  They moved fairly quickly, faster than the jets on the flightpath, but not erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not have any blinking nav lights like an aircraft, and travelled from the Southeast to the Northwest on a line that would line up closely with George Bush to Hooks Airport (KDWH).  The lights did not bob, change direction, or otherwise act erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to lose intensity as they passed overhead.  There seemed to be a slight twinkle as well.  Similar to a glowing ball passing through the sky.<n>

When off in the distance towards the west between a few dark clouds I noticed a bright orange glowing fireball.  We watched the the fireball for about a minute and I noticed small little orange sparks flying off the back but there was no trail or vapor trail or anything following behind the glowing object.  Also it seemed that the fireball wasnt growing in size nor was it getting smaller.  As we continued west I pulled my phone out and tried to get a few pictures of it.  I have one but the picture is very grainy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes we went behind some trees and as we cane out on the other side the fireball had vanished.<n>

He noticed what he described as a &#34;star&#34;, but with the sun still out I told him it was probably Jupiter.  I ran into the house quickly for about a minute and then came back out.  He was still fixated on this object, so I looked up and found it difficult to locate.  When I did see it, I noticed a small, rather unremarkable point of light just lingering there so I thought nothing of it.  It was almost directly overhead, the light was constant, and the weather was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute or perhaps less, my brother said it was moving so he ran to grab his binoculars.  I found it harder to locate this time as indeed it had changed its location.  It was moving approximately ENE across the sky, but not particularly quickly, more like drifting across.  Now I knew it wasn&#39;t Jupiter so I went to grab my spyglass.  I asked him if it might be the ISS or a satellite but he said no as he was looking through his binoculars.  He couldn&#39;t make out the actual details of the object as it was difficult to focus on it with cheap binoculars, much less the fact that it was drifting across the sky.  It appeared to be slowly drifting faster until it was no longer there!  It was still overhead at the moment of last sighting and then we couldn&#39;t locate it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what this could be, and I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s an explanation.  I&#39;m sort of a skeptic when it comes to UFO sightings but am open to the idea of government/military experiments or atmospheric phenomena as explanations for most of them.  For this particular sighting, neither of those make sense to me.  If anyone has more information, I&#39;d love to know.<n>

It first appeared to be a very bright star, like a planet, flickering and low towards the horizon.  Looking ahead it was a immediate eye catch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later I could tell it was local and moving, we were heading towards each other.  The light then in my mind resembled a landing gear light on a plane.  I could tell it was flying very low.  There is a airport in it&#39;s direction about 7 miles away, way too low for that distance, about 500-700 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached Hwy 40 and when I was close to the interchange to go west it was just reaching hwy 40 from the south side, on a path heading north still just west of the interchange.  I then noticed three additional lights, red, green and blue in a triangle pattern, red leading.  The moment I realized this object was unusual was when I realized the marker lights were not blinking, no tail light, the bright white light was in the middle of the craft, not shining in just the forward direction but in every direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was on the ramp for 40 west.  The craft just crossed hwy 40. With the height seeming to be 500-700 ft or about a little higher than a cell tower, I could not make a outline of the craft.  Just the four lights.  Heading towards the side of it getting on 40 it seemed to be moving very slowly at this point and by time I was passing it&#39;s path behind it it seemed to have rapidly picked up speed and changed direction to northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now when telling the very same people I talk to everyday, including my wife, immediately there&#39;s a look like uh huh yeah right.  So with that in mind... when I was on the on ramp for hwy 40 and I was heading towards the side of the craft, I saw what appeared to be a small rectangular door opening.  It was behind the middle white light and off centered.  I took it as a door because the dim glow grew as such from a door opening.  I could not make any details out from what was inside just that the dim glow was indirect.  I don&#39;t tell anyone anymore but figured I should atleast report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was captivated at first as much as anyone is by a low flying plane but when realizing something is different about what I was seeing, I didn&#39;t want to pull over, fumble with my phone for a pic... all I wanted to do was observe and figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While driving through Portsmouth, Ohio, my eldest son had noticed 3 orbs in the sky that were orange/red in color.  I pulled over to the side of the road and all of us got out of the vehicle to get a better view.  The orbs/craft were flying side-by-side in a line formation.  They seemed to be gliding through the sky smoothly. There was no sound that I could hear coming from the crafts.  They were roughly 800-1500 feet in the air.  We watched them for about 2min, that&#39;s was when they faded in the clouds and disappeared.  This is the first time I&#39;ve seen anything remotely looking like a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been in the military going on 20yrs and I&#39;ve been around just about every type of aircraft known to the military.

I saw a bright pinpoint white flash just below the star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion.  At first I thought it was just the strobe from an airplane, but after watching for a few seconds,  I concluded it was not.  This light was flashing at irregular intervals and intensities, and would hoover in one spot before moving slightly and slowly to another spot.  I went inside to get my binoculars to get a better look, and saw much the same.  The object would flash irregularly with varying intensities and move slowly in one direction, and then change directions, sometimes moving up, down or back to its previous spot.

I have never seen anything like it before<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside having a smoke and I look to the right and I seen, then filmed 4 bright orange round objects flying in the same straight pattern coming from the top of houses and not going much higher all the way across the sky.  The objects seemed to grow larger then they all glowed even bigger and brighter then they al got a bit smaller and then stayed lit.  I&#39;m only 13 miles from a major airport and very well aware of what any airplane is flying at night with their lights blinking and on.

I then pulled out my cell phone video camera and then all of a sudden there was another one coming from the same direction and it did the same thing.  I filmed a total of four of them and they were in sight for about 30 to 40 seconds each.  I&#39;m only 13 miles from a major airport in Minneapolis, MN, and very well aware of what any airplane is flying at night with their lights blinking on and off. These were not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this was filmed on December 25, 2013 at 6:30 PM Central time.  After more research, I have now ELIMINATED the thought of one of these 4 filmed objects in the sky of possibly being a recent sighting of a red meteor shower because they move downward and these had no tails, these objects were going sideways from west to east.  I ELIMINATED the thought of one of these possibly being an orange chinese lantern because if they are carried by the wind, the winds were going SW that day and at the time recorded, and these objects were moving SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the Youtube video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Vy_4bkf84&amp;feature=share<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like credit for the filming please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Not very high above the tree line.  (I joking said, look its Santa!) It was moving from the north to the south.  I pointed it out to my husband and he also acknowledged this curious &#34;ball of fire&#34;.  As I watched it cross almost over head, it actually looked like a ball of fire with a halo affect partly around the front of it.  As it passed to my right I closely watched it and it began the dim then brighten back up every few seconds.  This lasted only about 20 seconds then it &#34;blinked&#34; out and it was gone.  This was at around 11:35 PM tonight.  It&#39;s dark out, it might have disappeared from sight because of trees but it didn&#39;t look that way to me.<n>

They were going from east to west.  They looked two to three times larger than Venus.  They did not descend-they kept moving in a line formation.  The first ones would disappear, but more of them appeared.  There was a small plane in the area and they were almost at the same height.  One of the lights moved closer to another one, but they continued toward the west.  I ran, woke up my son and told him to hurry outside.  He also saw them and neither of us knew what they were.  At first I thought maybe they’re fireworks.  I expected them to burst into flashes of color, but they didn’t.  Then I thought they could be lanterns, but my son thought they were too high and why would anyone let lanterns float loose over a residential area where things could catch fire.  Another friend thought maybe they were military flares, but they w! ere not descending-they kept on a straight path until they would disappear or flicker out.  I would like to know what they were.  I googled it to see if anyone else reported seeing them and that’s where I found your website.  Hope you can tell us what they were.<n>

The third light prompted me to go outside with my father, at approx time of 23:30 .  Clearly observed multiple (counted nine) very small (estimated beach ball sized) orange lights clearly separate.  Low flying not making any noise.  It should also be noted that the night and location of observance was extremely quiet.  Took video of two flying together.  Noted also that no wind was present at ground level and sky was super clear visibility.  Also note that I was super excited having never experienced anything like this and was very talkative during video.  Father also shot video.  Mine came out better using a Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone.  Side note, lights appeared to have small red top and were constant not flashing, estimated 40-50 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Walking to my car with my father and his wife when I noticed a bright orange-red light due south at about a 40 degree angle to the horizon.  I mentioned it to the others and my father suggested it is a planet.  I said it is not in the right place for a planet and it is too bright and deeply coloured.  It seemed to pulsate but not in a predictable pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some time it smoothly moved further away still going south and the light became dimmer until it eventually disappeared.

The sky on dec. 24, 2013. Please search SANTA spotting rapid city, sd on YouTube.  I posted the video of part of what we saw.  Other friends saw the same thing and we would love others to comment on what was in the sky?!???  First off - ((name deleted)) we love love you!!!  Please watch this video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Santa in the sky or something very strange!!  My daughter and I were coming home from my parents after we missed going to church - which is very strange for our family on Christmas.  We were driving almost a block from out house and we saw this bright light low in the sky.  It was glowing kind of like it was on fire and then started blinking red light. It went up in the sky with no sound at all.  Right after that 3 more followed and then those 3 got into a triangle formation.  They all went up into the sky as fast as a b-1, but without any noise.  We of course were freeking out!!  I had already pulled the car to the side of the road and parked and videoed the first couple.  Then they went up into the sky and disappeared!!! Just like that. We were dumbfounded.  Another guy came and watched and police cars and we all were videoing it.  Then the same thing happened again with 3 more then 3 more and then 2 more.  They all had this really bright light and then red blinking and then in less than a couple of seconds went across the entire sky and disappeared completely!!!  My friend who lives up the hill from me saw the same thing.  We are all totally freaked out and so excited!!!  My daughter, 14, Skye thinks for sure it was Santa - I don&#39;t know I say aliens??? Who knows but really this is just so cool!!! Christmas Eve in rapid city sd - so bazaar!!! I just had to show you - because our news around here does not cover any news and certainly will not cover anything that isn&#39;t explainable. Hope you check it out. Much peace and love!<n>

They were really low, lower than you&#39;d see an airplane in the sky, with a bright, distinct orange color that appeared to make a circular glow.  The fligh path was perfectly straight until they spread out, and as they flew over head they made absolutely now sound.  I captured video on my cell phone, but the quality is not that good because my hands were shaking.

It slowly faded out as it went into the distance.  At first I though it to be space junk burning up in the atmosphere , but because of the direction it was moving I don&#39;t think that is possible.  There are no launches down at the Cape so it wasn&#39;t that either.  To give aspect on the direction, if staring at the cape the object started about 75 degree to the right and ended about 20 degrees to the right.<n>

I had driven up from San Diego and had just gotten to their house.  I said a few helos and then went out into the street to smoke a cigar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 10:15 pm.  I was standing north of the corner of Scandia Street and Stanford Ave. (exact address omitted).  I was looking southwest.  There was a bright orangish red light almost hovering; but moving slowly toward me.  At an arm&#39;s length, maybe 2 to 4 fingers above the house/garage roof across and one house south of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it 30 seconds or so, two slightly bluish white teardrop spheres of light fell from the orangish red light straight down.  They seemed to be going faster than if they were just falling.  Shot down followed almost immediately by the second one.  They were not beams of light; but lighted objects or spheres of light much longer than wide.  These bluish white lights were a color I can not describe accurately; but laser-like would be the closest description.  Not only laser-like, but even more vibrant than laser-like.  This light seemed like it had depth or maybe partially transparent; but brilliant.  I have never seen anything like them.  They were not round orbs, teardrop or at least much longer than they were wide in shape.  Again, they did not seem the fall; but were propelled downward.  They were not lite all the way down, but winked out before they went below the roof top southwest of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was excited, to say the least.  The orangish red light then turned in a quick motion and was heading almost away from me, slowly.  It started to fade first, and then pulsed on and off and then was gone.  It didn&#39;t seem to dart away fast; but seemed to wink out.  This was now about 1 minute from when I first saw it.  Then 4 minutes later, the orangish red light appeared again.  This time it was slightly further away but moving quickly towards me again.  When it got to about the same place the bluish white lights had ejected from it; it even got a little brighter.  It again, arced! away, or turned 180 degrees and quickly went away, or faded out as it moved away.  I was never scared.  I keep thinking about those bluish white lights.  They are kind of engrained in my memory.  They were such a unique shape and brilliance.  In terms of distance away, I am not sure how to judge distance.  A mile or two?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, not a few blocks away.  I first filled out a form for MUFON on Christmas Day.  A couple of days later I was contacted by an Investigator who seemed to think these were Chinese Lanterns.  Well, I live about a mile from the beach in San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of months ago I almost had a Chinese Lantern land in my yard.  So, I have seen Chinese Lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting on the 24th was not a Chinese Lantern in my opinion and for a few reasons.  Number one, the orangish red light went out for about 4 minutes.  If this was a Chinese Lantern, it would have dropped quickly to the ground in that period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But instead, the orangish red light came back on at the same ! elevation after the 4 minutes.  It wasn&#39;t a second Lantern as I would have seen it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, the orangish red light did not move like it was adrift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And thirdly, the bluish white lights that dropped or were propelled from it.....well, that was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said earlier that I am not sure of the distance this sighting was from my vantage point.  I have learned since my first report that the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Storage Facility is 1.5 to 2 miles southwest of my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I would mention that.  Sure wish others had also seen this event.<n>

First I assumed that they were airliners or local aircraft, but when I saw that they were flying at the same altitude, at approximately a couple thousand feet, and in relatively close proximity to one another (maybe couple thousand feet apart) and one right behind the other, I didn&#39;t think it was airliners. when there are multiple airliners flying at one time, they are required to maintain a certain distance apart, vertically and horizontally.  These craft were flying one right behind another and all at the same height.  There were no navigation or strobe lights typical with any type of airplanes, nor was there any sound associated with the craft (they were absolutely silent) neither jet nor props.  The craft weren&#39;t moving fast, so I was able to view them with my binoculars and I didn&#39;t see any! detail in the craft except a dull orange color.  The craft, still in the same linear formation, made a relatively sharp curve to the south and rapidly faded from view.  These were neither meteors, ballons, fireworks,birds, nor satellites as the craft&#39;s movements did not correspond to any type of those objects.<n>

However, as we passed the pine trees it was obvious there was no arena and no sporting event and it was not fireworks falling from the sky.  Instead the objects were slowly moving away from us, staying in formation, moving in a north to northwest direction.  Each object seemed to have several lights on it, all seemed amber colored. Exact shape of each object not clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three of us in the car, all seeing the same thing.  We tried to stop and get a picture, but there were a of couple light poles in the parking lot we pulled into, and the white light from those poles flooded the sky and washed out the amber lights.  Meanwhile the amber objects were fading into the distance.  Maybe 2 minutes total time had elapsed from our first observation.<n>

We looked at the sky and saw a flying craft that looked like a spinning top or a cone with different colored rings spinning around it.  The rings were red and yellow.  It hovered in one spot far away in the horizon toward Arizona.  We could not believe what we were seeing. We saw it in the sky hovering and I thought maybe it was a helicopter.  No Way!  The way it was moving no craft that we know of or have seen moved like this UFO.  I got to take pictures of it with my phone.  There was a moment where it stopped hovering and went forward then again continued hovering until we reached Belen.<n>

The thing that caught my eye was these three, what looked like really bright stars, moving slowly across the sky.  What really made me take notice was the fact that they were moving in perfect order to each other.  At this time I yelled to my friend to come and check this out.  It was at this point that I realized I was looking at one object not three because the craft (I do not know what else to call it) did something that blew us away.  It stopped and rotated so the two lights at the rear were at the bottom and the front light was now on top and you could tell it was this huge ¨craft¨ because it was blocking out stars we could see when it was in a normal flying position.  We just stared not knowing what to do and as my friend said I need to get my phone and try to get a picture the rear lights started to blink in a weird pattern and then it just shot away and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was huge and made no noise at all and when it shot away it was gone in a flash but made not a sound.<n>

I was looking up in the night sky it was clear no clouds just totally clear night sky.  In the northern sky in the direction of Walla Walla, Washington, there was a big ship stationed in the sky.  It was fairly high in the sky and HUGE - it kind of looked like a cross - it had supper bright whitish lights it was really big.  Then to the right of it about 2 miles or so in the night sky was this HUGE cigar shaped ship just sitting in the sky - this one had green and red lights and the lights seemed to be kind of twinkling.  The night sky was really clean no clouds and these weren&#39;t air planes and they were huge!  I dont know why but i see many odd sightings in eastern regon night sky, I&#39;ve also seen orange and red fire ball in the night sky but that was in the mts 30 miles west of portland going towards sea side.<n>

I feel it is important to say bishop airport is almost straight southwest of where I was and that from my living room chair I see and hear planes come and go almost everyday.  This thing stayed still and then fell at a very rapid speed from the east.<n>

We instantly we shocked as they were not commercial aircraft and flew in a coordinated manner and shifted to a rectangle, and then an oval.  If I had to guess they were 500 meters in diameter.  It seemed like there was a shape or form within the lights but it was impossible to tell for sure.  They traveled south of the city and at about where Boeing Field is they ascended vertically through the low cloud layer and vanished.  During the ascent we saw a commercial airliner fly under the lights.  We observed them for about 3 minutes, and during this our neighbors, also returning from a dinner, pulled up and saw the same (their oldest child was terrified, as was mine).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this a 5th orange light appeared from the same area and followed an identical flight pattern and vanished.  Attached is video I took for about 30 seconds when my wife told me to grab my phone.  I was excited and should have spent more time taping.  During the episode the entire sky appeared to briefly flash white, which is on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes afterwards I was still watching the sky and believe I saw a fighter jet fly over the city.  A work colleague I told the story to says they heard a fighter jet fly over their Bellevue home.  My neighbor who also witnessed the event says he was traveling north from the Federal Way area and had seen a number of military helicopters flying in the area.  What we saw were not helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran back outside to see about 10 lights all following the same track as the others.  It was a cloudy evening and all were below the cloud line. By the time my awe subsided, I grabbed binoculars to see if I could make out a shape; I was too late.  There was only one in the sky and I only caught a glimpse in the binoculars before it faded away like the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe a group let off some Chinese lanterns or something like that, but the wind was coming from WNW.  So they would not have traveled in the way they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything like this... EVER, and my hairs stand up every time I think of it.

The colors were either yellow/orange or red, and they gave off a glow.  Since it was Christmas Eve I was joking it was Santa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs lingered around the same area until we moved out of sight.  We watched them for a few minutes while they were visible until the distance and city lights blocked them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved in all directions, but very slowly.  The overall direction of movement was north to northeast.  They were not in any kind of formation.  They were too small and close to each other, and moving too slowly to be local aircraft as we do have an airport near the sighting area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were Chinese lanterns, but then realized there was a slight breeze so it didn&#39;t match the orb movement.  The orbs were fairly close to the ground (few hundred feet or so above us) and stayed at about that level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not have cell phones or camera with us at the time it happened so we do not have any video or photo evidence.<n>

It was moving very slow; going from west to east.  As it moved closer overhead it then appeared reddish-orange before disappearing just above a low cloud mass to the west.  I tried taking a video with my iPhone, but it was too cold and I couldn&#39;t get it to work.  However, I did snap 2-3 photos and when enlarged appear to show what I describe as a can-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 8 yr old daughter witnessed this as well, but only after I called her out of the house.  I would guess the total time I watched it was roughly 4-6 minutes.  It made no sound that we could hear and anything that seemingly low in the sky should be able to be heard.  I can&#39;t quite make out the full detail when I crop the photos on my iPhone but can tell it is a shape that does not look anything like a plane or helicopter.  I can send pics but I need an email address.<n>

It is a clear night out tonight in our area, so, I always look up to the sky to see if I can spot anything, having seen things around here before! That&#39;s when I saw the flash of light.  It was located near due west of where I am!  And at an approximately 30 degree angle to the horizon.  It wasn&#39;t a large flash nor shape!  Maybe about the size of a BB held about a foot or two from your face.  It was maybe red to reddish orange in color, and lasted maybe only a couple of seconds at most!  There were no aircraft in the vicinity!  I&#39;m thinking that maybe it was a Quark(?) or something like that, that Scientists see from time to time in the night sky, you know, an exploding star or some such thing in the distant Galaxy/Universe!  I&#39;ve heard of them, but exactly what they&#39;re called, I don&#39;t recall!  Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t moving!  Just a flash of light and it was gone! I watched, but saw nothing more!

I was loading my kids Christmas into our car, preparing to leave my in-laws house.  After witnessing the lights, in stunned curiousity I yelled for my wife to come out, by that time she witnessed one light, as they were moving quickly through the sky.  I know they weren&#39;t planes flying in formation they were way too red and relatively close together.  Very strange event.<n>

I was closing the trunk lid when I sighted the group of 3 orange/yellow lights/orbs moving overhead from my right to my left.  The orbs displayed a bright nucleus of light surrounded by a softer glowing aura of a paler shade.  The orbs were arrayed in a loose single file pattern moving overhead from the south toward the north at an altitude one generally see&#39;s a single engine prop plane fly at.  If one held a pencil eraser at arm&#39;s length and noted it&#39;s perceived diameter the orbs would have been of a like diameter.  The light emitted by each orb was consistent and didn&#39;t flicker and was surrounded by a translucent aura as mentioned previously.  There was no noticeable sound coming from the orbs and the night sky was mostly clear with only a few diffuse clouds overhead.  The orbs were moving along at a brisk and steady pace.  When the orbs finally passed by me I could see that each had what appeared to be a pair of “afterburner” like lights/emissions trailing behind them as they moved toward the northern horizon.  The 3 orbs finally disappeared from my view.  Then I again looked  toward the southern sky and was surprised to see a group of 5 more orange/yellow orbs coming towards my position headed along a similar flight path.  4 of the orbs were grouped in a broad non-linear cluster but the 5th orb was much higher in altitude periodically obscured by some wispy clouds underneath it.  As the group of 5 orbs passed by me they too displayed what appeared to be rear mounted jet-like afterburners in their wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 5 orbs disappeared shortly into the northern sky.  This group of orbs made no sounds as they passed into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note I was fortunate to attend a lecture by Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Bluebook) in the early 70&#39;s and e! ven spoke to him briefly.  I found his presentation both fasci! nating a nd thought provoking.  I&#39;m cautiously skeptical regarding unidentified lights and this is my first time seeing an odd aerial display of this nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve witnessed a couple of Chinese lantern launches in person and these lighted orbs were unlike the lanterns I saw on those occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orbs were quite a sight to behold.<n>

I couldn&#39;t tell if they were moving and the light seemed constant, no flickering.  They were very high in the sky but not so high up that I could not see them clearly while driving.  The lights were spaced quite far apart. If they had been drawn on a flat surface each light was about 4 inches spaced apart in the sky from my perspective.  While looking at them and pointing them out to other people in my vehicle a very tiny white light began to drop from the orange light on the left side.  The light dropped like a grain of salt would straight down and I could not see what happened to it because of my view being blocked.  That&#39;s all the information I have.<n>

I was confused as to what it was; but then once I drove down the hill, I saw them traverse across the sky, over my car, and form into a triangle shape to the right of where I was. I then knew that this looked like something surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First it seemed to have a clear solid body, but then it seemed to have no body and just be a formed shape of orange lights.  Instead of going my usual way home, I took a right turn to follow the lights over the trees.  They almost seemed to go faster, as if they were trying to get away.  I pulled down Wentworth Ave in Cranston, where I could see them close again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped, and they seemed to, as well.  Then, more fireball-like orange lights came from the North towards the 3 I had originally seen. It was so crazy and surreal.  I tried to capture photos/video on my cellphone, but they only look like orange dots and by no means show the true nature of ! what I had saw in actuality.  They then began to move away to the southeast; slow at first, and then quickly vanished once I drove up the road and reached Broad St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if this was a UFO; but I sure know that this was surreal, unlike anything I had ever seen-and it did not look like it was if this earth.<n>

At first we thought it may be a comet.  We looked at it through binoculars and it seemed like a ball of fire with a possible white smoke trail following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filmed it with my older Samsung camcorder, which has an 8mm cassette tape.  I have a 2 minute and 40 second recording which I don’t know how to copy, convert or forward to anybody.  It is a shaky video, but is a very clear image showing what seemed to be a ball of fire transforming, reshaping and at times, exploding into a very large entity, then imploding, only to shape-shift again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite a distance away from us.  At times it looked round like a planet, until it exploded into multiple parts and shapes and got very large.  It was white in the center, with some noticeable green and was a pink or purple color around the edges.  It was not metallic, or dome shaped or triangle shaped.  It appeared to be organic in matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We actually watched it for about 20 minutes.  At times it went behind clouds and was not visible to us.  It was traveling from the SE to the NW at a slower rate of speed.  It was not “streaking” across the sky.  (I researched some videos of the ISS, which seems to travel NE in an upward direction.  This traveled NW, going downward).<n>

The last few years we&#39;ve been getting to the latter showings but we got to a show mid afternoon this year.  By the time our film was over it was dusk and by the time we got home it was dark.  My street is caddy-wampus, so the front faces north and east.  And if you look polar north, neighboring trees block the horizontal view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as soon we backed into our driveway, we all took notice to a strange grouping of orbs all glowing orange traveling in the night sky.  We noticed they had a vertical trajectory, and one right after another they came up in the northern hemisphere as something that raised up into plain view, and came to stop at the same point in the sky, pulsated for a moment than vanished.  We seen 3 objects one right after another within a 5-10min span of time do this.  We though that was it, than 2 came up side by side with how manyever feet of distance between them, could&#39;ve been a couple of miles could have been more. Same song same dance.

I thought nothing of it untill tonight when i came to work in the car (06.01.14) as i an my girlfriend were driving down the narrow country lane for work at 20:25pm we noticed a very dimmed light on the cloud we hadn&#39;t noticed it was there untill it turned of, we thought it could of been an on coming driver with its full beams on but no car came past, nor one was behind us, so maybe there something above the clouds? i don&#39;t know i find it bizzare.<n>

I can only guess at its height but, 5,000 feet perhaps, I see it and from indoors, I use my Cannon Powershot 2500A Camera and try to make a video but, in the LED screen, can see nothing through the dirty windows, so I go outside, but cannot see it in the screen (I was so excited to have it coming overhead and a camera this time (I think in my excitement, I had zoomed all the way in while inside and couldn&#39;t see the craft in the small area I had zoomed in on, although this video does show something in a few frames, an expert should review).    So out of frustration, I stop the video, as soon as it saved the recording, I change to still photographs...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then looking up again, I notice the craft doing something odd, nearly overhead now, it&#39;s dropping little &#34;stars&#34; every one half mile to every mile, is the only way I can describe this activity.  These little lights, drop away from the craft, and move in their own way, off away from ithe main craft, then seemed to vanish or go dark.  Some go south, some east, some west, some even rise up equal to the main craft, before falling off their own direction (thus they were not just dropping but under control).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The little &#34;stars&#34;, I do manage to catch some of these in 4 pictures..,  Although it is not much to see, just little white specks of light... but, upon zooming in on the photograph with the camera, these look like little white boomerangs, some kind of craft, or probes, or drones, is my guess..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main ship had the same two red constant lights on either side, white flashing light below but, though it was a disk with the curved front, maybe because it was so dark I couldn&#39;t make out the same curve to the rear, yet, for a moment almost directly overhead, it seemed to me, to be indented to the back?  Like it had the backside open or retracted, and this, is where, these little stars, or boomerangs, were being launched from or departing from, Not sure, like I said, it was hard to see in the dark and that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued its normal flight path to the east, dropping these little &#34;things&#34; as it went in a regular pattern, it was visible from the time I first saw it fir perhaps 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what these little boomerang things are but, if I had to guess, I would say that they are little drones of some kind because, on New Years Eve around 11:15pm.  I was opening the door to look out through my storm door because every so often I hear jets and this craft at altitude sometimes sounds like a jet until, it gets close, where it is far louder.  During hearing one if these, I opened my storm door and for a split second, I swear, I saw, a boomerang shaped lightly colored object (not lighted, it was only illuminated by our dim yard lighting) some 3-4 feet across, and perhaps 8-12 inches front to back, and 1 inch or so in thickness, about 25 feet from my apartment, right in front of the apartment building across from mine but, as soon as I got the interior door open to see out, I spotted this thing and it went zipping silently up and over the roof of the building next door and out of sight, I only saw this thing, for really, maybe,, 1.5 to 2 seconds at mo! st.  Clearly, it did not want, to be seen, I am certain of that...<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are watching me, I think.  I hope, that this, is a, good thing. because if not, I am in deep trouble.  I know, I want to meet them, and learn, everything.<n>

It was moving very slowly to to the west from my perspective then moved down then backtracked!!  I was so shocked.  A plane does not abruptly backtrack.  It didn&#39;t make any sense.  It disappeared behind a house and I could no longer see it and had to continue moving since I was stopped in the middle of the road of my neighborhood.

The largest one was red, the others were orange and seemed to be following the bigger one in a half V shape slowly heading East.  There was no sound.  Maybe they were following the creek bed to the open water.  The excitement got to me, before I could grab the camera and binoculars they had disappeared out of my sight.

They were about 45 degrees to the horizon.  They appeared stationary as I drove west and then south.  Thought they might have been an aircraft(s), but no nav lights or strobes detected.  Anyone else see them?  I’m a skeptic, but I can’t come up with any plausible explanation.<n>

It left an oddly straight and even trail for a brief moment (which was also red/orange), maybe one second in duration.  Then the tail disappeared and the speed reduced considerably.  It looked like a glowing red oval/cylinder.  Both of us recall thick black stripes inside a large portion of the object, kind of like a grill.  The object maintained its red/orange glow and cruised at a constant speed and altitude in a westerly (southwesterly) direction until it disappeared in a slow double flash (which could just have atmospheric interference perhaps) just above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, two nights earlier at 21:00, I was standing in the same place and saw a rapid double flash of white light) about the same magnitude as Venus.

I initially thought it might be a tower light on a hill, but it wasn&#39;t blinking, and as we got closer it became apparent that there were no hills; a large, radiant orb hovered high above the freeway against a clear and starry sky.  As I kept driving toward it, the light moved slowly toward the southeast and out of my field of view, though my wife could still see it from the passenger&#39;s seat.  She watched it for a minute and then told me to pull the car over (as we passed through Toledo, WA, because the object was getting closer and was definitely anomalous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next three minutes, as caught on video, we watched it from the side of I-5, facing northeast, where it silently floated around Jupiter to the left of the Orion constellation, putting on quite a show.  Our limited iPhone cameras did a poor job capturing what we actually witnessed, missing the star-filled backdrop, the nearby farm house, trees, and horizon, and not really capturing how pretty and bright it was, which was significantly brighter than Jupiter and maintained a steady luminosity throughout the duration of the sighting, apart from its slow color changes (mostly blue, violet, and green, with a bit of red and yellow appearing briefly as it shifted colors).  It also seemed to emit two very faint searchlights pointing downward a couple of times, though I couldn&#39;t be certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, it floated down toward the earth and drifted slowly toward the southeast behind some trees, perhaps disappearing into the nearby river valley, or perhaps simply disa! ppearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some still photos, included at the end of the video, though they all look different, suggesting either the limitations of the iPhone 4S camera (such as one photo that looks like blurred movement) or that the object was changing shape as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my third UFO sighting since 1995, and my first nighttime sighting. I don&#39;t know if it was manmade or not, though I suspect most UFOs are.  All I know is that it seemed big given the apparent height and distance (judging by the tree line that it floated behind), was brighter than most aircraft lights appear at such heights (and certainly more colorful), and made no sound as it slowly and surreally looped about, dancing in the sky.<n>

My son said that it was not a plane or a planet as it was too bright and had no blinking lights.

It appeared to stay at the same altitude, perhaps a few thousand to 10 thousand feet up.  It moved across the sky at a speed equivalent to a fast propeller driven plane, but appeared to be emitting orange or red fire, or was on fire.  It did not appear to be a meteorite.<n>

12/23/13 20:00|Layton to Farmington|UT|Unknown|1 minute|Blue highspeed object over Northern Wasatch Front, Utah.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105529.html|339|ndxe201312| Blue highspeed object over Northern Wasatch Front, Utah<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving North from Salt Lake City to Ogden, Utah, my brother (driving), my wife and my nephew (rear passengers) and myself (front passenger) witnessed a craft of unknown shape over the Layton/Clearfield, UT, area climb from an approximate elevation of 500 feet (AGL) to an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet (AGL) in about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that caught our attention most was a dull blue light emitting from the craft suddenly intensify to a very bright blue light as it climbed as accelerated Southward on a heading completely opposite of our heading as we travelled North.  The craft travelled a distance of what I can best guesstimate as 20 miles in about 30 seconds, then slow to nearly an approach-speed which airliners hold as they enter a final approach into a major airport. As this craft came into our 9 O&#39;Clock position we looked closely for any strobe lights and marker lights which are required under FAA regulations, and to our suspicions their were none, the only light we noticed different from the blue light, which was visible from all the angles we were able to observe, was a faint white light at the aft end of the craft which was an uninterrupted light (not a strobe like we see on conventional aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed us we noticed a change in heading, it made a turn to West by South West, but there was no swoop to this heading change, it appeared as if there was some form of thrust vectoring involved, because the turn of nearly 75 degrees was almost instantaneous.  The object was visible for another 15 seconds and appeared to accelerating as it began to cross the Great Salt Lake, but we lost sight of it due to a complex series of overpasses at the Legacy Parkway ~ S.R. 89 ~ I-15 Junction of Farmington, UT.  When we were finally clear of the interchanges we all tried to regain our view of the object but it was gone.  The estimated distances we witnessed this craft cover are, to my best abilities at finding a number, exceed 50 miles, and this observation lasted approximately a single minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though it was very cold outside the car I had the foresight to attempt to get an auditory account as well (mostly because I was very interested in finding out whether it was a jet propulsion system or something else) so we rolled the windows down to listen for anything we could possibly hear.  We live near Hill AFB, Salt Lake International Airport, and Ogden-Hinckley Municipal Airport, and as a result we are very used to hearing and seeing a vast number of different aircraft. This craft had no sound which we could hear, given we were traveling at 50 to 55 m.p.h. and there was some wind noise, but we know that if the craft had a jet turbine system such as an F-16 Falcon or an F-22 Raptor we would have heard the engine(s) and definitely seen the afterburner(s) because this craft was well over mach at it&#39;s fastest observed velocity.  Also, there no sonic boom, there was no disruption to the atmosphere - at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The origination of our sighting placed the object at the same latitude as Hill AFB, however, it was roughly 5 miles West of the base.  Also of note is that Salt Lake International was using runways 34 L and R and also 35, which would place all approach aircraft in this same line of travel, but this object was not in the pattern, (the elevations were far too low at the beginning, and far too high at the end of the sighting.)  There was no possibility of having been in the Salt Lake approach pattern due to its turn to traverse the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also must emphasize heavily that the object had some seriously advanced vectoring technology to its propulsion, from the initial 2,500 foot climb and then the turn it made to the West toward the lake, both maneuvers were made with surgical precisions and were as fast as a Color Guard Marine snapping a salute to the Ensign.<n>

Silent and pulsating.  Color of an ember that floated in a straight line at constant velocity.  Comparable to brightness of an airplane light yet it&#39;s pulse was strong enough to increase brightness dramatically.  Light flashed a few times before it stopped flashing (only the small orange light left), continued on its path and then disappeared.  Altitude and distance is hard to estimate as nothing else was visible as being part of the light.  Planes fly low over location all the time and if the light was at the same distance and altitude of a plane the brightness of the large pulse would be the diameter of a plane.  I would of said it was just an ember that flew out of someone&#39;s chimney but consistency of velocity and brightness and repetition of pulses make me hope someone else besides my party saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had the joy to say I have seen a UFO, but a member of my party claims he has and even he said what we saw was &#34;weird! &#34;<n>

There was a faint mist in the upper atmosphere that put a halo around each star.  High in the northwestern sky I noticed another bright orange “star” that just didn’t fit in.  After observing it for several seconds, it drifted slowly toward the southeast.  It kept a gradual pace for about ten seconds, then quickly accelerated, suddenly flickering white and then back to blaze orange again.  Its light was brilliant, many times brighter than Sirius or Jupiter, despite the upper-level mist.  After roughly one minute, it had cruised across the sky and was over the southeastern horizon.<n>

After that time I suddenly noticed a white light hovering closely to the helicopter that was not present minutes before.  The helicopter immediately followed the solid light about five miles into the distance.  The white light was not visible after the helicopter traveled 3 or so miles alongside away from my ground position.  Then the helicopter returned and left. The white light was easily distinguishable from the helicopter and hovered closely.  This caught my eye being there were no running or hazard lights on the vehicle the helicopter was running aside and appeared to be persuing.  It largely appeared the helicopter was present for another reason and happened to come across this vehicle.  It appeared to either be a police or traffic monitoring helicopter and then changed its course once the light appeared.<n>

The object I observed was at high altitude and went in, behind and or out of clouds.  The course of the object appeared random with small, distinct, directional changes, during which there was a slight increase in speed.  This movement to me seemed out of proportion with what would be possible for a helicopter.  The altitude also was more consistent with an airplane or even a satellite.  At first I thought it was a satellite because the vividness of it and its speed was similar; however I have never seen the type of directional changes I observed from a satellite, plane or helicopter.  It was very cold outside so I went back inside after about 5 minutes.<n>

It was cold so I checked it out for about a minute.  They were in the south, which I thought strange.  They were very pretty as it was perfectly straight lines of every color shooting straight down, across the entire south eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, I convinced my daughter to come see but she barely peeked because of the cold.  I noticed then that the lights were exactly the same.  Shouldn&#39;t northern lights have moved by now?  I watched for a bit, then noticed that almost to the north, after a big dark space, there was a much larger beam of blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a half hour or so of periodically checking, I decided to take pictures.  The intensity and color isn&#39;t there, but you can most definitely see some of the beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband that the lights were still there and hadn&#39;t changed so he checked them out again.  We decided then that it was certainly not northern lights.  We came in and when he checked a while later, they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later, I told an acquaintance about them and she excitedly told me that she had a friend by Edmonton (300km north) posting about this on Facebook.  She also said that two friends of hers by Lethbridge (200km south) were also posting about these lights.  They were also certain it was not northern lights.  So what was it?  I am speculating something either very large (cloaked behind the mysterious clouds on an otherwise clear night), or it was many, many something&#39;s.  To be seen so clearly over 500km, it had to be from space.  Also, I could see that the beams did not touch ground; they came from above.  I wonder if I could post my pictures?<n>

I opened the door and walked out with him to make sure there was on one in the greenway behind our house that he might bark at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a large red light just peeking over the rooftops of the houses southwest of my location.  We have a lot of air traffic so this is not uncommon, however that low altitude is.  I quickly scanned from left to right the greenway and when I looked back the object had moved at least half the distance from where I first saw it and my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It now had my full attention.  After almost coming to a complete stop, it suddenly shoots from left to right (east to west) covering a distance of 1,500-2,000 feet (this is hard to report as I could not tell how far away it was) in less than 3 seconds and gained altitude. This distance could have been further.  We see tons of aircraft come from that direction and everyone of them we see from that distance takes at least 3-5 minutes before they reach the house.  Once it reached this new location just south of us, it came almost to a stop and slowly cruised east to west until it flew out of sight. There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, upon seeing its profile and at a much slower speed, revealed to my wife and I a bell shaped object in which the mouth of the bell was stretched out making it look like a huge plate with the bell sitting in the middle of it.  Its shape was not that detailed though as it emitted a bright red glow making those edges described very rounded (think somewhat oval but with a very pronounced center rising up).  The color remained red, but the center, and tallest part, started glowing white, then red, and then orange.  The object just slowly crept away heading west.  This last leg was the bulk of time we viewed it.<n>

(Monitoring the weapons cache at the old Naval Air Station?)  I estimate it was 1/2 mile above the ground and maybe 2 miles away.  It had 3 sides, with red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night was crystal clear, yet this object appeared blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made sharp and quick turns.  My intuition leads me to believe &#34;they&#34; were looking for someone or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch, covered in goose bumps, for approximately 2 minutes. Both of my dogs were frightened.  The smaller dog wanted me to pick her up.  My other dog wanted nothing more than to just go home.  They have never shown fear to a vehicle, especially a vehicle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s ascent left me feeling it is not ours.  As it took off skyward, it  did so keeping the &#34;hull&#34; square to the ground, travelling virtually in a direct vertical line.  Its color also changed to an orange color.  This craft was completely silent.<n>

I had gone out to my washroom to retrieve a forgotten laundry load.  Exiting the house to enter the laundry room, I glanced to the east ward sky and noticed a warm bright star close to the moon.  I stopped to get bearings noticed it was in the constellation of Leo and the stars didn’t fit.  Then I noticed 4 others brighten and gently bob in the sky.  I thought at first that maybe this was an Iridium flare.  So I ran back into the house and grabbed both cell phones and began videoing the spectacle.  As I came out into the back yard the objects were moving slowly to the west towards the moon.  I then noticed 5 new lights rising from the east through the Coma Bernice’s.  For a total of 9 lights.  They continued rising gently from the east in a westerly direction toward the moon.  The first group of 4 winked out individually and at different times.  The second group continued to rise, not in orbital arcs, but in a gentle bobbling.  Unlike satellites, commercial planes or light aircraft. At about ten minutes after the first sighting,  The second group winked out to the north east of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checking the Heaven’s Above website, there were no satellites in the area at that time.  I have realized that it is the winter solstice.  And these could be Chinese sky lanterns released in a celebration of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself an amateur astronomer.  I have seen many things in the sky.  These I haven’t seen this before.<n>

But unfortunately they didn&#39;t answer.  After the 6 light disappeared one more Orange light arrived to the same spot, so I change my line so I do not turn left on State Street and then I drove towards the Provo Lake looking the light and tried to hear any sound, I stop on the side of the road but the light vanished the same way that the other did.

12/21/13 20:50|Sparks|NV|Circle|2-3 seconds|On a crystal clear winter night, I watched a bright blue ball descend at about a 35-degree angle west of our house.|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105492.html|369|ndxe201312| On a crystal clear winter night, I watched a bright blue ball descend at about a 35-degree angle west of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, between 8:45 and 9:00 p.m., my husband and I went out to our hot tub in our back yard.  We live in Spanish Springs, in Sparks, NV.  It was crystal clear out, and we were star-gazing, as is our habit while hot-tubbing, when I happened to look toward the west-southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright blue, lit ball was descending in the western sky.  The blue was a &#34;true&#34; blue.  From the horizon line, it caught my eye when it was at about 30 to 45 degrees up, and heading down from right to left at that angle range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say it was big, from where I stood--because the sight of it brought me up from a sitting position to my feet--it&#39;s challenging to describe, because of its distance.  But I&#39;ll do so in terms relative to the house behind which I lost sight of it.  The neighbor&#39;s house is about 700 to 1,000 feet away, separated by open horse property between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright, blue ball was roughly the size and shape of a &#34;doubled&#34; basketball.  In other words, it like an extra-large basketball compared to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slower than a shooting star, remaining bright blue for the two to three seconds that I watched it until the house blocked its view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if there were any sounds accompanying its descent, because the hot tub jets were fully on and noisy, but there was no impact noise or boom or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a third to a half the size of a full moon.  The night was nice and dark, making for good contrasts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> --((witness name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. I know last night you said you thought the helicopter we saw a few minutes afterward was unrelated to the bright blue ball, but I tend to think it was looking for it.  I have no way to prove this, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
12/21/13 20:15|Kernersville|NC|Light|60 seconds|Two very silent and steady red lights at relatively low altitude with individual paths pass directly overhead in the night sky.|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105509.html|370|ndxe201312| Two very silent and steady red lights at relatively low altitude with individual paths pass directly overhead in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a parking lot at 36.074638, -80.057982.  The objects were steady red lights, similar in appearance to lights on a distant radio tower.  In the course of about 60 seconds they moved at relatively constant speed from about 45 degrees on the horizon almost due South (when I first observed them) to about 30 degrees on the horizon almost due North, passing directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed them to the south, they had some initial horizontal movement that brought them very close together a couple of times, and then they separated by about a degree or two, and remained roughly parallel for about 40 seconds as they passed overhead and towards the North, and one was a couple of degrees in front of the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was strange to see only single red lights from individual aircraft.  But I also thought that they were likely helicopters when I first observed the horizontal movements they initially made.  I fully expected that as they grew close! r, I would hear some form of engine or rotor noise.  But as they passed overhead, there was nothing but silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they had been aircraft, I would have estimated their altitude to have been a couple thousand feet.  When they got to the 30 degree angle in the north sky, one red light veered off to the right at about a 45 degree angle and I lost sight of it, and about 5 seconds later, the second light disappeared, obscured by low level clouds and city lights from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a licensed professional civil engineer, and I happened to be in my church parking lot at the time of the observation.  I tried to take a phone video of the second half of the observation, but I only got a completely white image.<n>

It moved relatively slowly considering, and was in my field of view for more than 30 seconds. What makes me certain it was either a UFO or experimental craft of some sort was that it was absolutely silent. There was zero noise detectable from the ground where I was standing. It just silently and smoothly cruised across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 20/20 vision, am 29 years old, and am gainfully employed in the IT field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first UFO I have EVER seen.

We didn&#39;t know what was causing the sudden congestion, until we noticed many drivers were slowing down to look at something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanting to see what they were seeing, I looked up too and that&#39;s when we saw them.  Only, by this time, there was only 2 orange lights left.  They seemed unusually low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we scrambled to record a glimpse, the two orange lights ascended into the sky until they went out of sight.<n>

It moved slowly.  A lot slower than any meteor/shooting star I&#39;ve ever seen.   It moved laterally heading north and didn&#39;t appear to be falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell the distance from myself to the fireball.  The only thing that I have to judge the hieght of the fireball from my vantage point, is the tree line directly across the street from my driveway.  Those trees are about 30-35 feet high and the fireball was about 30-35 feet above them, but over the field behind them.  The field is to the left of the tree line.  I will attatch a picture of my vantage point in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was definitely some sort of smoke or heat trail behind it.  I couldn&#39;t really tell what it was but it looked like a thick plume.  The fireball lasted about 2 seconds and then it appeared to split in to two pieces.  It looked like one behind the other.  They both seemed to have kept the same altitude and color.  Once it went out, I could not see any visible trail or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;intact&#34; fireball was about 4-5 times the size of an average star.  After it &#34;split&#34; the front piece seemed to be the same size as it was before it split.  The one in front was the biggest, the one behind was half the size.  Then, it just went out.  The whole thing lasted about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over at my mom and asked if she had seen it.  She said no.<n>

All the sudden a bright white flash occurred.  The flash seemed from our perspective, to move from our right, to our left, at a extremely high rate of speed.  The line of sight from where we were looking from, to the general area of the flash in the sky, seems to be somewhere between 25&#39; to 35&#39; degrees up, illuminating through the trees that stood between the flash and where we were sitting at the time.  Trees vary between coniferous and deciduous, with intermittent uninterrupted lines of sight periodically.  We both agreed that the flash originated beyond the aforementioned trees at an unknown distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suspected most likely, it was a meteor flash.  But, it did seem slightly odd even for a meteor flash, so I feel this should at least be archived.  We both agree that we saw the exact same event, in exactly the same details upon comparison, to the best of my knowledge.  We monitored the local news for anything related to what we witnessed, which amounted to nothing by the next following morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More likely, may have been a meteor flash.  But, feel unexplainably compelled to document this event, as this report may prove to be a useful reference for some type of research in the future.<n>

I looked out my window facing North East towards Haleakala when this ball of white-blue light came down from the mountain and towards me at a very fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a helicopter, but then when it got closer (I couldn&#39;t tell the exact distance because it was hard to judge scale...I would guess a few hundred yards) it became clearer, and was not a helicopter at all, no noise at all and no helicopter features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my son up and we stepped out on to the lanai.  My son grabbed his phone to take a photo and when he did the orb stopped dead in its tracks and hovered; bobbing up and down.  It had a central white/blue light that emanated outwards, red singular lights forming a circle around that, and  a lighter greenish glowing halo of sorts around that, as if it was in a bubble reflecting a green glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son turned his phone off and a large shooting star went across the sky infront of it, leaving a line in a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the orb started to descend wobbling back and forth as if it was making a landing with turbulance as a helicopter would.

We were quite a distance away and it was very bright and the blue light looked like it was very large.  It wasn&#39;t lightning and was similar to a transformer blowing but larger and brighter and it was up in the mountains.  My husband, my 16 year old daughter, &amp; I all saw it.  My husband has a degree in computer networking and I have gone to school for medical assisting.  My daughter is in high school and is a pretty level heading young lady.<n>

I haven&#39;t stopped scrutinizing every brightly lit star in the night sky that wasn&#39;t sharply light or was too large and seemed to be within the atmosphere.  Most of my observations of the stars that seemingly appear large also carry with them atmospheric haze as though they appear to be within the earths&#39; atmosphere leaving me to believe they are not stars.  The one star that I found questionable always appears in the same spot in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off work at 2pm December 19th (Thursday) and went Christmas shopping with my wife.  It had been hazy weather through the week but on thursday I noticed we had clear weather.  We had been out shopping for around 6 hours before we decided to head home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:20 to 8:30 we pulled into driveway of the apartment complex facing west.  I would guess that somewhere between south and southwest is where I originally spotted one of my stars of interest.  That star decided it wanted to put on a show when we came down the driveway that night.  I noticed it was lower, closer (brighter), and was brilliantly lit with changing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon I saw it I told my wife to slow down before we park so I could point it out to her.  As soon as we both observed the star(ufo) it began to slowly move to the left (Southwest).  I asked my wife to circle the driveway so I could see what it was going to do.  As soon as it stopped moving we began to inch forward and we stopped to noticed that it began moving again slowly to the left towards the tree line behind the apartments.  Again it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We inched forward again slowly only to stop again to notice it moving slowly again almost as if in response to us noticing them.  It continued to move in the same direction right behind the trees and that was all we witnessed.  I&#39;m expecting their return.  No contact yet.<n>

Watched the red ufo,s for about 20 or 30 mins moving to the west to the Gulf of Mexico.  Three other people watched with me, we all asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;.  They were moving in the clouds against the wind and we were only able to see the red lights when they were out of the clouds banks.  Again there was no sound and no other lights as a plane would have. It was odd that they were moving so slow in rows of two, one higher than the other as the UFOs pasted by heading to the Gulf of Mexico.<n>

They were small, pinpoint flashes and lasted for about 10–12 minutes before just stopping.  My daughter described it as almost looking like fireflies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later we observed a red, reddish orange light about the size of the first 3 bright lights that faded out.  There were 3 of these and they were at different points in the sky, and appeared to be closer to water level.  My son and daughter had witnessed something similar in July but the red, reddish orange lights actually seemed to rise from the water and shoot into the sky.

Sometimes dimmed, did not flash.  Main craft was behind/trailing the light.  From that I would think some kind of plane with light far put front.  However three was another craft,or something large.  Approximately 4 or 5 times as large as main rectangular craft.  The larger object was ovoid/bean shaped and grey with a darker band through middle.  This object appeared tomove quickly from side to side and above/ below/behind the man craft.  It seemed to pause before moving to other side.

At approximately 4:00 p.m., I went out to sit in my car to take a lunch break but stopped before I got to my vehicle to chat briefly with a co-worker.  I happened to be looking north toward the Muldoon base gate and saw two huge balls in the sky hurdling to the ground.  They were bright red, yellow, and pink (the sun was setting, so that could explain the color) and were traveling/falling at the same speed right next to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it seemed they were approximately 100 to 200 feet apart, but I have no way of gauging the distance from one another, nor how high in the sky they were, only that they were falling fast, as though they were crashing to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They could have been meteors.

I&#39;m an Air Force brat and have lived on air force bases my entire life (and still do) and have seen every imaginable jet in the sky from A-10 Warthogs to F-22s, and this was like nothing I have ever seen.  I watched the sky for quite some time afterwards and saw no aircraft flying.  These balls of light were vivid red and very distinctively circular in shape.  It was around 4:00 Alaska time, which means the sun was starting to set, but it was by no means dark out.  There was a short trail of light following the objects that like I said were yellow, pink, and red, but the objects themselves were red.   The fact that I watched them in the sky for five minutes tells me they must have been way up there.  As I watched them, I assumed they were meteors, it&#39;s just that I have seen meteor showers in the past and they always had long &#34;tails&#34; and were much more brief, and weren&#39;t nearly as colorful.  Also, they came down almost completely vertically, slow enough that at times it seemed like they were suspended in the air.

12/19/13 12:00|Catonsville|MD|Triangle|~1 minute|Silent black composit aircraft with red-tinted dome near front.|12/12/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115884.html|409|ndxe201312| Silent black composit aircraft with red-tinted dome near front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heavily cloudy day with low hanging clouds, and they were moving in the direction as all witnessed aircraft.  The size of the craft was well seen, it was bright out, and was no more than one and a half &#34;medium to large&#34; oak trees tall.  Thus, the craft was off the ground no more than five stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft itself was silent, and had a few lights.  While I forget the colors (I want to say blue and red) and their exact placement.  The aircraft was absolutely silent and had a black exterior which was probably its material and not paint.  The aircraft had no markings of any country.  The only company that has the ability to use the airspace within this area is Northrop.  They do not mark test aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At its front end this craft had large, red hued dome protruding from its bottom, similar to a UAV camera dome.  This may have housed a IR camera that was testing therm-imaging designed for use through cloud cover (see DARPA current special projects&#39; webpage).   There may have been antenna housed therein, as other aircraft designs has such domes as containing communication/monitoring antenna.  It did not appear to have any heat trails, but the fast moving clouds around it that day made it hard to observe and distinguish (if any).  There were around four to eight rectangles in the back of the craft, and was probably of a rotatory motor design.  While there was certainly enough room for a person to potentially be inside, from my vantage point it did not seem like there was even standing room in the mid-area of the plane.  I did not get to view the top of the craft, nor did it had have anything like tail-end rudders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was shockingly low to the ground and had zero to nearly zero sound.  If it was not for a cloud break, myself looking up, it would have remained unnoticed.  The craft&#39;s wingspan was around the size of four to five standard street lanes.  It was moving rather quickly compared to ground cars that preceded it, maybe around 40-60 miles per hour?  There were no cars on the ground, and it was traversing the streets above homes, rather than flying along main streets.  The direction was headed toward Baltimore Washington Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Sometimes the BOOM only happened once or twice.  Other times, it would sound a number of times, in rapid succession.  This went on almost night for over a month.  It then became several times a week, and continues to this day.  I heard it this morning, at about 4:30AM, and listened to it for an hour.  There was no BOOM today...just the deep-pitched droning sound.  My husband has even heard it a couple of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the DIRECTION of the sound, it seems to be from above, kind of in an &#34;umbrella&#34; sort of way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the last month or so, I have contacted Patrick Air Force Base...NASA...a tech person who works for a local gas company...the 2 local airports...NONE of these folks had an explanation for the sound.

12/18/13 21:45|Ames|IA|Changing|3 minutes|3 lighted, circular objects flying over city on a clear night, 1 appears to expand and descends to outskirts of town.|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105439.html|416|ndxe201312| 3 lighted, circular objects flying over city on a clear night, 1 appears to expand and descends to outskirts of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my bike home from work on a very clear night. Being the first night in quite a while without any wind blowing, I took my time riding home and was enjoying the nearly full moon and the surrounding stars, although there were many city lights and most stars were not visible.  So it caught me off guard when I saw what appeared to be three very bright, orange stars at a very close distance.  When I first saw them, they appeared to be in a straight line, quite similar to Orion&#39;s Belt.  I remember thinking &#34;hmm that&#39;s weird, Orion&#39;s Belt is over there...&#34;.  I slowed my bike to a stop for a better look and quickly realized that they were not stars at all, but something flying within Earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once off my bike, it was clear that they were moving.  Within 20 seconds, the center one had moved away from the others so that they were flying in what seemed to be an isosceles-triangle formation.  Each of the UFOs were circular in shape.  They had alternating red and yellow lights around the outside of the bottom, and the tops looked white or metallic and extended maybe 5-10 feet beyond the bottom part with the lights.  They did not appear to be spinning, but gliding effortlessly North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were flying at a pretty slow pace so I decided to get my phone out to try to get some video of the event.  Unfortunately, my phone didn&#39;t have enough battery life to capture anything.  While I was getting my phone out, one of the crafts started to drift away from the others, heading East.  I watched it for a few seconds before looking back for the others. They sat still.  I returned my gaze on the UFO heading East.  The top part started to expand, almost like a hot air balloon, and then the whole craft started to descend, heading East the whole time. I looked back for the othes to see if they had done the same. I could only find one, which was heading South and its lights appeared to be getting dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back at the remaining UFO quickly,  I watched as it got lower and lower, and it actually seemed to pick up speed as it fell.  I didn&#39;t blink.  This thing just kept falling.  I&#39;d say it only took about 30 seconds once it was &#34;inflated&#34;, but it felt like minutes.  I watched until it fell over the horizon, behind some buildings way across town.  I was in the center of Ames, and I&#39;d guess it fell East of the city, maybe 20 miles from where I was.  That is, IF it actually fell and landed somewhere.  If it were a plane, helicopter, or any other man-made flying vehicle, it defintely would been a crash landing, but I don&#39;t think it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was out of my view I searched the sky for any sign of the other two, but there was nothing.  I hopped back on my bike and headed home again, keeping my head up, enjoying the moon again.<n>

Given the speed, at any altitude we should have been able to hear noise from either turbine or normally aspirated engines. NO SOUND!  Because the moon was full and so bright,  We would have been able to see a shape had the lights been one object. It is obvious that the lights were separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot, (single engine, fixed wing) I know what airplanes and helicopters look like in the sky.

There was no smoke coming from these lights so there for it didn&#39;t leave any trail..  Neither of us have been drinking or on any drugs!!!!

Its altitude was approximately 1,000ft high and due west.  I pulled over to the gas station mounted my phone in a still mount and began capturing video in HD.  During which time I noticed other smaller objects coming up and joining or twirling around said fireball.  To the naked eye you could see only a asprin sized amber colored ball and tiny spots of light coming from the ground to the object.  After reviewing frame by frame I noticed a common feature I have seen in other videos other residents and I have captured.  The Object is actually a circle of  smoke or a shock wave when zoomed in on with a Galaxy Note 3 HD video camera.  I have seen black shadow figures on the beach twice and orbs coming out of the gulf nightly since October 27th.  I mention this only because while reviewing frame by frame I c! aptured several black entities that have an electric bolt connection from the object in the air to a building below and to the south.  These black entities are on what appears to be a porch structure of the building and appear to be ascending and descending from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the hotline and spoke with a gentleman who told me that there was no way I have seen 50 UFOs since October 27th! Local residents and I find that very disheartening since we have seen them every night since October 27th.  We have called the Pinellas County sheriff&#39;s Department twice Only to have the sheriff&#39;s take pictures with a full spectrum camera and then leave without reassuring residence we are safe or giving any type of comment whatsoever.  This is not a joke I don&#39;t appreciate the way my phone call to nuforc was handled. Here is your report and a couple of media clips of said event. I hope you take it seriously reconsider your stance so we can move forward for a resolution to put a large number of our towns minds at ease!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five years ago my wife and I witnessed 2 orbs come from the intercoastal waterway and launch at a 45 degree angle into space, I have been an avid Skywatcher ever since.  I am 13 hours short from receiving my single engine private pilots license and live near 5 airports and an air force base.  I am very familiar with local private/commercial aircraft routes, leapfrog routes &amp; landing routes.

They looked to be over the tree line because as we drove they would disapear below the tree line then they would come back again but they wear not moving.  They did not move in any way.  Along this route there are houses, poles and lots of trees.  It was also a very clear sky that night.  This is not the first time we have seen them.<n>

12/17/13 17:45|Seminole|FL|Light|left prior to end of even|6 bright objects with "trails" hovering over Gulf of Mexico.|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105412.html|439|ndxe201312| 6 bright objects with &#34;trails&#34; hovering over Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 17th at approximately 5:45 PM, I was in my vehicle heading due west on Park Blvd approximately 1/4 of a mile east of the Park Blvd/Seminole Blvd intersection.  Straight ahead in my field of vision, in the distance of what I instinctively perceived to be towards the end of Park Blvd (where it runs into the beach or the Gulf of Mexico) I saw in the sky six to eight &#34;glowing&#34; objects.  I am positive there were six, I thought there could have been another two lower in the sky and in the far right of my field of vision.  The objects appeared to be small balls of light with what appeared to me to be connected to short vapor trails.  If there had been only a single object I would have associated this with a typical small aircraft, but because of the number of objects and their proximity to each other I could not imagine that these objects were aircraft.  Because of the direction of the &#34;vapor trails&#34; it was quite obvious that the objects were moving in either a straight downward direction (perpendicular to the horizon) or downward at a diagonal direction towards the horizon.  While there was no quick movement it did appear that the lenght of the &#34;vapor trails&#34; was slowly growing.  These objects appeared to be white, or a &#34;white light&#34;.   Against the setting orange colored sky these objects appeared very bright, or would be very bright at a closer range.  The sky was very clear as a cold front had wiped away most, if not all of the cloud cover.  The objects appeared larger than stars and a little smaller than the size of Venus in the evening southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the end, the best comparison I can make is that these objects very closely resembled those in science fiction movies when meteorites have entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere and are hurling towards the planets.  My gut reaction when I saw the objects was exactly that of &#34;Oh no there are meteorites heading towards us&#34;.  Then I realized that was a little improbable as someone somewhere would have detected an event of that nature in advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to investigate further and had to turn away from the objects and head towards home.  They were still glowing when I left.  I am forwarding a short video separately from this report.  One final note, as I turned down my street I noticed that a Coast Guard helicopter which usually flies swiftly in a southerly direction down the coast was taking additional time covering the area, possibly circling.<n>

It was very odd to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 10 minutes before it simply vanished.  It was not a reflection, as it was obscured twice by clouds<n>

Maximum digital magnification of 80x. 12/17/2013 at 15:09:33.  It appears to be two objects colliding (naked eye saw more like 4 solids) the strange part is that a plane or meteor should have had longer tails also I was at stop light for about 2 minutes and this object did not change in anyway nor appear to move.  Line of sight says was well over the Gulf of Mexico.<n>

I thought it was sideview of a plane but it went up like a helicopter, but there were rutters.  It then preceded to continue going in the direction it start, left.  It went out of sight and I would&#39;ve had to leave the job to see it and I wasnt able to.<n>

We turned into the road, and I saw a motionless, jet-black circle (It didn&#39;t look spherical, it was a plain, black circle) in the sky just above the hills that surround my school.  It looked at first like a balloon, and did not pay much attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we were approaching the drive through, I thought again, and looked back at it.  I asked my brother if he saw it, but he was not paying much attention because it was early.  Neither did my father, because he was driving.  I then naturally thought to myself, &#34;Hey, could that be a UFO?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled up to the driveway, and I left the car, heading in between the buildings of my school that blocked the hills; I wanted to go and take a better look at it.  My brother went to his locker. Looking between the buildings, I could still see it sitting motionless above the hill.  It may have been a trick of the eye, but I think I saw it! make small motions, moving a little up, then down left and right.  It still stayed in the general area, and it moved in these directions very slowly.  I called my friend that had just arrived to school over to take a look. I told him that there was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He walked over not really believing me, until he got between the buildings.  His reaction: &#34;Oh, yea... What is that?&#34;  He seemed pleasantly surprised.  I then pulled my other friend who had just arrived then to see it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began talking about it, wondering what it was, and debating on whether it was a balloon or something else.  I brought up the point that balloons are not complete spheres (plus it was a circle, not a sphere, it seriously looked two dimensional)  And if it was a balloon, then how did it not reflect ANY light whatsoever?  It was the blackest black I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were talking, we noticed that it slowly started to descend behind the hill.  As it disappeared, I turned my head to my friend in excitement, but then he pointed and said, &#34;Whoa! !&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me that after I had turned my head, he saw a streak of black shoot up into the sky.<n>

It slowly floated by and shift directions but not with the wind.  It did not look like a meteor. It sort of looked like a big flame but it wasn&#39;t falling, it was floating.  We had no idea what it could be.  It slowly went by and kept going for about 5 minutes until out of sight.  We have no idea what this could have been.<n>

Moved in very fast, stopped, then moved up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking my dog in the evening, sometime between 9:00 and 9:05 PM, I saw a single, extremely bright, round, orange colored light in the southern sky moving in a north to north-eastern direction.  It had no tail, no sound, and its edges seemed to shimmer. I first saw it as a small orange dot.  As I watched, it grew larger and appeared to be coming closer.  I could not tell exactly what it was over, maybe Puget Sound, maybe the Olympic Peninsula.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it was the largest and brightest thing in the sky, outside of the moon.  I stared at it for about 20 or 30 seconds as it moved.  Then it suddenly stopped and stayed in one place.  I watched it for a few seconds, then ran for my house, to get my husband to witness it.  He did.  It had begun moving again, and we saw it move up and away, in a straight line at about a 45 degree agle to its previous path.  Though this time it was moving much faster.  In only about 5 seconds, it had moved up, very high into the sky, till it was a tiny dot, then dissapeared.  It all happened quite fast; the entire incident was only about a minute and a half long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is retired medical professional and my husband is a retired engineer and physicist.<n>

We were out back enjoying a fire when I looked up and saw what at first looked like a flock of birds.  About 25-50 white objects were flying in formation over our heads.  They were silent and we did not see any wings moving.  It was a full moon and clear sky so its possible that the moon light was reflecting off the “birds” but I’ve never seen anything like this before, none of us had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved at a slow steady pace and changed formation, it looked like a “V” formation that got wider as they floated by.  Another way to describe it was it looked like fish swimming in water, the objects did not move like normal birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later another wave of objects flew by in the same fashion.  I suppose these objects could be what people refer to as “Orbs”.<n>

We both saw it,  it was a huge disk with lights rotating around it moved silently first extremely slow and then within a matter if seconds it had darted back into the sky.  Once it was in the sky it flew in sparatically.  At first when it was close to us, my video camera wouldn&#39;t record, then once it was in the sky it started recording.  Strange.<n>

As i continued to watch, it became brighter, then it faded away almost as if you were watching from a distance someone turning off a light.  It also could not have been a shooting star as it did not streak across the sky, and lasted far longer.<n>

It seemed to be in the form of migrating birds sort of a V shaped formation, the object was moving very slowly.  As the object moved closer I began to notice that it was not birds, but just a set of lights.  I stood there maybe about 2 minutes and watched the object go from a V shaped formation into a straight line.  I thought maybe I&#39;m just seeing things so I ran into the house and had my sister come out just to make sure I was not hallucinating.  I asked my sister was she seeing this, he then asked me what was it? We could see directly through the object and there was nothing there but lights, no strings, no metal, or anything holding these lights in place.  The object then changed from a line into an oval shape and then back into a line. We stood there maybe 3 minutes the item went about 3 to 4 houses down from the house where I stood over the trees and then vanished into thin air.<n>

Then the object stopped in mid-air and appeared to turn, all the while glowing a bright red light.  Then it went black for a few seconds.  Then it started glowing red again and proceeded towards the moon, stopped again then went straight into the moon and disappeared at a high rate of speed.  Please note I tried to photograph this object, however, my camera did not register the object being there even though I was looking right at it with my eyes.  It didn&#39;t register on my friend&#39;s camera either.<n>

I went to bed at around 9:45pm.  Before crawling into bed I noticed a flashing light to the south.  It was at about a 70 degree angle from the horizon.  It was higher that the clouds as a western moving formation obscured it within about 15 mins of viewing.  I called my children upstairs who also saw this light.  One of them then noticed another flashing light nearly straight up but slightly to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several pictures with a high powered camera which showed the white light was actually a rose colored hue.  I know the difference between a light and the aircraft flying into Mitchell Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:20 am I walked my daughter to the end of our street for the bus to pick her up.  I noticed to the north a flashing light again.  My daughter also saw this light.  It remained stationary until the sun obscured it.<n>

Before spotting the object there was a power cut in my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I looked over and saw a bell shaped object flying with a extraordinarily brilliant bright orange transparent coloured bell shaped over the top and flat shape at bottom.  It&#39;s like the bell shape floating in the sky with out support.  It has sparkling effect inside the orange coloured top.  It was flying slowly, vanished into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wonderful experience!! never seen such an object in my life.<n>

The light performed a sweeping loop near Castle Hill, before travelling quite fast in a northerly direction.  It would be erratic and perform huge dips. It was almost as bright as Venus and was flashing blue.  It would occasionally go behind low lying clouds.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in view for about 3 minutes before dipping towards the horizon and behind the ground lights.  It almost looked as if it was travelling on the winds and falling through air pockets, but it was far too big to be so susceptible to that.<n>

As it was moving above us, it looked as if it was expanding and looked like it was dropping a bomb.  The color of the object it dropped was orange/gold as well and looked like it was falling towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking that if it was bomb we were in trouble.  The object that was falling then started to go back to the eastern part of the sky and the original light kept moving in the western part of the sky.  Then the original light split in two and traveled together out of sight.  This object was moving in a very high speed.  It looked as something was melting out of it.  I was able to see something because of the moonlight but not able to make sense of what it was.  It was still orange under the moonlight but I can’t think of what type of craft can come so close and not make any kind of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total there were three objects, at first as one then it multiplied.  They were the brightest objects in the sky.  It was not a meteor because these objects took different paths, one went back to the eastern sky and the other two kept moving to the west until they disappeared.<n>

But my sister is afraid people will think her &#39;crazy&#39; so she is afraid to report it.  Which is why I filled out your form with her name and info.  I spoke to her just now and is not willing to call your telephone # to report it.  So you can call me and I will pass on her info as accurately as possible.  Please do not call her but you may write to her I would think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. This is not a joke, my sister is uncomfortably obsessed with these objects and is scared of not knowing what it is.  She has had many other encounters that are really weird and strange and unexplainable.<n>

Saw what looked like a plane in the sky.  It grabbed my attention because it looked taller than a commercial aircraft (as if the passenger area was 4 levels tall), and it also seemed to be moving too slowly to stay aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept an eye on it with the understanding that it could easily be an optical illusion created by my position relative to the object.  As my physical location became clearer to see this thing, it became obvious that it was barely moving forward at all.  The size and its speed did not follow the known laws of physics.  The last moment I looked up at it, it simply became less and less opaque until it vanished from sight.  This vanishing (fading out) lasted about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An interesting sighting that could be off Earth, or may be advanced military. Who knows.<n>

Appeared to have a triangular edge to the front of phenomenon, although it was not definitive, or sharp.  It moved across the sky seemingly eating the clouds as it went, with constant speed remaining on straight line course for the duration of viewing.  This &#34;object&#34; or phenomenon was being shadowed by an aircraft with a white flashing light which seemed like it was traveling supersonic due to the engine sound delay, and it seemed to be losing ground to the black streak.  The tail of this streak dissipated quickly and it looked to have a reasonably constant size throughout the viewing.  Length maybe 75-100X the length of the aircraft and about 50x wider.  Took about 25-30 seconds for the dark streak to cross the sky with the trailing aircraft in view for abut a minute.  The clouds seemed to dissipate after this event for a few minutes revealing the stars and moon only for the clouds to move back into place about 10 minutes later.<n>

But it was in the wrong place?

I had seen two on my right over the water and heard the helicopters I could clearly tell what those were. Less than a minute later I saw what I thought was a plane high up moving over my house.

It appeared to be stationary and was probably 10-15 miles away from us over the Norman, Oklahoma, area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed aircraft with their landing lights on coming and going from the Oklahoma City area for years, but none of them pulsated and changed colors as this light did. It seemed to flash red, white, blue, orange and possibly green in quick procession.  We joked that it was a &#34;Christmas star&#34; because of the colors. We lost sight of it because we went down a hill.  By the time we got a view of the horizon again, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many strange aircraft lights along that horizon in previous years and it seems that more and more reports of these lights are being made.  I suspect it might have something to do with Tinker Air Force Base.<n>

What a bummer they thought I was joking.  I don&#39;t really know how long it was there, but when i seen it and drove home must have been at least a minute.  I wasn&#39;t keeping track of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just amazed on what I was seeing.  Sorry I don&#39;t have a great story but at least I can share this with people who will take me seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I live next to an airport and this object had no sound, no lights, and definitely was not flying by fast like the airplanes around here.<n>

Deafening wooshing sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside for  break from wrapping presents when I noticed a red light, circular in shape, in the snow, next to my car.  It blinked 3 times and then disappeared.  It was 3 to 4 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I&#39;m reporting  this is because after seeing this it reminded me of an experience I had a couple years ago, around 1am.  I was biking down Blount street toward the High Noon Saloon.  When I was on the sidewalk next to the MG&amp;E coal castle I was engulfed in a green light or laser that was coming from quite a distance as I could tell the laser was breaking up around me.  I stopped my bike, and the green light stopped.  besides the Christmas similarities I find it rather disturbing.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s alien in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another Madison experience I had about 6 to 8 years ago, we were sitting in my living room with the windows open when we heard a deafening wooshing sound.  It was spring or fall and lasted for 20 seconds.  Quite a while and was reported in the paper. I nev! er heard a conclusion I think the lights are Taran of nature... now the big question... why me?  And what was the wooshing sound?<n>

The first is reflected on the report above, while the second occurred the following evening closer to Phoenix, on the way back to Phoenix to spend the night before flying home to Georgia and North Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first occurred on the night of the 13th.  My coworker and I were walking back to the Spring Hill Suites from a restaurant.  The Christmas crowd had gone home for the evening as we walked passed the Palace Restaurant.  We paused to take a photo of the historic restaurant.  Neither of us noticed the shape above the Palace in the night sky.  I found it on the photo the next day and will email it to you.  We both agree that we didn&#39;t see it at the time but it does not appear to be a photo flash.  The shape is a very distinct saucer-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second strange experience was during our drive to Phoenix on the 14th.  At approximately 20:30, we noticed three very large lights hovering over the mountains on the western horizon.  The three lights were in a triangular pattern; with the one in the middle being just above the horizon and the outside two were evenly spaced on either side, higher up in the sky.  I watched them from the car for at least 10 miles before bringing the lights to my co-worker&#39;s attention.  We continued to watch them.  They were spaced what seemed to be approx 1 mile apart or more. They were very large. They could not have been stars or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we reached Pappadeux restaurant, we noticed one light disappeared, followed by a second.  The third, lower light hovered over the mountain as we entered the restaurant.  It was gone when we came out after dinner.<n>

I looked out my window and noticed a slow moving orange light flying west.  I was facing south. I watched for a minute just wondering what it was, then it got brighter.  As it brightened, it split into two other glowing lights.  I am not sjre the distance from me to the orb, but the two other lights that aplit from the first fell back, one flew lower, as the other went higher.  They drifted a good distance away from the first and then got up to the same speed as the first.  They flew like this for about a minute and the the first light got brignter again, and the other two lights increased speed and went back into the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I opened my windows and tried to listen for sounds.  The object was silent, but when I opened my window my dog stood up on the bed and growled for a second, the fur on her back stood up.  She ran for the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then increased speed and just took off out of view. The whole event lasted around five minutes.<n>

Then looking through my Binoculars I saw they were in formation and each had slowed to a virtual crawl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now suddenly realized each had two small but obvious red lights an equal distance horizontally from each other though not apparently supported by any visible structure but in an identical configuration.  I thought it strange the first apparent red light had now become four in the time it took for me to find and view them through my Binoculars - a maximum duration of perhaps three seconds - and all had slowed to a slow crawl seemingly &#34;floating&#34;  without collapsing toward each other as objects do when receding into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I further saw they were in an obvious formation across from one another. From my perspective as I experienced this first sighting - I judged them to be at least a half mile away in the vicinity of one another though not apparently connected and obviously not conventional aircraft like Jet or Prop driven aircraft or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within one minute they slowly crossed the short distance to the left behind the big cedar tree behind my house and were then totally obscured from view. I thought it quite strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to view the stalled traffic on the freeways through my binoculars for Approx. five minutes when I suddenly noticed a very bright and rapidly pulsating light directly North of my location which I estimated to be perhaps a mile away and about 5 to 600 feet above the Mission District of San Francisco - Approx. the Area of Potrero Blvd. and the Hwy. 101 and 280 interchange.  Shifting my position I saw a second object identical in appearance to the first vibrating light light as well in an identical, abet bizarre fashion somewhat northeast to the first and partially obscured by the same ceder tree which had shortly prior obscured my initial odd sighting of the four red lights, I watched in amazement and fascination  as they seemingly hovered motionless and in unison.  This continued for Approx four minutes before I quickly went to my computer to contact my online community in the SF area to inquire if they too could see what I was witnessing.  One friend a few miles to the west said she could see a bright stationary light hovering over the area of the Mission Dist. She wrote: &#34;I saw a VERY bright, large light on the southeastern sky.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it was not moving.  Then I thought perhaps it was a planet, but it was pretty low on the horizon&#34;.  After a few minutes exchanging excited online messages I returned to my position on the couch and again saw the bright light nearly exactly where I had first seen it as a vibrating light in a few minutes prior, the second object wasn&#39;t immediately visible but quite quickly I grabbed the binoculars and my camera and ran out of my home and around the block to where I would have an unrestricted view of the entire sky.  This took Approx. 90 seconds but there was nothing unusual visible at that time or location. i observed for ten minutes before returning home and calling the police.<n>

The first object re-illuminated and started falling towards the South in a stop-and-go pattern.  The second object taking a similar path but not exact.  After 2 of the first objects went behind a tree, the third object appeared and started &#34;Falling&#34; South.  The Second object reemerged and went north on a flat plane and then the third object kept falling South in a stop-and-go pattern and the light went out and went back on 1 time during its fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I saw something about one year that contained 3 objects following the same pattern in the same exact part of the sky.

These lights were well above the street and ahead of us about 8-10 miles away.  The lights began to break formation and proceeded  on their own path. Two of the lights started to intersect each others path, but they did not colide.  We watched the lights for about 3 miles while driving.  Three of the lights that were closest to the east, started to fade away and or fly away, while the one remaining light intensified and slightly flashed a few times. Once we traveled another 2 miles or so the remaining light faded away.  I have traveled on this road for more than 20+ years, and I or my mother have never seen lights like that before  there.<n>

I’m a big airplane enthusiast and very interested in astronomy, so I always have my eyes on the sky no matter what time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was around 6pm, against and completely black sky.  I was walking across campus and saw two extremely bright orange lights.  They were right next to each other and at an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a small moment, my gut told me it was a plane with bright lights on the tips of its wings that was banking hard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a step back from behind the tree that was now blocking my view to make sure I wasn’t crazy.  I saw the two golden orange orbs moving slowly, in separate directions.  I watched them for about 3 seconds before the lights faded out right before my eyes.  One of them faded slightly before the other, and both were moving in slightly different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed there was no sound at all, and if it was the plane I thought initially, I would have heard so! mething.  The plane would have been a few hundred feet in front of me, and there would have been sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, I’m always looking to the sky.  I know what satellites look like. I know what the space station looks like. I know what Venus looks like.  Two golden orbs, moving slowly, fade away to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s where it gets weird for me.  Yesterday was December 13, 2013.  My friend and I were making our trip from Potsdam, NY to Albany, NY.  An hour south east of Potsdam is a town called Tupper Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to Tupper Lake, the sun had just gone down, and the sky had a pinkish blue tint to it.  I turned to the left to see two golden orange orbs in the east.  They were the exact lights I had seen in Potsdam weeks earlier.  This time, they appeared to be almost directly over us, and about 300 feet apart from each other.  These were the same lights, and in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first lights I saw in Potsdam were right over Tupper Lake because it was in the South Eastern sky.  I started yelling to my friend in the passenger seat to look at the lights!  He was looking at the street lights, car lights, lights from the mall…he didn’t see the orbs in the 3 seconds that I saw them.  Just as before, the lights were there for 3 seconds, then faded out while moving slowly in different directi! ons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the drive, we would observe what I KNOW was Venus fading in and out.  It was extremely bright<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We have a SF International Airport in a couple of miles from this spot.  Several aircrafts were in the sky at the time and comparing to them this object was moving absolutely differently at about the same altitude.  I was watching it for some time at the red light but then I had to move and could not see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a bunch of red lights and one green was blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of all it reminded me of a child toy but very high in the sky.

At first glance it appeared to be a plane coming in for a landing.  Four or five large fiery orange lights hung there in the sky, in a horizontal orientation for only a moment or two.  The lights then went out, one by one leaving only the clear night sky behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pondered what it could have been for the next few miles.  As we came to a clearing just before the Bradford exit, we saw it again.  This time the lights were in a more vertical orientation and blinking differently than before.  One would go out and another would come on immediately.  I could almost see a structure, a craft, but at the same time there appeared to only be lights.  Then the lights went out, like before, in perfectly timed succession, one by one, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly pulled into the park-and-ride and got out of the car to see if we could hear anything and there was silence.  It was truly bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The first thing I noticed was there was a vertical smoke trail in the sky, the kind of trail which you see when a jet plane leaves behind in the sky.  And the object making the trail looked like a bright white  orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This vertical trail I could see from the top of the sky.  The object was going vertically down to land , crash or whatever.  I waited long for it to emit a bright flash which I believe would have confirmed to me that it was probably a meteor.  While this was happening I saw something extraordinary.  Another object which appeared diamond shaped,very bright appeared and was moving horizontally near the orb moving downwards.  This diamond shaped object did not have leave any trail of any kind in the sky and appeared to be moving significantly faster than the one moving downwards.  I can not say how close these objects were to each other.  The diamond shaped object was visible for about 5-8 secs and then disappeared.  The vertically falling orb was seen for approximately 5 mins.  I tried taking a video but my smartphone could not capture it.  The objects seemed like they were very far away.<n>

I noticed a bright bluish white light hovering in the sky.  It was a solid light with a slight flicker.  It resembled a planet, similar to Venus.  As I travel this area daily, the light seemed out of place.  I watched closely and it appeared to slowly move toward my position.  I slowed to about 55 mph on the interstate and looked at the object through the top of my windshield.  Afraid that I was going to cause an accident in the early morning traffic, I decided to take the first available exit so that I could pull over and observe the object.  I exited onto Northbound Illinois Rte 203 with plans to stop at the Gateway Truck Plaza to watch the object.  While exiting, watching the light, and trying not to run off of the ramp, the light just disappeared.  I opened the moon roof and no longer saw the object.  I continued to the Gateway Truck Plaza and parked and exited my vehicle to scan the s! ky.  The sky was lightly cloudy, but above me, and where the object was, was completely clear.  The morning light was very faint and there were stars that were still visible.  After scanning the sky it was evident that nothing could be hiding behind clouds, as there were none in the area where the object was.  I would estimate at the time of disappearance, the object was at about 5000 ft.  I am a Mechanical Engineer and consider myself of sound mind.  What I witnessed this morning has left me perplexed.

Even with the highest strength of an Rx from my doctor, I still have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.  Last night I was sitting in my living room watching tv.  I don&#39;t like having the lights on in the house when not necessary; so they were all off.  My fiance and son were in bed.  My couch was facing a large picture window that looks out onto our front yard. We live in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching my television show, I noticed a dim flash of orange outside that came from over the tree tops and was bright enough to light up the surrounding trees yet not super bright.  I jumped up and looked outside the window but there were no cars.  The flash came from above anyway and I have seen many car headlights come and go from our neighbors and they cannot and do not illuminate our entire yard and up to the top of the 30 ft. trees we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and no sign of any aircraft.  I opened the front door and the only sound I heard was that of the wind moving through the tall thin evergreens and those trees crackling as they swayed in that wind.  If it had been the spotlight from a helicopter, it would have been bright white, like an LED bulb.  I&#39;ve seen those many times.  And I would have heard that helicopter.  Like I said before, there was no sound at all.  And it was not bright enough to have been a spotlight anyway.  It was a somewhat dim flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was that I saw and I&#39;m not going to try to overthink it.  I&#39;m just putting it down here for you to consider because we had an experience two nights in a row some days ago that also included bright (at the time even brighter) orange flashes that illuminated our yard.  That&#39;s really all I can say about it.  I had not been drinking. I don&#39;t do drugs and I was not sleeping.  I was wide awake at the time.<n>

The lights would blink( more like a flicker) and reappear but not like a plane would.  As I watched I called a coworker to come over and see.  As he came over a different light appeared much bigger and brighter than the others and orange in color.  It did not move and was seen for 30 seconds to a minute before it slowly faded away.  We watched the smaller flashing lights move towards the southwest till they were out of sight.  Then they reappeared heading toward the direction they came.  There was at least a dozen maybe more of the smaller lights.  At one point one of the lights stopped flashing and became a constant light.  We watched it move to the east and then switch directions and move to the west.  Which I do not know of any aircra! ft that is capable of moving or changing directions like that.  Shortly after that the bright orange light reappeared followed by four or five more all in a line at what looked like the same altitude.  The line disappeared in the same order that it appeared one going out at a time.  We did not see the light again but continued to see the others for another 10 to 15 minutes.  This was in the city of Grovetown looking towards the direction of the Fort.  My Co-worker and myself were very confused by what we saw both of us have never seen anything like it.  We did see a shooting star during this event and a plane.  I have seen planes, helicopters and shooting stars in the night sky plenty of times.  I do not believe what we saw was any of those things<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

With two bright white lights connected by smaller red and white blinking lights, I thought it was an airplane at first, except it remained almost completely stationary.  Maybe it was a helicopter, I thought, as I continued on my way to my friend&#39;s place, losing sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later at around 9:15pm, my friend and I were getting back onto I-94 westbound near Miller Park when I spotted the same lights.  By this time, the object had moved and was presently just south of I-94 by about a quarter to a half mile, hovering about 1000 feet above the ground.  As we got closer, we were able to get a better view of it as it hovered above the area just east of Stare Fair Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no discernible wings and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  There were at least 3 bright white lights and a hale-domed shaped blinking red light which appeared to be in the center.  I couldn&#39;t determine the shape-it was night and we were on the freeway, driving fast-but my friend and I both did not recognize it as any aircraft we&#39;re familiar with.

We also noticed 2 other glowing balls next to each other a distance apart from the other ones.  At the same time, we saw about a dozen sparkling objects that surrounded the orange fireballs that would sparkle then disappear repeatedly.  We excitedly got out of our truck to get a better view and as we did, the other two orange balls dissappeared (a minute before the other set of fireballs vanished)… Then, the sparkling objects suddenly dispersed and began moving west and we lost sight of them behind the trees.  We saw a few more of them in the sky, but they were singular..not part of a group like before.  Next, my partner saw two of the same type of orange lights above the trees in the east.  They seemed to lower in the sky behind the tree line then they disappeared in the same manner as the others.  My partner has seen the orange fireballs in two ! separate instances in the past since living on this property in the last ten years.  Note: the orange balls are stationary.  They do not get larger or smaller in our visual field.  We did not hear any sounds.  This is my first UFO sighting.<n>

At first thought street lights or office building lights but we don&#39;t have any buildings that high.  My brother on the opposite end of town also spotted these.  They weren&#39;t meteors from Ty Geminid shower or flares or fireworks or nothing explainable to my knowledge.  Dispersed after about five minutes.  They were a reddish orange or amber color if you prefer.  They were somewhat in a formation but mostly just looked scattered<n>

12/12/13 18:25|Henderson|CO|Sphere|4 minutes|Bright lights in triangle formation stationary in the sky|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105310.html|541|ndxe201312| Bright lights in triangle formation stationary in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of December 12, 2013, at 6:24 pm as I was driving home with a friend after work (I was in the passenger seat and not the one driving and we were driving eastbound on the main highway), I looked out to the right side (southern direction) and noticed 4 military flares being dropped, and I observed them descend at a relatively steady rate until they went below tree line and disappeared.  I have seen military flares being dropped before and there was no question that these were military flares being dropped from an aircraft.  This was not the actual sighting, but I wanted to note that this was a little unusual as I don’t see flares being dropped often personally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:35pm, literally about 9 minutes after seeing the flares being dropped, I observed to my left side (which was in a northerly direction) 3 bright, stationary lights in the sky in a semi triangular formation, which I estimate were at around 15,000 feet elevation.  They were very high in the sky.  At this time I had pulled into a gas station and was stationary and not moving while at the same time observing these lights.  The only reason it had caught my attention was that I had never seen a formation of lights in this manner shining so brightly, not moving, and completely stationary.  The brightness could be compared to the star Sirius, which is considered one of the brightest stars in the sky at night.  At first I thought that these 3 stars were stars/planets, and I was trying to figure out what constellation it was.  About 4 minutes later, the 3 bright lights completely dematerialized and were gone.  I was not able to track them moving at all, they just vanished without ! any trail whatsoever and  disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That area of the city where I had observed the lights has no tall structures or communications towers that could have been the source of the lights, and I was not able to observe any FAA lights that are mandatory for all aircraft in US airspace.  That area is completely level, and the mountains are much further to the west.  The simply appeared as stars in the sky, and then they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I am unable to attribute this sighting as any natural phenomena, as the formation and the brightness of the lights, and then observing them dematerialize was, to me, anything but natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I called my grandson to see, we stood looking out the window (looking eastward).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched, for about 20 minutes, as the lights moved about, at times with the comet like tails and at times very clearly four separate lights.  They moved in circles for a bit and then lined up straight.  One moved and then just disappeared;then a moment later reappeared.  We watched the lights move along the horizon just above the trees, and then one by one they sank behind the trees and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted an astronomer at an observatory and he suggested they were fireworks – these were NOT fireworks, or laser pointers.<n>

My UFO siteing occurred yesterday morning at 1:30 AM while just beginning of US-84 E/Hwy 84E (130 mi. from 2nd st.Exit)---a second siteing of the same craft occurred on the same highway 2 hrs.later 25 mi. from 2nd st exit(105 mi.from 1st siteing).....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s my story: I was driving from Reno, NV to Temple TX. (I had a 13 wk. medical Pediatric cardiac ultrasound job in Temple,TX. beginning  12/16/2013....I left Reno at around 10PM.... When I arrived at the above mentioned hwy.location..I noticed an &#34;EXTREMELY&#34; bright clear light about 45 degrees above the horizon flashing on and off consistently at 2 sec. intervals....Estimated distance from my location is at less than 3 miles.  I had a fully charged high end camera with me which has 1080i high definition video and (40X)ZOOM capabilities in case of an accident while traveling. I took out my camera and began a 25 min video consisting of &#34;MANY&#34; 40X CLOSE UP ZOOM SHOTS&#34;...What the zoom shots revealed was:  1) The object was perfectly circular and pulsing consistently on and off extremely bright clear light flash pulses of light every 2 seconds.  There were random sporadic finger-like projections occurring at a rate of approximately 3 to 6 times per minute ! where streaks of light was projected equidistant from the center of the primary perfectly circular light center.  These additional light features created various geometric configurations ranging from pentagonal star formations to multiple other  nondescript star burst configurations....On multiple occasions smaller burst manifestations appeared to be taking up different- but proximal space simultaneously as if being in two place at the same instant....I kept zooming in @ 40X and out quite often during the 30 min. video....2)  In the 40X zoom mode I was clearly able to demonstrate an additional space craft unit attached (docked to), or may have been part of the non illuminating portion of the original craft. When the bright burst of light pulsed- a secondary connection could be seen as a result of the illumination...The connection is clearly demonstrated as being connected to the craft and the connection point is identified at the location of 9 o&#39;clock on my video pics.The shap! e of the connection is cylindrical like a waste basket. To wat! ch and o bserver the  multiple finger-like highly illuminated projections from the central illumination was sensational...like 4th of July spectacular visuals.....3) The pulsing spherical object with connections at 9 o&#39;clock remained in stationary, motionless orbit during the entire filming of the 1st siteing---There were two siteings: After 25 min.of the videoing the 1st siteing...I felt I had videoed all the features possible, so I put my camera away and continued my journey...Well,105 miles down the same hwy, (25 miles before the 2nd st exit), I saw the same object in the sky only now it was on the same hwy. only 2hrs and 105 miles later...It was the same object with exactly the same manifest ions....I  took a brief video documenting this later siteing. As I videoed the second siteing, the craft moved directly on an intercept course with me..where I was outside my car on the road.within a minute the craft had intersected my line of site and was now hovering in a stationary pattern! still 45 degrees above the horizon , but only less than 500 yards from my line of sight reference. It really appeared as if  it were preparing to land. I held my ground and prepared for any eventuality..It remained in stationary orbit at that location, Finally, as I turned onto and away from the craft to continue my route to Temple,Tx. where I am now. I could see it moving away in my front windshield....Bottom line: I have seen seen a UFO documentary....and I believe the craft I&#39;ve seen and videoed has been seen on TV before...But now I have much greater resolution pics/video of it....Currently, Have 35 min. of high magnification with 1080i pixel definition quality definition of  a UFO which is for the first time irrefutable....This is the definitive link: I want to be paid $$$$ for this video. I have 30+min. video of it....I would like to sell it....Anyone interested in it?...I know any ID of the teller of this story is prohibited...but this is exceptional....The best def! initive video ever!!! !OK, I&#39;ll take an &#34;exceptional&amp;quot! ; chance : my contact for this video is: userq9750@aol.com        userq9750@aol.com....highest bidder gets the video...REAL DEAL....<n>

The night was cold, the sky was clear and there was a day-past first quarter, or fat half-crescent moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object through an opening between some trees across Dixon Branch Greenbelt Park.  The sighting was a brief glimpse of a far-off, dark, silent, dart-shaped silhouette against the clear luminous night sky.  Because the object appeared to be so sharp, I assume that I was looking at an edge-on view of a triangle, but cannot prove this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought that the shadow was a swept-wing fighter accelerating upward in my direction at a supersonic speed.  It was climbing toward me from the southwest – note that ALL of my view of this first UFO was along a straight line approaching from the southwest of me.  The craft apparently moved twice the speed of a commercial jet and traveled about two miles in six seconds, both estimates, when put together, gave its speed at about 1,200-mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were commercial jetliners visible to the far north and south, providing a direct comparison.  The silhouette appeared to be generally airplane-sized at 2 to 4-miles distance, but was silent despite the velocity – a jet interceptor would have been on afterburner and audible at that speed and range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO first caught my attention when it was about 35-degrees elevation and it disappeared at about 50-degrees elevation.  The first quarter or half-crescent moon was at about 60-degrees elevation, also to the southwest.  I roughly estimate that the silhouette first appeared to me about 4-miles away, possibly over the Deep Ellum area, and it disappeared when 2-miles closer, approaching White Rock Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It climbed from 2-miles altitude at Deep Ellum to 3-miles altitude at White Rock Lake.  If the climb and direction were backtracked, its original ‘takeoff’ may have been the Cockrell Hill areas, which are 8-miles to the southwest.  Although it was getting closer to me, I lost it in the half moon’s glare and could not pick it up on the other side, which would have been almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing seemed phantom-like and eerie, and I was surprised to see it.  The object appeared to be going on a straight course from a lower altitude to a higher destination and I recall chuckling to myself that, “It must be carrying some cargo.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think much about this first sighting because it was so distant, vague and impersonal, and did not make a report or discuss it with anyone.  However, I did begin accessing some websites and buying various books about UFOs, for the first time in my 73-years.

I get out to run an grab my camera but i was stuck in awe watching it.  I have never seen anything move like this or look like it, it seemed as if it had no limitations to ways it could  move about in the sky.  As it zoomed by in what seemed like a blink of an eye another appeared out of no where and the two white star looking crafts started to like dance around eachother in the sky.  By this time it looked like they were the air force had shown up with various types of aircrafts and started circulating around the unknown crafts.  After 20 min about of doing this one brave helicopter went in to get a closer look and i could of sweared they were dead when one of the ufo&#39;s just charged at.  Swiftly getting by it the helicopter took off in the other direction frantically.  The sky was full of planes and the ! orbs would pop in an out in various differnt spot, and every dog in my neighborhood was barking due to the ufo&#39;s.  They finally faded away as did all the planes..  Apocolyptic<n>

I was looking up at the clear night sky facing north.  At an altitude approximately 10,000 ft., I saw three huge flashes of white light like huge LED&#39;s in a chevron formation in the due north sky.  The flashes were not an airplane and there was no noise as if any form of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking in the same area and there were no more flashes for another minute or so that I could see.  I could hear the neighbors&#39; dogs barking in the distance.  This is a rural area and there is no light pollution whatsoever.  I came in and reported my sighting to the other occupants of the house.<n>

We described to each other what we saw and marked the time at 6:00 P.M. exactly.  It did  not have a tail but looked more like a computer cursor.  It headed into the trees, but we saw no explosion like we expected, instead it just disappeared..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe the objects to be within a mile or two of the highway I was traveling.  I pulled over and lowered my window.  The lights expanded in size then changed color turning from red to orange then dimmed to yellow before vanishing.  I waited a couple minutes then drove a mile to the first side road and traveled southward in hopes of getting another glimpse over open fields.  I stoped and got out of my vehicle looking southwest.  A few minutes later, one of the lights reappeared several miles away then vanished after 5 seconds.  Five minutes went by then both lights reappeared on the horizion.  After 10 seconds one light went out and the second light became bright, expanded in size then dimmed just as the first light reappeared.  Both lights blinked ON &amp; OFF then vanished. No sound or vapor trail emitted.  These lights were very large in! size.  Had a 727 passenger plane been in the same air space I believe the objects would have dwarfed the planes.<n>

Then it slowly faded out and it was gone I mean gone I believe the passenger plane that was moving to the west just to the east of the light played a role in its disappearance.  This is the 10th time I have seen this type of light..CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM THIS??  PLEASE!!!!<n>

This was much brighter than Venus as well as much larger and slowly moving from west to east.  At one point it stopped moving for a few minutes and the continued on in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it through binoculars and then through my spotting scope.

Brea is located in the Northeast corner of Orange County.  At the time the observation was made, the object was traveling very fast and at a very high altitude (possibly the fringe of space) in a West/North/West direction.  When first sight the object appeared to be at about 70 degrees above horizontal (from the base of the Brea foothills) traveling from East to West.  The Object approached the brightness of Venus when seen in the night sky, but was much smaller.  There was no sound associated with the observation.  No lights were seen.  As the object moved quickly across the sky it was followed by a very small and visible white trail, however, it was nothing like any vapor trail previously observed on other occasions associated with high altitude military aircraft or the vapor trails of rockets.  The object never &#34;left a trail&#34; as it moved.  The trail follow the object, never increasing in length or width and immediately appeared to dissipate (it&#39;s size remaining constant.)  At least one commercial airliner was seen in the sky at the same time as the object&#39;s sighting, also traveling East to West at an altitude consistent with an airport approach for landing.  The airliner appeared to be motionless in the sky when compared to the object.<n>

Seen at intersection of HWY V and 113 facing north.   We came over the last hill going north on 113,  approaching the stop sign at V and I said,  What in the hell is that..what is that, what are we seeing Oh my God what is that!  3-4 lights evenly spaced and one light spaced a little farther back and to the left.  Like it would have been on a curved object the sky around the lights was dark, I started to pull over but the traffic was coming up behind us and my husband said no, don&#39;t pull over.  We sat with the traffic behind us and stared.  The light on the far right went out and another appeared or came off of the one next to it a little closer and then another appeared where the one on the far right was.  Then the one that appeared closer to the second one on the right disappeared. It reminded me of the lights one goes off then the next one goes on etc.  We watched for at least 20-30 seconds while stopped, the lig! hts on the far left stayed lit.  Then all at once nothing.  Just like nothing was ever there all at the same time gone. Just blinked out.  These lights were not moving and they did appear to be in a formation very evenly spaced.  They were over a farm field not very high in the sky and very close.  I am no good at trying to determine distance. If these lights were on something it was big. 1/2 the size to the size of a football field big.  They were NOT high in the sky like you would see a star.  I am still trying to wrap my head around this.  I got a very severe headache during and after this.  When we got home we went to our windows to see if there was anything there that we could see.  We do not live far from where the lights were and would have been able to see them from our windows.  I got ill and had to go to bed.  Had a very uneasy sick feeling all night. I do not get ill or have severe headaches from stress etc.  I feel we saw something and am not one to see somethin! g and just assume it is a ufo or a ghost or anything like that! .  I gre w up Air Force and know how F-16&#39;s, Blackhawks and the like maneuver, what are satellites  and even the space station or shuttle!    These were stationary.  25-30 degrees up is my guess. Can&#39;t rely on that though. I could go out there and show someone.  Sorry!  I also took pictures of something in Nov that I did not see when I took the pic.  But thought it could be ice crystals in clouds.  Father is/was a meteorologist. (Govt NOT tv) He thought it was a strange anomaly, and was not sure. He is not a photo expert. glare etc.  Going to try to post those now that we have seen what we have seen.<n>

The object was on the other side of the sky, and when focusing on the object I noticed not only that it was blinking green, yellow and blue but that it seemed to be bobbing up and down.  While staring at this object, I noticed another, smaller and less distinct light that seemed to be traveling and closing the gap between itself and the large, bright object.  While I was watching, the larger object seemed to flash orange and both objects ceased all movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside and returned about an hour later, knowing that the objects would be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only apparent object in the sky was the one that I normally see in its usual spot, so the large and bright object was back where I normally see it, but much less brighter than in the previous hour.

It was shocking because there&#39;s was surely nothing or no one around on ground level, and the way the lights disappeared was very confusing because it was nothing nor could&#39;ve been human-aircraft in my opinion, because it was like it had to have warped away or something of that travel capability.<n>

And if I recall correctly, the light did not appear to have the typical brilliance of aircraft lights, nor did it appear to be a craft just within the cloud layer, with its main light source diffused, and perhaps the other lights obscured, by the clouds, thereby giving it the appearance of a single light object; it did appeared as one object, i.e., an object of light, and I am quite certain it was below the clouds and not passing through, or thinly veiled by, them; so it was probably not the International Space Station.  It may have been a plane, but it seemed too close, below an overcast that was reflecting some of the ground-based lighting, for it not to have been discernible.  I did not perceive any sound emanating from it, either; from the beginning of the observation, I felt uneasy as I intently watched this light/object and sensed I was possibly witnessing somet! hing not man-made.  The quality of the round or oval light brought to mind the descriptions of plasma radiating UFOs.  I kept a constant watch to note if it stopped and/or changed directions, or perhaps pulsed, but it simply continued on its steady pace, becoming dimmer as it became more distant until it finally disappeared below the tree line to the northeast.  The observation probably lasted less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the line of travel to have been a line passing through the Tampa Bay area, across the northern Orlando area, which is where I was, and on out to the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between the Kennedy Space Center and Daytona Beach.  Was it generally following the Interstate 4 corridor?<n>

She said this movement took approximately 60 seconds. She said it then stopped and suddenly disappeared and reappeared several (roughly 20) degrees North and continued to move in a northerly direction at the same pace as before (she came in after another 60 seconds of watching it).  My estimation of the time is different than hers as I thought she had been out there for nearly twice the amount of time she claimed, so you can decide between the two or average it to 3 minutes total.  As soon as she came in and rattled off what she had seen I ran outside and could see nothing past the trees right behind the north side of our yard, but did see what was obviously a helicopter or small plane with cle! arly-defined length and individual blinking lights on the eastern horizon facing north (the last direction my daughter had spotted the craft), then turning and moving towards me (due west).  I know that she knows what these common craft look like, as they are constantly flying around here and she points them out with proper identification nearly every night we are out and about.  We have a hospital and helipad not 2 miles from our house (a few blocks east of MO-71/I-49 and a few blocks south of MO-58)and several small airports within 15 miles, so they are truly common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing strange craft here is not uncommon if you look up in the evening and after dark.  Strange black triangles (that are clearly not the Stealth Fighters and Bombers I saw growing up a few miles from their home at Whiteman AFB) and a large craft that sounded like a heavy helicopter but had no defined shape flying dangerously low and making repeated sharp, banking turns above my house with absolutely NO lights have been seen in just the last three months by my entire family and the entire neighborhood with no explanation (we were all standing outside staring up at it and were confused/frightened).  We are less than 5 miles from what used to be an AFB, but is supposedly now closed except for military barracks and some large warehouse/shipping buildings.  Despite its status there are still many military vehicles there at all times and Chinook helicopters fly over from that direction (very low) at all times of day and night, and we can easily identify several military fighters/ h! elicopters that are frequently seen in the area.  That being said, we have no idea what some of these things are that we are seeing, but some of them shake the house but make no discernible noise.<n>

I noticed two lights off in the distance hovering about 2000 ft off the ground.  They were at a 45 from each other, one was higher and the second was lower and to the left.  Everyone in the car is now looking at the lights trying to figure out what they are.  They looked like two aircraft flying coming directly towards you except the light was brighter and more of an orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we are coming up the street, a row of houses blocked our view of the distant sky. We lost sight of the lights for appx. 15 seconds.  Once we got a clear view again, the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The inside of that car was dead silent as we were just trying to figure but what type of aircraft that was, now the two object were gone.

If you were to draw a line between them out would be at about a 60 degree angle.  These dots did not appear to be moving.  After about 20 seconds, the bottom dot faded away.  It took less than a second to fade away. 2 to 5 seconds later the other dot faded away.  However it took longer to fade away than the first.  It took about 1.5 seconds to fade away.  I&#39;m pretty interested in aliens and the like.  My brother was pretty skeptic about the idea that it was a ufo but we couldn&#39;t find any other logical explanation.<n>

DOGS WERE HOWLING FOR FIRST TIME-19:06 12/10/13<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:06 p.m., I was sitting outside at our home in Laveen (SW Phoenix) and letting my dog play.  I was in the backyard where we have full view of high skies and much flight activity as close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Air Force Bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing and an enormous and brilliantly white in color light caught my eye as the it seemed to literally fall from the sky and quick over the house and neighborhood and then to the ground. It came from what appeared to be the North and East direction (saw as quick came over roof of home) and the immense and very intense bright white light dropped in the just near South and just East or possibly just Southerly direction.  The area where it flew over seemed to be almost right above the front of our home and heading rapidly towards the ground and South Mountain part.  The bright light was very intense and large and &#34;appeared&#34; too close to be real.  We did NOT hear any explosion or landing noise.  We did, for the very first time we&#39;ve lived here, hear dogs HOWLING. It was so large that clearly others have seen and will report.  I had thought to call 911 but thought I could not really tell them what it was or where it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen meteor shower and stars falling.  They burn out quickly and don&#39;t appear to ever be lower than the very busy aircraft that are constantly in the air.  The Airport closest is about 10 miles due East and we see departures and arriving flights around the clock, along with military craft performing maneuvers and plenty of high altitude large craft mostly coming from the West or likely California and passing far above the local traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in a fairly spherical shape but the light was SO BRIGHT and SO WHITE that it seemed like it may have been very large-nothing I have ever seen in 40 years.  I&#39;ve never reported anything like this, never have seen anything like this and hope that you and others can locate where this landed and hopefully it didn&#39;t land or crash in a populated area.  It&#39;s too early online to see comments from NEWS, etc.  But MANY private and commercial craft were in the air at this time.  This was far below even where helicopters fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arizona Reporting<n>

The car in front of me slowed down and pulled over and i was passing trail road and the plane got closer and the closer it got it was v shapes almost like the top of a triangle I thought it was a stealth plane the army uses and it had two huge bright white lights and it almost came to a complete stop in midair I could see all the lights and it slowly moved southwest towards kswo.

The lights were a dark orange in color and seemed to be very large however I have no reference point by which to make any claims to their actual size.  As a light would begin to glow it would gradually increase in intensity and after a second or so, begin to decrease in intensity as another light in close proximity to it would then begin to increase in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed there were four of these lights in a row and they would sequentially glow on and off in sequence until all four had lit up.  Then we wouldn’t see any activity for a few moments until the light sequence would begin again very near the previous location.  After seeing this for a couple of iterations, the activity stopped.  I observed a single orange light glow and increase in intensity and then decrease again at the very beginning of the event and at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also witnessed this activity and we attempted to film it, however we were not fast enough and were only able to capture the single glowing light at the very end of the event.<n>

These objects weren&#39;t moving. They had lights all around them, very bright lights.  I looked away for a split second and the little one was gone but the big was was still there.  I was so amazed i even pulled over on the side of the road and looked behind me and there was 1 more car pulled over looking and another pulling over looking at the same object as me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light was high in the air but lower than the outermost atmosphere.  It was not a star. It was moving, though too slowly to be a rocket or a plane.  As I was trying to figure out what it was, a jet coming from the south flew by the light so quickly that I thought for a split second that the light had fired a rocket.  It was a jet though, as I could tell from the condensation trail. It appeared to be some aircraft running reconnaissance on the unidentified light in the sky.  That means it was low enough for manned aircraft to pay attention to it.  I went back to my house after walking my dog as the night sky grew darker.  As I got closer to my front door, I realized the light was traveling in a northerly direction from the south.  It ended up in a position southwest of my house, and my neighbor drove up as he came home from work. I told him to look at the light in sky and tell me if I am seein! g things. He asked the same question I did, &#34;what is that?&#34;  We both looked at it for several minutes then went indoors.  I texted my other neighbor and told him to look outside to see if he could tell me what he saw.  He and his wife both saw the light and remarked on how strange it was. It was there for an hour or more.  I left to go inside and was unable to track it any longer. When I had a free chance I went outside again to see if it was still there, but it was gone.  I took a 6 minute video with my phone of the light as I viewed it from my back porch.<n>

It was early in the morning (~9:15am) so the sun was not high up in the sky (just above Lake Ontario).  I then noticed that the sun was to my left and another bright light was to the right.  My first thought was it was a reflection of some sort from the sun bouncing off the clouds, but it was just very unusual how it only reflected off of one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself this was beautiful and decided to take a photo with my cell phone camera (while driving).  As I started taking pictures and getting closer to the lights I realized this was some sort of phenomena.  I then had to turn right (westbound) onto Wentworth and decided to pull over and get a still shot.  I rolled down the window and took a clear shot of the lights then I zoomed in a little closer and took a couple more shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then within a matter of less than a minute the light started to fading or slowly disappearing. The light now turned into a small beautiful rainbow as the cloud disappeared and then eventually the rainbow also disappeared. I did not think anything of what I saw as a mystery, but just beauty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to my office I downloaded the photos to do a review then to my surprise I now am noticing an orange dot in some of the photos.  I did not see this with my eyes while observing the bright light.  It seemed to have been moving and one shot shows the dot very near to the bright light.  It is the dot(s) that are making me believe that I witnessed some sort of a UFO.<n>

I then see a very slow moving light with other coloured flashing lights which would not flash in a specific order. I called my friend who was sleeping downstairs to look outside my dining room window when she did she was amazed at what she saw. It could stay in the sky without any movement just hovering still as can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both kept repeating to each other on the phone “Oh my god do you see that” every time it would change direction circling the sky around 8 times. It moved across the sky coming towards us and go further from us whilst also being able to maneuver left and right which i have never seen in an aircraft before. We saw two flashes before we watched the UFO hover down landing behind some houses.<n>

The lights in the house were off.  When we watch television we are facing one small and one large picture window that looks out onto our wooded yard.  Our house is tucked into a forested lot so that even the headlights from the very occasional passing car going to and from a neighbors house is not seen from our living room.  There are very few houses on our road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched our show at least 3 bright orange flashes of light flew from the right side of our house in the air the whole time and moved across to the left.  Even though it only lasted a few seconds it was clear that the light originated and continued in the air, though maybe not tree top height.  The trees around our property average about 20-30 feet high. From where the flashes originated there is nothing but wooded property and our garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes seemed to be no more than 6-10 feet off the ground but grew in height.  My fiancée thought something in the garage had exploded.  However, there was never any sound at all. I thought the lights to the truck had flashed a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé ran out onto our front deck to look and see what it was but there was nothing there.  Nothing was out of place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were bright orange and clear quick flashes with 3-5 of them successively within the span of 3-5 seconds.  They moved from right to left completely silently and were so bright they lit up our front yard (which is about the size of the parking lot of a small business) and all the trees in our yard.  To give you an idea of how big our yard is, we could probably park 30-40 cars in our front yard alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s at all related or not but last night (the night before this happened) around 3:30 in the morning, our dog who sleeps on her bed in the living room, came into our bedroom and alerted to something in the living room or at the front door.  This is out of character for her.  Just as she woke me, I heard a very slight sound but I could not pinpoint the sound.  It seemed to resonate throughout the house.  It was a very slight but deep sound.  You could liken it to a (Wah-Wah-Wah-wah) sound.  I could feel this sound just as much as I could hear it and I can&#39;t explain it better than that.  It lasted for just as long as it took me to walk the few feet from our bedroom to the living room.  Then it was just gone.  It just immediately stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a really tough time falling asleep last night.  The dog acted as if there was someone at the door and I felt like there was too but our motion sensor lights weren&#39;t on and I saw no one.  I felt the weird need to sleep in my f! our year olds bed with him at that point.  At this point, my healthy ((xx-years)) old dog would not leave my side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, my dog collapsed onto the floor and laid there with her eyes open but not blinking.  She would not respond to my voice or my touch.  She would not even respond to my commands.  This scared me.  About two or three minutes later she came to again and acted totally normal again.  It seemed as if she had been drugged but of course she had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated ((deleted)). I also hold a degree in ((deleted)).  I do believe that we are not the only intelligent life out there.  However, like most people I have never encountered anything personally that would give me that absolute undeniable truth.  I&#39;m not going to say that this experience is that undeniable truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be quite honest, I don&#39;t and I can&#39;t know what this was that we saw but it is a very strange experience and it happened just as I have told you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she is a very capable, and serious-minded, person.

It was faster than anything I had ever seen before but it did not accelerate, decelerate or gain or lose altitude.  It stayed completely consistent in all aspects of movements.  I was in my back yard at about 8:15 PM est. when I saw it zip across the sky from North to south in an arching path.  It didn’t fade away, it continued across the sky extremely quickly until it was out of view.  There were low spotty clouds that may have covered it from view but I saw it perfectly through them.  They didn’t affect my view of it.  The object couldn’t have been more than 1000 or so feet above the ground (still some clouds lower than it).  After I brought it up to a trusted relative, he said he had seen the same type of craft in north Jersey only green 	This was like nothing I had seen before and I hope others saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After I passed under the exit, I was directly underneath it and could see the bottom was completely lit up by the 3 lights and 1 small blue light in the middle.  The first thing that came to mind was “This isn’t completely normal. I should take a picture”.  So I rolled down the window and held my phone out the window to take the picture.

It lasts up to an hour, same time of night but not every night. We have video of it and it is about three finger widths above mountain horizon, then within fifteen min either disappears or goes down until it is below mountain&#39;s horizon.  However we can still see the &#34;glow&#34; of its light coming from the horizon.  There are four witnesses to this. myself, husband, and our two daughters. It can be seen for miles and I believe it to be within our atmosphere, it does move, too fast to be a star or satellite, but also stays in the same place for the majority of its appearance. It dims and come back as well as descends.  It has no flashing lights nor other common aircraft lights. It is too far away to see exactly the lighting but we do see changing colors, blue, green, with white most steady; white/yellow headlight-like intensity.<n>

It appeared to be a football or egg-shape with bright white lights with a greenish tint underneath of it.  These lights revealed metallic &#34;legs&#34; underneath but a clear view of its underside was limited due to the intensity of the lights.  The craft didn&#39;t make a sound, even as I drove right under it.  I pulled into my driveway half a mile down and when I got onto the hill it had disappeared.  This is the third time I have seen a craft of similar shape and lights on this state route, a family member has also seen it twice.  I couldn&#39;t take a picture because of a car behind me.  I feel like reporting this is crazy, but I have seen things like this before.  The last time I saw it I had strange bruises on my arms and legs and an experience as though I missed time.  I was writing a report and next thing I knew it was over 45 minutes later.  This has been seen on the same road by multiple people.  I have friends that have seen it.  I think there should be someone looking in to this.<n>

But as I drove a bit more a third to the left then a another to the right appeared and I thought the shape to be a square when two more appeared and it was a rectangular shape of orange –ish lights.  I got out of my car to see it better and to determine if it was a plane or helicopter going to a near-by hospital.  I watched it move very slowly in formation. ….not making a sound and that is when I tried to take a picture.  My cell phone could not pick it up because of the darkness.  Then I tried to call my husband because I knew that this was nothing I could explain.  It was a bit cloudy that night but I thought this to be below the clouds. I could not detect a body to this phenomenom…only the lights …  The quiet or silence disturbed me.  It was directly overhead moving slowly…then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote Linda Moulton Howe to see if she had heard other reports.  The next day I called the sheriff’s department but no other reports.  I know that I saw something.  It was NOT the radio tower as I first thought for it is in another direction.  This had to have been over the Hiawatha Golf Course and moving to the northeast, possibly following state route 3.<n>

We all looked at what looked like a bright orange light In the sky.  It was moving funny.  The driver of the car said it maybe the top of a cell phone tower.  It kept getting higher.  The driver said were pulling over to get a better look at this.  We pulled off the road and all got out.  It was directly above us and was moving back and forth when it came to a dead stop.  It started to dim I&#39;n brightness and then shot off across the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not a big believer In UFO stuff and wouldn&#39;t belive this if I had not seen it with my own eyes.

And of course there reaction was (Rudolf)  Not until it completely disappeared a few seconds later did it really freak me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No way it was a plane the sky was clear and no obstructions in the way.  There was an airplane right behind it with its light flashing and no where near the speed of this object.<n>
12/8/13 20:30|Homosassa|FL|Light|15+ minutes|Unidentified Super Bright Light Ball.|12/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105167.html|611|ndxe201312| Unidentified Super Bright Light Ball<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 20:30 and 20:45 Eastern on December 8, 2013 I drove to the local grocery store. On the way there I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary in the sky.  Upon leaving the store, approximately 5 minutes later, I immediately noticed the brightest light I have ever seen in the night sky other than the moon in the same direction as I had just traveled not noticing anything.  I watched for a moment in the parking lot as it seems to pulse between orange and gold colors with very little motion. I decided since I lived near open water that I would drive to the water’s edge and get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove along the tree canopied roads it was hard to keep a good eye on but at one point it seemed that there was something that resembled a light beam from the bottom.  This made me think this was possibly a coast guard helicopter or something but continued to get the unobstructed view at the water’s edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise the object was no helicopter, completely silent and so bright that the light from it reflected clearly off the calm water.  I snapped the best picture I could with my phone but it is obviously not made for detail at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was located WNW of Homosassa, FL, with a slight drift toward the south. Low elevation, 1000-1500 ft max would be my best guess.  If it was more then a few miles offshore it would have had to be of massive size based on the sheer amount of light being produced. Slight color changes between a golden yellow and orange happened periodically but not in a certain amount of time.  Weather was 80 degrees, wind under 5mph and variable, crystal clear skies.<n>

I estimate one mile away at most but, I think more like a half mile and a couple hundred feet altitude, doing it&#39;s dim-bright-dim-out-dim-bright routine again.  I know now, there are few houses back there, most are further north, south, or west of where this &#34;light&#34; hangs.  I watch for perhaps 5 minutes outside, come inside and continue to watch for another 10-15 minutes, watching off and on thereafter for sone time and finally give up, being starved, I go make dinner, thinking to myself, they&#39;re back...  I&#39;m glad, they are becoming like old friends, and after 3 years seeing these things, or maybe the same one! , it was like they were there just saying &#34;hey, we&#39;re here&#34;, like an old friend that drives past and toots their horn driving down your road, just to say hi.

I&#39;m use to jets, helicopters, and airplanes in the area most can be detected by their distinct noise trails, but this object was completely silent!  The size appeared small due to the distance I presume it had no smoke trail it flew perfectly straight at a speed that does mimic some known aircrafts but did not have the shape of know air vehicles.  fter the object passed maybe about five minutes later a jet passed in the same spot, but the jet was easily recognizable! It had a sound trail and that infamous white tail is smoke a little ways behind it, minutes after the first jet I saw another jet with the same features as the first one heading in the exact same direction of the UFO, as if the jet was going after the unidentified object, I video tapped th! e sy right after the UFO was spotted, I was so shocked, I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before today!!!<n>

I got up and went to the window to investigate.  I can clearly see them now, no backgrounds light, no people in the area.  As I was watching the they formed into a line and slowly moved away to the left and disappeared behind 2 vehicles.  I was completely stunned and blown away,  I wasn&#39;t really scared but more scared because I couldn&#39;t explain the lights.  Several minutes later i seen 2 cats and a dog walking the same area as the lights.<n>

Then I noticed more lights moving behind the first one.  There was a total of 4-5 lights moving slowly and close together in a straight line across the sky.  I opened my window to see if they were making any noise and they weren&#39;t.  After about a minute, they all disappeared except the one in front leading.  After about 30 seconds, that one disappeared as well.<n>

It almost looked like an orange sitting on top of a basketball rim from the other side of the court.  It stayed very still for about two seconds after I noticed it. It then proceeded to move down toward the road, with a slight angle to the right, at an incredible rate of speed for onky a second.  I imagine it was far away based on the size of it. In order for it move that distance.  It came to a dead stop right abobe the crest of the hill for two more seconds.

The attached pics and vids are taken from our front yard looking directly south. The property is located just northeast of Elliot and Val Vista Roads in Gilbert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, we saw an object streaking in the southeast sky heading west and descending in a diagonal trajectory.  It had a bright white light with a trailing tail and looked like a falling star, which is what I at first thought it was. It also appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object came to a stop at a position due south of our property and 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object held its position while emitting a significantly dimmer light. I originally thought that it was the spot where the falling star (meteor) had burnt out, but the light remained in the sky at the stopped position.  We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.  It traveled approximately 1/3 the distance to the ground and stopped. It then began heading east (horizontal to the earth).  At that point, the object was intensely bright and appeared to be emitting sparks very much like a fireworks display rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three additional objects did the same thing, creating a formation about 30 degrees above the horizon at a significant distance below and east of the original object.  They remained visible for several minutes, descending along looping trajectories until they disappeared below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The attached pics and vids are of the descending formation only.  We did not have the camera working in time to capture the activity that had happened before.<n>

They were flying In a  straight line eqidistance apart.  They had flashing red and white lights.  I could hear the faint rumble of an engine, but they didn&#39;t seem that high up because the lights were so visible.  They weren&#39;t moving that fast.   I thought it odd they were in such a straight line, so close together in jet stream of each other and moving slowly.  They appeared to be coming from the South going north.  I figured they possibly could be coming from Beale AFB.  It just appeared strange being in formation like that, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 10 to 15 lights that normally I would have taken them to be stars but given the color of the sky at the time, and the fact that they were an unusual color and standing out so much I don&#39;t think they could have been stars.  They were positioned much closer to the horizon and given the color of the sky behind them they couldn&#39;t have been stars.  I looked higher up and located a normal star and it was much whiter in color.  I drove my car up further on the road I was on, I looked for them again and they were all gone, I couldn&#39;t locate 1 of them.  If they were stars I would have been able to see them again.<n>

Opposite of the unindentified flying objects, were four military planes (fighter jets) flying in formation, one after another at a high rate of speed.  The planes were monitoring the objects from a distance.  Aircraft altitude unknown, although flying low approximately 2000 feet agl.  UFO&#39;s were disc shaped and had bright lights similar to Xenon headlights found on cars.  Towards the end of the sighting, the military planes flew over Nut Tree Airport and as soon as they curved around to ascend, the UFO&#39;s vanished quickly within a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have never done anything like this, but I cannot explain what I saw.  The video is decent that I took with my phone.  This was no plane and definitely not the setting sun hitting an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Middle of the day, decent skies, up about 6 stories. It was all black, we thought it was the new amazon drone, but realized they weren&#39;t doing that currently. It had the same build, but different style. It was bulkier with thicker arms going into the propellers and had a smaller central body then the amazon drone.  Although I suppose its possible, I doubt its a toy. We were going 25-30mph through the back of a subdivision along the marsh and it passed us with no trouble and we eventually lost sight of it. I&#39;d say it was going between 35-50 mph. I just cant think of a kids toy that could do this.<n>

It was not a street lamp after looking more closely as it was higher in the sky.  It was not the moon or a plane and was bright orange and a large bright light.  I was able to take a picture and after showing other people, they agree, they do not know what it is and say its not a street lamp or the moon.<n>

It was an odd time, so I went to my bedroom window. We have a minor view of the NYC skyline during winter when no leaves block view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw some of the city lights per usual.  The cityis probably 25-30 miles away. There was one green colored circular/oval shaped but the light its self was more apparent.I noticed it and though maybe its just a light from Plainfied or somewhere closer because this was no more than 5 miles away.  Next thing I notice is the object/light hovering and then slowly movinng straight upwords maybe 500-1000 ft and at that moment it did a bunch of zig zag,right angle, non-coonventional jet movements.  It then came to a stop and hovered for about 10 seconds. And simply disapperared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thought that was it when I looked leftward ou t the windo and now there are new organge/yellow objects.  There were two of them, identical looking. They didn’t move fast but far sideways while the other stood still. Then the one came back placed itself next to the still one which then move straight up and straight left, right angled. Then, both in a colum moved up and down until they became more near eachother and dissapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hate hoaxes I sware this is what I saw I don’t even know how to play thricks, I don’t have a smartphone, camera, video recorderk etc.   I am really hopinn for some corrabaration and a call if posssible. These wer not stars, not nyc lights, nothing like that, way to close. I hope somone else saw, but I don’t care if no one believes me, family only wouldn’t tell others. I know what I saw and that is the most amazing thing I have ever seen no doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please give me a call or email Back. Thanks much.<n>

My balcony faces toward the west and this craft(s) was coming from the east and headed west, I was only able to view after it was over my buildings eve, but through the entire western sky over the west hills of Portland. It was unlike any aircraft I have seen in over 4 years of living in this apartment.  The lights were constant in brightness and duration with no flashes or blinking, not like any plane, jet, helicopter or thing I have seen.  If you could imagine for idea of position of the lights, the face of a clock; one light was at 12 o&#39;clock and one was in the 5 o&#39;clock position.  They stayed in these positions relative to one another the entire time I saw them. They moved on a path not like any aircraft I have seen, moving east to west, slightly dropping to the south before moving back to the north as it was traveling east to west the whole time.  With solid white-yellow lights the entire time.  Many aircraft travel over view from my balcony from the 3rd floor, news and law enforcement helicopters; private, freight, and commercial planes and this was not the same.  It had no &#34;noise&#34; or sound relative to anything I have observed.  It lasted about 45 seconds to 1 minute total.  I think it was about 1000&#39;-1500&#39; in the sky based on all other helicopters and planes/jets I view on a daily basis.<n>

Two very brilliant red lights, below cloud cover, seemed to be hovering over the land fill to my left.  They were stationary because as I continued north to the stoplight that leads to the entrance of the land fill, I was getting closer to them and the angle changed. When I stopped at the stoplight they were pretty close, still brilliant red, no blinking--one was higher than the other at about a 45 degree angle.  I noticed that the driver in the vehicle to my right (I was in left lane) was looking at them too.  Before our light turned green the two lights suddenly and in completely coordinated fashion, accelerated quickly to the north and disappeared.  I&#39;ve been living in this area for some time and am familiar with the various helicopters and small planes that frequent the area.  (There is a small private airport about five miles south of where the sighting occurred).  I&#39;ve never seen any! thing quite like this before.<n>

At first I thought they were planes, but they seemed to be in a formation that I did not believe a passenger airline would use and the red light was uncommon. Then I thought they were potentially missiles because they were moving so fast, but they all disappeared. I am not sure if they just vanished or they were traveling so fast that it just went out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies are dark but clear. I can see stars clearly and these were not stars or shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights resemble what was captured in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwpHT18pJYE&amp;feature=youtu.be - the main difference was that the 4 lights were all lined up, one after another.<n>

The size of the circle must have been near a quarter mile, it lit up the entire sky.  The light first flashed blue then green then cut off like someone turned off a light switch.  The light was clearly coming from above/behind the storm clouds.  We continued to walk in shock and saw the light once again a few miles further East about 30minutes later.

They were in a triangle formation.  They hung in one spot for a few seconds, so we thought they were helicopters.  The U hospital is in that direction so it seemed logical.  Then the lights began to ascend straight upward.  Two more lights of the same color appeared below the first three.  For a few seconds the five lights glowed together.  We watched in wonder trying to figure this out.   The original three soon ascended more and one-by-one became more faint until they disappeared.   My boyfriend lost interest, but I stepped outside to observe the other two.   Like the first three, they too ascended and disappeared.  There was no sound.<n>

For some reason I took my flash light and began too sed a messeage in morse code.the huge red light in the center which was not there before answered back.I said hi and it answered back with another hi back at me.I was going too try and ask somemore questions when I heard theses jet planes coming fast.one minute it was there a second it was gone before my eyes<n>

About 20 min. later there was what appeared to be a meteor, a large falling fiery object with a tail like an over sized shooting star.<n>

Have seen these orange colored ball UAP&#39;s before and like the others it faded out before disappearing completely.  The altitude of this one seemed quite a bit higher than the others though; if I had to take a guess I&#39;d say between 6,000 and 9,000 ft.  Checked the website flightaware and there were no aircraft in the area heading NE, or N or E for that matter.  Checked again a few minutes later still no aircraft on that flight course.<n>

It started North above Pearl Harbor Military base.  Moved West towards Waianae/Lualualei Naval Base. It then Dropped down what had to be a Mile or so, and then Continued west again.  I had Binoculars with 24x zoom but the light of the object overwhelmed the visual.  I have a 11 second clip on my phone which shows just a speck, but worth analizing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a copy to  Earthfiles and one to Coast to coast Am.  When I was returning from my smoke break, and already describing this to a Leutenat of mines (non Military- Law Enforcement Related), a Military Plane was spotted going in the direction the Object faded to. I wouldnt say faded. It blinked out of Vision as if it sped off.  Clear Sky in the area it traveled. The start of this was Right next to Venus.  This is why I noticed it in the first place.<n>

I heard a strange sound that seemed to be a mix between very distant bells and a long drawn out low trumpet sound.  At some point I looked up into the sky at the snow fall and spotted a black circle.  It almost seemed as if it were turning slowly left then 30 seconds later to the right, as if a satellite dish would do when searching for transponders. Each time the sound would resonate into the night like a pulse.  There was what looked like a faint red light in the middle of the circle, that part was hard to tell, it could have been me trying to focus through the snow, but I for certain stared at this black circle that is no longer there, so it was not a shadowed fixture from a tower, something was there.  It was in the South Eastern sky just south of Tulsa University.<n>

We have been together for 3 years. He is a believer in UFOs, I was a skeptic until now.  We had been seeing strange orbs in the same spot for about 3 months prior to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first saw one UFO hovering fairly close to the ground. It was a disk shaped sort of orb of glowing amber light and seemed to be emitting light straight down as it flew higher into the air. When we stopped to observe this UFO it suddenly changed shape to look like an airplane with blue and red flashing lights. It then rapidly came towards our parked car, moving towards us and closer to the ground. At this point we drove away and it stayed hovering right above our car. Looking up, I noticed it had changed shape yet again. It had a large center mass with blinking blue and red lights and two huge wing-like protrusions coming off of the center mass.  The underside was covered with panels of light, much like the light of a cool white LED.  The light panels were also gridded, like looking up at  fluorescent office lights.  We then turned to try to get away and the UFO flew further away, and rapidly changed flight direction. It stayed the same distance away but followed us in the sk! y as we drove down the street.  It was still blinking red and blue but suddenly two black clouds came out of either side of this UFO.  Once we changed directions again, so did the UFO.  The next we saw it, a few seconds later, it was back to its glowing amber appearance and was about 10 miles away, hovering with two other orbs right near the downtown Minneapolis skyline.  The orbs stayed there hovering until we stopped looking at them and came home.<n>

Probably right down the street at about the only location we realy know about there. someone used to spook us when we walked by that house as a kid.  The aliens seem to remind us recently of things that we had thought of and forgot.  They help you to remember the scary things so you can forget them because when we originally thought of them we forgot without thinking of it and becoming unscared of it.  It was something scary and they helped us remember it so we wouldn&#39;t be scared no more so we can put it out of our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the helicopter flew real real low by the house someone told us on the  phone day before yesterday.  It had happened the day before and they had just got a real real weird phone call about 15 minutes before we called.  It had real real weird static on the line they said and they hung up. It wasn&#39;t usual and hadn&#39;t happened ever before.  Don&#39;t know what color the helicopter was or much on how the call sounded.  They said the helicopter flew real real low and the call was real real weird though.  They said it was an airlift because of a car crash.  They said it landed down the street first - flew weird though.  The car crash idea was probably just something they thought of to make sense of it. It surely wasn&#39;t one and at first they just said that it was a real weird helicopter flying strange and landed.  They didn&#39;t mention a car crash.  Didn&#39;t mention the main road.  They mentioned a weird flying helicopter is what it was.  And nothing of any cars or anything like that- just that it ! had landed. So the other story of the car wreck and air-lift was not realy what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought of a helicopter that flew by here low recently and voices said they&#39;d make one fly low there, too.  They said it&#39;d be the Hells Angles outlaw motorcycle gang- just like flew by here many times very low outside our window.  That is how they do death threats- they are a mafia organization. So, then the voices said aliens fly by and land down street in helicopter and you just think of an air lift due to a car crash would be why they&#39;d land like that. Helicopters landed down the street here before, too. But the voices said landing there and aliens or mafia and that they knew a car wreck would happen or they would cause it to happen. Realy, it may have been aliens or else the hell&#39;s angel&#39;s mafia organization maybe - perhaps possessed by aliens and landed there. Don&#39;t know what it looked like or what the occupant&#39;s looked like. It landed so that is unusual. The call was weird- at same time the mafia calls there daily which would be when we woke up the day before. They ca! ll and tell lies on the phone because that is mafia activity. They lie on the phone and tell them the same things we said the day before at the same time we said them the day before. It is meant to make them trust them- sound familiar to the person so they trust a stranger. The hell&#39;s angel&#39;s do lot&#39;s of murders for money and that is what that is. They work with other mafia organizations, too such as Georgia mafias which is what some of them are out there. So, the aliens called the next day, too and did weird noises on the phone. Static maybe copying that song by the band who did &#39;love shack&#39; because we thought of that song other day, too. Maybe aliens put the song in our mind. B-52&#39;s is the band name. Channel Z song- maybe we used to think the song was ufo&#39;s or something related to it like ufo&#39;s contating you telepatically. The aliens may have reminded us of that idea that we&#39;d never have remembered otherwise. don&#39;t know if we ever thought that realy. Or we used to think t! v&#39;s were weird or something- like the film Poltergeist. The vo! ices may be were helping us forget soemthign that scared us though by reminding us that we thought of it and forgot it before we calmed down over it. So we could remember it and forget it. So they landed and just basically also annoying us with voices and scaring us. It was a helicopter, but it maybe was aliens and it landed- don&#39;t know if it was black. Rape is associated with a ufo landing spot where an alien was sighted in the vicinity. It landed and one was sighted apparently at least. If it was the mafia or not we don&#39;t know, but that itself is ufo related because it&#39;s alien related because aliens have something to do with a gang that kills thousands of innocent people every year - mostly in the southern us. They work with other mafia organizations, too though a whole lot- we know because we have seen them. And they are international, too a-lot we know because we have seen that, too. We&#39;ll have to ask about the color of the helicopter and what the occupant/s looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They abdolutely did not at first say it was a car crash and air-lift via helicopter. They said it flew by real real low! It had landed down the street! And all you could figure out is why they&#39;d do that would be an air-lift to the hospital from a car crash maybe on the main road. Why else would it be there? Is it legal to land personal helicopters wherever you want like that? In a residential neighborhood and flying that low- they said it was terribly low. We&#39;ve seen low planes before because we have seen ufo&#39;s before and aliens flying low. This was even lower apparently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Real real weird static on the phone the next day and they hung up the phone they said. So it&#39;s not normal and it does not even sound like a prank call. I have got calls from ET&#39;s before and here we have stopped answering the phone. The alien/s called maybe just to freak us out seems like and they may have been ordered to phone us up from time to time like it&#39;s their job by a top alien. We heard a voice saying they&#39;d be a weird call and there was- with static real weird on it- and it was. The day before we had tried to call out there and they were on the phone to the mafia. The mafia calls and lies and tells them things we said day before at the same time they call there the next day. It&#39;s to gain trust and they had called and were on the phone lieing to them out there to make them think they have something in common with them- to sound familiar so they will put their guard down and trust them when they shouldn&#39;t. So calling people like that would cause ET&#39;s to get there beca! use the mafia is doing very violent type of thing by doing that. ET&#39;s being evil have something to do with it. So there&#39;s the mafia and also we don&#39;t usually call out there and we recalled that. Aliens maybe wanted to remind us of that and how bad it was coz they hate us out there of course. We had to call though because there was important business needed done and you can&#39;t do it in 2 minutes once a week here in town realy. We had to do things about buying groceries, clothes and everything and we had to call. They maybe wanted to remind us - did we get mad and freak out and say we weren&#39;t calling and to remind us to calm down over whatever we maybe thought on that whole thing if we heard voices on it or whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard about it via the voices 1st, they saw it and surely many others saw it there in the town. Aliens could fly a helicopter and even abduct people or animals onto them and make people think it was an air-lift.<n>

The next day a strange phone call at 5:30 pm central time zone- lots of weird static on line.  We weren&#39;t there, but voices told us about that- they said they&#39;d do that and it happened apparently. someone told us on the phone about that stuff.  They said it was an air lift due to car wreck, but the aliens would say that&#39;s what it&#39;d be, too. ***(The aliens did say that- they said they&#39;d land... air-lift something or other.  That it&#39;d be an air lift due to car crash, but there probably wasn&#39;t a car crash.  If it was it would been on the main road there probably since it&#39;s a 1 road town.  There&#39;s such things as air-lifts, but it flew real low and there was a strange call the next day.  The call was aliens for sure and if a car crashed they knew about it and told us first or they did it.  But, first she didn&#39;t mention a car crash- just low flying helicopter and said that&#39;s what it was.  Just like we thought of it shortly before that happened a few days before- day or so before.  We thought aliens landing or something- someone flying low by- which the mafia has did that here- flying low by the window out there following us down the hall while someone came out the stairs and also followed us at the same time.  The voices said aliens in a helicopter land and then said - it&#39;s probably an air-lift from a car crash.  So you&#39;d think it&#39;s that, but maybe it wasn&#39;t because why would a helicopter land down the street? They - the voices may have said -make the mafia fly low over the house there since they did that here once at least and we saw them out there. Hells Angels International mafia organization did that here. They talk to the mafia - they told us they were on the phone with the mafia day before or recently- the mafia woman calls daily she said there. She talks to the mafia out there on the phone and they moved in next door and into her house even- that area. So, we were par! anoid maybe and just thought of the helicopters something and ! then tha t happened- and the voices, but it may have been aliens in the helicopter. We&#39;ll have to ask what color it was. They were mystified about that at first and the car crash theory was probably not real and just somethign they made up to explain it. The call the next day was very strange with real weird static and it was about same time we got up day before which was when the mafia woman would call out there every day and lie on the phone. So we had tried to call and it was busy and it was just static and they said they hung the phone us. they said it sounded real real weird and that it hasn&#39;t happened before and it&#39;s not a normal regular type of prank call they get out there or anything.) You may think that coz why else would it land, but that was aliens in the helicopter realy and on the phone. The aliens seem to be reminding us a lot recently of things that we thought of and then forgot before we had a chance to calm down over it to make the voices go away. so they were just ! helping us to make the voices go away and spooking us by telling us they were going to do those things and then doing them. don&#39;t know if it was black helicopter or not. it landed also by a house that we thought of - probably there- that is down the street. they said it landed down the street. So, it was the house that someone used to tease us about when we were little kids saying the woman who lived there was a  witch. We recalled that other day and when we were little it scard us a lot and gave us nightmares. The voices reminding us that we were scared is what they did when we thought of that we freaked out and they landed to remind us of that apparently that it was scary. The woman was out in broad daylight if she was a witch she&#39;d been hiding late at night- she wasn&#39;ta  witch. The other woman just said that being weird - she said - see that old woman out there with them shakers banging on them trashcans- she&#39;s a witch. We&#39;d run and get scared- we were real little babies! only then. She was just playing moracas and banging on the tr! ashcans because it sounded musical kinda. She was unable to haul off the trashcans- large metal tranh containers kinds with the lids on top in metal-metal barrels. The woman thought she was sexy smoking cigaretttes and they&#39;d walk around the block and she&#39;d tease us kids like that. She&#39;d walk around the block smoking those and say that when we went by that house. A helicopter flew over the house real low and landed down the street. The next day a strange phone call at 5:30 pm central time zone- lots of weird static on line. We weren&#39;t there, but voices told us about that- they said they&#39;d do that and it happened apparently. someone told us on the phone about that stuff. They said it was an air lift due to car wreck, but the aliens would say that&#39;s what it&#39;d be, too.

When we were on County Road 12 and approaching an intersection, I noticed a bright star that was above the stoplight.  This so called &#34;star&#34; was much lower then stars normally are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our car approached the intersection more, two lights came to view beside the so called &#34;star&#34;.  The light on the right was bright blue and the light on the left was bright red.  As we were almost on the intersection, the lights moved towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were at the stoplight the lights passed directly above us and when I looked up I noticed they were in a triangular formation and in between the lights that formed the points of the triangle was a dark mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me this proved that what I was seeing was a solid ship.  This ship silently passed over us and kept going behind us.  The ship then made a right turn and was currently not clearly visible because of the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three minutes later when we went further down the same road and I looked to my right and saw the same lights from a side view moving very quickly through the sky.  The lights then disappeared.<n>

A white object was approaching the formation from the west and below at an angle of approximately 45°.  At first I thought it might be another goose joining the formation, but I’ve never seen a “white goose” so I thought that it could be a seagull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I tried to get a better look at it, I couldn’t distinguish any appendages such as wings or head, it appeared to be spherical in shape with what looked like a mirror sort of reflection flashing randomly, nothing like a wing with regular features or motion.  Its size appeared to be similar to a goose or seagull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object started to get close to the geese, their formation became erratic and the typical “V” became chaotic while it appeared that they were trying to regroup but were unable to.  The white object reached a point close to the geese–with the direction of the flock being east and referring to the direction of flight as 12:00, the white object stayed at approximately an 8:00 position close to the group, but not inside, now moving as if it were part of the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to adjust my vision to see the white object as a bird considering that my eyes were, “playing tricks” with my perception, but I just couldn’t see anything but a sphere.    After a minute or so, the entire flock including the white sphere “disappeared”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no obstructions or clouds to block my vision, but I moved around to different positions to try to get a different perspective because at this point I wasn’t really considering something unusual happening.  What really held my attention was the thought that I was seeing some sort of albino goose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took a few minutes after the flock of geese disappeared that it struck me that something more unusual was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no unusual sounds or other objects, no aircraft of any type were in the area from my perspective.  The sky was clear with high visibility.  Only the geese and the white object were seen.  The approximate location was: 34° 17’ 39” N, 118° 41’ 42” W (from Google Earth). Unknown Altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don’t want to jump to any conclusions.  I’m sure that there may be an explanation that just hasn’t occurred to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and interest.  If there is a simple (or any) explanation, I would be very appreciative to find out what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking from the South facing North and slightly East. They were flying East. I was the only (1) witness. I&#39;m happy to answer any more questions and very much appreciate your work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

While getting things out of my car trunk for a night walk up the canyon, I looked to the SE over the very eastern edge of SE Tucson and saw a bright orange light about 3 times the size of Venus in the night sky.  The light was  self contained, laser precision and didn&#39;t have the star burst glare of plane headlights.  Even though it was self contained and was not emitting a flame in any way, it had the characteristics of being somewhat on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light proceeded towards me from about 10 miles away and then turned and went up into the cloud layer above the nearby Rincon Mtns.  The event lasted about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a few seconds later another identical light appeared from behind a nearby hill again to the SE of me but farther west than the first object.  It seemed to be coming up right out of the city itself since it started so low.  Again it travelled somewhat towards me and then went up gradually in the clouds above the Rincons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had my binoculars out and noted that it had no running lights or any other colored lights around it.  This one took about one minute from start to finish of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then yet another one appeared even farther to the west but this time was seen IN FRONT OF a very small hill just 2 to 3 miles away.  It then proceeded for 1 minute to climb up into the cloud layers above the Rincons traveling for one minute or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind other than a mile zephyr breeze of 1 to 2 miles an hour.  All of these objects travelled several miles of sky in less than a minute each thus ruling out Chinese lanterns.  Also, it rules out that they came from Davis Monthan AFB since the last light was seen starting its course in front of the hill just a couple miles from me and also the AFB is located farther west from where the first 2 came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound emitted from any of these objects.  I saw the last object VERY clearly through my binoculars and it had no running lights as noted with the 2nd one as well.<n>

Hard to tell their exact shape.  At about 30 degrees off the eastern horizon (closest intersection Higgins and Huntington) I saw a huge flash of bright yellow/white light.  The flash was so bright it illuminated the whole sky and the outside as if it were daylight but only for a few milliseconds.  Then about 2 minutes later I saw the exact same thing.  No sounds produced.  No known aircraft (presently cloudy, drizzling).  If I hadn&#39;t already been looking out the window trying to figure out the first flash I would have missed the second one.  One thing to note although probably not related, was at the exact moment of only the first flash there was a single dog bark.<n>

We watched it thinking it was an airplane but the lights did not blink or strobe.  As we were looking at it it got lower to the point where our car actually went ahead of the object ( this is how i could tell it was low because if it was high like an airplane we wouldn&#39;t have been able to pass it and to where the angle we had to look at it had to change ).  We stopped, now questioning what we were seeing.  The object continued to move past us ( to my view it was moving to my right and I was sitting in the passenger seat of the car, looking out the drivers side window) until suddenly, and i mean INSTANTLY, stopped and shot away into the other direction (away from our car, to the left of my view, and towards the rear of where our car was faced).<n>

12/4/13 10:30|Jacksonville|FL|Cigar|10 minutes|Some type of rocket launch.|12/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105087.html|702|ndxe201312| some type of rocket launch<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside yesterday at approximately 10:30 AM.  We heard a loud noise that sort of sounded like a jet.  But it went on so long that I started looking for it.  Then, to me, it started sounding more like a rocket.  I looked in the direction of the Kennedy space center as I often watch launches from there.  And there was indeed what looked like a rocket.  I enjoy trying to catch the take offs from my area when the weather is nice.  So I am usually familiar with what is taking off when because I try to watch for them.  (And sometimes photograph them)  I remembered that SpaceX had tried to take off early in the week and had been delayed but I thought it took off that night before on Dec. 3.    When I got home I did searches and could NOT find anything about any launches at Kennedy. I also checked the schedule of launches from Kennedy and other than one later this month there was nothing scheduled after the Dec. 3 SpaceX launch that had happened the night prio! r.  So after lots of digging I have yet to find anything about this launch.  My guess is it&#39;s unpublished NASA launch of a spy satellite or something.  But it definitely was a rocket launch and looked very much like it would if it were from Kennedy Space center. Also immediately after there seemed to be a lot of activity at the NAS Jax. (Tons of military jet planes) The area I was in 32256 is very close to the NAS base (just across the river from it), however, the &#34;launch&#34; was coming from the coast in the South eastern direction.  Again this is the exact direction I have previously watched many NASA launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did find, after lots of digging this video-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRzshn_8QI&amp;list=FLgk_WMPAW3xQhP2N9OtTnMA&amp;index=1 .  It sounds and looks just like the launch I witnessed.  (Although I witness, obviously, from a much greater distance).  It was LOUD though even from our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ground level &amp; moving closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night. First time back in a week from Jamaica.  Me &amp; my sis hot boxed outside around 1am, when all of a sudden I noticed I bright light. &amp; then I noticed a second blue light. It was not as bright. It was jus a blue light. I didn’t say anythin to my sister for a while I jus watched the blue light until it disappeared &amp; appeared again. I still didn’t say anything until the first light got brighter then it would lesson it’s brightness. It wasn’t someone walking with a flashlight but they were gettin closer. So I asked my sister “is that a plane?” She says no it’s too bright nd it’s not moving. All of a sudden the blue light comes back &amp; I asked her did she see it. She saw it. &amp; it disappeared again. &amp; that’s when I was confused as to what I was seeing. We’re these people ? I haven’t hot boxed that spot in a week. So many questions unanswered. The brightest light was gettin closer &amp; we refused to leave becuz our eyes were amazed. We saw the same thing. We de! cided to run as fast as we could to the house because it wasn&#39;t in the air it was more ground level at this point. I wanted to get my Canon t3i with my 55-250mm lens to record &amp; get a better look but my sister didn&#39;t want me to go back out there.<n>

As I was looking up at the stars between throws, I glimpsed what I thought was a shooting star, I gazed back and found it again and realized it was actually an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed right away that it did not have the typical green and red lights, and nothing was blinking.  I have flown planes so am very familiar with their patterns, speeds, sounds, etc.  This was truly strange because of only the very dim red lights on each side of the aircraft, because of its high rate of speed and because it was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no way to tell the size or speed, because I couldn’t really tell what I was looking at, there was absolutely no sound at all.  I can only approximate what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that it was traveling above Interstate 5 in a Southern direction at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet above the ground and at a speed of roughly 700 mph.  I would approximate the aircraft to be about 75’ wide, no idea of length…very dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a completely sane individual and am just very interested in finding out what the heck it was that I saw.  I am guessing that maybe it is an electric drone practice run..?  but again, nor typical navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope someone out there saw it also, and maybe has an answer for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw a sudden flash of 2 large orange lights over west Tucson and then a minute later I saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later I looked to where the western edge of the Catalina Mtns meets the edge of NW Tucson which was about 25 miles from my position and I saw a large, bright orange light suddenly &#34;turn on&#34; similar to a light switch being turned on.  A half second later another on came on just a short distance in the sky to the left of the first and then a third all staying on at the same time and in a straight line.  They were just above the horizon line but clearly in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were about 5 times the size of Venus in the night sky and were not emitting the star burst glare of a plane headlight but were more self contained and laser precision.  From seeing videos of the Phoenix Lights incident from the 1990&#39;s these lights turned on in progression similar to those.  I saw them for no more than a couple of seconds and then they all &#34;switched off&#34; at the same time.<n>

My sighting sounds just like last night&#39;s in Davenport, FL, except that I live in Clermont (the next town north of Davenport), and it happened Tuesday night 12/3/13, around 7:45 pm EST while I was sitting in my backyard.  The UFO was traveling from north to south in the area west of highway 27! I actually saw it go down for a minute (then it got blocked from view by my neighbors large house), and then it came back up after a minute. It traveled a little more and disappeared.  It was flashing colors from orange to red.  Around the same time a jet airliner with bright red lights showed up.  I found another report from 7/20/13 in Davenport, FL, reporting the same thing, including the jet airliner that came from east to west.  The details were identical to mine!  I saw several other UFOs around the same time also flashing orange to red, but the one that went down and then up really caught my attention because there are no airports in that area; so I wondered where on earth he could be going if he was going down to land.  Orlando airport is east of us, the direction the jet came from, but the ufo was in the west.  Nothing there but empty fields.<n>

The sky was about 30 percent overcast.  There were several aircraft in the area, as is usually the case because of two nearby airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:15 I noticed a relatively small, deep orange “fireball” traveling horizontally north to south, about 40 degrees above the horizon, and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet or less, substantially lower than most aircraft in the area.  This object appeared to be of exactly the same size of the one I recently reported in “Sighting #30” and was traveling at least two, maybe 3 times faster than any aircraft I’ve seen.  I first noticed the object when in was straight out in front of me, due west.  It’s size was that of an average size star, whereas most all others I&#39;ve seen are the size of a pea held at arm’s length, and as bright or brighter than Venus at it’s brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it through my binoculars for around 7 to 10 seconds, when it changed color to a solid white, and then split in two, with the light on the right being up at an angle of around 45 degrees from the one below.  Without binoculars it looked like a single light.  I watched It through my binocs for another 10 seconds or so as it continued moving south until it faded out of sight because it moved so far away from me.  There was no other activity for the following 45 minutes.<n>

I went outside on the front porch, and the light was maybe 25 degrees above the SW horizon and stationary.  It was much brighter than any star I have ever seen.  My wife and 2 neighbor kids said they could see blue sparkles around it.  I could not (too old).  Over the next 30 minutes it slowly moved to the WSW until it passed beyond the trees.  The total movement from my point of view was very slight over that time.  Because I could still see it by going upstairs, we could estimate its height over distance by considering the relative position of the object from the 2 viewing positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only possible alternative explanation would be a police helicopter, but one would expect it to move at some point or see the light move if it was searching for someone.  No sounds were heard by any of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because we could clearly see jets flying between NY and Atlanta passing above it, I would estimate the height at 5-20K feet, perhaps 3-10 miles distant, which would place it near or above Silver Spring, MD, if any other reports come in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If interested, I have a picture taken from inside my home using a flash to orient the position in the sky.  The light can be seen through a window even with the flash!<n>

Traffic was very slow, I was able to observe this for sufficient amount of time to confirm that it was an unusual sight, it was a clear dark sky with no other distracting interference.<n>

It was right before dark but the cloud was glowing bright.  Everybody stopped and looked up at the sky, in which it was about twenty or more outside playing basketball.  The head of the glowing smoke was bright white, forming a circle.  The object was so bright that it had an outer layer, like the moon when it brightens the night sky.  It was partly cloud outside also and you could see the gray clouds.  When cloudy sometimes the moon glows through the clouds and show a circle through.  I know it&#39;s a name for this but I&#39;m trying to explain that the object was so bright it had this same image as the moon shows.  The object turned to the left and we could see like a burst of white flame coming from the back of the object, rocket boosters or some sort of engine.  This was the part that made us all hold are heads.......the object stop and the flame wasn&#39;t there anymore, but 2 small orange circular objects flew from the white object.  The objects formed a horizontal line with the white object on top and its like they just cruised the air until they all disappeared.  I Guy took a video on his phone and everybody that saw it was looking at each other like what just happened.  I mean this thing looked like a white ball of smoking glowing flame cruising the sky.  I Have seen the object before but it didn&#39;t stay as long as it did this time in Memphis, TN, about a year ago.  It appeared and zoomed arcoss the sky in matter of seconds.  This one today wanted to be seen and it blew people&#39;s minds because we couldn&#39;t believe what we saw.<n>

The sky was blue, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the end of our driveway, so I walked back to my husband and jokingly asked “is that a UFO?”  By the time I turned around, the object had turned west and changed to a cigar shaped object that we could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went in the house for his binoculars.  The object made no sound, was moving fairly slowly, and was too high up to be a helicopter.  An airplane was also in the sky to the east and south of, and higher in the sky than, the object, moving west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my husband looked at the object with his binoculars, he said it was like an elongated oval, with a thinner elongated oval above it but not seeming to be attached to it.  He did not see any lights on it, and said the color was off-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The longitude/latitude of the sighting was 30°15’05.04”N / 98°03’47.86”W and the object was probably 2000 ft. high or more.<n>

It looked like a ball of green fire that got bigger as it got closer to the earth.

I actually saw it on Dec. 2nd, not the 3rd.  Also, someone in the valley saw a very similar thing and posted the pics in Coast to Coast around the same time.  I will include the pics, as it is what we saw, but we saw it at night)  My wife and I were watching a noisy helicopter hovering two blocks away.  After turning away for a moment, I saw a flaming orange and red shape hovering roughlyidqay between is and the chopper.  The glowing flaming object was about 1/2 way between us and the helicopter, just above the tree line, now abot 3/4 of a city block from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright object was amorphous, I could see flames rising from parts of it.  The shape was rather fluid, morphing a bit like mercury, changing shapes.  It it looked a Bit like a pair of wings to me at times, my wife saw a triangle as well, as did I, as it flowed smoothly into different forms of bright glowing orange red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perfectly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not an airplane, drone, chopper, or toy hover craft or miniature chopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered, came towards us a bit, dipped down 20 degrees, swung due west, and eventually arced up steeply and went black or vanished abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night in the Pico - Robertson area of Los Angeles, near 8 pm The object was most dramatic and out of place, yet- no one seemed to notice oneoremlight in the sky.  As I pointed it out to my wife, it seemed to flow a bit brighter, and definately moved innocently a bit closer to us, or rather in our direction, and seemed to present a bit of a flourish In our direction as it made its exit, in a steep upward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like firey glowing wings a good bit, which is meaningful to me personally; also, my Wife is an Indian Tribal member, and her tribes name translates as &#34;Keepers of the Fire&#34;.<n>

They were travelling in the same direction and one was in front of the other.  I can’t say how large they were or how far apart they were due to the distance.  However, they appeared to be travelling over the Indian Hills area in North Eastern Jefferson County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were floating Chinese lanterns, but I determined that they could not be lanterns due to the speed at which they were travelling.  They seemed to glow orange/gold and flicker sporadically.  I immediately took out my iPhone camera and videotaped the lights, but they were so small in the video.  I then noticed that there was another light in front of the other two, also travelling the same direction.  As I ran up to the house, the first light faded into the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached the house, my daughter joined me outside and she also captured video of the two remaining objects.  As the 2 closest ones were starting to fade into the clouds, one final light appeared through the trees, following the previous three.  We both agreed that these were not a normal aircraft that we are familiar with;  UFOs by definition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where the objects appeared is close to the flight path that passenger jets use as they round into their landing pattern at the Louisville airport.  However, these lights appeared much lower than any jet would travel, and there was no sound.  There were no blinking lights on the objects, just the occasional flickering.  The objects appeared as if they were completely illuminated; glowing.  They were close enough to see that they had some mass, not just a light in the sky.  But I couldn’t determine how large they were.  And they all had the same steady pace and straight flight.  I wouldn’t say they were speeding across the sky, but they were travelling faster than wind would carry the objects.  Also, the wind was travelling ESE (1 mph) and these objects were travelling NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could submit my video, but you can only see 2 pinpoints of light, not any of the details that I described.  I haven&#39;t seen my daughter&#39;s video yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen comets, meteors and satellites and I know these objects were none of those things. I’ve never been a big believer in UFOs but I didn’t disbelieve either.  What we saw tonight isn’t something that would make me say that we definitely saw alien craft, but I can say it was very strange and unlike anything that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

I had just finished getting over the grade when I had no choice to but notice a large bluish light just above the santa monica mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was directly in front of my view and I&#39;m sure the other cars next to me saw it too.  After around five seconds of seeing this, the bluish light pulsated and tripled it&#39;s size.  Almost looked like a star gate was about to open up.  Then it quickly went back to its original shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, three more similarly colored lights with the same shape appeared to its left in perfect order, but in a somewhat curved shape (like a smile).  It also looked like it could&#39;ve been either a large object firing on all its lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After around 20 seconds, the light simply dimmed and it was no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scoured various ufo reporting sites and came across a report that matches what I saw here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.theblackvault.com/m/events/view/-UFO-Holographic-like-bluish-lights-fly-over-Burbank-California<n>

It was a clear night at dusk.  There was still some sunlight showing from behind the ridgeline.  Object shot straight up at least 3-400 feet.  Object left no apparent trail.  There was no sound.  At that height stayed there stationary for 3-4 minutes.  Then it started to descend very slowly making an “s” shape back and forth motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be a firework but when it got down to just above the ridge line it stopped descending and made a more exaggerated back and forth motion.  It stayed in that state for 7 to 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I could see the sphericalness to it and the colors of green, blue, and orange swirling around.  Can’t tell if the object itself was rotating.  It appeared solid and metallic.   There were no landing lights.  I estimate the object was the size of a mid-sized car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The locals wanted to locate it after it got below the ridgeline and we got in our car to look for it but there was nothing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 20 years’ experience in aviation repair.

Patrick Airforce Base is approximately 30 miles to my east/southeast, and the Kennedy Space Center approximately 12 miles due east.  As a result, I frequently see, and am familiar with all manner of small, private, single/multi-engine propeller and jet aircraft, as well as commercial and military aircraft.  Furthermore, I am familiar with their lighting and flight characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of December 2nd, 2013 at approximately 6:30 pm, I observed an unusual display of lights in the western sky as I was driving south on the street I live on, approaching my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was initially drawn to the &#34;object&#34; due to its unusual brilliance, purity of color(s), and size.  The object was located west/southwest of my position, about 45° above the horizon and appeared to be moving slowly towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was that it was simply a commercial flight from O.I.A. and that its &#34;unusual features&#34; were caused by flairing due to viewing it through the window glass.  However, I quickly dismissed this notion once I had exited my car and seen it with the naked eye, unobstructed by any glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be circular, about the size of a large pea held at arm&#39;s length.  It was an absolutely pure white, diamond-like brilliance I have never seen and, projecting downward from each side, at about a 45° angle, there was an i! ntense &#34;lazer-like&#34; blue beam.  These &#34;beams&#34; appeared about the diameter of the shaft of a round wooden toothpick, and the length appeared approximatelty equal to the diameter of the light.  I watched it for several minutes as it maintained it&#39;s approach at a very low speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have stood there all night watching it and tried to get a picture on my cell phone, but my father-in-law was seriously, in the hospital, and we were rushing to try to get to the hospital to see him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I simply cannot get that image out of my mind, it was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this account helps in some small way the effort to finally get an answer as to what these things are that so many people around the world have been reporting for so many years.<n>

But at this time, it was late on a Sunday evening.  My husband was following directly behind me in his car.  There were few cars on the street along with us at this time.  This short stretch of neighborhood area has few street lights.  An object caught my eye on the right side of the street.  It was a bright/glowing red orange object that was gliding at tree level.  It crossed our path.  I got to witness it up close as it crossed right in front of me.  The only way I can describe it, is that looking out my windshield from inside, it was about the size of a large car.  The object was glowing red from within and had a bright colorful haze around it.  It seemed to be in the shape of a tear drop sphere but it was so bright.  I would&#39;ve gotten a good recording if I had had my phone out.  I slowed down and rolled my window down so that I could point out! the object to my husband. It made no sound as it glided straight across.  I pulled over to the first parking lot I found and I was able to watch it until it disappeared.  This definitely is a populated area that I witnessed it in.  It was coming from an area that is somewhat isolated but going towards the highly populated area.  It was not a fireball with a tail and it was not falling from the sky.  It was gliding across the sky at a low level and moderate speed.  I only saw one object but I kept looking around to see if I could see anything else.  When I got home, my husband confirmed that he too had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Myself and other cars were going around 45-55 mph due to the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I see a bright orange-ish light, thinking it was the moon.. maybe an eclipse of some kind.  As I drove closer to the light I realized it was not the sun/moon and it had a prominent shape to it.  It was round and divided up (like a calzone looks).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky completely lit up bright orange!  It was so bright it looked like it was at the peak of the day. I kept driving and there were more maybe 10 altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not moving, just stationary in the sky and I did not hear any sound coming from them.  Not blurry, not far away, VERY PROMINENT SHAPES!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was around marker 170-180 (I didn&#39;t look because I was so scared at the time but it was in that range)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After driving underneath these object all of the cars proceeded to drive around 95-100+ mph out of that &#39;area&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called 911 which transferred me to highway patrol and they said they would &#34;send someone out there&#34; but seemed to have no knowledge of any projects with an aircraft like that being out there at that time.<n>

I&#39;ve never seen a UFO or any flying object like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was the driver who first pointed it out to me.  It was kind of the shape of a cigar so I thought it was a plane until it got closer.  It was changing lights from red to yellow and flying in a way no airplane could fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it was moving so fast I was shocked.  The lights stopped blinking then it continued to remain one flash of light and I saw one behind it!!  It was following the first one I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed i would see something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was on the east side of Indianapolis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they faded we also saw two of the similar objects by our home doing the same thing.  I can&#39;t be fore sure if they were the same crafts or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just very bizarre.  I&#39;m in shock if no one else has reported or seen these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We had been talking about how much air traffic there is in this part of the San Fernando Valley just a few minutes before heading outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped for a moment to watch the plane in its traffic pattern, and then my mother pointed out a point of bright white light, definitely higher than 40 thousand feet and moving at a very high rate of speed.  It was faster than a commercial or private jet, and not as high as a satellite in orbit.  The three of us all had our eyes fixed on it as it moved south/southwest in the dark night sky.  Suddenly, its rate of speed dramatically increased, and then it spectacularly appeared to ascend its altitude, upward, until it became invisible to the naked eye.  There was no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were very few stars visible.  The night sky over Sherman Oaks and Los Angeles is extremely polluted with light as you very well know.  Aircraft is easily visible, satellites can be made out with a trained eye…but this white light was so bright and clearly visible…it was an amazing sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all three stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds, and then I finally asked them &#34;did ya&#39;ll see that?&#34;  They both said nodded yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all in agreement that whatever we saw, it was unlike anything we&#39;d ever seen in our lives.  We talked about it for the rest of the evening.  It was spectacular but very, very strange.<n>

You see that!  We pulled the car over to the side and watched each one dim and suddenly vanish.  The whole event lasted about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger ball stayed the longest, while the tie small ones in the middle faded within 30 seconds if us spotting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They must have been there longer than we noticed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four fireballs were clustered together in a small group, right above the trees and low enough to catch you&#39;re eye while driving.<n>

My family came in to wake me up and realized I was already awake.  We watched the lights and I grabbed my phone and got a picture and a video.   They were round lights that would slightly fade in and out of brightness and were moving side to side, up and down, but only slightly because they were fairly far away.  After a couple of minutes they faded out completely.  About 10 seconds later another fireball came flying from over my building and went in the direction of the other lights and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 weeks before this my dad and I noticed something in the sky flying at in no specific pattern or direction.  It was 3 lights in a triangle shape and was flying very awkwardly and vanished about 30 seconds later.<n>

I am 70 years old so at my age I cannot sleep through the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the stool room of the bathroom and while there I looked out the window and saw an object that was not familiar to me.  It was an object that was about the size of our refuse container.  It was about four feet high and four feet wide.  It was black in color.  It was sitting on my neighbor’s driveway in the sidewalk portion in the drive.  The direction from me to the object was north/northeast.  It had a white light on the side near the top – the size of it was one inch by five inches.  It pulsed every two seconds but did not go completely out during the low side of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 80 -100 feet from my position.  The unusual thing about the object was there were no definitive edges.  The house, driveway, lawn and street looked as normal.  The black object looked as if it shimmered slightly.  It was black but not a dark solid black with lighter streaks going through it horizontally though they were faint.  The only other thing that was not normal was that my ne! ighbor had installed Christmas lights on the lawn next to the driveway.  The lights were not on at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the window two more times – the second time I went back to the bedroom then back to the window.  The third time I went into the bathroom and then back to the window.  This was a Saturday night and we had stayed home -- I did not have an alcoholic drink that night nor have I ever in my life used any kind of recreational drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amount of time I observed the object was about five minutes.  After this I went back to bed and told my wife about it the next morning.  At that time it did not concern me but the next night I was a bit “spooked” by it though nothing else was sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next afternoon my wife and I went across the street to my neighbor’s driveway to see there were any kind of marks that might have been left on the concrete there was nothing  About thirty years ago I noticed a white light that followed me and didn’t have any idea what it was.  This white light followed me for about sixty miles while driving in central Kansas.  This black object was so much closer and seemed so much more real.<n>

The object was very high up, and to the naked eye, looked like a red star accelerating at a high speed.  It of course was not moving as fast as a shooting star, but roughly 7 to 10 times faster than a conventional airplane moving through the sky at night.<n>
