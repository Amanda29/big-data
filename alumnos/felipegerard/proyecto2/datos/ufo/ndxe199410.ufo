We had been to the city water plant to check that nobody was parked there. The water plant was located on a dead end gravel road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat at the end of the gravel rd.and the main road the light began to grow.  The object that had looked like a star was now a yellow/orange sphere getting larger as it came toward us. I radioed the other car that was on patrol with us and asked them to come to our location.  In a few minutes the other patrol car can speeding down the road, and the object by this time was nearing us wasn&#34;t traveling very fast. It looked to be maybe 500-800 feet above the ground and looked to be about as wide as one lane of the road, it made no noise and had an object that moved back and forth on its top, kind of like a weird radar dish, but the moving object was curved over the sphere not open like a normal radar dish and did not appear to be attached to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second patrol vehicle came down the road and rolled to a stop and the driving officer came out of the car holding a mag-light flashlight shining it on the underside of the object.  He ran down the road shining his flashligh on it. Just below where we were the road split and made about a half mile, to a mile circle with a large amount of trees in the middle, so we all decided to each go one way and meet on the other side.  So I went straight and the other unit went left and we met on the other side, but the object had disappeared.  Then it hit me....I had a dash video camera looking right out of the windshield and never thought to turn it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, the other 3 witnesses will not admit they saw anything...even though one of them chased it down the road on foot shining a light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#34;t have a clue what is was.<n>

She had called me downstairs to witness this bright orange to reddish light.  I noticed that it was high in the sky and appeared to me to be moving slowly.  It was very peculiar to say the least.  It was so strange that even my wife who was upstairs getting my son ready for trick or treating that night came out to witness it as it sped up and moved in a straight line pattern but in an vacillating fashion.  I was surprised to see other planes move normally against the same  panoramic view of sky. Which gave me a convincing feeling upon comparison that it was not a normal flying craft.  It was hard to tell how high it was but it was certainly much higher than the airliner traffic whooshing faster than the object appeared to be moving.  Erratically this red light started to vacillate to white and then red and the end made a very steep upward climb out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We leave our trailers in a state camp site a few miles from the Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening around late October 1994 we saw what was by definition was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The campsite was deserted but for my dad and me and a friend who had gone to sleep in his trailer.  The moon was bright and we were standing outside listening to the geese and ducks being loud and obnoxious.   I noticed a white light about 30 degrees off the horizon.   I told my dad it might be a planet, but it stayed there, and as our eyes focused it flickered like a flame.   He went to get binoculars and I went to the observation stand which is about 20 feet higher.   Thru the binos it looked like a white flame flickering over open water, you could clearly make out the shoreline with the moon light.   We watched it for a few minutes; my dad speculated it was a gas well, then maybe a reflection of one.  I told him there were none there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He walked down and woke up his fiend in his trailer.  Thru the binos I could see a white mass that appeared to flicker like a camp fire from a distance.   Dad’s friend joined us on the observation tower and was clueless as to what it was, then out of nowhere a smaller light appeared next to it, they then started moving back and forth along the water line.  My dad said they might be helicopters looking for someone.  But helicopters don’t make pin point turns like that and have spot lights which look like flames.  After only a minute or two of that, they started heading out over the bay, we lost sight as they took a high speed route straight away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes now we mention it and pause and some says, what do you think that was, but no one knows more than the other.  It was an unidentified flying object, that’s all I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

No lights, no noise.  I saw it for less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on Randolph Air Force Base at the time, less than a mile from the flight line.  I saw planes take off and land every day.  I know what planes look like and I am sure that was no plane. If nothing else, it would have made some kind of noise.  It was eerily silent, though that could have been the shock I felt at having seen the &#34;blob&#34;.  It didn&#39;t even seem to leave wind in its wake.  I would love to know if there is anyone else out there who can explain what it was because I don&#39;t believe that aliens visit this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/24/94 14:30|Charlotte|NC|Disk|1/2 hour|We were under brilliant illumination that was much brighter than the 2:30 pm afternoon clear day sunlight.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53365.html|7|ndxe199410| We were under brilliant illumination that was much brighter than the 2:30 pm afternoon clear day sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed intense but unusual ground effects lighting all around us before I noticed what was causing it.  There were no clouds, it was a bright, sunny, blue sky, October afternoon with the sun shining to our right, casting long shadows in the sand. I had sat down on a swing for about 5 minutes, watching my son playing in the sand to my left, when all of a sudden I physically felt an extremely intense, powerful double shock wave that initially seemed strong enough to stop my heart momentarily from beating. When I looked around me, everything was lit up brilliantly in a strange light grey light, and then looked over at my son 7 feet away from me, I could clearly and obviously see that we were being intensely illuminated from directly above. When I looked over at my son, his own shadow below his body was razor sharp around him on the sand, but when I looked straight up in the sky, the two round objects were actually about 3-4 miles over to our right instead, which was confusing because the light they were emitting made it seem as if they were only 100 feet straight above us.  His bright red jacket appeared only grey, there was no color vision at the time of the sighting.  The light seemed brilliant grey, and actually eradicated all of the shadows eminating from the bright sunlight.  They were heading south to north, same speed, same line of movement, second one behind the first one about a mile or two behind, and were the same size each, circular in shape with about 7 concentric non-contacting rows of brilliant but separate and staggered, huge, stationary sparks underneath them, but coming out of the underside of the objects. The sparks were static and appeared photographic due to total non-movement, but with random, smaller bright shards of blue and red in each of the white and also each of the yellow sparks. The first, outer, ring of sparks was white, the second two smaller inner, concentric rings were yellowish in color, the next smaller ring was white and the next two were yellowish ag! ain in c olor, with the final, smallest ring being white sparks. But in the exact center of each object was a huge black circular discharge of downward facing uneven energy, like an enormous jet black spark, as was all of the other sparks, each facing downwards as well.  I could tell the black energy was larger because it was blocking out the few rows of sparks that were behind it.  The second, trailing object then zoomed quite rapidly up to the first one, as they each continued northbound, and then immediately bounced off of without ever hitting it in two or three tiny little loops to the right of it, then instantly approached it again, and once more seemed to be deflected somehow by the first one in 4-5 little swirling looping motions on the left side of the first object.   The first object remained perfectly stationary at both times.  Then the second object went all the way back to its original distance and position and once again approached the first object again, same speed, but this time, apparently making a smoother approach, because it went slowly under the first one, because the first one started disappearing as in a crescent shape above it, and then the top one dissappeared completely, apparently as it overlapped the second one now below it.  Due to their similar size, they now appeared as one object.  Then, after traveling another few miles towards the north, above to my left, they rapidly and suddenly flung apart from each other, the top one seemed to deflect to the right where I could still see the rings of sparks on the bottom of it and then the second one deflected to the left of it flipping almost on its side at an angle towards my direction because I could see the top of it, that it was covered in a greyish brownish material, soft looking, and it had no windows or doors and had a smooth dome shape directly in the middle of its center. When they both instantly flung apart from each other, they also instantly and abruptly stopped at the same exact time completely in mid-air.  At that instant, that ! they bot h stopped in mid-air for perhaps two seconds that I could tell, then they both, at the same precise instant, disappeared from view completely without any indication of speed, flight trails or even any apparent flight direction whatsoever.   I used to work in the financial accounting field, so paying attention to details was very important.  I also did not feel threatened or afraid at any time of the sightings even because of the strange light because they made no movements towards us, they simply seemed to be maneuvering in the sky, and the way they moved so effortlessly, made it seem to me as if they were floating on top of a solid surface, even though they were so high up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At first I thouhgt it was Mars but it was moving due east in my direction. Getting closer and closer until it was directly over me and continued eastward. A couple of Fighter planes were flying maybe 1000ft or 200ft below in the same direction until it was out of sight . This event happened for about 10 to 15 mins from horizon to horizon...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About thirty seconds later an extremely large object appeared moving over the townhouse in complete silence.  The object was somewhere between 300-500 feet above me.  It was triangular in shape with a large very bright circular disc in the front of it and two smaller but still large bright discs in the back.  Connecting the disc was a very dark (almost black) center part of the craft.  It was on a trajectory coming down to land on the golf course.  The craft was enormous, my guess would be the length of three or four football fields.  As soon as it went out of sight I ran from the deck through the dining room, kitchen and out on the deck facing the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jump over the railing and headed towards the golf course.  As soon as I turn the corner I started to think that this may not be a good idea.  I stood there for a second trying to decide what to do. I returned to the house and grabbed a paper an! d pencil and sketched out the craft at the dining room table, I wrote down the exact time, lack of sound and described the craft exactly as it appeared.  The one thing that struck me very clearly was that whatever I had just seen was not of this world.   Nothing that large could move with absolute silence, there was nothing that large that could gain flight in our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a hard time getting to sleep that night and finally fell off sometime after midnight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I got up with absolutely no memory of having seen a UFO or any other unusual thing for that matter.  The kids and I had breakfast in the kitchen, they went on there merry way playing with other kids in the neighborhood, I washed my car in front of the house and it was business as usual.  Sometime in the early afternoon, I was going out to the deck facing the golf course and saw my my yellow legal pad with a sketch and words on it.  The second I saw the sketch of the craft it flooded back to me exactly as I had seen the night before!<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day there is no doubt in my mind that I had seen a UFO.  There is no way that it was a weather balloon or some other questionable object.  This was some type of craft flown by intelligent beings that had technology that far outstripped anything that man had created.  The memory to this day is so strong and the vision of this craft is so ! vivid that it will go with me to my death.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source of the report does not indicate that fact.

I looked out of the window and saw a blip of light moving erratically in the sky.  In a moment, it went away.  I wished that it would reappear, and when I thought this it came back, this time moving in seemingly controlled, deliberate movements, as if it returned because I knew that I wanted it to return.  It seemed as if it had a message for me so I said, “Yes”, obeying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting seems to be related to an aberration that I heard on my radio, listening to BBC News as I fell asleep the night before I switched on the TV the morning of September 11, 2001 to see the horrors of the disasters in New York City and Washington DC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In November 2001, I was on the light rail in San Jose, when someone technologically assaulted me with a weapon in a pager case.  The weapon flashed rays in my eyes, and the person who assaulted me said, “I forgot”.  The rays reminded me of the acoustic aberration that I heard on the radio that night before the morning of September 11, 2001.   I now know that this person was being used by Fujisankei communications in New York City as a caricature to make money, and by the people of Fujisankei to pass for White people in what is left of South Africa’s apartheid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had some difficulty in expressions about seeing and hearing thunderstorms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed a more constant point of light in the sky when I was in the Philippines in 2005 and upon my return to the United States in the years since that visit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the change in the government of Iceland in February, I contacted the Consulates General of Great Britain and Chile in San Francisco, concerning Stonehenge and Easter Island in relation to the 1994 sighting.  Before reaching the consulates, I had only watched Fujisankei on Channel 26, but after my contact I found that Fujisankei was broadcasting on another channel, 60 digital 2, so I have the number two from the rongo-rongo tablets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Given these items I just presented to you it would lead one to believe that I am a man of reasonable caution and prudence who has maintaned well thus far in life and continuously making efforts in learning new things.  To make a long story short, I saw a UFO that I would like to report however at the time when I saw it, reporting was not an option and access to opportunities such as your sight were not provided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October of 1994, I saw a UFO hovering overhead above my location on the corner of Tremont Street and Anawan Street in Taunton Massachusetts.  It was roughly 250 to 300 feet above ground level, I saw it clearly and know precisely what I saw.  The craft is described as dark in color, circular, was hovering and moved at an estimated 5 to 8 miles per hour making not a single sound. I observed lights moving rapidly at a circular-flashing motion located underneath the craft as whitish/ reddish in color.  I maintained observation of the craft for roughly eight to ten seconds prior to it simply disappearing beyond the tree-line into thin air as if it wasn’t ever there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I respectfully request to report my account as I am prepared under the integrity of my office to make a full statement under oath if need be before the U.S. Congress, or any other agency (Private/ Government) charged with the responsibility of investigating such occurrences.  As a Police Officer, Integrity is hallmark which backs my abilty to openly speak of my account in 1994 these days.  As a former Marine, the courage to follow through with reporting and commitment to the public and people I serve is what makes me want to aide in the disclosure of the Phenomena and report my account (although past) for the world to know.

From the center of the object, a bright white light shone upon the field.  My wife thought it was a helicopter searching for something.  As we drove the object intersected the road.

While driving we saw an object off to the left hovering above a cornfield. There was a white light coming from the bottom of the object, shining on the field. My wife speculated that it might be a helicopter searching for something.  We continued driving when I noticed that the object was starting to move in a direction that would have it intersect the road about a mile or two ahead of us.  We continued to watch the object as it move closer towards the road.  I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, and we exited the car.  The object crossed above us a few hundred feet.  It was perfectly silent, triangular in shape, with one light on each point of the triangle.  The lights were rs, green, and blue.  What made it so eerie was it&#39;s slow, silent movement.  After passing over us it moved to a field on our right, and then sped off to the south.  It traveled so fast that it practically disappeared. l<n>

It was a wonderful birthday present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my kids to school, on the morning of 10-20-94, as we crossed some railroad tracks, I looked up in the sky to the north and saw a small silver saucer shaped object, I said to my children look up there and pointed to the saucer, at this point we were amazed. I turned north at the next street which was across the tracks, tried to follow it and then it disappears into thin air.<n>

We were just sitting there on a picnic table and talking. We enjoyed staying outside all night since we were all only 14 or 15 years old. Well anyways it was a fairly chilly morning. As we talked we were looking towards some woods. The woods were roughly northeast from the house. We noticed the sun had come up over the trees directly in a straight line from or view. We didn&#39;t think much of it and just continued to talk. Then one of us (I don&#39;t remember who) happened to look over to our right and more in a easterly direction. And the sun was coming up over there! We then being somewhat more confused then shocked looked back at what we had assumed was the sun. It was a huge round, bright orange sphere. We all were just flabbergasted and couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. It then dissapeared. It sort of imploded,kind of like the circle the cartoon characters stick there heads out of at the end of the cartoon. You know it goes whooop. A few things became apparent looking back on it after having time to think about it. The object was of course too far to the north rather than east to be the sun. Also it couldn&#39;t have been near as bright as the sun or we couldn&#39;t have stared straight at it like that. It was definitley very close to us and above the woods. I realized as well that light reflected off the trees as if the object were directly above them. Not a celestial body thousands or millions of miles away. It was very bright and very orange. The only explanation i can give for us thinking it was the sun at first would be that we just werent really paying attention to it. During this whole episode a fog had rolled in. We didn&#39;t really feel any fear but we felt enough apprehension to head inside. We don&#39;t really talk about this much. In fact the two of them sort of denied this happened for years after the fact. Me and ((Witness #1)) had several strange things happen to us in those woods throughout later years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact i&#39;m a little scared of them. But i really wonder about this still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was dark, and I was driving on Loop 390 in Marshall, TX, close to the interection with FM 1997.  I saw a bright object out of the corner of my eye, and looked in time to see an orange disk fly across the sky in front of my car.  The disk appeared to be flaming, was traveling north, and moved over the horizon very quickly.  A rushing sound accompanied the moving object.  It was traveling at  about tree level and was larger than a car.  I have not reported the sight until a friend told me she had seen an object matching my description in Fall 1997, hovering in the vicinity of the object I had observed.  She reports that the object moved up and down, the came toward her before flying north at high speed.<n>

Appeared to be coming from a black spot in the sky approx 200ft in the air (no trees by the river in the area we were). As it travled the 3 of us looked up through our rifle scopes and could only see a black spot, but we could tell something was there as the stars were blacked out.   We watched the light on the river sweeping from side to side, move towards us, past us, until it was approx 300 ft. down river, then the light went off and we could not see any sign of anything at all. We heard no noise even when the light was shining on the river directly infront of our campsite. Another thing we noticed was at the time we heard no frogs, or other noises, just dead quiet other than the river flowing. About an hour later we noticed the frogs again started making their regular noises.  We only saw the circle of light on the river, and the black object (could not tell the size or shape just that the stars did not shine where it was) in the sky, we never saw a beam coming from the oject down to where the circular light was on the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My Grandma taped this over ten years ago.  I&#39;ve kept the tape since &#39;94.  I contacted Art Bell about it a few times but received no response.  This is what happened.  My Grandama lives in Delaware County Ohio.  It is in the country.  One night her neighbor from 1/2 mile down the road called her(around 9 pm)and told her that her husband had been in the field on a tractor working and he saw some UFO&#39;s heading towards my Grandma&#39;s house.  At this point, my Grandma grabbed her VHS cordcam and went outside. By this time, her neighbor came down.  They then watch and converse about the happenings.  I will dictate what takes place in the video:  My Grandma and neighbor says,&#34;  they almost look like searchlights, but why would they come together like that&#34;.  At this time in the video, you see four tear-shaped objects, glowing a soft yellow, coming together to make one bright object with many rays coming from it, however you can still distinguish each object.  Then they break apart and head to different parts of the sky.  At this point, beams of the same color shoot down into the back woods.  I have periodically look at this video.  My brother and I used to watch it frame by frame.  The objects move at incredible speeds.  They wil disapear and reapear in a different spot, and THEN you will see the streak/travel path left behind!  Also, at one point you see the fifth object which appears in the upper right corner of the video.  It is long and rectangle with very soft edges, not luminecent like the others.  You can also see a row of windows that are darker than the rest of the ship.  At that time, I was 14.  My brother and I began to research it. We found pictures of the likeness of our ships in the &#34;Gulf Breeze Sightings&#34;.  They even had a pic of the rectangle ship we saw.  They called it a &#34;cigar-shaped&#34; ship, and go on to call it the &#34;mothership&#34;.  Anyways, I figured I would tell one last person.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved from east to west, moving very slow, not very high up in the sky, and made no sound too.  When it was over me, it had a hugh white, circular light in the center, and 3 smaller red, circular lights making a triangle shape around the white light.  I seemed to have stopped when it was over me, but I think it was just me being so caught up with the moment.

It seemed to float by.  No windows doors, lights or markings where observed.  There was no sound coming from the object either.  It was a moonlit night and the object though metallic in appearance didn&#39;t reflect the light it seemed to be what I would describe as a brush aluminum finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for roughly 20-30 minutes.  It seemed to be circling us in a large pattern which included a path over the ocean and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  At its closest point which I would estimate was 1000 feet in front of us the object seemed to be about 20&#39; in diameter.  After several passes around us its trajectory too! k it over the forested mountains to the south of us.  At which time a forest fire started beneath it and the object moved on in our direction.  Each time it passed close to us it seemed to slow down.  It was obviously controlled, it moved in a smooth floating like movement in all direction.  I kept thinking to myself that gravity is not affecting this object...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object would me still, then begin to vibrate and then go into orbital like movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I watched this object for three hours it came from the north and remained on the western horizon for approximately three hours. I first noticed it because of the bright white light it gave off and seemed to get bigger. After a while it seemed to get small, and began to give off red, green and white light. Sometimes all at once or just red or white. The object would remain still and then begin to vibrate very rapidly. Sometimes it would just stop vibrating or it would go into parabolic type orbits. (small range orbitals.). Sometimes it would move in a linear fashion when vibrating. It would then stop all movement and remain still. Then movement would start up again. The object seemed to remain at the same level off of the horizon, but moving south over the time we watched it. We reported this to the NY State Police (Name deleted) at the time we were observing it. The next day I reported it to the Cornell Astronomy Dept. (I was an Cornell employee and student at the time). The irony of this event is that a few weeks before witnessing this event, this same time of UFO sighting was broadcast on Unsolved Mysteries. The show also featured video tapes. These sightings occured that same year most of which happened down south. I think the show focused on the crafts that were sighted in one of the southern states. I could be wrong about the year, it could have been 1993 that we saw this, but you can verify the year by contacting the TV show Unsolved Mysteries or your own archives have probably cataloged those same sightings. I am sure this happened in fall, a few weeks after that particular show was run.  The following night both my parents and I observed the same object in the same area. I know this is outdated material but it may help.<n>

It was a sunny, cloudless afternoon.  I believe it was around 2:00 PM. One friend in the front seat was turned around talking with the other two friends, who were sitting in the back seat.  As we approached Circleville from the north (coming from Columbus), I saw a classic, disc-shaped saucer hovering above the town. It was shiny silver and I did not notice any sound; since we were at a distance of approximately 0.5-1.0 mile, I can only guess the size was somewhere between 100-200 feet in diameter. Since I was driving, I switched back and forth from looking at the saucer and watching where I was driving. I looked back and forth approximately three times and the fourth time I looked back up, the saucer was gone (i.e., I did not see it depart). I remained in awe and speechless the entire time. After it had gone away, I asked my friends, &#34;What was that?&#34; My friend in the front seat had been turned around the entire time and did not see the saucer. The person with whom he had mainly been talking had not seen anything either, or at least she did indicate she had. The other person in the back seat apparently had seen it and replied, &#34;I don&#39;t know (what it was).&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two in the back are from Germany and returned there in early 1995.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in frequent contact with my friend, who was sitting in the front seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When I saw it I was young around 3 or 4 but I remember it clearly and right now I&#39;m 12. There were three people who saw it besides me. My Great Grandfather and two neighbors, both from different houses. We were on the hill, which is the terrain on Coleman Rd. I was in my house at first then my Great Grandfather told me to look out the storm door. I did and saw a bright, white, round light flying low and comming towards our hill. We went outside the same time our neighboors did and watched it till it slowly disappeared behind the other hill. I didn&#39;t know what U.F.O.s were untill I saw it and it was like then I knew what it was. I don&#39;t know what month it was or year, or at what time it happened. But I beleive it was in between 19:00 and 21:00, or 7:00 to 9:00 P.M. central and pacific time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was less than 1/2 mile from my middle school right as night was approaching. We had farmed the property for sometime yet we saw a bright light up by the property owners house. The owner had a small air strip next to his property where his son would fly planes. I asked my father had the owner installed a new street light because over the trees about 600 ft away his house was really more well lit than I remember. We took our time and was heading home as usual when we noticed his property was extremely well illuminated as we were leaving. I looked up in the sky and saw what I took to be the moon but it was clearly not the moon it was a perfect sphere of light on a cloudless night. I could see what I took to be a UFO. It made no sounds and didn&#39;t seem to move. I looked at it long and hard to check and see if it had any crevices or imperfections, there were none I could see.  I wanted to make sure! I was seeing it so I ask my father did he know what the object was and did he see it.  He said he saw it and didn&#39;t know what it was. We didn&#39;t stop and headed home. I was bothered and terrified I had never seen a UFO before and haven&#39;t seen anything like it since.  I have been telling this story ever since. I feel liberated after officially telling this story after so long.  We were alone us two that night harvesting in a field about 20 acres or so big. I can&#39;t say it was a craft but I can tell you I felt like we were bieng watched. I got the same chills writing this story I got all those years ago. This is the first time I have written about this experience.<n>

I was not feeling well and woke up to get a drink of water.  I looked up and could not believe my eyes.  There was a very large, round shaped, glowing fireball. It seemed to be the same size of the house it was hovering over. I live in a rural area that is usually very dark at night and the home that this object was directly over was all lit up. I got scared so I went to my back door and peeked out the blinds.  The fireball then shrunk to the size and color of a star.  It hovered, then moved extremly fast for a short distance and stopped, then the object vanished.  I woke my husband and told him about it. He could see that I was very upset.  I have never reported this because I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was crazy.  I know what I saw.  This is not something that is easy to forget!<n>

The sighting occured at the Farmington Airport, in Farmington MO.  This airport was investigated in 1974 by Dr. Harley Rutledge of Southeast Missouri University, when lights that were not aircraft, were seen by the local Stick and Rudder Club headed at the time by Mr. Ralph Pingle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was coming off of Highway 67 on New Perrine St., I spotted what I thought was a bright landing light of a larger than usual aircraft for this airport.  As I approached the airport, I could see that whatever it was, it was not going to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object headed from East to West.  As I watched it, the back end behind the light slowly started to extend out into a dark blue cylinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not believing what I was seeing, I slowed down so I could see it better through the front window of my truck.  As I went past the Jaycee Park, I noticed a second object the same as and slightly below the first. I pulled over to the side of the road, to get out and look at the objects, when they both had vanished.<n>

10/12/94 21:00|Okeechobee|FL|Disk|unknown|Close encounter 5th kind - CE5.|3/26/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117952.html|40|ndxe199410| Close encounter 5th kind - CE5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a completely true, but amazing, experience, and I strongly feel it will interest you.  It’s another strange thing that’s going on with some people, a twist of things happening in recent years, worldwide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Wednesday, October 12, 1994.  In what follows, a name is changed, withholding a man’s identity.  Everything else is exactly as it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That day around 9:00 p.m., we arrived at Okeechobee from our day&#39;s work in Boca Raton.  Okeechobee is a Seminole Indian name meaning, &#34;Big Lake.&#34;  Joe was with me.  We are computer engineers developing an important product for a big client.  It was a difficult job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We needed a change of scene and he was glazed over too from the day’s problems.  A ride in the country would give us a change to rest our heads.  Escaping our noisy hotel was part of the answer, so driving eighty-five miles to Big Lake was welcome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beach is usually good but typically it’s a parking problem.  At Okee, there’s cool, clean, air with a chorus of wild creatures to hear all around ... Relaxing.  There‘s no stress or tension.  What a place!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived with just time enough to fix a drink and walk outside by the rim canal. It felt so fine being there on a perfectly clear cool moonless night.  The air was wonderful and stars were bright.  Looking to the right we immediately saw a light coming.  It was over the canal about 800-feet in the air a quarter-mile away.  Something close was flying our way.  I was thinking, &#34;This ought to be interesting.&#34;  Little did I know!  It seemed like a helicopter by its speed and height, with a big light under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time there was a twin engine plane flying out over the lake, just behind it, about two miles away.  The plane was noisy and gaining altitude from take off at Okeechobee Airport.  So, it’s natural that I wouldn’t hear a helicopter coming our way.  Only it wasn’t a helicopter, not a plane either, and it’s coming along in the air too quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’re near Route 441 with some distant sounds of traffic going by.  But I couldn’t hear this thing coming and it’s getting close.  We saw a steady bright glow under it, like a big searchlight playing into the canal.  Whatever it is, it had no flashing lights of any kind.  But all aircraft are required to have strobe lights at night.  As it came from behind a nearby tree into clearer view, we saw it’s a brightly lit disk and still  moving toward us.  I said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  Joe was glued.  I just watched without a thought and looked hard trying to decide what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was still flying toward us, slowly, maybe 20-mph.  It flew the same way over the canal until about 300-yards away.  Then it went gradually higher to about 400-yards, almost over head.  It’s changing direction slightly now, moving to the opposite edge of the canal and over a point about 100-yards in front of us.  It slowed, descending as it went by.  It’s absurd not being aware that it’s a UFO but it never entered my mind.  A UFO is exactly what we saw, the real thing.  I never saw one before and this one is really close.  It didn’t get closer than 200-yards to where we stood.  As the craft flew by, it was perfectly circular, about 35-feet in diameter give or take five.  At that height it looks bigger than, say, a full moon rising on the horizon and it’s brighter.  As it moved it made a bright white glow with a hint of yellow, bright but without a strain... easy on the eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound, I said – it was totally silent.  By then there’s no noisy plane nor any road traffic being heard, no more distractions anywhere.  The craft was coming down, low, slowing to a stop and moving east 100-yards toward Nubbin Slough.  In five seconds, it flew from high over head to where it’s hanging in the air over the levee.  We saw it clearly, parked a little above the levee up a 20-degree angle.  As it descended the disk-glow was harder to see the lower it came, because the angle was smaller and the glow diminishing.  It came to a stop, suspended motionless in the air 100-feet past the ridge of the levee toward the lake, a distance of about 250-yards from us.  The craft became dark.  Two small soft lights appeared, one each side, square light images although not big as windows.  They are reference lights to help us with what happened next.  It’s on edge-view and I saw its silhouette, because there’s a lot of light in the haze behind it from the well lit power plant 15-miles! away.  The plant was under construction around the clock and covered with lights for the night shifts.  It looked like a vaudeville straw hat on edge view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The upper part of this thing was dark but showed a rectangular silhouette, flat on top, and not as wide as its base where we had seen the glow.  The top is a shallow wide cylinder shape.  The top part is three times thicker than the base and eight times wider than thick.  The base is thinner and a third wider than the upper part...maybe 15% wider on each side than the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for how the base is connected to the top, curved or straight, but couldn’t see it.  It’s a lame description but it was dark.  When the craft came low and to a stop, I was thinking, &#34;Now I will see what they’re doing!&#34;  Without thinking UFO I knew they weren’t like us inside.  This was really different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It amazes me, not realizing the things I know.  Like, how might I know ostensibly never having seen one before?  Did they send me subconscious thoughts already?  And I mean, Lake Okeechobee is a military operating area, and there are rumors we may have flying craft of similar appearance.  But this craft is nothing of ours.  No question, this technology is special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very quickly after this thought, something happened to me. I didn’t remember it clearly for weeks.  What I remembered instead was, that at about this point we turned and went into the house for a few minutes, then came out to look for it again.  It’s still visible, glowing over the levee about two miles down, past Nubbin, toward the southeast and Indiantown.  Again, we turned away with it still in view and went back into the house.  The clock read 9:45.  Wasn&#39;t that something?  Joe said, &#34;Yeah, you know, some things just happen.&#34;  He couldn’t function either, both of us were subdued.  I was drained.  Sitting in the house, I was tired and empty of thought.  I just couldn’t put two thoughts together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside looking at things again and found my vision was different.  I could see really well in the dark but soon came back inside.  We immediately turned in for the night without a word.  Next morning it’s never mentioned by either of us, nothing.  Joe never brought up anything about it, not ever.  It’s awhile before I came around to it with him. Months later after remembering most of what happened, I phoned Joe about what he recalls.  He said Nothing.  Months after that I sat him down and probed him to see if he remembered them talking to us.  All he’d say was, &#34;Maybe they were talking to you.&#34;  And with a grin, he said, &#34;They found no intelligent life here and moved on.&#34;  It seems all he remembers was seeing a ‘fast moving’ light.&#39;  It’s a clue ...maybe he’s on different ‘time’ than me in this experience.  I’d been thinking He simply didn’t want to remember.  And he doesn’t want to talk about it at all.  At least he knows they came, I’m thinking.  He’s my witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the most incredible event in anyone&#39;s life experience, uncommon in all human experience, yet we lost interest in it?  We turned our backs, headed inside and simply went to bed.  Nothing like this could happen in normal circumstances.  But there’s certainly nothing normal about these circumstances.  Something very different happened that October night.  After they left us, I was mentally washed out, tired and just about dysfunctional.  It’s the chance of a lifetime for two curious people like us, who are no pedestrians to technology, and who earned educations in four scientific disciplines between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could’ve done much more investigating at the time, because there were binoculars, a camera, and a 2½-inch refracting telescope, all within five yards of the door from where we stood.  None of it mattered.  We simply couldn’t function acting on our own will.  We had no initiative, none, zero.  Best I could do was look and wonder. After weeks of trying, memory and the details began coming.  I did it mostly while driving to work with plenty time to think.  Eventually I got nearly everything back.  Here’s what happened.  We watched as the craft came lower, stopped, and became darker.  Two small lights appeared.  The craft was parked in the air just inside the levee of Big Lake maybe as close as 200-yards away.  As we watched, something hit me, a marvelously happy feeling and I knew at the time it was coming from the craft.  I thought THIS is a really good sign whoever they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The happiest feeling of anticipation had suddenly come upon me.  I knew to expect something wonderful to happen between them and me.  They were doing something to affect my mental state giving me a wonderful feeling of euphoria.  It‘s nothing like anything I’ve ever felt, a totally joyful happy feeling beyond description.  I was so glad they were here and understood, waiting for something.  I dared not move a muscle although knew I wasn’t restrained.  Whatever came next I wanted to be part of it.  Next, I was sensing a projection of thought to me, when soon thought-speech appeared in mind in my own idiom.  But there’s some fumbling, because I first heard some unintelligible words and a series of growls.  I thought It’s growling at me.  But it definitely seemed like a recording coming up to the wrong speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure, as in, they don’t know how to operate their ship.  Much later I saw they were showing me that technology is being used.  It sounded like technology was being engaged and directed to me.  It’s growling, why’s that? ... thinking This might become difficult... how very odd all this is.  Next, I heard the word…Mrep!  (Visitor) Mrep, what the hell is...?  With that exchange we were talking.  It’s like they’re tuning on what I was getting.  How could they know?  Yes, they’re already reading my thought responses.  We’re communicating!  They’re talking with me and the warm feeling of expectation was at its height.  I thought this is actually happening, happening here and right now.  Right now!  Wide-eyed I couldn’t believe it, thinking It’s too fantastic... they’re real, what a discovery!  A man’s voice was very friendly, saying, &#34;Yes, up here.  We’re here.  You’re looking at us, and we can see you.  You hear us talking to you.  We know you’re interested in us.  It&#39;s okay, we won&#39;t harm you.   (Visitor)&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this exact moment Joe said Damn!  Obvious excitement, because he realized he could hear them too.  They’re here and they’re talking to us! But there’s a problem, I notice these speech-thoughts went by really fast for a typical English-speaking dialog. It wasn’t like two people speaking with each other, where more time is inserted between thoughts, where we allow each other time to think in the process.  It was going by as a flood to grasp, near my limit. I found it difficult and didn’t want it this way, but it was also all clearly heard and understood.  There was only time to respond, no time to form any questions, which may have been deliberate.  It seems to account for speed of the exchange.   They were deliberately pacing the exchange so we couldn’t ask them any! questions.Next the voice said…We want to meet and show you around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do stop and show others sometimes and they have a good time.  We want to be friendly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would you like to see everything here and have a ride?  (Visitor) Immediately, a silly image of a guy popped into mind. The guy was sitting in a deckchair with sunglasses, a blue blazer, white slacks and shoes, with a captain&#39;s cap. If this was supposed to be an image of me having a good time, it struck me as totally bogus, because I would not imagine something so ridiculous in my situation.  They must have sent it.  I thought nice try. But it’s also okay with me.  My thought in exchange made it okay, because I obviously knew it wouldn’t be like that. It was humorous.  I’m thinking now, these guys do have a sense of humor.Imagine that?  I’m invited.  I was so excited and thought Really!  ...and emphatically thought Yes!  I was so happy, so excited and grinning hugely.  I shot a glance at Joe.  He had on his biggest smile, too, although he didn’t look at me. Quickly, I looked back to the craft feeling they didn’t want my attention anywhere else. No voice said so but I underst! ood a thought to be…Now look here a moment.  (Visitor) I replied thinking Okay ...doing just that. We had switched from our explicit dialog to a direct implicit thought-flow between us; telepathy, explicitly vs. implicitly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between reference lights I could see a tiny spot beginning to boil and enlarge.  There’s a grayish-green circular spot and it’s getting bigger.  A fuzzy spot had formed and was expanding but slowly at first. It appeared to be swarming with motion and became a cloud-like image emanating from the edge-center of the craft.  It was swarming in the sense that it appeared to be boiling with a lot of motion and was fuzzy to look at.  It was fairly uniform. Next I saw circular arcs being traced out one at a time.  The circular cloud was growing out of a tiny port on the craft.  Arcs appeared at the edge of the circular cloud at twelve o’clock and moved on a curve to its center at the port.   Arcs emanated from the same point-source and immediately began getting bigger, growing into a tear-shaped envelope.  One of the yin-yang symbols on the South Korean flag comes to mind, the one curving left, but was narrower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all five or six formed, each growing onto the upper right side of the circle-like cloud.  After they were all formed the cloud became more oblate, squarer with rounded corners.  The envelopes formed sequentially, the first beginning from the 12 o’clock position. Each one was growing on the lower edge of the preceding one. The tear-shaped envelope is a sort of bottle. Next, I saw contents of the bottle growing from the smaller back at the edge toward its larger front at the port.  It’s growing into the space rather than filling into it.  This is a biological process and how it grew was amazing.  The process took only a few seconds to complete each teardrop envelope of its contents.  Growth would suddenly appear in discrete steps, not gradually filling within chambers of the envelope.  I saw its compartments being filled in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each cell of the envelope is irregular in size, shape, and volume.  It reminds me of compartments of a complex soap bubble, itself being formed of bubbles within the biggest bubble.  The inner bubbles are the cells being filled in a flash-instant of growth.  There’s a tiny pause, then the process moves to an adjacent cell.  The progress of moving between cells reminds me of how water drops suddenly connect together moving down a dry surface.  Just a tiny hesitation before they merge.  The next one would get its space filled, and so on until the envelope was totally complete.  Each cell was filled with different stuff; some of it was light, some was darker color.  The only thing coming to mind that’s similar is tadpole jelly from the swamp I played in as a kid. As each envelope filled with growth, a new envelope was immediately traced out under it.  It would fill and so on until all of them were complete. The envelopes developed in a clockwise stack under each other, the last one! being grown at the five o’clock on the cloud-circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the processing was complete the cloud-object changed its character, getting bigger much faster.  It changed to greenish-yellow from gray-green ...more yellow now.  Next it began coming, moving rapidly down to us.It traveled the 200-250 yards in under three seconds, closer to two.  I was startled to have it come so fast but I wasn’t scared.  As it came, it changed the angle of descent twice. It started down steeply and changed to half the angle at half the distance.  Within the last 100-feet it changed again by half the angle, arriving with a shallow slope only slightly above us as it swept in.  As it came I saw the cloud was 3X taller than wide, luminous but not bright and without distinct features. That is, except for a perfect black ellipse centered in its upper third, the major axis at vertical.  The cloud was symmetrical about its vertical.  That is if you could fold it in half, both sides would match exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The black object seemed like a tunnel in the cloud, like a big eye, but wasn’t.  I searched hard as the mist approached, looking for any definition but saw no detail anywhere.  The elliptical feature disappeared without me noticing as the cloud arrived. I feel it’s there merely as a focus, a diversion but nothing significant. The cloud was strange-looking, much bigger than us but wasn’t itself a creature. At its edges I vaguely recall seeing separate forms the instant it arrived, the kind of thing you can see if you don’t look directly at it. They came so fast I couldn’t focus my eyes fast enough.  It’s like they’re on each side of it, the landing party of workers sent by who’s ever in charge.  I’m thinking This is my chance to see something ...but no way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting point; the light cloud approached low over water, yet I saw no reflection from the water as it came.  It’s low enough near the end and I should have seen it. But it didn’t happen.  For a year the subtlety escaped me, as in, what’s wrong with this picture?   What sort of light is that anyway?  I know that Joe saw the cloud come, too, because as it arrived he hollered No!  Joe felt threatened, and anyone would trying to hold onto normal reality.  Here is his only known world.  Something like this has no place in ordinary life experience… does it? As the light cloud swiftly engulfed us I felt nothing different.  We were immersed in a yellow mist.  I struggled to see something, anything.  Then looking down and to the right I saw motion.  Something smaller was moving toward Joe.  I saw a small person like a five-year-old shuffling past at a half-run followed immediately by another exactly like the first.  I only saw them from the belly down.  The glare of yellow light was masking everything.  No one came toward me.  They went toward Joe, standing to my right four feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides their size I made two other observations of them.  Their knees are simpler, the same thickness as their thin non-muscular legs.  Their knees are nothing like our thick knobby knees.  When they run they don’t lean forward enough as we do.  Their backs are nearly straight.  Nobody runs like they do.  I’d fall down trying to run like that.  I’ve imitated their posture trying to make a step but couldn’t move.  I’m thinking they’re really lightweights. Their upper bodies are minimal.  As I watched them go I’m thinking There&#39;s no sidewalk over there.  They loped past about three feet over the edge of the sidewalk, out over water.  Their loose silvery metallic-looking clothes glowed from the surrounding mist, but less bright than the light.  How many came I don’t know, I saw only two.  But an interesting thought comes to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen bodies of these workers being custom grown, all six of them.  A biological process happened just before they came.  Seems they use such bodies to work here with us, like we wear our jeans and jacket.  If it’s so, what technology!  But it makes a guy speculate about what form they’d normally take, to assume biology-wear as a work suit.  It’s what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mist was a nuisance, I couldn’t see much.  I looked carefully at what there was to see.  I remember looking at the bright yellow light source at floor level. The bright object was lighting the cloud creating the mist. It’s on the ‘floor’, parallel and even with the edge of the concrete sidewalk but beyond water’s edge about four feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light’s a half-ellipse two inches high, eight inches long. It’s the mechanism making a platform under them, extending over the water where they’re working. The light had bright radials sticking up from it in the vertical plane and was located parallel to the edge of the concrete sidewalk. I saw the bigger radials of light are separated at 20-30 degree angles from each other, bright from the source and quickly becoming less distinct, fading a few inches above source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Radials would all shift together at irregular intervals, hopping back and forth, yet holding their places and distances to each other as they all jumped to another position. My impression was, it’s compensating for load dynamics on the platform as the workers moved about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I closely studied this light show until I understood what it’s doing. I looked up and forward into the mist thinking Now, what next?  Then I felt I was going... Going?  It’s really subtle. No weight off my feet or of being uplifted, but a feeling of departure, upwards. Then... blank. I was blanked for a time, because next I remember coming to, realizing I’d been blanked. I was again conscious, present, feeling some air.  I seemed to be back on the sidewalk where I’d been. My body was still standing there just as before.  I felt the gentle air from the canal. My eyes were still closed, although I felt I could open them if I wanted but didn’t.  Seems, somehow I knew we weren’t finished yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a slow vibration, about 8-Hz, like a flutter. Then quickly it’s gently against my forehead. In a moment it went in. It’s inside my head!  It was not interfering with my mind, I could still think. But I’m being buzzed by a wave, a gentle, extremely low frequency (ELF) wave... thinking What&#39;s it doing?  ELF wave was getting harder, slowly rising in intensity and in frequency. I felt like it was charging my brain, like a capacitor, more, more, and more. It kept on increasing, the frequency going up, up, ever upwards.  On and on and I’m thinking Will it ever end? …Knowing it’s going to my limit and wishing it would find it soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it kept going higher, higher. How could it go so high?  I wasn’t happy with the wave continuing upward. It’s tough to take but it went to an unbelievably high level before finally hitting my limit. It abruptly stopped with a pop at the top of my head. Receiving the buzz was an extremely rude experience.  I was grimacing, eyes and jaws tightly clenched to withstand its powerful effect. There’s never any pain, just a force. When it ended, I got released and it doubled me over spinning me around clockwise. I saw Joe&#39;s feet where he’d been, still standing next to me. I shouted What the hell was that? Damn!...Thinking I am back.  Have I just landed on my feet? . I’m on my feet.  It felt strange being back, like where had I gone? Physically I don’t feel I went anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was zapped hard by something and was afraid, thinking Maybe I’m ruined.  It’s the most physically stunning experience.  I staggered around a long moment, 10- or  20-seconds, trying not to fall into the canal. I was cursing trying to get a grip on reality, trying to get my balance. Everything’s distorted, nothing making any sense as I look around.  For once I’m scared, thinking I might stay this way. The wave was forceful and its release was like having grabbed a 240-volt AC line... new meaning to the word stunning. It also cleared out my thought processes but not where I live in my mind. That part was still unaffected, because I was myself the whole time.  Rude as it was I still had the glad feeling like before. Maybe it’s all in friendship, and if so I’d hate to be on their other list. Good time, is it?  The only thing coming to mind was that they’d given me a capacity test, taking a measurement. But Guinea pig?  There’s obviously nothing else it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I was coming out of it, looking around for them. The disk was moving away, flying over the canal a mile to the east. It made a curious maneuver, a small move to the right to back over the levee. But it did so in a spiral motion, first moving left then rolling in a downward circle coming up to the right, all the while keeping its horizontal axis parallel to the ground. It’s a victory roll.. Way too odd! I’m thinking Someone’s got a real sense of humor in there.  Their job clearly has some humor in it, watching me deal with effects of the Buzz. More than coincidental, the maneuver was for my benefit, because I understood it as a wave goodbye. The little buggars!  They had to know I was looking, like they were watching through my own eyes somehow.  But what’s the relationship and why so friendly?  Well, I’d actually discover why four years later. There’s more ahead about them, you’ll be impressed. It’s easy for me to see their maneuver, because my eyes were so slowed down. My eyes were now like a video screen, with light-paint lingering, delayed in a sort of light-smear, tracing out its path as I watched the craft circle moving back over the levee. I was thinking Fishermen at Nubbin Lock are getting a big surprise as this thing flies low over them ...right ...about ...now.  I laughed to myself about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly later I looked toward the Nubbin again, still getting my bearings.  White lights all looked very yellow now, blurred ...even smeared. They’re much bigger than usual although not brighter. What seemed different was, when I moved my head, the lights smeared to over where I was now looking. Then the smear slowly faded. Also, I had tremendous night vision, almost like day. I could see everything around me, up and down the canal. Everything is clearly lit by a yellow light glow.  There’s more. I also had eagle vision at will. I could will myself to have a close-up frame of any object I wanted to see. It would simply appear closer and bigger. Such total surprise! I stood looking at things in a residual yellow-light effect. I could see better by it.  The light cloud was gone, of course.  At the time, there were very few lights down the canal and not big. But that night they helped light up the whole canal. Otherwise it’s blackness down there when there’s no moonlight. I enj! oyed my newly given ability only briefly, because we were washed out and tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point we stopped looking and went inside but soon came out, again, for another look. I saw the disk glowing brightly two miles down, still near the levee. Back inside the house it was drab, really dull and uninteresting after being outside seeing things. Artificial light so close to me inside was annoying. My vision had changed. I was sensitized to see by different light and its effect is awesome. If the Army only knew that a directed ELF produces fantastic natural night vision.  Fat chance though, that they’d make anything happen like this in a hundred years. It’s modulated ELF. We sat in the house a few minutes saying nothing.  I felt so different than normal, like being at arms length from myself. I could still think but I couldn’t scan-think, like in thought synthesis. It‘s the processes needed for reaching conclusions. Thoughts wouldn’t flow in that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then without discussing it we headed for the bedrooms. I threw myself down on the bed and stared to the ceiling, trying to rethink what happened. In the pitch-black room my new night vision didn‘t help. I couldn’t see.Next, it’s morning ...a dreamless sleep all night. Like flatline, there’s nothing in my head.  I woke up rested with the event first in my mind.  Again, Joe and I didn’t speak of it the whole way to Boca.  It’s perfectly ridiculous, but we’re keeping the same ‘secret’ from each other. It’s too taxing to discuss, besides I only wanted to relive it privately. By that night my special night vision was gone. But my eyes played tricks concerning eagle vision.  Sometimes it’s in, sometimes it’s out. It gave me problems driving, because scanning for traffic in the mirror sometimes a car seemed too close, nearly on top of me.  Seconds later, it’s back to normal. The car was where it should be.  It’s annoying and dogged me for days. Weeks passed. I’m rethinking the even! t everyday while driving. Gradually more and more came back and I wrote everything down. Finally I had it all except for being blanked.  That part wasn’t recovered... if I got my ride after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: Years later someone explained to me that ELF is extraordinary stuff.  It’s like my visitors used a handheld device, working up close while doing me with ELF.  That’s interesting technology, because governments communicate with their submarine fleets using ELF. But there’s a difference. All our efforts need an antenna big as a football field to create such long waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a result of the encounter, he wrote four books with the information they gave him and asked him to write in astounding detail.  The contents of these books provide the rationale for our lives and the answers to questions that mankind has been asking since the beginning.<n>

I was driving home after school, and I was on a side road getting ready to turn on to a more travelled road.  As I slowed to stop before turning onto the road, I looked in my rearview mirror and saw something flying very quickly in the distance--it would have been like I was looking over my right shoulder.  At first, the sun glinting on the object made it catch my eye.  At first I thought it was a ballon and was catching the sun funny, but then it began to get closer, and I could see it was too large and moving too fast.  However, it was too small to be a plane, and too low and too fast.  The object flew over and above the trees and to the right.  By this time, I had turned onto the road, but I had slowed down to look, and two other cars had slowed also--so it wasn&#39;t just me.  I tried to make myself think it was a sophisticated R/C toy of some kind, but it was too big for that.  It was very, VERY quickly gone.  This whole incident was 1-2 minutes in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (I got a brief good look when it was overhead) was chevron/triangular shaped, with steady lights at each corner and (I think) some moving lights between the corners.  It was silent and, as I&#39;ve said, small and fast.  I did tell some others, and we thought it might be an experimental military device.  I think it was too small for anyone/thing to be in it.  It is hard for me to know how high it was since it was a very clear and bright day with no clouds.  I had nothing to compare it to in the bright blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

All three banked around and the two domes were in front of the Airplane when the two took separate directions, upwards in a V to what appeared to be out of the Airplanes way.  When we reach our house I called the Albany Airport and spoke to the Air Control tower and explained to him what I just witnessed, he did advise me that there were 2 blimps on radar that he could not explain and the offer me Peter&#39;s Davenports number which I called and to my amazement Peter Davenport was in Albany that AM&gt;....?? Weird....I Sent Peter A hand drawing of my sighting and that night the local New Station was interviewing me for the 6;00 news....  I do believe that we are not alone. I guess someday we will all be on the same page, but for now only a few at a time. One last memory of this, it was as if I were looking through a vertal blind and someone was rasing and lowering it very quickly. like the old Vaudeville movies in black and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I remember having spoken to this individual, despite the fact that it has been over six years since we spoke.

It covered from up to past the horizon in about 4 seconds.  Seemed like to tip lights on each end were slightly forward and out of alignment with the rest of them.  The size of the craft, however high it was I can&#39;t guess, seemed to be about the size of the constellation of the Pleades.  Very similar in appearance, as though the constellation were flying across the sky. Found a picture of the Lubbock (sp?) lights over Texas in the early 50&#39;s. Almost exactly the same thing. 11 months later saw (Sept. 12, 1995), also at 4:00 am I saw another chevron shaped ship, but this time it was much higher, seemed to be flying &#34;away&#34; like out of the atmosphere and &#34;away.&#34;  Instead of having lights, though, this one was a solid &#34;glowing amber&#34; color.  Watched it for about six seconds until it was out of sight.<n>

No sound accompanied the object. This ball of light headed due West of Pine Bluff, AR.  The object was flying much to fast to be a plane, yet it was much to steady to be meteorite or &#34;shooting star&#34;. The light seemed to be perfectly round, had no tail and flew in a strait line until I lost it in the tree line. By judging the altitude of this object, I would predict it&#39;s size to be about that of a round bus. I know this is not a spectacular sighting, but there was certainly something mechanical about the object. That is really all I saw, but it was enough to know that there was something strange cruising our atmosphere that night! It was beautiful and I have no idea what it was!<n>

Mostly because I just recently had the experience of seeing an object in the sky that I logically could not explain, and being a person who requires &#34;empirical evidence&#34; to label something properly in my inner database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other event in my life (I&#39;m 42, retired Air Force officer) that comes close is the one I am about to recount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the passenger seat of my fiance&#39;s car as we drove North on I-87 (the Northway) in the fall of 1994 and we were just approaching the Burnt Hill&#39;s exit (I believe Exit 11?) at dusk.  We were talking about our college classes from that day and I was looking straight ahead as we approached the overhead highway sign indicating the upcoming exit.  Traffic was relatively heavy (three lanes, full but moving) and as I looked straight ahead through the space under the highway sign, I initially thought I saw a sky full of stars.  This struck me as strange because the sky was not even fully dark yet; some light was still visible on the horizon.  As this thought began to strike me as odd, I quickly realized that the lights were slowly moving, up and to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped in mid-sentence and said to my fiance: &#34;Do you see that?  The sky ahead of us is moving!&#34; and we both watched as a giant rectangular shape (what I have always though of as resembling an upside-down aircraft carrier) was moving across the sky... very low (maybe 200-300 ft) and completely silent.  Not even a vibration from an object of that size, which he and I were both familiar with as aircrew members with many flight hours and time spent on the flightline.  We both watched as we continued to move in traffic and I asked him to please pull over into the median (we were in the far left lane) and he did try but we were at a point where the grassy median had very steep sides and he was worried that we would get stuck.  As he continued to drive and watch the road,! I climbed over into the back seat to get a better view from t! he back left side of the car.  I watched as this giant object with hundreds of small lights (randomly placed, like looking at a city) continued to move off over an area that was mostly farm fields (at that time, at least).  Remember, this was a time before the internet was a &#34;thing&#34; and people didn&#39;t carry cell phones with cameras.  We were just left to ponder this and check the news to see if anything came up to verify what we (and probably a hundred other commuters) had seen that night.  I haven&#39;t shared this info openly while I was still in the military due to my top secret clearance, and my now ex-fiance is still in the military and similarly concerned about talking.  But I am absolutely positive that I saw this massive, amazing object and cannot begin to explain its existence in any way that could fit with conventional knowledge of today&#39;s aircraft capabilities.<n>

But when I looked straight up I knew I was never going to see anything like this for the rest of my life. I called out for everyone in the house to come out and see. It was a circular shaped object with a very light triangle shaped ring around it. The bottom section of the sphere glowed to a bright orange like the color of the sun, and then it would dim down again. It continude to do this for the whole time we were looking at it. We all got a perfect view of it, the sky was perfectly clear and the object was only about 500 ft above us. It made no noise, and we were all in such aw that we made no noise either.

We observed an object across a lake from us , probably a few mile&#39;s in the bush from said lake. It was aprox. 8:30 at nite, it had 4 light&#39;s on it , blue, red, green, and amber. It seemed to just sit there , i guess about 1/2 mile above tree line. We could&#39;nt figure out what it was, and all of a sudden it just veered straight up, i would say from the long distance it was from us, 1/2 a mile straight up, then it would go down. It moved to fast for an aircraft. The background was total darkness. Binocular&#39;s were used on it, that&#39;s what determined the light colour&#39;s. When i got home(1000 mi. away) my mother told me it was on the new&#39;s that week, and it was the military testing equipement.  There is no way that the Canadian millitary has something that moved as fast as i observed, as a matter of fact any government.

It was +/- 5 times bigger than a star. It seamed to stay at the same place. A few second later I saw 3 other lights lined up with the first light, the second light had the same colour as the first one, the 2 others were green / blue. The first light did not move and the other 3 formed a triangle around the first light which was exactly at the middle. I found that very strange because the objects were exactly over my head and after they formed the triangle, they did not move at all during a couple of minutes. I decided to take a picture, so I ran into the house. I met my girlfriend in the stairs and told her what I saw, but she did not pay attention. I took my camera and ran on the balcony, the triangle had disappeared, but one of the orange / red light was still there. It started to move forward at speed of a jet (I guess), I took a picture and saw it go away during many seconds until it disappeared in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the picture I took, we can only see a very small point in the middle of the sky. I was quite disappointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very surprised to read similar UFO reports on this site.

As I approached the State Highway Patrol office I noticed what looked two strobe on either side of a third, central flashing light in the distance, beyond the tree line of Cook&#39;s Creek Golf Course.  The two strobes would flash 3 times, then the central light would flash once.  Of course I thought it was a plane, as up and to the right of it were more lights that seem to be headed towards it&#39;s location. The highway curves to the right just past the golf course, losing sight of it because of the trees.  As I emerged, directly ahead was the lights, sitting completely motionless.  As I got closer to it the lights never changed or moved.  I decided to turned off 23 and onto North Court St. at 84 Lumber and go through town and take ST RTE 56 home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was now east of town and as I looked to the west I saw the lights, in the same formation as before. That had me even more suspicious, so I decided to head toward it. I turned onto Tarlton Rd. and headed west. The closer I got the more I could see that it was near DuPont off 23 and was further away than I was willing to drive that night, so I turned south and went the back way home, all the while looking at the lights and they still looked the same from a S/SE view point. But that is not craziest part. My best friend worked 2nd shift and did not come to work till 3:30pm. He had no time at all to talk to those that I worked with, as he worked in a different department. As I was about to tell him about it he turned and said &#34;dude, you will not believe what we saw last night&#34;. He began to tell me that he and another of our friends who worked with us were headed north (from the south of Circleville), coming from Chillicothe, at almost the exact same time as me. According to him as they approached DuPont they saw something over the factory. They pulled over to watch it and said that it began to come toward them. They described lights flas! hing 3 t imes in a circle under it with a ventral strobe light. This is one of about a dozen different encounters I have heard of in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Sunday Times of India dt. 30 October,1994 Captioned &#34;Hexagonal UFO sighted over Delhi&#34;<n> <n><n> 2. The Telegraph (calcutta) dt. 27 October,1994 Captioned &#34;Skywatcher claims UFO sighting&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the UFO sighting :  Disgusted at not being lucky to join the group of amateur astronomers that left Nehru Planetarium, New Delhi for sky-viewing on the outskirts of Delhi in the evening of 2nd October 1994, I was dejectedly looking at the night sky around 20:30 hr standing in the balcony of my house in the Gole Market locality of Delhi when I chanced to observe six dimly-lit red-orange star-like objects resembling configuration of a hexagon in upright position swiftly moving across the north-eastern skies at location somewhere between 40-45 degrees from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly, the swiftly moving unusual object did not produce any sound, and disappeared from the sight within a minute. There were no clouds in the sky at the time of sighting of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was utterly confused about my having personally seen an abnormal object in the sky which did not match description of any of the established heavenly objects on that eventful day of my life.  Based on my knowledge of cosmology, I realized that the fast moving objects could not be a group of stars either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of sheer excitement and curiosity, I reported the chance observation of the unexplained object in a local daily with a view to learning readers&#39; reaction to my sighting.  To my surprise, I did receive a rejoinder to my report from a scientist, Prof. K.S. Vashistha intimating sighting of UFO of similar description on 10th October 1994 at Agra (India)at almost similar time I did the sighting of UFO on 2nd October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequent to confirmation of my sighing of unusual object in the sky, the news of sighting UFO in Delhi sky was a big news in the national dailies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/2/94|Bingen|WA|Fireball|15minutes to an hour|I was car camping with some friends at Bingen Marina. I was awakened by what I thought was a car pulling into the parking lot.  (no car|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05631.html|57|ndxe199410| I was car camping with some friends at Bingen Marina. I was awakened by what I thought was a car pulling into the parking lot.  (no car to be seen)  I looked around 360 degrees 2x.  The 2nd time I saw a shooting star and a big fire ball type of object simultanously.  It seemed to be steaming, and was pulsating.  I thought I was looking at a fire at first by the color but I realized it wasnt.  I became mesmerized while staring at it and then my adrenalin started flowing.  It/they  (what ever)  calmed me down with a internalized voice I thought at the time was my own.  &#34;Go back to sleep, your cold, tired, it&#39;s just a metiorite, it&#39;s nothing , look in the morning when it&#39;s not so cold&#34;  Then I layed down, next thing I knew I was sitting up in my sleeping bag again watching this &#34;thing&#34; fading away.  In the morning I wake up feeling exhausted and very depressed and I thought it was strange that I should feel that way...I had no recollection until two days later when I was driving and looking at the colors of the sunset and I saw a meteorite...then I remembered.  I think that I remember only part of the event, and I don&#39;t know for sure the exact time or duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a calm wind night, the first night I had camped all season long (windsurf season, in the gorge), that we had frost on the car.  The object didn&#39;t have a definite shape that I could make out.  My first impression was &#34;It&#39;s a forest fire&#34;  but then  I realized that there were only about four trees surrounding it and they were not burning.  I also noticed that there was absolutely no sounds at all.  Dead silence.  There appeared to be steam arising from it and it&#39;s brilliant red orange glow kind of oscillated.  The steam was blowing towards the east as it was a prevailing west wind the whole weekend. (this happened very early sunday morning.)  As I sat watching, I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.  The steam or smoke dissapated and no more came from the object.  It continued to glow (pulsating) and I stared for I dont know how long.  pWhen I realized it wasn&#39;t a fire my mind tried  frantically to come up with an explaination of what I was observing.  I laughed to my self at the burning trees and thought &#34;....and moses only saw burning bushes&#34;.  When I thought of the possibilities, UFO did come to my mind but not until I exhasted the most rational things I could come up with first like meteorite, or fire or ? anything!  I got really frightened and went into the fight or flight mode, when I was suddenely so calm it was as if I were drugged.  I think I was aware at the time that something outside of myself was calming me down, and that scared me even more.  Like I said before I still don&#39;t remember the whole complete thing, because there was a time when I started to lay down because I couldn&#39;t fight it anymore. (I tried!!!) and the next thing I can remember I was sitting up watching the light and it slowly ,over the period of a few minutes just got smaller and dissapeared.  The height of the glow of the light was at least 60 feet.  It was just as long and the whole glow was circular as far as I could tell.  I wasa parked aproxamately 30 feet away.  There was no noise and no smell.  There were no little green! men either.  I didn&#39;t see any kind of beings at all.  I did feel like someone was inside my mind with me.  No, I&#39;m not crazy!  I was camped with 3 other vehicles.  I was in my subaru wagon, by myself.  My friend was in his ford utility truck, right belind me a blue old toyota and our friend in his voltswagon camper van.  I eventually asked all of them about that night and if they remembered anything.  I think I was the only one to either see or at least remember.  One interesting detail to note before I go,  while this was going on, I cannot remember thier cars being there, maybe it was because I was so focused on staring at this huge light thing, but I don&#39;t know.<n>

I stopped down the road and got out to get a closer look. By the way when I drove by I was about 400 feet away. I would estimate it to be about 30 feet wide by 15 feet high. I stopped down the road and walked towards the saucer. I could not see it from where I stopped because of a hill. When I got about 600 feet  away I seen the ground across the field from the saucer light up with a red light. and the light was moving around from a reflection of something  moving. I was looking around to see where this light was coming from because the saucer was NOT lit up on the ground. It had a metalic color. I was looking up and turning around to see where the light was coming from and saw nothing. Then I started to see the saucer rise up from behind the hill it was behind , while on the road I was on the other side of the hill , the side the saucer was on. It rose up very slow and was now glowing a red color. It rose up I would say about 10 feet a second and made NO noise at all. If you were not looking at it you would not know it was there. It rose up to about 350 feet and stopped. The bottom of the saucer was white light with movement of like a turning fan with 3 blades. and it turned about one revolution every 10 seconds. the movement object was not clear it was behind a semi transparent bottom with a grid type support. The top of the saucer I could not see any detail because of the glowing red , it was the entire top surface lit up glowing. anyway I was watching it rise and when it stopped rising I watched it for about 45 seconds more then I decided to run towards some trees because I didn&#39;t know if they were going to abduct me or what. While running I looked over my shoulder to see if it was still there and it was. When I got to the trees I looked and it was gone and still heard nothing. But a wind breeze went by.<n>

The craft was not of a design that I could identify and I could not see any type of propulsion system also missing were any type of navigational lights or light beacon lights wich are required by law of all aircraft.The rapid change in trajectory indicated that the object was under positive control.The maneuvering ability the object demonstrated to avoid our conflicting flight paths was....well I was impressed; the maneuver would have been enough to structuraly compromise all conventional aircraft and probably kill any occupants.In other words it would rip a 767 into pieces.The object was gone from sight as it flew north and descended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1994 is approximate.

10/1/94 21:00|Warsaw|MO|Cigar|10 Minutes|Triangle shaped object hovering above the water.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59843.html|60|ndxe199410| Triangle shaped object hovering above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approximately 10/01/1994 at around 21:00 hours, myself along with 3 other people were traveling together on T Hwy in a southern direction in Benton County, Missouri approximately 8 miles north of Warsaw, Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we topped a hill heading towards a bridge named Tebo Bridge we all witnessed  a light hovering above the water on the east side of the bridge.  One of the persons in the vehicle made the comment about what that light is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued in a southern direction and came upon the bridge and stopped our vehicle.  All of us exited the vehicle and stood there and watched this light just hovering approximately 50 feet higher than the bridge and approximately 1/8 mile east of the bridge.  The best way for me to describe this light would be is that it is similar to lights you would see on an airplane but it was a constant light, not flashing or anything of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was below the ridge line that ran in a east/northeastern direction with the water, so I am confident of the approximate distance from us to the object.  It was very dark out and very difficult to see an outline of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was calm outside and the big thing we noticed was that there was complete silence.  This craft made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this object for approximately 10 minutes just hovering above the water it turned and was now pointing in a north direction.  As it turned to the north we saw another light on the rear of the craft.  Being that it was so dark outside it was very difficult to get an outline of the object, but to my best guess it appeared to be an almost triangle shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft turned, it slowly started to move in a northern direction.  As the craft moved away from us there still was no sound coming from it.  We watched this craft moving away from us at a very slow speed until it evidentially went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1994 I was a Police Officer and had never witnessed anything like that before or since.  Some of my fellow Officers are members of the Air Force Reserve and I described what I had saw and was told that the Air Force has nothing like what I described.  My thought was that Whiteman Air Force Base is approximately 40 miles from the area where this event took place and the direction the object took was in a somewhat direction towards Whiteman Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  There was a very dramatic event that occurred on June 21, 1995, near Cameron, MO, which was very well documented by one of the police officers there.  The case involved three teenager, who were camping in a camp near Cameron, and all of whom reported the same experience to the police.  PD))<n>

Me and 2 other friends where spending the day hiking in the state park, which borders westover AFB. We were making our way out of the park by heading the way of a &#34;back trail&#34;. There is a large pond/lake in the park with adjacent wall with a railing. We were by the rail enjoying the view of the lake when we saw the forest on the other side of the lake light up very bright (we were about 1/8 mile from object). We saw a round object (it seemed about 75 feet in diameter) that was glowing in multi-color, the object than started to &#34;break-up&#34; shooting large glowing balls (seemed basketball sized) of light in every direction and color, the glowing balls seemed to be shooting off farther and seemed to be getting closer. We were scared these things might get closer so we proceeded to run as fast as we could into the forest behind us, once we got to the edge of the forest (about 40 yards away)we looked back and there was nothing there. We  continued running anyways until we got to our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched it as it paralled us for 15 - 20 minutes.  It resembled molten metal and seemed at times to drip fire.  It would dip down below the trees, but then it would reappear within seconds. I first thought it must be someone in a hanglider, and I looked hard for the tell-tale sign of someone underneath the orange object that was shaped somewhat like a sail. I thought the bright orange color must be a reflectiton of the sun, which was getting lower in the sky, but the object wasn&#39;t just the color of fire.  It looked like it was fire, only with a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had thought about stopping the car, but my daughter, not yet 10-years old, was afraid and urged me not to stop.  However, I did drive very slowly and couldn&#39;t stop myself from looking at the odd object.  After we crossed the river, the highway veered slightly to the right and went up a hill.  It was at this area that the object stopped paralleling us and appeared directly in front of us over the road.  I had been puzzled and amazed before, but now I was afraid.  I checked behind me and saw no one, so I stopped my car in the middle of the highway  Then something happened I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crescent shaped object turned in on itself and disappeared for a fraction of a second.  When it reappeared, the crescent was facing the opposite side.  It had been facing to the right, now it faced the left.  Then it moved from over the highway back to the left side of the highway.  It was now in front of us to the left.  I moved my foot from the brake, and started the car again.  The shape dipped down below the trees and then went back up.  Then it dipped down again and stayed down.  We looked behind us, but never say the object again.  We will never forget it.  It was so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
