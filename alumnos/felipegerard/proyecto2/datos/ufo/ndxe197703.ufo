It had to be really big because it was extremely high in the sky, yet you could still see it in wonderful detail, such as its lit-up windowsp windows.  Although round, the object also had depth to it.  A certain height to it.  Around and around there were rotating lights or windows. The lights or windows that lit up were square in shape, and they rotated and spun super fast, flashing many colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered and spun for several minutes and then it flew off in a flash and simply disappeared.  The UFO was silent.  No sound. I did not feel afraid of this craft, but I did of the triangular one I also just reported tonight on your website.  My father, however, felt very afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget what it looked like because it was unlike anything I have ever seen or expect to see again in my lifetime.  It made headlines in the local Mellus or Mellis Newspaper because hundreds of other people saw and reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had laid my head back to rest and noticed a dim red glowing ball in the sky outside my window. I rolled down the window and saw a rectangular shaped craft approximately the size of a football field with dimly glowing red globes on each end. Since the ballfield lights were still on they gave some illumination to the bottom of the craft, which was hovering at approximately 150 ft. I noticed what appeared to be ducting all over the bottom side, and the red glowing globes were veiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were at the stop sign and I told my mother to stop, while I had my head completely out of the vehicle. There was no noise from the craft whatsoever. It slowly moved to the South about 50 ft, then changed direction to the North about 50 ft. and then the craft changed from it&#39;s horizontal position to a vertical position and started moving. There was still no sound from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instructed my mother to stop but she told me other cars were coming up behind us and she began travelling North on the highway, and the object mirrored our speed and direction for approximately 4 miles before rapidly accelerating off toward the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at our home a minute later, and I stayed outside to see if it may return or if anything more may happen. Aprroximately 20 minutes after I had last seen the craft, I noticed red lights approaching from the West and another set approaching from the East. As they got closer I could easily hear that they were jet aircraft. What did surprise me was that they were flying straight toward each other and at the point they intersected one aircraft turned 90 degrees and headed North, which would have put it on the same flight path as the unidentified craft. It seemed strange to me, and knowing the distance of a local Air Force base I rationalized that it was possible the craft showed up on radar and that they were trying to fly a grid in order to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw the craft again, but I remember it now, some 30 years later, as vividly as the moment I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 11 am over my brothers school ((deleted--witness #1)), ((witness #2)), ((witness #3)), ((witness #4)), ((witness #5)), and I witnessed a cigar shaped object flying back and forth accrossed the sky north to south at great speed. The object had no writing or sysmbols on it. It was silver in color metalic if you would. When it stopped dead in the air for a few seconds (20 to 30) without any sound at all. Out of the distance we could all hear the sound of almost thunder like rumbling. I could a few seconds later see to what looked to be fighter jet screaming toward the object. We all looked with great wonder at what was happening. Then as the jets got closer the object seemed to be taunting the jets by reamaning still until they were within a 1/4 mile. then it took of so fast it was gone and out of sight before the jets were even over it location where it stood still. Heading off in the north west the jet flew over and seemed almost standing still after seeing what we had seen. I have never told but a hand full of people of this and just wanted to share this with you there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was late evening, 6-7pm. The sun had gone down, but it was not dark.  What I saw next was awesome.  As I looked east,were what appeared to be 2 UFOs, one was quite large the other about 1/2 size or so. They were moving very slowly, spinning slowly toward the north.  There was NO sound. I dropped the hose and ran inside the house yelling for mom &amp; dad to come out quickly.  My older brother(20yrs) also ran outside.  Much to everyone amazement, the UFOs were still there.  What I can best describe the sight is the shape was like a spinning top only compressed top to bottom with lighted windows around the center horizontally, and blinking lights on top&amp; bottom.  Like I said &#34;NO NOISE&#34;  The size was larger than 3-two story houses and they were about 300-500 feet up in the sky.  I could see vehicles driving eastbound on the 134 freeway &amp; the UFOs passing over the top of them.  I have always wondered why no one else reported it.  WHAT DID WE SEE????  Many years have gone by, but my family and I still can picture what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

One night, I was outside with my 8&#34; Cave newtonian telescope when my father came out to tell me it was time to go in.  I happened to look to the north-east and saw a V-shaped formation of lights moving in a westerly course.  I knew that the LAX flight corridor is in the same area but I had never seen a flight of planes in that corrider as it is for &#34;heavies&#34; only, and not for military planes.  I told my father to look at the formation.  It moved to the western horizon and dissappeared into the L.A. light pollution in about 7 seconds.  That was faster than any jumbo jet would have moved in that corridor, and it made no sound.  I could always hear the jets flying by but these made no sound.  The best part was that as my father and I watched, the V-shaped formation suddenly shifted.  It seemed as if each light flew across the path of the others and it became a stright-line (line-abreast) formation.  The change was almost instantaneous, but slow enough for us to see them move.  We looked at each other knowing that military planes don&#39;t fly in the LAX approach corridor and they sure don&#39;t switch formation like that, especially at night. Plus they made absolutely no sound; we would have heard that many military jets.   Like I stated earlier, I am an amateur astronomer and have seen everything under the night sky, from flocks of geese, to meteors, to planes, to balloons, and this was none of the above.  I had another experience like this but I&#39;ll submit it as a separate incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/15/77 20:30|Stevens Pass (ski resort)|WA|Sphere|3 minutes|Scintillating orange sphere; exhibits near-instantaneous acceleration from stationary|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35029.html|9|ndxe197703| Scintillating orange sphere; exhibits near-instantaneous acceleration from stationary<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently I&#39;ve noticed many reports of orange balls of light in the sky on this website.  Thought I would post my sighting from 1977 to notify that these orange balls have been around awhile!  If they are man-made probes or drones; we had them in 1977!  The date given above is approximate; it occurred sometime in March or April, 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Story below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;doc&#34; ((name deleted)) and I were night skiing Stevens Pass ski resort (Cascade mountains, Washington State) in the spring of our senior year of high school (that&#39;s how I&#39;m certain the year was 1977).  We were skiing down &#34;Red chair&#34; at about 8:30 pm, when I noticed an orange light in the sky, while skiing.  &#34;Huh&#34;, I thought to myself, &#34;a firefly&#34;.  Although it felt wierd that a firefly would be up in the mountains while they were still snow-blanketed.  I had never seen a live firefly; only pictures in books, but my mind automatically labeled it a firefly.  I slowed to a stop over about 30 seconds, keeping an eye on the &#34;firefly&#34;.  As I was slowing to a stop, the light increased in apparent size from about star size to about half to 3/4 the size of a full moon.  The light was brilliant orange; scintillating light around it; the overall shape was circular but with ragged, jagged edges of this brilliant orange light.  After I came to a stop, I watched it, mesmerized, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  During this time, it&#39;s size and appearance did not change and it remained perfectly stationary at about 30 degrees above the horizon--I know that it remained stationary; because it remained just above and to the side of a mountain peak (behind &#34;Big Chief&#34; chair lift, to the direction of the eastern side of the ski area) that served as a reference point for me.  During this period, my friend &#34;doc&#34; ((name deleted)) skiied up and stopped beside me; I glanced over and saw his eyes glued to this wierd orange light.  As we both stood still watching,suddenly the object instantaneously darted across the sky--it went from being absolutely stationary beside the mountain peak; to traversing (in a time period of about 3 seconds) about 150 degrees of the horizon--from our vantage point; it traveled starting from the east and briefly disappeared toward the south behind a mountain peak; quickly reappearing on the opposite side of this mountain moving toward the south and continuing toward the southwest; when it finally disappeared from view behind another mountain to the southwest.  During this traverse, it was losing altitude; the angle of descent appeared about 5-10 degrees below horizontal, from our vantage point--before it finally disappeared, it was actually below us in elevation (down a valley) at about a 5-10 degree angle.  During it&#39;s transit, the object travelled almost too quickly for our heads and eyes to be able to follow; during its transit it remained brilliant orange and about the same apparent size; but appeared to have a short orange &#34;tail&#34; behind it--hard to say if this &#34;tail&#34; was an optical illusion; due to it&#39;s tremendous angular velocity from our vantage point.  Also, I seem to recall a faint hissing sound starting just as it disappeared from sight, and continuing for several seconds after it had disappeared from sight.  But no sonic boom or other sound.  I then looked at my friend, whose mouth was wide open &#34;did you see that?&#34; he said.  &#34;What the hell was that&#34; I replied.  We just looked at each other, then skiied down to the bottom of the run to get on the chairlift to ski some more.  I asked the lift attendant if he had seen anything in the sky, he said no (however, helping people on the chairlift he was facing the opposite direction of the object; and there were bright nite ski lights in the direction between him and the object).  My friend &#34;doc&#34; ((name deleted)) and I compared notes on what we saw; our descriptions matched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was and still is most baffling to me was the instantaneous change in the object from being perfectly stationary (for 30-60 seconds) to moving at an extremely rapid velocity--given the first mountain it moved behind (and reappeared) was about 1.5 miles distant,and that it traversed about 150 degrees of horizon within a few seconds, it must have been moved at least 3 miles within a few seconds, corresponding to over 3600 miles per hour!  And it appeared to attain that velocity instantaneously; certainly within the half-second or less which it would take our minds to register the change from stationary to moving condition (I was a very good ping-pong player and fair badminton and tennis player,so my mind has been accustomed to very quickly registering rapid changes in speed and direction in ball-shaped objects)!  This huge acceleration rules out any manned aircraft; g-forces would tear any human apart.  Perhaps now in 2004 we have unmanned probes or drones that can perform extreme accelerations (like antiaircraft missiles); but I don&#39;t think this was possible in 1977.  A meteor is ruled out; because it was stationary in size and location near a mountain peak for 30-60 seconds; and the apparent acceleration was instantaneous, not gradual (as could happen due to parallax effects).  I think any man-made vehicle, or known natural phenomena can be ruled out.  A missile might be able to accelerate like that; however I think with only a ground-based boost system (not a mid-air launch).  This leaves unknown natural phenomena (e.g. some type of atmospheric plasma ball?) or....any ideas? P.S.  There may or may not have been a solid object behind this light--we did not observed any solid object; however the light was so brilliant that it would have obscured any otherwise nonluminescent object that it emanated from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He was a U.S. Navy veteran who worked on airplane electronics, so he was generally familiar with aviation technology. I was 12 at the time of the sighting, and my brothers were 9 and 7. I have only a vague recollection of the incident. Some years later, my mother also had an encounter with a UFO - a lighted, spinning disc she saw late at night on the neighbor&#39;s lawn. She&#39;s reluctant to discuss the incident for fear people will think she&#39;s crazy, but I hope to eventually write down her account of the experience and share it with NUFORC.]  The Mysterious Lights  It was somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., say about 8:45. The date was March 2, 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kids were watching Grizzly Adams on TV and I just sat down myself, as I had just finished showering. [My wife] was in the bathroom, bathing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a noise, a low roar much as a jet, but it sounded low, too low for a jet. I expected it was a helicopter, actually I believed it was a number of helicopters, because it did not sound like it was high enough to be a jet. The noise slowly became very loud, you could feel the vibrations!  Now I became puzzled, my mind expected certain familiar things to take place, and when they didn&#39;t, I was puzzled. I expected the &#34;slap-slaps&#34; the helicopter rotors make, but there wasn&#39;t any. Now I decided to investigate. The kids also were puzzled and said, &#34;What’s that noise?&#34; &#34;Airplanes,&#34; I said. &#34;Stay here, I&#39;m going to see what I can see.&#34; I was sort of afraid of what I might find and didn&#39;t want the kids involved if it was bad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and saw 3 bright lights moving slowly, from northwest to southeast. They seemed low and close. The noise was very loud. My first impression was that it was 3 airplanes spaced in a triangular formation. They were not directly overhead but past me, and moving very steadily away from me. The lights were bright and they did not change relationship to each other, and I looked for but could not see the expected blinking red and green airplane running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This viewing occurred in a very short time span, say 10 or 15 seconds. I had on my eyeglasses, but decided to get my binoculars in the closet just inside the door. I ran in the house and took them out of their case but fumbled with the lens covers and wasted too much time returning outside. By now the lights were well past my observation point but still visible to me. I put the glasses on them and had only a second or two before the lights were obstructed by the branches of a leafless tree. I looked for another few seconds and only could see 3 bright lights. I took down the glasses and was going to move so the tree would not obstruct my view. I looked around and decided no other place gave an unobstructed view and put the glasses back up. I only found one light and just as I did, it went out. I presumed it went behind a tree branch, waited for it to reappear, but it didn’t, so I presumed it went over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the viewing interval, the noise remained strong for quite some time, even though the lights steadily moved away from me. When I had the binoculars the noise was diminishing, but I don&#39;t remember how it ended, whether it just stopped or droned on out of earshot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [My father added the following notes to his account some time afterward:]  This write-up was done after an interval of weeks after the incident. I wish I had done it the very next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .. One point that my story doesn&#39;t make very well, the noise was TREMENDOUS! It was the most distinctive aspect of this tale, not the 3 lights, although the lights were unusual and important to the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report describes herself as someone who writes frequently.
