We noticed an object hovering just above a water tower on the east shoreline. It was dark and appeared triangular shaped. As we were returning from the north, we looked at the water tower and the object was gone. Just at that moment I looked back toward the north, and coming straight toward us at an altitude of 100-200 feet was a triangular shaped object. I would guess that each side of the triangle was about 50 feet, and that the object was traveling about 20mph. It passed directly overhead, and what was spectacular about it is that we cut the engine, and there was no sound from the object. Secondly, all around the edges were red, white and blue lights, pulsating intensely. We watched it as it slowly moved out of sight to the south. When we got back to the marina, we walked out on a dock to watch the sky. Lo and behold, we looked west toward the Dallas skyline and saw three of these objects sitting still in the sky in a triangular formation. Angle was about 25%. I was very excited and expected the radio stations and newspapers to be full of sighting reports, but never saw or heard a word. It was quite an experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife who was also in the car, witness the sighting.  I jumped out of the car, and I observed a large craft that resembled a building that appeared to be on its side.  It had what appeared to me to be windows, like an office building and they were all dimly lithe up with yellow lights.  There were many windows throughout the craft, and not all of the windows were lithe up.  Other than the lights that were in the windows, there were no other visibible lights throughout the craft.  The size of the windows appeared to me to be about 7 foot tall and 4 foot wide, with perfect corners. The craft was about 300 yards long (and not clear on how wide or deep it was).  It was quiet with no sound at all. It was very windy that night. The craft was slow moving and on an even keel.  It was traveling south bound. The first ! pass lasted about 3 minutes, and then disappeared, long enough for me to get back into my car.  Then it came back on a north bound track and again that lasted about 3 minutes.  It appeared to be a dark color and not shinny, like a grey almost black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to make a report by calling the airport, but we could never get through because all of the lines were giving us a busy signal.  There were two other men that witness the craft that night. I never got their names, and do not know if they also tried to make a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced pilot and airplane builder. I have no logical explanation as to why this type craft was flying that night. A craft of that size and shape; I find it impossible to have any type of flying capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only assume, but if there were occupants on this craft, (in my opinion) there is no way that they could be small individuals and had to have been rather large, judging from the size of the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I am 71 years of age ,.I worked in the used heavy truck, construction sales business. Self employed for 20 years. Retired in 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I send this out for the public, I am aware that many will think me a nut. I think that some of the information  that I learned from this event ,may be of some importance some day .there was some snow on the ground .<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occurred at my home. The time of year was either early spring or late fall. I do not remember for sure..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was setting in a lazy boy reclines watching TV.,. The chair was next to a sliding glass door situated about a foot or so from my right. I noticed something in the air outside, and turned to look. An orange ball of what looked like fire was falling down towards my neighbors roof. It was about the size of a golf ball even a little larger. My neighbors house is about 60‚Äô behind mine, there is a 6‚Äô grape stake fence around the back yard. Bushes against the fence half way up on my side.  Between the bushes and patio landscaping is about 50‚Äô of lawn. The patio landscaping rose  about four foot at that time. The patio is connected to the house and is 15‚Äô deep,the patio is next to sliding glass doors, where I was setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Page 2   Now here is the strange stuff. The ball was falling at a speed  less than is a falling stone. Quite a bit less, or so it seemed. It stopped falling about a foot above the roof.  The object turned directly towards the patio doors. It followed the contour of the roof staying a perfect foot or so from the roof. Traveling horizontally. It dropped down behind the fence. I lost sight of it. Then it suddenly  It appeared at the top of the fence, staying about a foot from the top. Then dropped to the lawn, continued across the lawn, again at about a foot. Traveling fast straight toward the patio doors. It raised up and over the patio landscaping,  again at an exact distance from whatever was underneath it. across the patio and smacked  hard into the glass door. It left a mark on the glass door that looked like a large cherry bomb fire cracker would leave, dark to medium black in color It all happened in seconds, I seen it hit, and jumped up, thinking the glass would shatter. After hitting it actually stopped in mid air for just a second, then turned a pale yellow.  It returned in an exact reversal of direction, traveling back over all the ground objects at the same level. It reminded me of a toy train reversing direction. It traveled to the spot on the roof then straight up, it‚Äôs speed diminished. It reminded me of a hurt animal, though it  was not animal.  , It climbed a bit the! n the fire was out .I am not sure of this ,but I  think I seen some smaller fall. As I was not on good  terms with that neighbor, I did not think  telling him I seen a  small object fall to his roof. There was snow on the roof and I looked but could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was solid, from the sound of the hit , It was about the density of a rock.\  The fire seemed to come out about a quarter of an inch or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left no smoke trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the fire came out all around  the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was obviously guided. Important  It‚Äôs guidance could not detect glass. I think this is important.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The residue it left seemed to about like a fire cracker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the  door it hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think this stuff is important ,because a lot of people see fire balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This tells something about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source of the report does not indicate that fact.

Mountains surrounded the horizon.  There was a barge facility approximately a mile from the main plant that was unmanned.  Every two hours some one from the maintenance department had to go to the barge area for a fire watch and sign a log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night, I decided to ride in the van with the two maintenance men to the barge dock.  The road was straight as an arrow and not paved.  When we were about halfway back to the main complex, the maintenance man driving stopped the van.  I got out of the van from the passenger side and the other maintenance man sat in the van listening to the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked, the other person suddenly said &#34;what in the hell  is that&#34;?   As I turned to see what he was talking about I saw nothing but stars and the outline of a mountain across the river.  It was a clear night but the moon was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I saw some flashing stars on the horizon changing colors as they do when they are first visible.  I said &#34;What&#34;?  &#34;All I see are stars&#34;.  He said &#34;no&#34;!  &#34;To the right&#34; and pointed.  As I looked further to my right, I saw the large shadow coming straight toward us.  It was so large I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  It had no lights and was shaped like a perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed directly over our heads and disapeared over the horizon of a different mountain.  It had a flourescent appearance and shown a greyish black surface.  It made no nise except for a gliding sound coasting it seemed through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other maintenace man in the van jumped out at hearing our talking about the object and saw it briefly b! efore it disappeared over the horizon.  I felt weird and had chills over my entire body.  We were freaked out and decided we would tell no one because it would make us seem crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started to get back into the van, we heard a noise and it was two military jets following the same path as the triangle.  As they passed over head they broke the sound barrier and the &#34;boom&#34; echoed across the valley.  It then dawned on both of us that the triangle and the jets had come from the direction of the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Al, about 30 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had read about flying saucers and UFO&#39;s but at the time of my sighting, I had never heard of a flying triange.  This thing had to have been over a mile wide.  Who would believe that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that others are beginning to report the same, I decided to report what I saw that early morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.

I was a Security Specialist standing guard at the &#34;Alert Aircraft Re-fueling Area&#34; (referred to as Post 6). I was walking behind the blast shields waiting for a &#34;flight exercise&#34; which is pulled off at least once per shift by the Flight Sgt. or an appointed member of our flight. These are expected as a regular training exercise to keep us on our toes. When  I noticed several fireballs going across the sky from North to South. They came across at farely regular intervals and appeared to be ashing off as they passed, but never faded out they just flew out of sight. I called it out over the radio to the desk, they said they would check it out, and then said they had just heard other reports of the same kind on police scanners and from other posts, but would get back to me. Later that shift the Armed Response Team came out to my post with the Flight Sgt. They told me that a notation would be made in the &#34;Blotter&#34; but as the official word would report, that &#34;I did not see anything...&#34; Well I let it go at that because I was a good soldier that didn&#39;t know how I might be treated if I carried it out any futher. It has always bugged me that I never said anything to anyone else other than a very few close friends. I don&#39;t remember anything else about that night until about a half hour or so before I was relieved of my post at shift change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that time though I have had terrible luck maintaing employment and a home to call home. I feel as though I must move every 6 monthes or so. I have moved probaly 30 times since then and had as many or more jobs as well. This isn&#39;t something I am proud of or tell many about as it seems very EXTREME. I don&#39;t know that it will help to put this statement &#34;Out There&#34; , but, I am hoping it will not Harm me. If there is anyone else who might remember anything similar to this at around that time frame or have exrerienced similar problems of mine please list it here in this forum.

I do not recall the exact property, but looking at a map, and recalling a brook that passed through the farm, I would say that I was on the south side of Rte 253 right where the brook crosses 253.  After a day of helping around the farm, just after dark, I was sitting leisurely on the grass against an embankment  facing the highway.  The hill I was leaning against sets back about 3-400 yds from the road. I was chatting with a young lady that joined me there as a guest. I was 19 and she was about 24.  As we spoke I noticed what appeared to be the wing lights of a small plane, above the hills which are beyond the highway. The lights looked to be about a mile or so away at that time. The lights came directly over the road and over the farm toward us. They took quite a while (perhaps 5 minutes)to reach the farm area and by that time I had surprisingly noticed that there was nothing but space between the two lights.  A plane that travels at 60 mph would have taken only a minute to get to us.  They were glowing a subdued dark orange, were about 12-15 feet in diameter with maybe 40 feet separating them. They were not discs, but were spherical.  They made an almost inaudible crackling noise like static electricity and appeared that way too. The two balls went directly over our heads perfectly parallel and side-by-side bearly skimming over the hill I had been leaning against, which is to my memory, about 2-300 ft up. They passed over us without slowing down, but they were moving at only about 10 mph.  Immediately trailing the two spheres were like a static-y charge, like a kind of faint sparkle. Stunned for a few moments as I realize what we had seen, I ran inside the mobile home there, which was the camp kitchen and screamed about what I&#39;d just seen.  The couple of folks that were there were busy and thought I saw something way up in the sky.  So I ran back outside and there were still 2 trails where the two UFOs had p! assed ov er.  I never pursued any action, nor did I call police or any authorities.  What I saw was real, and very close. Twenty years after the fact I want to know what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was floating about 1 foot off the ground. I thought it might have been a firefly but no it wasn&#39;t after looking at it closely.  Hand held lasers were not readily for sale to the public at the time and it was floating off the ground, not a image on the ground.  When I realized it wasn&#39;t normal, I stopped walking and started to look around to see if anyone else was around playing a joke on me.  But then again That&#39;s when I noticed it wasn&#39;t a laser but a little tiny glowing red light. It kind looked fuzzy but also not very bright.  It was about the size of a marble with a round glow surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten or more seconds of this light checking me out, It slowly started moving down the alley and took a right turn onto either myrtle or pearl St. it was the alley behind the old restaurant mai kai on Elm St in Manchester.  It scared me so bad after it went up the street, I turned around and walked the other way.  I haven&#39;t told anybody about this because I didn&#39;t want people to think I was out of my mind and in need of a doctor.   I&#39;m not sure if it was fall or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night and I was walking home from the north end. I have seen another UFO at the Manchester airport but I think that was a satellite going by.  It was a red square object that was traveling in a straight path and going pretty fast. That one took about 30 second to travel the length of the sky until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I never knew who to tell about this until I saw your web site.  Years later on a movie I saw the exact same glowing orb that I had saw that night walking home.  That was on close encounters of the third kind.  It seemed really strange that the movie had the same thing that I saw and this was at least 2 years later when the movie came out. I would let a Dr put me under if anyone had doubts about what I saw. Another reason why I never told anyone about this.  Thanx! for your time.  Feel free to contact me if have any further questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanx again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

It moved silently in a straight line and performed flawless angled turn of direction without change in momentum.  I believe it stayed on the same plane and speed was approximately the speed of a car going down a residential street.  The closest it came to me was perhaps 20 to 50 feet away.  It altitude was approximately 25 to 35 ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flock of black birds split to fly around it.  When it reached my position it continued in another direction, approximately a 35 to 45 degree angle, until it was out of site.  I was alone, but it traveled over a very populated area and traffic.  Someone else has to have seen it.  I&#39;ve written this today because I just read an entry of 2002 asking someone who may recognize a picture of a sphere found in the red clay in the woods near Huntsville, AL in 1984.  I saw my object in 1980, although I don&#39;t remember the day and exact time of my encounter.  It is similar to that, but with some noticeable differences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I watched the object off and on for apporximately 20 minutes before gettting on a bus to go to school.  My bus passed by the object twice and the object remained stationary hovering.  On return from school, I looked for the object but it was gone. Although my entire family was in the kitchen during the my initial observation, for some reason I did not mention it to anyone. Also, while on the bus I watched the object while it was in view for about 10 minutes and didn&#39;t tell anyone on the bus.  I find this really unusual that I didn&#39;t say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: The disk was about 100ft. diameter and approximately 30ft. in height.  I base this on comparison to the 150ft. High tension power lines which it was hovering a couple hundred feet away from. It was approximately 100ft. off of the ground. It was highly reflective matallic with a very slight gold tint to it. There were no windows, lights or protrusions. It was absolutely stationary with no movement hovering over an already harvested corn field. At the closest distance, I was approximately 300 yards away. Nothing else out of the ordinary was observable in the area.  I approximate the location as Lat-42.84 Long-88.12 from checking terraserver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As ranking officer, I responded with an area captain to the bridge on Highway 7 ‚Äì the point the fishermen were last seen -- to coordinate response by the department.  As we pulled up to the bridge, I spotted a large bright white light downstream from the bridge at a point I guessed was directly over the confluence of the North and Middle St. Vrain creeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, the light moved back and forth in a U-pattern. My immediate association was to an airplane dipping its wings.  After a few seconds it faded out.  I had the mental impression that this light was signaling the location of the fishermen, and letting me know they were okay.  I asked the fire captain if he had seen the light, and he said no.  I told him what I had seen and what I thought it meant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too dark to search downstream, so I assigned a couple of people to stay at the bridge overnight in case the fishermen walked out.  The next morning I led a crew down an access road to the creeks.  We had only been walking a few minutes when we met the fishermen walking out.  They were okay, and reported they had spent the night ‚Äúwhere the two creeks come together.‚Äù  I asked if they had seen any unusual lights during the night, and they said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was living just upstream from the bridge, and I had seen a similar sized flashing white light in the same area, but a little further north and stationary.  I am aware of at least one other area resident who had seen a similar light in this general location on at least one occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation.   Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.<n>

We were doing some serious meditations.  I specifically thought:  You are out there, make contact with me.&#34;  Shortly, thereafter, this UFO passed overhead.  It had not lights and made no sound.  I could not determine how big it was because I had no frame of reference and had never seen it before.  We both jumped up and tried to look at it for as long as we could before it left our sight.  It was one of the most thrilling events of my life.  The amazing thing is that it is as if we made contact -- I think we did.<n>

My husband and I were driving back to Arkansas from visiting relatives in Shreveport, La when this occurred.  We were in a Mustang fastback, which is relevant to this story as we had a large window from which to veiw what transpired. About 10 miles out of Homer, La., we noticed a large, bright light in the back window of the car.  At first we assumed it was an aircraft that was flying low.  The light grew larger and larger which really got our attention but instead of staying on an apparent flight plan it seemed to be following us.  The roads in the area are extremely curved and the light stayed right behind us.  After what seemed forever, and the light had definitely brightened and was coming closer and closer  it just  zipped off into the Western sky.  We will never know what it was. What we do know is that it stayed centered in our back window no matter which way we turned or how fast we drove.  A very eerie feeling!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/80 22:00|Jersey City|NJ|Cigar|2-3 Minutes|Blimp shaped object with extremely bright lights hovered then rapidly dashed into the night's sky.|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47013.html|23|ndxe198010| Blimp shaped object with extremely bright lights hovered then rapidly dashed into the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following experience happened to me in my youth and I am not sure to the exact date.  I believe it happened between 1980 and 1982.  I would have been between 10 and 12 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night before going to bed around 10:00 p.m., I was looking out the window of my bedroom in my family&#39;s 11th story apartment in Jersey City, NJ, when I noticed a large blimp shaped object hovering slowly toward our apartment complex.  I had often seen the Good Year Blimp passing by are apartment building, and being a child I always found them somewhat interesting and worth watching.  Back then, I liked to read the advertisements that scrolled along the side of the blimp in the array of lights that Good Year Blimps had for advertisements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time however, something was different. As the object approached closer, I realized that the lights on the side of the object were not reading any messages or advertisements.  The lights were just flashing randomly.  My first impression was &#34;wow, it must be broken&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as the object approached even closer I realized that the lights were extremely bright, far brighter than I had ever seen on a Good Year Blimp. As for the color, I only remember the lights being white. They were all over the craft in no discernable pattern and they pulsed slowly and seemingly randomly. The intensity of the lights were very similar to magnesium burning.  It was a very intense, pure white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slowly and steadily toward our apartment complex and eventually got very close. There was no sound.  In my best estimation it was probably only 250 feet in the air and 300 yards away from my vantage point.  It was very large and looked very similar to a blimp in shape and size.  I remember being absolutely mesmerized by the bright flashing lights, but not afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden, it went from casually hovering along, to an insanely fast dash into the night sky. In a matter of 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, it went from being this large bright object to a speck of light that looked like a star, and then completely gone.  The rate of acceleration was unbelievable.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I recall, is that I was in a state of delirium after this incident, and I didn‚Äôt even mention what had happened to anyone.  I just went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I hadn‚Äôt remembered a thing.  This memory actually came back to me slowly but positively over the next 2-3 years.  In my estimation the lights that had so mesmerized me, probably had something to do with this memory loss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, that is my experience. It is actually quite hard to put into written words, and hopefully I‚Äôve conveyed myself well enough.  I am a believer 100%, that this experience was real and UFO‚Äôs do exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in my home in rural Shirleysburg, PA.   It was sometime in the evening after dark when I heard a noise outside.   I opened the door to my front porch to see what it was.  My neighbor had stopped to get her mail from her mailbox.  It was then that I noticed rapidly blinking colored lights in the southern sky.  I thought perhaps it was a satellite.  Very strange, I had never seen a satellite do this.  I called to my daughter to come and see.  Shortly afterwards,  5 UFO crafts flew directly overhead at treetop level.  Each craft had 4 spherical shaped bright yellowish glowing lights underneath in a V shaped pattern. The front two of the lights were closer together than the back two.  You could not hear any sound from the crafts as they few over.   Soon thereafter the air force chased after them.   They were quite noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friends discribed a &amp;quot;Orange ball of fire&amp;quot; that was hovering over a small country store adjacent to the highway.  As my friends got closer, the &amp;quot;Ball of fire&amp;quot; changed into a cone shape.  The craft had something on the outside that started to revolve,on the thrid revolution, the craft made an initial dart and then left at an incredible speed.<n>

Suddenly bright overwhelming light thru the black raining night. I saw a craft traveling low going east to west completely dominant with it wings on backwards for the direction it was traveling. I was amazed and ran out side to find the object gone. Next day in the local paper reports of sighting. I have told few people of what I saw but brush it off as a experimental out of nearby Moffet Field.  I can see it vividly still and can draw its shape.. As I get older I still wonder what it was. I can still see the square lights that were attached to the wings. They were so strong and backlit the craft shape. This is the firsttime I`ve ever talked about this incident<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness in this case hold a very responsible position, and would be construed to be a qualified observer.  We have requested an illustration from the witness, and a copy of the newspaper article, which may allow confirmation of the date.  Date above may be approximate.  Given the proximity of the sighting to Moffett Field in San Jose, we cannot rule out some kind of unusual aircraft, but it would be surprising to have such an aircraft flying apparently very low over a populated area.
