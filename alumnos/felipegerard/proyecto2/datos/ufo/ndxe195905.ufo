5/30/59 17:00|Cincinnati|OH|Disk|60 minutes|Large saucer shaped craft hanging motionless and silently over Cincinnati. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61668.html|1|ndxe195905| Large saucer shaped craft hanging motionless and silently over Cincinnati.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this info is very old but wanted to report it as I never have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 years old at the time of this sighting.  The weather was clear and sunny.  I was walking past a large part in an area refered to as &#34;Queen City&#34; when something caught my eye and I looked up and saw a very large saucer shaped craft approximately one hundred yards in diamater and about a mile from me and at about fifteen hundred feet altitude.  It appeared to be unpolished stainless steel in color and looked like two saucers turned on top of each other with a row of dark windows separating the two.  I saw no structures above or below it.  It was tilted at a 45% angle toward me and did not appear to be rotating or moving at the time and made no sound at any time.  After a few minutes I realized that it was moving very slowing, almost &#34;drifting&#34; southward and over the Ohio River into Northern Kentucky and the Greater Cincinnati Airport.  By the time it got to this point the object was now tilted at a nearly 80% angle.  By this time the light was starting to fade considerable, making contiued visual contact very difficult so I went back to my uncles home.  I did not mention this incident to anyone for many years for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time of the sighting,I looked around several times thinking that other people would be watching it as well.  I saw no one observing this very large saucer shaped object in broad day light over a large public park in a very large city.  I saw no-one!  I was amazed!!  I thought, &#34;I cann&#39;t believe that no one else is looking at this thing!&#34;  It was RIGHT THERE big as life and no one else was noticing it.  To this day I don&#39;t understand why it seemed that only I could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  One of two excellent reports from same source.  PD))<n>
5/15/59 04:00|Evanston|IL|Unknown|20 minutes|Distant craft in the same part of the sky for 3 nights, seen by a group|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32306.html|2|ndxe195905| Distant craft in the same part of the sky for 3 nights, seen by a group<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred over several nights.  I was a university student, living in a dormitory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first night, I saw a distant craft.  The reason I knew it was a craft and not a star was that it did not move at all - and then at a certain point - it took off and disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same thing occurred on the second night.  This time I had one or two friends with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the third night, I gathered a group of the other members in my dorm (perhaps 8-15 others), and we all watched it do the same exact thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the fourth night, I called the observatory on campus - and the craft did not appear.  I felt that the beings in the craft knew I had called the observatory, and that&#39;s why it didn&#39;t appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All along, as I (and then we) looked at the craft, I felt the craft members knew we were watching them, and were in fact looking back at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw a bright orange/yellow circle, approx. 10 ft in diameter, silently cruising about 50 feet above the ground. It was as bright as the sun. My younger brother asked me what it was. I told him it was the sun, although I knew it wasn&#39;t... at 8 years old, I had no other answer given my limited frame of reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They chased it, threw rocks at it. It drifted silently on it&#39;s course at about 5 mph, until it passed over our backyard and out of sight. It could have been in June of that year because it was warm that morning...perhaps the beginning of summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/59 18:30|Columbus|OH|Light|2-3 min|Red-orange lights over seen motionless over Lockborne AFB-one vanished and one sped out of sight.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21805.html|4|ndxe195905| Red-orange lights over seen motionless over Lockborne AFB-one vanished and one sped out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself  and two other musicians were on our way to the entrance of Lockborne Air Force base.  We were to play a dance job at the service club. I was in the front far right looking out an open window at the many reddish orange lights over the base attached to tall structures of all kinds, when I suddenly realized I had been staring at two red-orange lights, side by side, but not attached to anything. They were completly motionless and silent. I had been fixed on these lights several seconds,but the instant I consciously knew what I was looking at, the right light vanished and the other shot off to the north and out of sight in an instant, in complete silence.  As I turned my head to follow it, I realized my friend to my left was also looking at it.  The driver didn&#39;t see it, and when we spoke of it, the driver joked about our seeing &#34;flying saucers.&#34;  A peculiar thought I had latter was that it took a month or more for me to admit to myself that I had seen what could be called a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
