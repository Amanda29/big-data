8/22/64 18:40|Florence|AL|Disk|1 minute|Typical "saucer shaped craft" followed a valley leading to a major hydroelectric plant on the Tennessee River.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27493.html|1|ndxe196408| Typical &#34;saucer shaped craft&#34; followed a valley leading to a major hydroelectric plant on the Tennessee River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my job as 6:00 PM News Anchor at the local TV station.  The street leading away (east) from the station dipped into a severe valley, up the other side and then flattened out for the trip into the town itself.  As I approached the downward (eastward direction) side of the valley I noticed, perpherially, a semi-gloss, silver, saucer shaped object with a slight dome on top.  The dome was one-third the thickness of the saucer which I estimated to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and (including dome)about 15 to 20 feet tall from the bottom to the dome top.  The bottom of the saucer was flat and unremarkable.  The saucer was traveling from my left to right (north to south) and was following the contour of the valley.  It seemed to be traveling at about 30 miles per hour.  It was totally silent. There were muted red and blue lights circling the perimeter of the saucer.  I could not tell if the entire saucer was rotating or just the light rotating around it. As I approached the bottom of the valley, so did the saucer.  I brought my car to a stop and jumped into a ditch as it looked as if we were going to meet at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer passed approximately 25 to 30 feet above and to the east of me and blotted out a full moon in the process of following the valley southward toward the Tennessee River and The Power System Service Shops of The United States Tennessee Valley Authority in addition to Wilson Dam, a hydro-electric facility built around World War II.  The event happened at 1840 hours as that was the time I left work every evening.  I never saw the object again.  However, several years later (1969-71) so many saucers were seen &#34;feeding&#34; off high voltage power eminating from Wilson Dam that it became a popular thing to go north of Florence a few miles and park to watch the saucers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of my sighting I did not even tell my wife, much less put it on the air for fear of being put away since &#34;saucers&#34; were for &#34;kooks&#34; only, not respectable News Men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/20/64 22:45|St. Petersburg|FL|Unknown|45 minutes|I saw very strange lites in the sky one night that seemed to hypnotise me for a half an hour.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74967.html|2|ndxe196408| I saw very strange lites in the sky one night that seemed to hypnotise me for a half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Joe Late august of 1964, I went to my neighborhood buddys house to lift weights about 3 blocks away from my house.  I had just turned 16 and was thinking I was now allowed to drive but here I was walking.  It was 9:00 PM and I had to be home at 11:00 PM.  So at 10:45 I headed home. No booze, no drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked along in the quiet night, I felt someone was watching me.  I turned to look up and and right there, probably 500 feet up and back was this set of lites that I felt was watching me.  The white square lites quickly blinked and moved from left to right like a marquee drews ones eyes along. I got the impression they were windows.  As a &#34;Coast Guard brat&#34;,I grew up around naval bases and was familiar with aircraft.  Even blimps make noise at relatively close range.  This was silent and I stared for approximately 30 minutes or so. It never moved and neither did I.  Finally, It just very slowly moved off from northwest to a southeastward direction. I slept all night and saturday until 4:00 in the afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother had my dad go to the C.G. base the next day to see what he could find out.  He came home tight lipped and we all just went on with our lives but never forgot this incident.  My mother always said that this episode did something to me.  I say it just made me aware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was not a large bird because the clouds would pass under it and the shape was too large at that elevation to be a bird soaring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115816.html|4|ndxe196408| Point of light moving at high speed with stops describing a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this happened 50 years ago, but the memory is as clear as yesterday.  I was 14 yrs. old at a camp on the Delaware River, working as a nature counselor.  A large field there was perfect for astronomy and on good viewing nights, I would be out trying to locate constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the incident night I started about 2300 and continued to 0100, the date was about 20 Aug., &#39;64, but may have been a few days before.  There was no moon, the sky was ink black with brilliant stars, at this time.  I was looking south.  I saw what appeared to be some shooting stars, not uncommon, but then a star moving as fast as a shooting star caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light, as a bright star just to the left of the center of the sky moved from left to right, stopped then turned south moved about a quarter distance of the sky stopped turned back to the left recrossed turned again a returned to the starting point.  The path was rectangular and did not look like an aircraft in a holding pattern, as the turn points was sharp right angles.  I had started studying for flight training and had 10-12 hours by age 16, expensive, worked pumping gas at an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, in 1964 was just a dream with books.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The item that just was unnatural was the exact, clean, crisp 90 degree turn with no change in speed.  You could have used a right angle to draw the event.  I recognised then that for the turn to appear that crisp the object would have to be very far away but I had no comparison for distance, however the velocity was so high that it covered over 1/2 of the sky in 3 seconds.  So, see object point of light, high speed 3 seconds, stop acute turn, 2 seconds down, stop acute turn, 3 second flight, stop acute turn flight 2 seconds return to start point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This flight plath consisted of 3 cycles, then slight deviation out of pattern north for a second then gone, looked like acceleration then gone, not visisble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I graduated college, an infantry officer, medical school, and a instrument rated pilot and an AME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew at the time this was not a conventional aircraft.  The size of the flight path would require and extremely fast aircraft at distance flying squares.  On the other hand the aircraft would be much closer 10-15 miles, but then aircraft navigation lights, landing lights would be see and the turns would be gentle banking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was what illuminated, no twinkle, high speed, sharp 90 turns, then just disappeared. There it is, what it is.  I&#39;m seen a lot of aircraft from the ground and from the cockpit.  Never since have seen anything like this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

No sound....after about 45 minutes it left with incredable speed up and at somewhat of an horizontal flight...No aircraft around us and the Captain was baffled at this (phenomenia) also I had never gave much thought to UFO&#39;s until that night and now I always look in the sky for another possible look.........<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, but we are not certain.

I and 4 other friends we were on small valley sorrounded by small mountains we so this Flying Saucer shape object coming from the South and stop at this mountain about less than a quater of a smile away from where we were. The ship slow down at the mountain as if they were looking for something on the ground.  All of us we kept quite and the ship was there for aproximately 30 minutes or so. The ship was following like a rectangular pattend at the top of the mountain. The ship never landed there, but after been there for that time it took off on a Northeast course, crossing the sky in a matter of about 30 seconds. That was very very fast. There were no noise coming from the ship.  The following day we went to the mountain during the day to look around.  The only thing we found at the top of the mountain was sea shells and brain coral like if the mountain at some point was under water.  We didn&#39;t find any thing unsual.  To this date some of the people that we were there still said: What was that thing that we so there.  I guess we will never know.  The only thing I can say is what ever that was, it was not from here.  At that time that happen I was 14 years old, sometime ago. I will never ever forget the shape of the ship as longer as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window to see if i could see where it went but no sign of it any where.<n>

At about 9PM, was out on the beach.    Saw triangular shaped object, very large, out to the west of the coast, moving from north to south.  This object was silent.  A smaller object, which resembled an airplane, was &#34;following&#34; the triangular shaped object and was darting back and forth at the rear of the object (I think it was a military aircraft).  My father is an aircraft mechanic and FAA inspector.  I have grown up around airplanes and have a better than average knowledge of aircraft (both military and civilian) and have never seen anything like this object.  A few days after viewing this object, I had the opportunity to speak with the gentlemen who manned the radar station at Cambria/San Simeon.  I told him what I saw and asked if he had seen these objects on his radar screen that evening, but he said nothing at all had shown up on his radar screen that night.<n>

In the far distance, over the nearby ocean and near, I would guess, to Block Island, RI, a very bright light, like a bright star, came up out of the ocean at a 45 degree angle; it continued to zig-zag at 45 degree angles upward for a few seconds, as if gaining speed to get out of the earth&#39;s gravity, then shop straight up and out of sight.  We both looked at each other, amazed. No one we told believed us; I am 50 now, so we were about 15 at the time. We just happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. I would imagine on a nice summer night, others saw the same thing, particularly people on Block Island, a tourist resort.  I would estimate the object was about 10 to 12 miles away, putting it very close to Block Island.<n>

The fence was mostly cedar posts but there were 2 trees, cedar, about 30-40 feet high in the fence row also, the trees glowed as it rolled through them. I was about 10 at the time my nieghbor was 16, the ball of what we thought to be ball lightning moved completely and slowly to the end of the fence line and went back up in the air 20-30 feet and disappeared. I remember fear and awe and wanted to go look at the fence but we didn&#39;t at that time. The next day I was going to go back there and see if the trees blew up when it hit them but when I opened the gate to the feild I noticed something very strange, we had a few white ducks and one was sitting on the ground as though sound asleep, no head or neck, no blood, no scattered feathers, it only had a slight concave portion were the neck would have conected to the body, again no blood. It wasn&#39;t even red or meat colored, it was grayish. I went on to the fence line 300 yards away and all was the same as normal, trees fine, no marks or burns. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but wouldn&#39;t lightning have singed the bark, or leaves or weeds along the fence row? Later that morning, within an hour of that anyway, I had my first nosebleed, the only one I have ever had in 49 years. There is also 1 more detail I am very hesitant to put in here, actually 2, 1 I will tell you the other will remain a secret because it is way, way too weird to tell. The morning I got up to go check the fence line, the day of the nosebleed, that morning when I awoke to go downstairs my brother started telling my grandmother about a dream he had, I stopped in in the middle of the dream and finished it, I had the same exact dream. No I can&#39;t say it was about aliens, I don&#39;t remember what it was about, but it was exactly the same dream. The fire ball was exactly as it sounds, fire ( Orange,red, and yellow) ball, close to the size of the largest tree in the fence row, thats how I ascertained or guessed the size. Please feel free to ask me any questions or for the name of the witness. The fire ball by the way made no noise, and left a glowing trail as it rolled down the fenceline that lasted a few breif seconds.<n>

My sister, brother and I along with friends were jumping rope in our backyard. My age was 10? at the time. We began to see an object approaching very slow, large silver, cigar shaped. Size was larger than any jet I have seen. It stopped directly above our 3 story house(approx 10 ft above) as if watching what we were doing. We all saw that the object had stopped, blocked out the sun, and no noise was heard. We ran screaming into the house as did our friends. Within moments everyone, including my parents, my friends and their parents, were outside to witness this object. It had begun to move slowly over the street then quickly accelerated into the sky. We all watched this for about 10 min. as the object stopped again before quickly disappearing. We still talk about this incident to this day, really terrified us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were 5 circular lights hovering over the house.  They were in perfect formation...Exactly like the lghts reported on TV on the Arizona event...The lights hovered in the air and then disappeared one by one slowly into the dark of the night as though the darkness just opened up and the lights just slipped inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately 1964 of 1965..I was only 17 or 18 years old, and I was standing outside with my boyfriend&#39;s little brother, who was only 5 yrs old at the time..The reason for reporting it now is because I was so impressed with the Arizona incident last year.  I was young at the time and didn&#39;t know to report this. I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me. My boyfriend at the time lived on Kildare Ave. If I remember correctly, the address was 2202 (or close to it).  What I do remember is that he lived close to the corner, the 2 streets were Tripp Ave. and Kildare, in Chicago. The lights were white and very bright. Five lights across the sky and they were very low...there was absolutely no sound, moving ever so slowly...When I looked up, I was so excited, I told my Mikie to run in and get everyone to come outside to see...he was so frightened, he cried running up the stairs...well by the time anyone listened to him and they finally came out, the lights had disappeared into the sky as thou the sky opened up and the lights just slipped into the darkness one by one. On that morning of the announcement of the lights that appeared over Arizona, I went into shock, I didn&#39;t know who to call first....My best friend now, who is now my x-husband, I called. I was jumping up and down.  I couldn&#39;t believe that there it was again. And now the whole world was finding out...THOSE were the exact same lights... I wanted to tell someone...I don&#39;t remember the exact date and time...But I remember the incident, I have never forgotten that night...I wanted to know if anyone else had seen those lights around that time.....It was the summer and it was either 1964 or 65, it may have even been 1963. I was married in 1965 which leaves me to believe it may have been 1963 or 1964, because it was befor I was married, and I was married on Aug. 21, 1965. Thank you.<n>
8/1/64 06:00|Stonington|CT|Disk|1/2 hour|A Genuine Spaceship|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40011.html|18|ndxe196408| My parents had left the house early one morning and called from a phone booth.  My mother told me to wake my brother and look out the bedroom window.  When we did, we saw a large saucer-shaped object hovering over the neighbor&#39;s house just to the right of ours.  The craft was large and I thought to myself it couldn&#39;t be as close as it looks - it was just because of it&#39;s large size that it looked so close.  It was a silver metallic object with lights underneath.  It hovered for about 1/2 hour or so until the sun started to come up.  At that time, it took off swiftly at an angle and within seconds disappeared.  Later that summer, while at the beach one night with friends, we spotted three mysterious lights in the sky that seemed to be following us and then in an instant they too took off at an angle and disappeared.  That was the last time I ever saw anything again.  My brother and I recall the sighting when we see each other.  He always asks me, &#34;Did we really see it?&#34; and the answer is always the same.  Yes we did!  Why my parents never reported it, I don&#39;t know or whether they ever mentioned it to anyone else, I don&#39;t know. All I know is, we saw it and it wasn&#39;t any kind of military vehicle that I have ever seen in all my years.  It&#39;s hard to be sceptical when you know you have seen something like that so vivid and so, so real.  My parents were just normal people.  My father a commercial fisherman and my mother a homemaker.  My brother and I were just normal school-aged kids.  I was around 16 years old and my brother was 11 or 12.  I consider myself a very logical and methodical person who has always questioned everything throughout my life.  There is no explanation for what we saw - but I know we saw it and no one will ever make me believe it was anything other than what it looked like - a genuine spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I drove under it it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no colours in the light and no noise that I heard I am a down to earth farmer who is in no way fanciful. In fact I didn&#39;t tell anyone except my wife untill recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on a country road and as far as I know nobody else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
