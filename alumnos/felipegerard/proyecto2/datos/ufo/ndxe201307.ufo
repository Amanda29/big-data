I walked to my Car an sat on my trunk  facing east.  While I was talking to my friend he mentioned that he had seen a dark object in the sky.  He quickly said it was nothing, so I continued with our conversation.  Then a police helicopter had flew by us very quickly.::  As the time for us was getting closer to end our break, I was facing east and was watching a co-worker enter the factory, I randomly looked up and saw a dark object fly by so quickly and shoot a beam of light and quickly curve up and vanish into the sky.  It happened so quickly I could Not believe it.  Sure was real.<n>

Once again I saw something different than I&#39;ve seen before and something I cannot explain.  While looking towad the South East a bright star like object appeared from no where and grew extremly bright then shot across the sky heading Northe West at an amazing speed.  It left a trail behind it as it went obver head.  It looked almost like a meteor only it was flying straight across the sky instead of travelling downward.  It kind of looked like it could be a missle almost since it travelled so fast but it made no sound whatsoever.  It lasted about 5-6 seconds before it dissapeared out of site.  It was NOT a falling star or a meteor so I am calling it a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approximately 200 feet above the ground, below cloud level.   My husband and I were sitting outside with our two boys.  My younger said &#34; Mom, whats that?&#34;  And pointed to the sky.  When I looked and saw what he was pointing to, I saw a fireball, orange flames, very distinct.  There was some cloud cover, but not in the path of the fireball.  It dipped past the tree line and out of sight.  It was silent.<n>

Started as always with 2 due south of us (loop 303 and Northern Ave) in the area of Goodyear.  We also saw a line formation (east to west) just to the South/West of our location to the buckeye area.  And then to My surprise, there was also another formation just to the West of them in a vertical line (up/down). In total, East/West line formation of 5 Orange Lights, and then just to the West and a little lower than the first line was the second formation up/down of another 5.  And then we also had the 2 to the South and a Third joins them in the middle and just above them.  It Was A Great Viewing Night For Us.<n>

We witnessed four unknown craft that were cigar-shaped and appeared light orange in color were flying erratically(sometimes motionless)some distance from one another.  After approximately five minutes each of the four craft left moving slowly in different directions and then left quickly almost as if they disappeared.  One of the four craft was visible for about 15 more seconds after the others vanished then was gone also.<n>

It was low enough that we saw it when it crossed the road to be in front of the tree line along Bittersweet rd.  so I think it went behind the house on the left and crossed the road in front of the tree line to the right .. it was too low to have traveled down bittersweet .<n>

It didn&#39;t make any noise or have any lights. It started off as a ball type object with what looked like a flag type tail at the end of the ball.  As it moved it got smaller the shape changed to what looked like a boomerang.  And then a cresant moon. I used my camera phone to take a very detailed photo of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I thought at first that they were helicopters, as in Baltimore city helicopters fly uncomfortably low.  I realize now that was just my natural reaction as a human, trying to relate something insane to something known.  I looked harder as they started flying lackadaisically over one another.  I grabbed my iPhone (for those of you who are familiar, when you click the button there is a swipe feature allowing the camera to open in about 20 seconds) and did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my camera was up (about 30 seconds) they had flown high above me into the clouds, barely visible but I was able to snap a few photos for proof.

They did get smaller as they moved further away.  As they vanished, I did turn around and notice a plane in the sky. we knew it wasn&#39;t anything like that.  My husband thought it might have been a flare., but 2 of them? and both straight and perfect, slowly vanishing?  I thought it looked like a sphere of 3 orange units together.  My husband thought it was a solid unit. Its a mostly clear night.  It happen about 10;45pm. no wind. no clouds in the direction it was heading.  And after it all. we notice it was aligned with Orion&#39;s Belt.<n>

They were moving at a consistent pace west to east (too slow for an airplane, but too quick to be carried by the wind).  One was slightly ahead of the other and further south, but in close proximity to each other.  I did not notice any other shape with or around them.  I was able to watch them for approximately 1 minute until they past the tree line.

They were moving slowly eastward following each other.  They were flying relatively low at first, but gradually increased their altitude.  Then, they stopped for several seconds, and one after the other flew upward very quickly and vanished from my sight.  They did not make any noise. I was able to observe the strange orange lights for 3-4 minutes before they disappeared.  I do not believe in UFOs, but this was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter, a balloon, or anything that I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lighted object first went left for a while, stopped again, then turned right, stopped again, and eventually went right over the top of us.  From there it stopped again, and there was no additional noise even though it appeared to be fairly close, it then went away from us in that same odd pattern, going one way, stopping, then going another way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t long before it just decided to take off I guess, and went off slowly away from Selah and disappeared behind some trees going away from Yakima/Selah area.  I tried to follow it but it was just gone.  The whole thing lasted around ten minutes or so.<n>

I am a 19 year old female home for summer break while my brother is 24.  We have witnessed strange sighting of objects in the sky before especially over the last few weeks but have no decided to submit a report until now.  We witnessed an object which at first appeared to be a star very low in the sky, just above the treetops in the distance.  We watched the light/object for around 5 minutes. The object appeared to be flickering and flashing slightly.  We first noticed the object because we thought it was unusual to see a star that low in the sky and have had previous experiences seeing strange objects in the sky line while out on our balcony.  After watching the object for a few minutes, we felt a little uneasy and decided to go back inside.  I suggested to my brother that we use our telescope to look at the object with a better view.  My brother got the telescope and went back onto the balcony.  When he got back to the balcony, which was probably around 3 minutes later, the object was noticeably lower in the sky, closer to the treeline than it had been before.  He set up the telescope and tried to focus on the star-like object.  He got a decent unfocused glimpse of the object for around 10 seconds and noticed flashing lights and changing colors within the object.  He stated that the object almost seemed organic.  He watched the object slowly descend and straddle the treeline for a few seconds.  It then dipped below the treeline and stayed there for a few seconds, before popping back up for another few seconds.  It then slowly descended beneath the treeline and did not come back up.<n>

There is a creek at the end of my street so I was wondering how they came out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing started walking up my street and it was walking very weird and was wearing black robes and a weird hat with a point and a curve and had feathers on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I hid behind my car waiting until it walked near my house. Note: it was walking the same pace the whole time.  And I said &#34;hey what are you doing&#34; and they didn&#39;t say anything back and kept on walking at the same pace up the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I started following them and at the other end of my street are more woods.  I was right behind this thing!  The thing got to someones yard and I was 5 feet behind it and started walking into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the flashlight on my phone real fast; within 2 seconds.  I didn&#39;t stop walking when I was turning it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up with my flashlight, i! t was gone...  It just vanished into thin air.  Nothing! I looked all over with my flashlight, there was nothing. I just don&#39;t know. I want and explanation and I want it soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want to live in fear know what I saw.

7/30/13 21:00|Baltic|CT|Triangle|1 minute|3 very bright bloodred orbs flying in perfect triangular formation and smaller object approaching from opposite direction|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100839.html|26|ndxe201307| 3 very bright bloodred orbs flying in perfect triangular formation and smaller object approaching from opposite direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> On tues July 30 @approx 9:00pm while in my backyard with my wife eldest boy 23 yrs and his girlfriend 21 yrs old we witnessed three very bright red objects flying in a triangular formation coming out of the NW traveling SE.  The objects took approx 1 min to travel 110 degrees of sky and were totally silent.  Upon reaching near zenith the objects began to flicker in and out of the visual spectrum and the central part of each blood red orb began to chage color and twinkle as well white and yellow light.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be another smaller dimmer object approaching from the opposite direction.  As it approached and passed the larger objects it appeared to execute an abrupt u turn and speed off trailing the other objects and disappear from view along with the other objects!   See video taken by my wife on our ipad.  I own a 20 inch obsession telescope and have logged countless hours under the stars.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, furthermore I contacted the FAA requesting wind speed and direction for that evening @ 3000 6000 and 9000 thousand feet.  They informed me that I would have to file under the freedom of information act to get the info.  I followed up with NOAA and spent 150 minutes on the phone to get the info.  The wind was out ot the NW traveling SE the same direction as my friends, however the speed was minimal.......3 thsnd feet 12 knots......6 thsnd feet 13 knots.......9 thsnd feet 7knots.  At ground level no wind whatsoever!  This data comes directly from the Brookhaven sounding station in Brookhaven NY.  Note: in order to see the smaller object traveling in the opposite direction the video must be viewed in complete darkness.  I am sending Pete new videos one with increased brightness and one in negative. The smaller object is much more apparent.  I also performed a control with the ipad on the star Arcturus and could not seem to record it,so there is no way the smaller object could be a stationary background star.  The original video on my ipad also sho! wed the smaller object to be the same blood red color as the larger objects.  There are no stars in that part of the sky of that color or magnitude!

We were sitting on a deck overlooking the ocean. Four bright, circular lights suddenly appeared over the ocean in the northeast corner of the sky.  Objects were arranged in a straight line and appeared in the sky for about 20 seconds.  They then blinked out.  About 30 seconds later three of the lights re-appeared about 20 degrees further south.  They were also in a straight line and lit the sky for about 20 seconds.  Then they blinked out and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was witnessed by two other friends and me.  During both appearances, there was no sound from the lighted objectss at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Absolutely NO sound.  Moving quickly to the east.  My husband thought it was a hot air balloon but it couldn&#39;t be because I use to live in Goshen, New York, where many hotair balloons flew overhead in early morning or early evening because of the updraft... and it seemed to be too late for that and there was no sound coming from the shooting flame.  I believe it wound-up being too high for a balloon by the time it headed easterly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted a photo of it on Facebook on my account there -- and it wouldn&#39;t show up red... just a bright blurry vivid-white light.<n>

The aircraft was to the south and was writing a welcome message to the airshow participants.  Looking straight up from our position, myself and another person spotted a round, disk object moving west to east. It was flying in a slightly erratic line, that is, the object did make several very fast movements to the north and south.  Each movement could be measured in yards. Actual movement of the disk was less than 200mph when first observed.  By the time we could focus on the disk, it quickly moved to the east and out of our view behind trees.  Altitude and size of the disk would be a guess, but it did appear to be below the scattered cloud layer and lower than the &#34;skywriter.&#34;  There were at least 2-3 miles separating the two aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former air traffic controller and very familiar with aircraft.  The other person who also spotted the disk is a current captain of a &#34;jumbo jet&#34; aircraft for a major airline with over 30,000 hours of flight time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our knowledge, no one else reported or saw the disk and it was well above the flight pattern altitudes at OSH.  As a side note, one other person in our group is a high level manager in the FAA.

Decided to go have a drink of water and a cigarette.  I was in my garage with the garage window open leaning against the window seal.  About 250 yards away there is a treeline.  As I was looking out the window,  I noticed a solid orange light zip up above the trees.  It hung in place for approximately 20 seconds then proceeded to zig zag back and forth upward,pausing in place momentarily every few zigs. It left a faint trail as it moved.  I tried to capture a picture and video on my mobile phone but all it would capture is a solid black screen.  I noticed an airplane with a blinking light coming in the UFO&#39;s direction.  The orange light vanished in the blink of an eye upward as the airplane approached.  I waited for a few more minutes to see if it would come back but it never did.<n>

I watched this thing grow very very bright as it moved from west sky to east sky, it got very bright and then dimmed as it moved across the sky, it then again got very bright and went dim, and out of sight.  With no clouds in the sky, it seemed to be as high as a satellite.  As it moved to the eastern sky, a white ball fell directly north and went dim as it went out of sight behind a small apartment building.   As I was speaking to my husband tonight about the first incident 2 days ago, we witnessed a green light fall, much like the white one 2 nights ago.  This is why I have come on here to investigate what all this could be.  It definitely was not a plane, however, I thought perhaps it was the ISS, dropping garbage.  I really have no clue what this was, but in speaking to ! a friend, they have been witnessing fireballs landing to the north as well, around 10pm for a few evenings in the past week... all of the balls her family saw were red.<n>

It also stays in one spot for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my flash light with me one night and moved it back and forth in the air.  The object moved in sink with my flash light.

It&#39;s not an airplane either.  But, I have seen airplanes fly by this object.  I tried one night last week to get it on video using my camcorder.  I did catch it on video but it&#39;s not too clear and my hand was shaking a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears in the same area of the sky, between two trees in my back yard each time.  I&#39;m pretty sure it sees my flash light as it seems to move a little while I shine my flash light at it.  I don&#39;t know if it is from Moody AFB as the base isn&#39;t all that far away from here.  But, it doesn&#39;t look like an airplane.<n>

I was standing in my driveway, looking up at the stars. I was facing northwest or possibly north-northwest.  No one was with me.  I believe this was there for at least 5 minutes, as I let one dog back in and then waited for the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an airplane moving in a southern direction off to my left (west) and directly in the sky in front of me was a large bright white light, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was oval-shaped, but not perfectly oval, with a bright white center and then a bright white thick, fuzzy outer edge.  The area between the bright center and outer edge was darker and looked almost like you could see the sky behind it.  There were what looked like wisps of small thin clouds in this area. It was huge, huge, huge, there in the middle of the sky and very bright. (my guess would be twice the size of a full moon)  There was not a sharp edge to it, just fuzzy and bright.  It looked sort of like a giant eye staring at me.  My impression was that it was somehow electrified, like a neon sign in the sky.  It was stationary, not spinning, not pulsating, not changing in color, shape, or any other way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was framed by two pine trees behind my house.  I looked around for the moon, so I could have some kind of reference point for what I had just seen, but I couldn’t find the moon.  The sky was clear and I could see lots of stars.  I am not sure how far away it was.  I was standing about 20 feet down my drive way and it was above and behind my garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staring directly at it for just a second… or two, maybe three at the most; then it just vanished, with a streak of bright white light moving right to left (westerly direction) in an upward arc across the sky very, very fast. I would say as fast as a streak of lightening, only thicker and smoother.  The bright white streak was gone in about half a second, and then there was nothing.  The streak disappeared before reaching the rear of the airplane.  The plane, off to my left, was still in the sky, moving slowly, it seemed toward the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sure seemed like a space ship just took off right in front of me, but it didn’t look like anything I would imagine a space ship to look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also did not hear any sound from the two airplanes high in the sky, or any other sound in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has really shaken me up. I have never seen anything like this.  I would sure like to know if anyone else in Sammamish, WA saw this.<n>

As we were just entering the field from north fifth street, my husband started shouting &#34;look up!  Look straight above!&#34;.  It took me and my husbands daughter a second or two to spot what he was seeing.   All three of us saw three diamond shaped apparitions with red lights on the outside edges of all three diamonds.  All three were hovering/moving in unison, with the front object being slightly in front of the other two.  The objects appeared to be almost transparently gray in color, and appeared to be quite high in the sky.  As we all three watched, they continued moving forward quite quickly, and seemed to disappear into the atmosphere.  The event lasted all of about ten seconds.  We all agreed that it was a very strange occurrence, and that none of us had ever seen anything like it before.  The apparitions are a b! it hard to describe, but I have described them as best as I could.  Thank you for the opportunity to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Roughly 40ft above the tallest tree a pure white organic/living butterfly like shape UFO flouted over the trees and as soon as I saw it, the UFO became skittish/nervous like and disappeared.  The UFO did not dart off, but instead turned off like a light switch blacking out.  The UFO was about 60-80 feet in length, nonmetallic but instead organic or as if it was actually living.  The UFO was perfectly symmetrical, all white and with two tails.  The incident lasted no longer then a few seconds, and after seeing the UFO black out, my eyes began to feel a slight discomfort and irritation which continued throughout the next day.  The UFO did not make a sound.<n>

I was briefly perplexed thinking &#34;I didn&#39;t know there was a ball field out here.&#34;  Being that I was on a hill I had a fairly good view. As I proceeded down the hill I decided to pull over to get a better look.  I turned my truck off (it is a 5-speed and difficult to simply idle)and was struck by the deafening silence that surrounded me.  What had happened to the nightly frog and cricket orchestra that graced our country summers?  The two lights suddenly appeared to be so much closer (even though up until this point I had not seen them move).  They slowly advanced towards the road and within what seemed like a second were directly in front of me just a little above the tree line.  I said out loud &#34;oh my god, oh my god&amp;q! uot;.  It was now evident that the two lights were connected by a long, dark &#39;body&#39; which donned a row of small airplane-like lights of varying colors (red, blue, green).  The shape resembled a barbell with the lights being the weights.  It was about the size of a commercial airplane.  To be so humongous it was amazing that I heard NOTHING!  And the lights were so bright however my vision was unaffected. The vessel disappeared from my visual field once its entirety had crossed the road.  I pulled away and looking in my rear view mirror saw no further traces of the vessel.<n>

Upon going out, I noticed a UFO.  I hurried to get my camera and attempted to shoot some video. It was dark and although the object was clearly visible, it did take some time to find it in the camera view finder and then slowly zoom it in to the cameras maximum zoom of 50X.  I edited 2 minutes out where I had lost sight of it in the camera lens.  I had to find it in the lens (small) and then slowly zoom it in while trying to keep it focused.  But I think there is some pretty good footage.  Because of the black sky in the background, there is no depth perception.  The object was very stable except trying to hold the camera steady and zoomed in to 50X makes it appear shaky. The object was not moving, just the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed the object, it was at about 45 degrees above the horizon and moving very slowly to the north, northwest at 340 degrees from north.  It appeared to either be slowly descending or because of its movement, dipping at the horizon.  I would suspect that at the current location, and based on the direction and speed it would have been visible for at least 20 minutes over my house, but I did not see it earlier.  It was approx. 2135 hours when I first observed it and watched it for nearly 15 minutes or until about 2150 hrs. when it slowly became blurry behind a tree.  I could still see it occasionally through the limbs.  I had a strong handheld bright flashlight.  When I would attempt to shine it on the object, it would move left or right horizontally for a few degrees as if to get out of the beam of light.  Although, the flashlight never illuminated the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance, altitude and size are hard to judge as there was no reference. I would guess that based on my observations, it was 1-2 km distance and no more than a couple of thousand feet in altitude. If that were correct, I would guess the size to be several meters in diameter. As the object moved away, it would have been continuing out over the sea and over many fishing vessels. I live on an island and there are no aircraft anywhere close at night. I have never seen anything like this before. There are no unexplained objects in the sky here. Actually no objects at all! Although, I have observed satellites before and being a pilot, I know that this did not resemble any aircraft I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emitted no sound. It appeared triangular and had three steady bright lights. The lights were always on. No flashing. They appeared to be very bright white with a bluish glow around the peripheral. Although the lights appear mostly blue in the video. The actual triangle appeared to be oscillating left to right a few degrees as seen in the video. As the object oscillated, a fourth and fifth light would appear in the back of the object. Giving the impression that they were slightly out of view from me until the object revealed them while oscillating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights stayed at an even distance, giving the impression that they were all connected and it was one object. I initially took a little over 6 minutes of video, but later edited out 2 minutes of simply black screen when I was trying to reacquire the object in the view finder. Towards the end of the video, you will notice that the lights get blurry, because of the tree. I stopped filming at this point.<n>

My wife and I where outside talking . I was facing her and she was watching the night sky when she said &#34;What is that&#34;.  I turned in enough time to see what appeared to be a fireball about the size of a dime.  It was very overcast and dark out. No stars in the sky, the moon was not even present.  It was as bright as a lite match.  It was pulsing and color was changing from fire orange to bright red. It appeared in the south east portion of the night sky and was heading west.  It seemed to be moving 5 times the speed as a normal plane you would see in the sky and lasted about 30 to 40 seconds.  It suddenly stopped and in the blink of an eye changed directions to travel north.  Its speed then increased to 2 times the speed it was traveling before.  It was moving so quickly that it was gone before I could blink.<n>

At first I thought it was an orange taillight reflection of someone in the driveway, but then realized it went up too high.  So it was low when I first saw it and then it was higher.  Thought maybe it was an aircraft on fire, but it was soundless and floated along.  Looked too orange to be a balloon, but I guess it could have been.  Seemed to move quickly suddenly and went higher into the clouds.  Could have been wind currents.  I took a picture, but it was going further away and just looks like a red blob in the middle of a dark background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While looking at the sky my wife said what a pretty cloud, and I said it was. Just above the cloud was what appeared to be a star, as we looked at the cloud the star quickly moved down into the cloud.  My wife and I sat watching there were no other stars in the sky due to cloud cover.  I used the deck post as a reference to see if the cloud was moving, it was not but, the object did.  We  are familiar with satellite&#39;s and meteors and this was neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one thing is that stars don&#39;t jump into a cloud.   The UFO was in the eastern sky at about 45 degrees off  the tree line and promptly dropped down at a slight angle towards the ground into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about it the cloud would have had to jump straight up in a split second but the cloud was stationary.  We both agree it was not a plane or star but a UFO.<n>

I glanced in my driver&#39;s door mirror when I saw a small, round red light traveling a few inches below mirror level in the opposite direction that I was driving.  From my best estimate, the object was about one or two feet away from my car.  I would guess the object to be about the size of a &#34;JFK&#34; half dollar or an Eisenhower dollar from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other cars or motorcycles in sight in front or behind me so I ruled out a tail light reflection in the mirror or someone tossing a cigarette butt out of their car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not experience any strange feelings, communication or time loss at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Please feel free to contact me in so desired*<n>

I told the gest to look and she saw the same thing. The flying object look like it could have been frying about 15-20,000ft, moving forward in a slow speed and the light on it was changing, white, red, purple, and green.  About 30 seconds wile the guest and I were looking at it, it just disappeared, as if some on just flipped a switched.  It was partly cloudy that nigh but we kept looking to see if it was going to come out but it never showed back up.<n>

It did not seem to glow or anything, it was simply white against the grey background of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an elongated blimp of some sort, as it seemed larger than a plane, but flying way too slow to be a plane.  Then it sort of shrunk itself from end to end to the point of disappearing in a matter of 5 seconds, tops.  The whole event lasted 20 to 30 seconds.<n>

We both noticed a very, very bright orange light at 45 degrees north of us. Initially thought it was a planet.  As we watched it, a commercial airliner came in for a landing and we could tell this thing was much larger than an airliner and at a much higher altitude.  The thing resembled a Chinese lantern and flickered very bright orange and white light.  We continued to watch it as it flew overhead.  Once overhead, it was round and very light grey in color.  Made no sound and had a S-SE trajectory.<n>

Had intelligence<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down Colorado Blvd going back to my sisters house when out of the corner of my eye I saw something with lights hovering above the church on 38th. I did a u-turn on 40th and turned on 38th then stopped.  I recorded it on my sisters cell phone. While recording I noticed that the object was not showing up on the screen even though I was looking right at it.  I then stopped a guy that was walking and asked him if he saw it. He said &#34;ya you mean that square thing with the lights, it looks like a kite&#34;  It was NOT a kite. It was 2:30am. I then left and drove the short distance to my sisters.  I told her about it. When I told her it was still there when I left she wanted to go see if it was still there.  We drove back to that area and it was there hovering above the church.  We stopped on 38th and sat there bewildered as to what this object was.  My sister told me to drive under it. 02 Apprehensively I decided to drive down the alley just after the ! parking lot of the church.  As we maneuvered south down the alley the object hovered above but even with the car as it moved. When we reached 37th I turned left and stopped.  The object was hovering over 37th. As we were stopped a truck passed us and pulled over to see what we were looking at. They saw the object and thought it was peculiar.  They went about their business. My sister was trying to photograph the object (which we both concluded looked like a red transparent bubble with bluish white lights that seemed to be eyes.)   When the flash went off the object hovered/floated behind some trees as if it were trying to hide. I backed up down the street so we could see it.  I then decided to see if it would &#34;follow&#34; us and drove back up the street and it did indeed stay in close proximity to the car.  We parked in the church parking lot and got out. It was not threatening in anyway, just odd.  The two guys in the truck drove back by, saw us still looking and pulled into the parking lot.  The four of us could not determine what it ! was.  It did somewhat resemble a balloon so one of the guys tried to locate where a string was that would be tethering the object and was unsuccessful. Meanwhile my sister called her boyfriend and he showed up.  He too was baffled as to what this floating/hovering object could be.  The two guys in the truck left and my sister, her boyfriend and I just watched.  It seemed to be looking at us with the lights.  The lights moved as if it were thinking or computing.  I&#39;m not sure of the correct word... It had intelligence.  By the time we left it was 4:00am and the object never went out of sight.  We left it, it didn&#39;t disappear.  During this time we also saw 2 what seemed to be stars go from standstill to across the sky.  It was like they took it out of park and moved quickly across the entire sky.<n>

It was traveling to the south west at a steady rate but was going slower than an airplane or chopper.  It had two very bright rear facing lights parallel to eachother and it appeared to be shaped like a tri-angle this object was quite close at most maybe only a third of a mile away from me when it was at its closest point.  There was absolutley no sound as it flew.

(center meaning the narrow spot of the bone shape) 7 miles south there is an air port.  just east of the air port there are several patches of buildings.  The building being there isn&#39;t so odd.

It was silent. I asked my neighbor who pulled up at the time it was over head what he thought it was and his guess was mosquito helicopter. I thought it was a helicopter too until I realized it was so close and making no noise.  The craft then came to a stand still in the tree line and went straight down within a few hundred feet of our home. we went out front to try and spot it again but there was nothing. I have blurry video of the craft on a cell phone but the video does not do this craft justice.  It was quite close and the phone would not focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

After about 15-20 minutes at approximately 10:40 pm 3 lights appeared simultaneously in the sky that were in a triangular formation.  They looked like stars at first but continued to get brighter and brighter until they were brighter than any of the stars in they sky.  The lights were solid, not blinking or pulsating.  They were about 3/4 the way up from the horizon from the south when they first appeared and then started moving in unison northward.  That&#39;s when I could tell it was a triangular craft and the 3 lights were actually one light on each end point.  The shape seemed slightly more wedge-like than  equilateral with it&#39;s 2 sides being a little longer than the back.  It continued to move slowly until it was almost right above me and then the lights faded out and it was gone. It was also completely silent.  All of this lasted about 20 seconds.  I would say that if you were trying to gauge th! e size you could have fit about 6 moons inside it.<n>

I finally gave in and let him out onto the deck where he started to growl as he looked up toward the sky.  I did not see anything at first and then I noticed several objects in the sky come from the southeast then turn almost due north.  Each object was amber in color and made up of 3 circles.  There were 4 of these objects in formation and they were silent.  I called to my wife to take a look and she saw them as well.  I’m a pilot and thought at first that it might be some military exercise as we are near the Bangor airport.  But what struck me as strange was that these objects had no navigation lights, were totally silent, and kept coming in groups of 4.  It was difficult to estimate the altitude or speed but I would say that they were possibly less 1,000 feet AGL.  They moved at a constant speed, not fast or slow.  We observed 20-24 of these objects and they all followed the same path from the southeast turning northerly.  A few minutes after the last group passed, our cat calmed down and came in and slept quietly the rest of the night.  It’s almost as though he sensed something unusual.  Unfortunately, we did not think to take any photos.<n>

There were a few clouds to the southeast, but it was relatively clear across the rest of the sky.  There was a light breeze and no moon, and it was quite cool for the time of year.  We hadn’t been out long when I asked my husband where the binoculars were, which he said he would get them.  I spent a few moments looking at Mars and Saturn and a few deep sky objects.  Shortly after 10 PM I decided to put the binoculars back in the garage, and just as I turned toward the door I noticed a bright orange ball of light coming up over the southern horizon traveling east.  I pointed it out to my husband and asked what it was.  At first my mind tried to make sense of the sight, thinking it was a helicopter or plane on fire, but it made no sound at all.  After a moment I realized the binoculars were still around my neck, and I looked at the! object, seeing only a perfectly round ball of deep orange light.  The color flickered like a flame into different shades of orange, but it remained constantly lit.  It never blinked or made any sort of pattern.  It was hard to judge how big or how far away it was, but it was slow-moving and appeared to be low in the sky, its path a relatively straight line.  I handed the binoculars over to my husband and ran into the house hoping to get my camera ready, but by the time I made it back it had disappeared.  It just “faded out” as my husband described it, and he wondered if maybe it just disappeared behind the clouds, so we went up into the yard hoping to see it again, but we never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been stargazing since I was a child, and I know what jets, helicopters, satellites, and meteors look like in the night sky, and this was none of those things.<n>

While driving she noticed a strange fiery object in the eastern sky traveling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not prepared for what I saw.  Because I was in the passenger seat, I was able to follow the object as it passed by.  Initially it appeared to be a flamelike aura.  As it came closer I noticed three equidistant non-flashing white lights on a slight angle, surrounded by a dark shadow against the cloudy night sky.  The laser-like fire appeared to be pulsating around the lights and shadowy form, moving from front to back.  We followed it, as it passed and I noticed that it made a semi-circular turn toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the cars behind us seemed to have turned to follow it.  My head was hanging out of the window when my wife turned to me and said, take a picture.  I did not react quickly enough and was paralyzed in amazement.	 	 My brain cannot register exactly what we saw, however it was nothing that either of us have ever seen.  A real live U.F.O.

It caught my attention because the object was obviously not a plane; as opposed to the flashing lights and shape of a plane, the object I witnessed did not flicker and was fiery in appearance.  The sighting did not last long. The object started to fade and dim before disappearing completely from sight.  It absolutely vanished.  I kept watching for a couple minutes afterward to verify this, and never saw it reappear nor did I see any aircraft at any distance from the sighting.<n>

It&#39;s about 2 in the morning and we look up and I though I saw a plane which is common for this area but the closer I watched it no lights were blinking like the usual planes do.  It was almost like an orange glow.  The object seemed pretty high in elevation and if that&#39;s the case then it was moving very fast and also it was silent. I would hear a plane at normal elevations and it didn&#39;t make a sound which leads me to believe it was very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began the shine my flashlight at the object and repeatedly turned it on and off with it pointed at the object.  Then after about ten seconds the object just disappeared.  I couldn&#39;t say if it sped up really fast and that made it disappear or whether the light turned off but either way it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing just seemed very unnatural and freaked me out a bit.

It was too big to be a satellite and it paused overhead and then started moving east. It disappeared after a few seconds of travel.  It was larger than a satellite or the ISS. I’ve seen both and this was not the same. I had seen a shooting star 5 min before seeing this object. I also saw a BRIGHT flash in the sky “Like Lightning “butt the sky was crystal clear.  It seemed very large and at a very high altitude. ???  It was an exciting experience.<n>

I had been sitting on the porch for about a minute when I heard a strange noise and saw what I thought was motion.  I stood up to see what caused all of this and witnessed several brilliant flashes of light northwest of my home.  The flashes were oval in shape and very bright.  They appeared to come from behind the tree line at approx. a 30 degree angle from my location.  The noise I heard was akin to a vibration or hum.  The color of the initial flash was a blue/white light and other colors followed.  Those flashes were over in an instant, but afterwards the sky pulsated with a strange orange/red glow in the same area for approx. 5-10 mins.   My wife was with me to see the red glow pulsing in the sky.<n>

I get binoculars to see up close (I had them handy) and see its in a shape of a triangle.  I watched the sky longer to see 3 more one by one fly up.  It seemed as if they were taking off from the airport by my house.  Inclining and gaining speed it looks as if these air crafts can hover and glide, like the sky were one big playground.<n>

I ran through the house yelling for my husband to follow me to the front yard to watch it pass, saying I think a helicopter is on fire.  We both stood in the front yard unable to identify what we were seeing.  We watch the sky a lot so we know most of the aircraft that pass this way.  This craft proceeded to silently travel south and turned east just past the Battlefield Mall.<n>

I thought maybe I could wish upon a star to make things better and when I looked up to the sky I saw a large, yellow/orange glowing orb of light.  It hovered above the treeline for only maybe 4 seconds and then it seemed to beam behind the treeline.  Of all my years I have seen nothing like this ever.  I told one of my close friends of the occurrence and she too said she had seen a similar sighting the night before.  I am not saying I believe in extraterrestrials, but it is definitely I&#39;m not saying isn&#39;t possible now.<n>

A disk shape craft with a red light on each side, and white flashing light underneath.  Again, at great height 1000 feet I would guess but, from the shape and lights it was the same one or one which looked the same as the one I had been hearing and seeing since 11-25-10.  This makes many many times, I believe, I have seen or heard this craft, in the last 3 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They definitely have some interest in this area, or someone, in this area.  I have repeatedly checked the various sites I have found online and done searches but, since no one else in this area, is reporting anything like this number of sightings of this craft.  I can only guess, it is me, they are visiting.  I just hope, whatever the case, it continues and perhaps someday, I have the opportunity to meet them, awake, aware, 1 on 1, as equals, I think they must have a reason for all these visits, and I intend to find out, if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If one was not looking, it would have been missed.    It was traveling at a speed that was faster than an aircraft, but slower than a meteor.    It was round and no lights, nor any type of metallic to it, but it was definitely a craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It progressed over our house and was on a direct course to the southeast.   As it was beyond our vision, it entered into some light pollution from the shopping mall nearby and it changed into a triangle like form and then disappeared.    It was very strange and only lasted a minute if that.  I have never seen anything like it before, very strange as if it was trying to maneuver quickly without drawing attention.<n>

So I pulled over to try to get a better look at them. When doing so I noticed them changing positions several times.  Tried to capture a photo but the street lights where to bright. So we got back into the car and tried to move to a darker location.  By the time we where able to do this they where there for about 10 seconds and then they where gone.  I have been looking into ufos for quite sometime but have never seen anything before now.  As for my wife she has never believed in anything like this and she still can&#39;t seem to grasp what we really seen.<n>

I was laying in bed when I noticed a red light reflecting off one of our windows that was open.  I got up to see what it was and saw this red ball traveling horizontally across the sky just above houses and apartments approx. 1/4 mile from our house.  It was traveling slow enough for my wife to get out of bed and see it before it disappeared behind distant houses.  This object did not make any sound or leave any trail behind it.  It was bright red with a bit more yellow/orange center.   This object looked just like the ones if you google UFO red ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At the time, the sky was almost completely clear, except for several thin clouds in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the stars and noticed an orange light moving from behind several tall pines which stand on a hill behind my house.  As I watched the orange light, which was rectangle in shape, I noticed about six or seven more move from the West to East, across the sky.  There was no particular pattern they were flying in, but all of them were moving in the same direction and clustered together (not to the point that it would have been part of the same object, but in close proximity to one another).  There was no noise and no blinking lights on these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my mom and had her come to the front of the house, where she observed two of the objects moving across the sky.  As we watched them, one of the lights seemed to disappear.<n>

It looked to be very high in the night sky, at least as high as the planes fly around my house.I had gotten up from my seat and just happened to glance up in between two trees and saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a very large asteroid because of the size and brightness and yelled for my friends to come see.  After about 30 seconds the object was growing in brightness and starting to slow down.  Another minute or so passed and the object changed direction and started heading towards the east.  At this point I took out my iphone to record the object but had a hard time keeping it in frame or in focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get about a minute of footage before I shut off the record function.  The object continued to move off to the east at a slow pace before blinking out after about another minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather was calm, no ground level wind.  There was a scattering of clouds in the sky and they looked to be moving from the SW to the NE.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING #15 – July 27, 2013 – 8th SIGHTING OF A “UGO” My friend “Carol,” who lives on the northern end of Sanibel Island, FL, called me this morning to tell me that at 10:20 p.m. last night she was out on her top porch and saw the now quite mysterious white glow again – the Unidentified Glowing Object (one of these nights we hope to the actual object that is creating this light).  She had been on her porch for about 5 minutes before the sighting.   This is the sixth sighting of this glow that she’s had (see my previous “Sighting” reports).   She said it was in the same location at the previous ones we and she have seen – not much more than a half mile away, to the WNW, just on the other side of the seaward tree line of clam Bayou, and very close to the water or beach.   She also said that “whatever is making these lights HAS to be really big, or really bright….just no way any kind of a flashlight could make that kind of a glow.”  I have to agree.  Also, as I stated before, the last time Carol had seen the glow, I was looking from ! a different spot and no one was out there with a flash light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow came on and went out as before, as if on a dimmer switch, and this time stayed on for a “good minute.”  She said that it was as bright as she has ever seen it.  After about 5 minutes, it came back on, but not as bright, and only stayed on for a “few long seconds.”  She had the bravery this time to stay on her porch by herself for another 15 minutes or so, but saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting is the timing of not just this event, but all of them – within a relatively short window, from 9:50 to 10:30 p.m.  I still have the now strong feeling that SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN ON OUR SLEEPY LITTLE ISLANDS!  STAY TUNED!<n>

Definitely moving like under power, not just drifting.  Up in sky, not just over treetops.<n>
7/27/13 22:15|Chagrin Falls|OH|Fireball|30 seconds|Single constant, bright orange fireball flying silently south to north on a cloudy night, below the cloud layer.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100585.html|104|ndxe201307| Single constant, bright orange fireball flying silently south to north on a cloudy night, below the cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, aunt, son and myself witnessed a very bright amber/orange ball moving at about the rate of a jet plane descending toward a local airport.  It flew below a thick cloud deck and was in clear view.  There were no flashing lights, or headlights or the typical red &amp; green nav lights we see on planes.  It was silent and appeared as a &#34;fireball&#34; for lack of a better term.  The light it emitted was constant until the last 2 or 3 seconds of the event.  It traveled from the south, due north directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it approaching, move overhead and then away from us - again, no flashing lights or landing lights of any kind.  As it flew toward the north, it got dimmer and dimmer until it just vanished - like a match burning out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might surmise it was a meteor; but it was below the cloud deck and unobscurred.  A meteor at such a low altitude would be moving extremely fast.  This object moved at a rate similar to an airplane we saw concurrently! coming from the east, and at a higher altitude.  So this object was moving slower than a jet coming in on approach.<n>

I closed my sunroof vent thinking I don&#39;t want any residue/pesticide getting in my car.  But as the aircraft approached my vehicle I started to realize it wasn&#39;t making ANY noise.  I looked closer and realized it was flying weird, so I looked closer and noticed it was the shape of a cross flying AT me straight up and down like nothing man made that I know can fly. It had three round white lights at the top of the cross and each side of the cross.  As I was driving (very tired) and processing all that I saw, I waited for the flying object to make a sound or a gush of wind to push against my car and never felt or heard anything.  I quickly looked to my left and did not see a thing!!  What could disappear like that?  As I craned my neck around I saw what I thought looked like a Air traffic control tower (a small one ) in a field behind me dark, and lit up only by tons of tiny blue lights in the form of a circle at the top.  So weird...my husband woke up a few minutes later and I told him that I thought I saw a crop duster fly really close to our car but it didn&#39;t make any noise...he said &#34; crop duster&#39;s don&#39;t fly at night&#34; so I told him what I saw and he said he would look on the internet to see if anyone else saw the same thing at the same time since there were tons of other cars on the road. And sure enough, there are....Kinda freaking out now.  Looks like these sightings have been going on for some time now...Weird.<n>

Moments later I saw a red orange sphere floating over the free way from the direction where the meteor would have fallen.  I was driving southbound, the object was floating northbound, pretty quickly, and then I lost sight of it. I saw it for maybe 10 seconds.  I thought chinese lantern but, this thing was floating or flying pretty quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking in a Southerly direction at an angle of about 45-50 degrees into the sky when I saw a flash of light.  It was not a meteor or an aircraft.  It was stationary and looked a lot like the light one might see if viewing a lighthouse from a great distance away (ie, like a rotating beacon).  It flashed/rotated only once.  About 30 seconds later I saw it again at about the 7 o&#39;clock position from where it was the first time, just marginally down and to the left of its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, it was definitely not an aircraft and definitely not a meteor.  It did not move across the sky, but rather it just looked like a single rotation of a beacon or very bright light and then disappeared.  Altitude is indeterminable.<n>

As I pulled onto my side street, Jasmine Drive, I saw 2 more.  I called my husband and son to get outside and look at these, and then 2 more following the other 6 came.  Height-wise they were approximately a mile up.  They were not directly overhead but more east.  While we were watching them we saw an airplane traveling to the left of these balls; I don&#39;t know if this was a commercial plane as we are sometimes in a flight path for Cleveland Hopkins or a plane that was observing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Estimated speed was 80 to 160 MPH.   Craft were silent.  Went from south to north. Reminded me of a helicopter speed and altitude. Not a chinese lantern! Deep red with flickering inside, and died out as it passed over my house.  No wind and scattered clouds. 3 more passed over at 1 exactly minute intervals, and exact same flight path.  Total of 4, and I tried to take camcorder pictures, but would not focus due to being night. My opinion is it has some type of silent propulsion system, but I cannot give honest opinion as to what it is.  Not an aircraft, (larger and faster and silent than a aircraft).  Definitely under intelligent control, either from aboard craft or remote.  Very unusual,I am 60 yoa and have never seen this before.   Let me repeat, after watching 4 go over at rather high speed, they are NOT chinese lanterns, planes, satellites, etc. Cannot explain what I saw.<n>

There was no engine noise or anti collision lights evident.  No landing lights were displayed.  Flight was observed between the citys of Martin and Sharon parallel with hwy 45 east.  As flight passed our location the lights began to dim and then went out as they passed the SE portion of the sky from our location.  The lights were orange in color or flame colored like a wood fire.  Lights also flickered like a fire.  There was no altitude change observed during the flight.<n>

It was low and moving slow. Thinking it was a helicopter at first we didn&#39;t pay any mind to it. Then we noticed that there were no other lights on the object. It was moving too slow to be a plane and we didn&#39;t hear any other sound that would suggest that it was an aircraft.  It finally crossed over top of us (North West direction) as we passed under it.  I caught a glimpse of it through my sunroof and asked my friend to look behind us to see if she could see what direction it was heading.  When she turned around, trying to look out and up of the car window, she lost sight of it.  She said she lost it amongst the street lights or it disappeared.  We came to the conclusion that it was a glowing orange fireball of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both creative educated individuals.  I’m artist and she a store manager.

Somewhat mountainous for Illinois the road is situated between the hill to the west and the Illinois River to the East. There was no oncoming traffic, street lights or house lights; sky was overcast so the only illumination was the car lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we headed into the darkest area of the road I noticed three distinct orange globes moving very slow in a triangular shape.  They were heading East with an undetermined speed. I remarked to my passengers to look out the moon roof and windows and they saw the same thing. We watched for about a minute and then they disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to note we also turned down the inside lighting of the vehicle to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was translucent but still had a definite shape to it.  It was yellow-green.  It had two dim lights.  Not like search lights.  More like ones you would see on a vcr.  The top light was a darker teal/green and the bottow light was lemon/lime in color.  The object seemed to be sizeable and appeared to be two blocks from where we were at.  It disappeared quickly.  When my son and I saw it, it was sideways.   I think that is why it left our view so quickly.  Like the side view was invisible if that makes sense.  It didn&#39;t hover like a frisbee, it was perpendicular to the horizon and looked 3 dimensional.<n>

They were less organized towards the rear, where some did move closer to others at an extremly close proximity.  They were moving smoothly, no sounds, from east to west.  A lot of people around the furnace st and queen st intersection stopped to discuss and record the moving objects.  And in a matter of a few minutes as they moved, they disappeared.  I&#39;ve never been convinced, but that evening myself and the people around there did.  There were a least 20 of them moving smoothly at very close proximity to each other.  People in their cars stopped to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many were hoping to hear something explaining the lights on Sunday but nothing was said on tv.<n>

There were approximately 10-15 blue lights lined up and appeared to span the two northbound and the two southbound lanes of I-17 and a little more.  We kept driving and saying, “What is that” for approximately 2 minutes then they all seemed to pulsate and vanish a few at a time until they were all gone in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our trek, searching the sky and the land around us to see if we could see anything until we arrived at Camp Verde.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our 6 year old daughter said she saw them and they looked like “blue stars” to her.  I asked if she remembers anything else and she said she doesn’t because she was tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very dark as the moon was covered by rain clouds.  There was also lightning to the east.  There were multiple cars in front of us headed NNE as well as cars headed south in the southbound lanes.  The lights were comparable to what Venus appears to be, very bright and bigger than the stars around it.  The lights were a deep, but bright blue color.  Also, for reference, according to the map on my iPhone, Cordes Junction is 26.9 miles from Camp Verde.<n>

It was not a Chinese lantern.  I&#39;m hoping others who possibly noticed this in this area as well reports this and has a photo to share of it.  We don&#39;t know if there was sound because we had the windows up and radio on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have cell phone video but its not the best being the object was so far away.  I thought maybe it was a satellite so I checked rotation times and it didn&#39;t fall within those time frames.<n>

I put the trash in the bin, and on my way back, looked at the star again.  It was visibly flashing colored light.  After deciding I wasn&#39;t looking at an airplane or helicopter, I called my two friends to come look the star and asked if they could see it flashing too or if my eyes were playing tricks on me.  They could see it as well.  After a few minutes I retrieved a pair of binoculars from my truck and we all inspected the light.  No definite shape was determinable but the lights formed a triangular shape with a gently rounded top, like a cut diamond.  The lights were arranged compactly not appearing to form any particular pattern or symmetry.  The lights were red, green, and light yellow that emanated from sharp, individual points that flashed rapidly off and on intermittently.  At any ! given time 25-35 individual lights were visible, but it is difficult to say exactly how many because of the speed and lack of pattern to their on/off sequence.  We took turns looking at the object for around 20 minutes as it stayed stationary, then went back in the house to see if there was anything online explaining what we were seeing. 5-10 minutes later we went back out and found the object had moved farther away and was lower on the horizon.  I checked on it periodically for the next 30 minutes as it continued to move away and dip lower on the horizon until trees blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I pulled over and took pictures. I shut my vehicle motor off to hear if they made any sound.  They did not. When I got back in my vehicle, I saw another group coming.  I stopped and exited my vehicle again and watched another twenty five to thirty go by.  I could not tell speed or distance.  However, they seemed to be about as high as a commercial jet and as fast.  All together, I saw approximately fifty to one hundred of these orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I uploaded the pictures to my phone and zoomed in, they look like fire balls with a nucleus.  I hope I can share the photos on this site. I would love to hear from others that witnessed this event.<n>

My husband didn&#39;t see it and I yelled for him to stop and park since I couldn&#39;t get a view while in the turn. Yes,I was indeed in a bit of a panic since I&#39;d seen something almost completely identical in Elyria, Ohio in late April, 2012 close to sunset(I think it was the 22nd.  I had no witness and have tried to research it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live within 20 miles of Cleveland Hopkins airport, so air traffic is noting new to me.  I&#39;ve seen planes in every flight pattern coming and going to that airport.  This thing was indescribably bright, orange/red in color and lower than a plane in landing decent, which heading west from North/South would be in almost all cases.Further, there were no visible signs of a tail or greenish color, which is more indicative of a comet.  I have yet to see a plane at night with no white or blue lights, and with nothing blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was so extremely bright orange, all I could do was yell, &#34;fireball!&#34; Just like my other sighting over a year prior, it first seemed to be circular and falling without will.  Once we jumped out of the car, it was overhead giving us an idea of it&#39;s speed.  We noticed then that there were 3 very distinct dullish dark circular shapes inside of a triangle with a redish ora.  The triangle then with intent, took a very sharp turn west.  I realized at that moment it wasn&#39;t a natural event, and was being guided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car toward home to continue to follow it.  The trees blocked our view for about 5 seconds.  We quickly reached open sky again, and it was simply gone.  Planes don&#39;t just vanish in the night sky in 5 econds at a low altitude!  This was something else.  Military?  The closest air base is 4 hours south of here in Dayton at Wright Patterson.  Who knows, but I&#39;d love to know if anyone has a reasonable explanation for this!  There were a lot of people out with the festival ending so I can only assume more people saw this thing!  I was unable to get an iphone shot of any kind because it was just too fast, and I was truly unable to stop staring at it.<n>

Initially thought it was a flare hovering untill it started moving.  The color of the object was what caught our attention, it was orange/red glow with no flashing lights.  The color reminds me of an old street light (before the new energy saver blue/white kind).  It was heading westward, made a stop above a particular area, then reversed direction for a second and then reverted to its original course.  Followed it but lost it behind a cloud, or its light diminished as it turned and headed north/northeast. 2 minutes later a second one (or the same one?) came from the east following a similar pattern.  This time we were able to record half of the event. The object made no sound.  During the event there were a couple planes in the area on their path north.  The object did not follow a typical path of commercial and/ or military planes as we know and see often since we live next to a military base.  We have seen all st! ealth technology, military, commercial, and personal forms of craft and never saw anything like this in our lives.<n>

A larger one appeared to be in front or closer as they moved.  They stopped an hovered a minute or so. During that time the two smaller lights in the back moved toward each other seeming to touch.  They then separated an one, then the other following, took off northeast in the direction they came and disappeared from sight.  The larger one hovered a few more seconds then also took off  in the same direction of the other two. No sound was noticed.  It was at this time I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone and just caught a blurred glimpse of the orange light.

You could clearly see it had a circular shape but it had a bright glow around it.  It was about half the size of how the moon normally looks in the sky and it moved very quickly.  As soon as I pointed it out to my mom it slowed down and slowly shrank in size and completely dissipated into the clouds.  We thought it might be a low flying airplane and waited for it to reappear on the other side of the cloud but we never saw it again.  Almost immediately after ,though, there were two very fast Airplanes that kept flying around in that very area.  They stayed for about 5 minutes or so.

Object was seen from a moving vehicle and rapidly approached to within 600-800 feet of road before stopping to hover in air above road.  Now revealed to have 2 different colored lights (red and white) on points of triangle.  Third, greenish-colored light appeared on third point of triangle, and the lights continued to slowly alternate colors before stopping with original red and white lights.  Craft continued to move upward and to the south with erratic movements, moving approximately 2 times as fast as a commercial jet airliner.  Continued moving south over the tree line and past the horizon.  Visual contact with the object was lost at about 9:25 p.m. and was not re-established at any point afterwards.<n>

It basically looked just like a star in the night, but moved south and slowly disappeared.  The light faded to complete darkness over about a 7 second duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, another light object (possibly the same one) moved back north from the same area that the other one disappeared at.  But the brightness of the light was only about half as bright this time.  Both objects moved in a straight line, but were definitely not planes because of how high up they were. And the lighted objects were 1 solid bright color the whole time.  No blinking or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of these objects were almost directly from looking straight up into the sky, but to the south-west a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mention 15 minute duration because of the difference in time between the first and second objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first time witnessing anything like this before, and i&#39;ll admit it shocked me a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/26/13 20:50|West Chester|PA|Unknown|12 minutes|Two, all-black objects flying slowing without lights, sound, or change in altitude for 12+ minutes|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100517.html|149|ndxe201307| Two, all-black objects flying slowing without lights, sound, or change in altitude for 12+ minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8:50-9:03 P.m. 7/26/2013  Standing on 701 E Market Street, West Chester, Pa  The Sun was below the horizon but there was still ample light to provide clear silhouettes.  We looked north of Market street and to the west.  There were two, totally black blobs, one apparently at a higher altitude than the other and slightly ahead.   If both objects were identical in size, then the higher one seemed to be about half the observed diameter of the lower one.  I first said that they were loose balloons since they were moving due east very slowly.  Estimated size of the closer one would be 4-5 feet.  Estimated speed would be no more than 10mph, slow and steady. No sound was detected but the street noise is loud there.  The air was wind-free.  As a frame of reference, a minute or so before we spotted the objects there was a small plane, probably a Cessna 172 or similar, heading for the Brandywine airport, presumably to land.  The airport is just a mile or less from that spot, so the Cessna would have been at 500 feet or less in preparation for approach.  These objects appeared to be well in the foreground of where I saw the plane pass by and by that I judged their size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have been happy to call them balloons and leave it at that but here’s the problem:  Small flying craft, such as remote-control balloons (or loose party balloons) are filled with helium and helium does its best to rise straight up.  These object remained, in lockstep with each other, at the same apparent size for the entire 12 minutes they were visible, until they passed into too dark an area to see due to the failing sunlight.  Worse, for much of that time, the lower one was traveling in front of a white contrail, which was clearly far up from passing jet, perhaps 20,000’.  It made an excellent frame of reference and it so happed that the closer object stayed easily within that narrow contrail of perhaps 1º-2º, gaining no visible altitude for the entire viewing.  The contrail, too remained in relatively the same position based on it apparent height above the TD Bank across the street from where we stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any remote control aircraft would have been far too difficult to keep on so consistent an altitude let alone two of them.  They would also need powered propulsion to maintain that altitude yet these were seemingly silent and moving far too slowly for any model aircraft to remain aloft.  But there’s no way anyone could have flown any type of balloon without gaining altitude or having some means to force enough forward motion to stop any such gain. There were no lights at all, the objects appeared totally black.  It was hard to discern any surface detail but I though I did see the closer object wobble a few times, as if it was rippling across its diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I watched then until they were too faint to see against the lack of light.  The main reason I am reporting this is due to the inability of balloons to remain at a given altitude for so long a time and the lack of sufficient airspeed to warrant belief in propeller-driven aircraft. As background, I am a firm believer in extra-terrestrial life but not UFO’s or Earthy visits from spacemen.  I have strong hobbyist background interests in all science, space, flight, mechanics and engines, and observing nature, but I cannot yet explain this sighting to myself.<n>

I was at the intersection by the Casey’s gas station.  I saw a rusted orange yet glowing ball in the sky, by the moon, it was dark, but a warm night. There was a full moon, and stars were plenty.  So it vastly stood out.  It was an orb shape, rusted orange, almost like one mixed literal rust with an orange soda.  It was to the right of the moon but soon moved towards the moon and accelerated very fast in a zig zag shape up above the moon than it vanished into nothing.  It left a trail, almost like when you move a sparkler back and forth fast enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen planes of all sorts, I worked with a man who was studying to be a pilot and he’s never heard of anything like that, aside from UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting #14 – July 26, 2013 – 6th sighting of Amber-orange to red UFO (“fireball”) + 4th sighting of a “flasher” + 7th sighting of large UGO + a ? I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, next to the rock jetty at Blind Pass, when at 9:56 I saw an amber-orange UFO, which turned red. The literature also describes these objects as “fireballs.”  I had been at my location for 30 minutes when I saw it, due west of me, about two finger-widths above the horizon.  It was a bit more orange than amber, then a minute later it changed to white-orange, and a minute later turned solid red.  There were clouds just past the horizon and there was a light wind blowing onshore, making the air misty, so I estimate that it was no more than 5 miles away from me.  It took about 4 minutes to travel from due west of me to roughly northwest. It also appeared to be traveling away from me.  When it reached northwest of me it faded out of sight, rather than just “blinking” out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several jets, common at this time of the evening, coming in from the northwest toward the Ft. Myers International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at an incoming jet through binoculars when at 10:06 I noticed a single white strobe flash about ¾ the spread of my binocular field of sight above the jet.  I trained my binocs on the area and caught another single white flash – these were a full second apart.  Then the single strobe started flashing quickly, but irregularly, just like the previous “flashers” I’ve described in previous, recent reports to NUFORC.  After a few seconds of irregular flashing, it stopped for a good 2 seconds,  It then came back on, flashing irregularly, and “jumping” from left to right and up and down.  This jerking around was more than the way distant objects “jitter” due to one’s hands shaking with the binocs.  Then a single red strobe flashed a few times, with the white flashing only a couple of times.  This behavior continued, with mostly just the white strobe flashing, for about 2 minutes, when I lost sight of it due to a creak in my neck.  This flasher was to my northwest, in t! he same area where the previous UFO light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to walk north along the beach when a white-amber light, about the size of a grape at arm’s length, came on for a brief moment, not more than 100 yards away from me in the Gulf of Mexico (there was no one else on the beach where I was at).  I stopped where I was, a bit frightened because it was so close.  When I continued to walk I caught the same light again from the left corner of my eye, and then it went out.  Most Interesting, is that a friend and I saw exactly the same kind of light, briefly and at about the same location, just a week prior.  We both looked at each other at that time and simultaneously said “Did you see that?”  Yes, we both saw it.  What could this light be???  Maybe it’s one of those “orbs” so many folks are seeing nowadays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:15 on the button, I saw precisely the same mysterious glow (Unidentified Glowing Object - “UGO”) on the horizon I saw with four fishermen on June 27, at 10:24 p.m. (Sighting #3 in my previously filed “Summary of 10….”).  This glow was to the west northwest of where I now was, across the street from my house.  Interestingly, it was in the same area that the UFO disappeared at earlier, and directly below where the flasher was.  Because (1) I and my friend “Carol” had seen UFOs directly associated with two UGOs we saw at her house (Sighting # 8), and also saw during that incident an apparently landed UFO with a white strobe light flashing; and (2) because I saw a flasher in association with “fireballs” before (Sighting # 7), I have to conclude that these three objects are truly associated with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UGO came back on a second time, about a minute later, and in the same fashion as the ones I and Carol have seen before – like they were on a dimmer switch.  About a minute later it came on again and it was REALLY BRIGHT, and gave me quite a freight.  At its base on the horizon, it was approximately two hand-widths wide, and just over a hand-width tall.  The next time it came back on, a minute or so later, it was not as bright; and the fifth and last time it came on, it was just a little dimmer yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly walked across the street to get my chair, and watch the horizon and elsewhere for another 40 minutes, but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE????  If anyone is out there is interest in the reports I&#39;ve been posting for the past month, and can maybe give me some help in understanding what’s going on, please contact me through NUFORC.  Thanks.<n>

My girlfriend tells me next that she&#39;s seeing something that looks like a shooting star, when I turned around and looked it was the same shape star again on the same angle / using the same trajectory has the first one and was heading towards to same direction has the first one.  Went inside quickly to grab a digital cam, but must be one of them cheap ones, i couldn&#39;t get the object to appear on the camera.  I was upset, until i turned around again looking at the North-East and saw another one on the same flight path has the previous ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to contact the Montreal Airport to maybe try to get information on if it may be a flight path or corridor used for planes, but i wonder which plane and if a plane, why are they traveling at such a high altitude.

I watched the object for a few minutes when suddenly it began to move.  It hovered, then randomly moved diagonally, up, down, sideways, only stopping when two other aircraft entered the vicinity.  After the aircraft left the airspace, it began moving again.  Also, I noticed that there was a halo around the object and trail when it moved, even though it was a clear night.  The treetops beneath it also seemed to be lighting up as if random beams of light were scanning the woods beneath the object.  I looked at the object with binoculars and saw a bright red flashing center surrounded by intermittent blue and green lights in a circular pattern. After watching it for a half an! hour, I decided to turn on the light to get ready for bed.  I turned the light off and looked out to see that the object had sunk down below the tree line, then disappeared.

I cannot explain what has been put on my right arm but maybe you can.  I will try and attach photos to prove what I am talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get to the heart of the matter, I was sleeping that night and thought I was having a dream, but was not.  I went to a ship or planet and was put on a table without legs and there was a bright lights above the table and darkness all around.  Was escorted by 6 (what looked like people) about 4 feet tall dressed in long white robes.  I did notice that their heads were larger as far as our proportional body.  I was put on this &#34;TABLE&#34; and a device what appeared to be a scanner of some sort, scanned me for at least 15 minutes, my best guess.  The individuals never tried to inflict pain or hurt me.  It was as they were collecting data for our future.  The scan went over my body at least 5 times.  Never felt any pain, as a matter of fact, I felt content.  It&#39;s like I was branded with something embedded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up on July 27, 2013 at 4:30 AM to take my Mother to the airport.

Woke ! up did my daily duties, watched some TV and was in the bathroom and noticed the below pics.  Didn&#39;t know what to think at first, but there was no pain as to the marks on me.  I wonder how long they will last no my right arm ????  Anyway, I also must tell you that for the last 2 + years I have been having I guess or contacts about the next generation computers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway take a look at the pics.

This was reported to have happened around 9:15PM local time near the Syracuse area.  A friend of mine was another witness to this phenomenon.  The sky was clear outside last night and he said he had no idea what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was coming home from work around 11PM EDT and had a clear view of the Syracuse skyline at certain points along his drive and said he noticed flashes of white light (several times) coming from the direction he was facing (East) almost like lighting –except there was no storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back from a friend’s house around the same time (about 11:15PM EDT or so) and noticed the same thing a couple times or so.

I lit a cigarette and looked at the stars for it was a clear night and they were all noticeable.  I the turned to the south and noticed a spherical shaped object peachy watermelon translucent colored object about 200 feet off the ground moving toward me roughly 100 mph.  Then a second,third,and fourth one. As they came toward me due north they gained a little altitude above me around 400 feet not in a formation.  When they got right above me they instantly made a 90 degree turn to the west at about 20 degree to horizon sped away at speeds unubtainable for human inception. From me to out of sight in 1 second.no wings.  No rotors.  No sound.  No light reflecting clouds. No helium balloon.no Chinese lantern.

It immediately caught my attention, especially since it was something I&#39;ve never seen before.  I work for an airline and I am VERY familiar with aviation so I was immediately curious as to what this was since it did not resemble any aircraft (no flashing becons, wing lights) and most aircraft in either a approach or takeoff phase are white in color not orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it in awe for a moment then ran inside to get my phone to try and record the occurrence. I was able to record about 30 seconds of the light move from one direction then the opposite direction then literally disappear.  I noted the position and information in the sky and have this information available.  I will submit this information in an email (subject STL07252013).<n>

Initially, they were in a triangular pattern with two up front and one distanced slightly to the rear.  We commented that it was odd to see three aircraft that close together in the night sky.  As they passed across the road, the objects separated and split off in three different directions.  I managed to keep my focus on the one that was south of the highway completely losing sight of the other two objects.  The single orange ball of light appeared to pass over a nearby residential area and hover. It stayed in that position until we drove on, and it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a merchant marine, and I am a teacher.   We do live in the vicinity of the airport and a military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home, I researched the color patterns of navagational lights on different aircraft; and I found no match for what we saw.<n>

It was after supper and I was outside weeding my flowerbed.  I felt or heard a kind of a hovering sound.  It was a hummmm hummm sound and I honestly thought it was a flock of geese flying overtop of me of the house because this happens occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and there were no birds. It was after supper and the sun was still up and the sky was blue.  Then I hear a sound that I cannot describe.   It got louder and louder and I backed up to look over the house because I thought it was fighter planes from an army base.  I remember thinking, the kids are going to think this is cool seeing these fighter jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look in the sky over the house and nothing!!  Then an object came flying right at me and I actually ducked and felt it go overtop of my head onto the deck.  It was so small.  The size of a golf ball but not round, more flat shaped.  It was grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped in the middle of the deck for an instant, then went zoom, quick as a flash of lightning, horizontally, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not scared.  I was in total dis-belief, and told myself it was a hummingbird.  I know it wasn&#39;t though.  The hovering sound and feel like something is creating a waving motion, then that loud sound that breaks the sound barrier, and ducking so I would not get hit!  It was so weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the kids if they heard those jets and they had no idea what I was talking about.

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting #13 – July 25, 2013 – Seventh sighting of the “UGO” I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, next to the rock jetty at Blind pass, when a friend and I saw another Unidentified Glowing Object.  I was looking just east of due south through my binoculars when at 10:08 p.m., I spotted a dim, unmistakable white glow that appeared to be very close to Clam Bayou, just west of my friend “Carol’s” house, where we had four previous sightings of UGOs.  On one of those occasions at her house, we saw three UFO’s in association with the two UGOs, in addition to an apparently landed UFO (see “Sighting # 8 in my previously filed “Summary of 10 UFO….”).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time both my friend and I were prepared – she at her house, and me 1.5 miles to the north (as the crow flies), looking from a different vantage point.  I had called her about 10 minutes before this sighting to tell her I was in position; this time I brought a chair to sit in for a one-hour one watch.  She was prepared to periodically go out to her porch to se what she could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called her just as soon as I spotted the glow, she went out to her porch, and saw the glow, describing it as “intense.” I stayed on the phone with her for a few moments as she was describing to me what she was seeing.  The glow stayed at it’s highest intensity she had ever seen it for a minute, maybe just a tad longer.  Then it went out as before, as if on a dimmer switch.  After a minute or two, it came back on “quickly,” stayed on briefly, then went back out again.  Carol, being alone, became very frightened and afraid that the UFO’s would show up again,  then went inside.  She did not want to go out and look again, or even look through her sliding glass doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed at my location scanning the area for another hour, hoping to see one or more of the previously seen UFO associated with the glow to show up, but I  observed nothing more.  One important thing I learned during this excursion was that just because I didn’t notice anything more doesn’t mean that there was not anything to see.  It was unlikely I would have anything unless the glow was at it’s greatest intensity, and I was luckily looking straight at it through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no possible way this glow could be “swamp gas” for two reasons: (1) the glow originates outside of the Bayou, just past and behind of the seaward tree line; (2) the bayou is quite open, and is not swamp like at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these things are on any kind of a “schedule,” then the UFO’s should show up in 10 days or less.<n>

It hoevered over and empty field to out left for what seemed like forever, but im sure it was just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slowed down to a crawl and watched in awe.  It then quickly zipped off at a speed that weve never seen.  It wasnt until after that we noticed there was no other cars around, on a pretty busy road. people may not believe me, but i know what i saw.it certainly wasnt anything of this world.<n>

I noticed it a few blocks further down in the direction I was driving but disarded it since some trees blocked most of it.  Figured it could have been a plane (there is an airport around the area) or the sun reflecting against something I don&#39;t know.  I reached a stop sign, which happened to be in front of where the light was and I got a clear view at it this time, no longer blocked by trees.  Right then and there I noticed it was shinning bright white light with a different form. The light was brighter on some areas. No other lights.  Just white light and the shape.  It was not a disk shape nor cone or anything that has been seen in pictures. It just stayed there for what seemed to be 20 seconds.  I was trying to pull my cell phone to try and take a picture and I realized, I was still at the stop sign so, I decided to make a left turn to continue my path seeing as there were cars behind me.  As I turned I just happened to look back and I noticed the driver behind me had his head sticking out looking at the same thing I was.  I made the left turn at a very slow pace while still looking at it.  Few seconds later, it seemed to have shrunk in size.  Once I completed my turn, trees again blocked my sight a bit so I decided to drive bit further and stop inside a neighberhood that was underneath the spot were the...light, figure what ever you want to call it was.   It was no longer there.  Even if it was a plane I am sure I would have still had been able to see it.  Same as a weather balloon or anything else we are used to see on a normal day. It was strange but it was not anything I had seen in pictures or sighting videos.  It was just bright white on all it&#39;s ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was not a disk, cone, nor small in size at first.  I can say it was probably the size of a car from the point of view I had.  The shape was just different.<n>

I noticed a light (orbish) which looked as bright as the North Star. It was at the awkward time in the morning where stars should be just out of sight so I found it strange and kept looking.  After a couple seconds the light bolted in a linear direction which appeared to be up, but due to the distance I couldn&#39;t be sure.  There was a slight trail to it because of the speed. It then made a sudden stop, paused and shot off in a diagonal (upper left) direction and appeared to vanish with a slight trail visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this only because it seemed out of place and I&#39;ve been trained (Marine Corp Vet) to notice small things out of the ordinary and have retained this training pretty well. It was pretty amazing to witness and didn&#39;t have time to pull out my phone to record it after it moved.<n>

Red Green White and stayed in one set location like it was hovering.  Me and my wife at first dismissed it as maybe being a plane in the sky getting ready to land but there is no airport in the vicinity of the lights to the best of or knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time we have noticed things like this.  About a month ago our son noticed what looked to be a ball of fire in the sky we thaught maybe a star or something of that nature.  But then the ball stopped and just hovered around then went back in the direction it started then some more hovering, then back again but then as we were focused on this it just disappeared in a matter of seconds.  We also seen a lite white in color like a star but it just got super brite almost like it was warming up and it appeared to be glowing then it was gone.  All these sigtings we have been able to dismiss as aircraft or stars for the fa! ct that stars don&#39;t have multiple colors and don&#39;t move and stop like these were.  And air craft seem to move in a set direction and at a slow speed these did not move in a set direction but where ever they wanted and they seem to move slower or faster than aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wish we knew what they were.  We tried recording them but they did not show up on camera.<n>

It seemed to be watching the light that zoomed away and kinda seemed like something the police would use like a drone or something.  But I really have no idea what it was.  It made no noise and was somewhat low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It went under the moon about three quarters of the distance above the horizon as compared to the moon.  I could not tell if it was heading due west and just losing altitude, or if it was actually moving somewhat to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The streak itself appeared to have a yellow/gold center with trailing &#34;sparks&#34;, but the outsides or borders of the streak above and below had a green tint to them.  The streak terminated without any discernable report, either visual or aural.  It just disappeared at a point estimated at an elevation about one half the distance from the horizon to the moon, but well west of the moon, between Sagittarius and Aquila.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire streak lasted an estimated 3-4 seconds. The length of the streak was considerable, probably consisting of as much as a quarter or even a third of the total length that it travelled in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that this was a meteor, not any type of craft.<n>

As I passed Centennial High School on my left, I noticed a large orange object in the northern sky.  As the object approached my position, it looked like a sphere with flames emanating from the top of it.  It was the orange colour of fire.  I stopped my car, picked up my iPhone from the centre console and exited the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out of the car when the object flew directly overhead.  It was the size of a single engine plane, approximately 400 feet in altitude, travelling at a leisurely pace and no sound was heard.  I saw a sphere surrounded by a triangular frame.  The sphere was orange, and the triangular frame surrounding the sphere was brownish red in colour.  As the object continued on a southerly heading, I was able to take 2 photos with my camera phone.  I have attached them to this report.  However, they are not of high quality.  I have also provided a sketch of what the object looked like when it was directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking the second photo, the object picked up speed very quickly, and within 2 seconds was out of visual range entirely.  I believe that it sped away, not burning out or disappearing.<n>

My friends house is a few blocks from Kipling and Colfax, and this night they had a few other friends come over to celebrate the night. We went out for a smoke at around 11 pm, then one of my friends noticed the light was back. It is very very bright, brighter than a star probably on the same scale of takeoff lights from planes which we see coming from Denver International Airport all the time.  But there was no blinking lights to designate which side of the plane or helicopter was facing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started at a 30 degree angle with the horizon and very slowly moved south, there is a utility pole out back so we used it for a point of reference if we stood still.  It got past the pole in about 40 minutes, then it sped up to a planes speed, then shot off to the distance.  We see these lights every few days, usually just one slow mover then reaches a point and takes off like a fighter jet.  I used to work near Buckley AFB outside everyday so I&#39;m very used to seeing jets do maneuvers overhead and the sound they produce.  This orb of light hasn&#39;t made a sound ever.  But we have seen it make dips, loops, and sharp full speed turns.  We have watched it take 3 hours on the path down the horizon to the north judging location on tall trees then just gain speed and disappear on the horizon.  And one time it even got close enough you could feel warmth on a freezing night on a 2012 December night, it also appeared like there was something pulsing down an aura on it.  There were times when it would glow slightly red on the top of the bright white, then little red balls would move downward around the ball of light then combine at the bottom and disappear.  It still looked small but I had the feeling if I threw a rock 40-50 feet up I would of hit it.  We have no idea what it is and our phones and cameras won&#39;t register it.  Altoget! her 20-30 people and a dog have seen these lights and didn&#39;t believe us until they got to see it for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Last night I got dropped off at the bottom of the hill because my friend&#39;s car couldn&#39;t make it up. I had my brother meet me at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the hill, I noticed a huge, extravagantly bright light. Brighter than any we even have in the city. It pulsated at about a flash per second and this lasted for about 5 minutes.  I caught this on film but the videos do no justice to the size and brightness of this flash.  It was just in the air right above the hospital lights and aircraft warning lights (which blink red and WERE the brightest thing in the sky until this strange light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the light disappeared, four helicopters immediately circled the area for a good 10 minutes.  They dispersed and and another two helicopters came and circled the area even wider. Last, one more helicopter flew around in 2 circles around the area and tool off. I have heard no ! reportings on the news whatsoever and I still want to know what this was.<n>

The sky was not quite completely dark and I could see stars in the area between the lights.  The lights were steady, no strobes, no other colors.  The lights all moved in the same direction at the same speed- probably three times as fast as a commercial airliner would appear to be moving when very high.  The light source was indeterminable, but appeared much larger than any known aircraft based on their apparent height.  No sound was heard.  They all disappeared/ went out at the same time when they were nearly overhead.<n>

After studing the object I came to the conclusion that it was nothing I have ever seen. I thought it was a model airplane with lights in it but then saw the way it was moving and clearly dismissed that notion. My daughter and I then took videos of it in our phones. Another man came by and looked and thought the same thing. The objects were round, changing color, and moving in patterns that are not normal for aircraft. I&#39;ve played with mini airplanes and this did not move that same way. It made no noise as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were hovering in the sky close to the water, then 2 of them moved behind 1, making it look like it they disspeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later they came out from behind that 1 red light. They don&#39;t form any shape, they were more like in a horizontal line next to each other.  I thought they were going form a triangle at that point.  After that they started moving farther out into the ocean but only 1 could be seen at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am visiting Hawaii for 2 weeks, I&#39;m 18 y/o female, from Toronto, &amp; I&#39;m fascinated with UFOs.

The lights were SSW of me, about two finger-widths of my outstretched hand above the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and about one finger width apart.  I would reasonably guess that they were around 500 feet above the water, and two to three miles distant.  They appeared to be due west of my friend “Carol’s” house, two miles south on Sanibel Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, by the time I got my binoculars out and the lens caps off, they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What’s important here is that after exactly one month, they still showed up in the same location.  As I’ve stated in my previous reports to NUFORC, it now seems clear to me that there is some kind of a reason they are continually showing up  at this relatively isolated area.<n>

After focusing on on it, I can describe that it looked like the upper part of it was more white in color and was shaped like a triangle or jib sail and was a darker &#34;fire&#34; looking color towards the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be moving North but as it got closer, it seems, it was moving pretty much due east.  The object light was pulsating in a random pattern like a fire would do.  As it moved west it resembled what a rocket looks like traveling away from.  The speed seemed to be no more than what a typical airliner travels.  There was no trail and never any noise that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no way to tell the distance from my vantage.  I can say that I could never get a defined shape as it was a bit fuzzy looking.  I did take two photos though.<n>

Light was moving slowly from west to east, staying level along side the mountain.  Light traveled approximately 1 mile before coming to a stop and then moving west again for about a 1/4 of a mile.  Brightness of blue light did not change, nor was there any flashing navigation lights.  Light then went down and then up, to the side and then down out of my line of sight into the canyon at about 4000 ft elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did I hear engine noise which is very common for any type of aircraft near my residence, as sound echo&#39;s off mountain.  I jumped in my car and sped 1/2 mile to the canyon, to see if light was a man made object.  Myself and other witnesses who had come to look for the light, saw nothing.  If it had been an aircraft, I would have seen it or heard it in the canyon, as I had a 5 mile visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a former pilot, I have never! seen an aircraft  at night that matched this description.<n>

I first noticed the lights about 3:30am to my left also going east at 70 MPH and a guess would be 2-3,000&#39; high.  The lights were about 1 mile apart going the same speed and altitude.  When the freeway curved the lights did not follow the curve but went streight instead.  I stayed with them until I reached my exit.

Checked out the starry sky and noticed an unidentified flying object  bursting from what we thought were a triangular star cluster. Shot off extremely fast with tail looking like trustees.  Then vanished from sight. We concluded that the triangular cluster was the mothers and the egg shape that spewed was the podcraft.  As it happened even skeptics on the patch had to agree that this was nothing we could call a human event.  The triangular cluster vanished after the ejection.<n>

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting #11 – July 23, 2013 – 6th sighting of a “UGO.” I was at my friend “Carol’s” house again star gazing, when at 10:34 pm we saw, to the northwest of our location on her third floor balcony, a brief, intense white glow followed by a “beam” of white light that shoot skyward, just a bit off of perfectly straight up.  After about a half second, the beam went off and the white glow remained for about another second and then went off, as if on a dimmer switch.  This brief white glow of light was of the same kind and intensity we had now seen many times before.  (See “A Brief Summary of 10 UFO Sightings…” and accompanying maps and drawings for previous sightings.)  The light, as before, appeared to originate just past the seaward tree line of Clam Bayou, and on or very near the water of the Gulf of Mexico.  I figure the distance of the light was just over a mile away from us.  The only houses in that direction are to the east of this particular location, approximately 30 degrees to the right (east) of the UGO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carol told me that this beam of light was quite similar to the ones she saw (while I was fussing with my camera all along)  before that was beamed up to one of the red UFO’s (which had changed from amber at first, to orange and then red) the by the glow on July 14th (“Sighting #8 in the above Summary).  Except that this beam was more focused.  And actually, this beam was not really all that focused like the beam of a powerful flashlight – rather, it seemed to me that it was dispersedly fuzzy at the edges, and instead of being a separate beam of light traveling through the glow, it was an integral part of the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As matter of very interesting fact, now that I think more about this beam of light as I’m writing, it was really bizarre, in that it abruptly ended at the top of the glow!     As previously described in my above mentioned sighting, the top of the NGO was about a hand-width above the tops of the trees on the far side of the Bayou – maybe 150 or so feet above sea level.  What’s additionally odd, is that there hadn’t been any rain for the previous 5 days, and the humidity was not that high as to be “misty” outside.  I’m not sure about the previous times we saw it.  Interesting….was there something at the “top” of the beam of light that we could not see?  The moon was just past full and at 9 o’clock, and was in the opposite direction of the UGO.  The sky was overcast.  There was enough light in the sky to easily see the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:58 the UGO reappeared, again, as if slowly turned on by a dimmer switch.  This time it stayed on for a good 5 seconds before going out.  Carol then went inside because she was afraid, but I stayed out for an additional 20 or so minutes, saw nothing further, left, and drove to the parking lot on the south end of Captiva.  I parked in the direction facing toward where we saw the NGO, and saw nothing for another 15 minutes, and then went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week prior to this sighting, I walked from Blind Pass south to Clam Bayou.  People rarely go down there even in the day time during tourist off season, and I’ve no idea why anyone would walk down there during the night, especially given the density of mosquitoes in the area of the Bayou.  There is also a large area on the exceptionally wide beach at the north end of the Bayou that is tapped off for nesting shore birds.  No one walks in this protected area, so it was quite smooth and it would have been easy for me to spot any kind of depressions from a landed craft.  I also walked around a 1/3rd mile long path that goes through the woods/bushes at an area called Silver Key, looking all the while for any signs of a landed craft – depressions, burned bushes, anything out of the ordinary.  Everything looked normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although purely speculation, I feel that if I could get out star gazing more often at Carols that I/we would have seen much more activity.  Since my last sighting 10 days ago on July 14 (see the aforementioned report), I have been out at night 5 times on the beach across from where I live, from around 9:30 10:30 (when I’ve seen the lion’s share of my sightings), and have nothing to report for those nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nonetheless, I now driven to believe that something special is happening at Clam Bayou.  Why Clam Bayou?  And what are these objections doing there?  Hopefully, time will tell.<n>

At one point the rearmost craft appeared to have two circular lights, glowing almost like the headlights of an automobile.  These lights glowed for only ten seconds or so, then abruptly turned off.  The two craft were steadily gaining altitude and finally disappeared into the hazy sky.<n>

To the East I noticed about 20-50 feet above a tree line, perhaps 2-5 miles away there was a white disc travelling at a high speed across the treeline (tall elder pines about 90-140 feet high approximately).  It took approximately 1.5 seconds for the disc to travel across the span of my driver side window where I ceased to be able to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most frightening aspect is about 20 seconds before the sighting I started to get images and thoughts of extra terrestrials in my head and cycling through thoughts about &#39;what is out there&#39; as I often research at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my music down to clear my head and something inspired me to look East.  When I did it was within 2 seconds that the craft appeared.  I often research extra terrestrial beings and craft in my free time as well as falsified research on moon landings and NASA space programs but have never witnessed anything myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had any ESP or signs of the like but this particular moment has definitely left me puzzled.  It is almost as if I knew the craft was there before I looked.<n>

7/22/13 20:50|Seattle|WA|Oval|6-9 minutes|Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101302.html|223|ndxe201307| Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 22nd I was on the deck of our home in West Seattle and my husband was upstairs.  Our home sits facing south on the cliff above Puget Sound at an elevation of 328 feet.  It was 8:50 PM and the sun was setting. I looked out across Puget Sound to the south past Lincoln Park toward Tacoma and saw two large, hovering, rotating, oval-shaped crafts with very bright white lights that were flashing and twinkling. They were in formation and the one to the right looked to be further away.  From my vantage point, they were about ¾ the size of a full moon or larger.  Standing in the exact location if I extend my first finger the objects were as wide as my nail and ½  to ¾ of the length of the nail.  Based on the altitude and the jet planes I see daily on the flight path I estimated that 3-4 large passenger jets could have fit inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were significantly brighter than the West Seattle-Vashon ferry which was traversing below (east to west) as well as the lights on the jet plane that was traveling south on the flight path (to the southwest) and the red aviation towers that are visible to the southwest of our house.  They looked like light reflecting off a diamond on a much larger scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was just to the right (west and south) of Lincoln Park from my view and just above the land on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear the jet and the disks/ ovals were noiselessly hovering and rotating slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly got my binoculars and observed a dark black outline of the oval disks.  There were no wings, no propellers, and no landing gear with very bright light radiating from the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for 3-5 minutes at which point the one to the right began to tip and turn to the left slowly like it was going to leave.  I could see the dark underside which was oval shaped.  As it turned, the bright light faced to the southeast but I couldn’t see the other side of it, just the underside which appeared black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went upstairs and handed the binoculars to my husband who then watched them for 3-5 minutes.  He attempted a picture through the binoculars with his iPhone but the resolution was not good enough.  Each disk slowly tipped to the right and departed to the southwest, slowly disappearing from sight.  As they turned the lights shone the other direction and the disks appeared black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lived and worked as an acupuncturist in Puget Sound for 17 years and have never seen anything like this. I have sat on my deck or near our many south facing windows for the last 2.5 years and am familiar with all the Sea-Tac airport traffic, military planes and helicopters, have seen meteors and comets, but I have never seen anything like this.  The aircraft technology was more advanced than I have ever witnessed.<n>

It was about 5am and I saw a bright static orange light in the left corner of my windshield.  I thought it was the moon at first because the moon was really bright this weekend but it looked nothing like the moon.  The ufo was about maybe 2 or 3000 feet in the sky and shaped like two rectangles imperfectly stacked on top of each other about two inches long from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or so, the rectangles seemed to separate slightly and jumped a few hundred feet to the right. It looked like about 7 inches from my perspective.  They stayed there for about 30 seconds then one shot off into the horizon with the other quickly following behind it.  They were both trailed by a contrail of light and it seemed that they shrunk to a finite point then totally disappeared.<n>

It slowly moved up and east and the light dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later another object moved from behind the trees from the south heading northwest toward my location, closer than the first.  I flashed an LED light at it, and it immediately dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my family were startled and scared.  I told them to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later another one appeared from same location coming even closer to my location, Lower, faster, brighter.  It was flickering and stopped in almost the same spot in the sky but lower than the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took photographs of all three objects.

I happened to look alongside where I was driving, as a light had caught my eye.  I saw a formation of fiery orange balls, roughly in the shape of the Dipper in Ursa Major.  They were so low I thought they might be warning lights on power lines.  But they were over a field, where there were no power lines to be seen in the direction they were formed.  As I drove I noticed they were slowly moving.  There was no shoulder on the road I was on, and I raced to find the next pull-off.   Unfortunately it was in a well-lit shopping center.  I lept from my car, and pulled out my phone to try to capture images.  I was unable to see the original formation, as it had moved too far from view/disappeared.  But there were a couple of stragglers that were on the same trajectory that I did get on film (very poor quality).  They were travling from low to high, at a fairly consistent speed.  They were apparently traveling from Northwest to Southeast.  They appeared like they were on fire.  They didn&#39;t change direction, nor did the speed change.  Surely any kind of lantern or sterno prank (which had been suggested) wouldn&#39;t have been this bright. Also, there have been theories that it was a satellite breaking up, or refraction from a setting sun. But it was absolutely night.  However, they did go out of sight at approximately the same position.  And after the 2nd straggler was extinguished from view, there were no more.  I posted my video on facebook, and I did searches for similar phenomenon the next day, but I couldn&#39;t find anything in the area. I did, however, find a video from Oklahoma City in September that was strikingly like what I saw.  The formation they captured was larger, but very similar in span, formation, and intensity of light.<n>

My husband walked me to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enjoying the big beautiful moon, we noticed something that was bright red/orange.  Our first reaction was that a hot air balloon was in the sky but we decided it was going to fast.  It was moving from south west to North east (I think, not good with directions).  When it reached the big dipper it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for several minutes (about 5-7 min) and saw 6 of these flying the same flight pattern one at a time and disappearing when reaching the dipper.<n>
7/21/13 22:05|Niagara Falls (Canada)|ON|Fireball|5 minutes|Simultaneous fireballs flying over niagara falls and burning out|7/22/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100405.html|234|ndxe201307| simultaneous fireballs flying over niagara falls and burning out<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10pm in Niagara Falls, Ontario, people were notified that fireworks have been cancelled.  A couple minutes later a light appeared above the eastern horizon.  I couldn’t determine the size of the object, nor approximate elevation.  But I can say it looked like elevation was increasing and it west travelling to the South-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from the size and elevation, this light or fireball looked like it was travelling about the same speed as the commercial airplane.  And by this I mean it looks like it would take the same amount of time for the fireball or light to fly across the sky as an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say it was more like a fireball because of the flickering yellow and orange light it was emitting.  The fireball was pretty big when it came over the horizon, but it appeared to either burn out, or exit the atmosphere.  I think it burned out though; it didn’t look like it was travelling fast enough to just pass through the atmosphere.  BUT, there was no sign of projection.  No hot air balloon would travel that fast, and it wasn’t burning any fossil fuels because it didn’t leave a trail of smoke.  All it did was float south-west bound for about a minute and a half before it completely burned out.  After it burned out there was still a floating silhouette of a sphere-like object, but only visible momentarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was still looking for the object after it burned out, someone pointed back to the eastern horizon and there was a second fireball.  Travelling in the exact same path and it burned out at the exact same place.  There wasn’t really a timed gap between the 2 fireballs.  They were pretty simultaneous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t figure out what was going on so I thought I would report it and hopefully someone will either tell me what just happened, or maybe my report could help someone else’s investigation.<n>

The object hung below the rapidly drifting clouds and above the height of the power lines, and despite a strong easterly breeze it did not change position, it was absolutely still!  At my distance below the black sphere my best judgment of its size is to compare it to looking at a solid black bowling ball from 50 feet away.  There was still plenty of daylight in the cloudy evening sky to see the object clearly and it appeared to be motionless, solid and silent.  Planes from the nearby and very busy Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale International Airport could be heard but this thing did not seem to be making any audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I could get under it but it disappeared or at least I could no longer locate it in the sky. I looked away for a mere second to check for traffic before crossing NE 20th Drive and when I looked back to the position in the sky where this thing had been sitting it was no longer there.  I scanned the as much of the visible sky as I could take in for several minutes but could no longer locate the object.<n>

It was the size of a single engine plane and was travelling in a west to east direction.  The speed was that of a single engine plane.  No sound was heard as the object passed my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was with me in the vehicle and I opened the sunroof to allow her to get a better view of the object.  As I continued to drive she described the object as a fire ball within a triangle.  I continued to drive down the country road, and within 45 seconds the object was out of visual range.<n>

YOU DON&#39;T SEE IT!&#34; as he came running out from in between our apartments and into my view I noticed he was pointing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then Exclaimed &#34; LOOK UP! OH MY GOD YOUR MISSING IT!&#34; as I looked up I seen a very bright glowing orange oval object about a little bigger than a 747, hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now please understand we see passenger planes on approach to LAX all day and all night long over our neighborhood, as many as 5 to 7 at time lined up at different altitudes. The object was at about 1000 to 1500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked behind myself into my home to call out another person to come see it and then looked back up it elevated so rapidly, it must of accelerated in altitude from about 1500 feet to about 40,000 feet in about 1 to 2 seconds it was so high up and ! so small.  It looked to be out of the earths atmosphere within seconds and was traveling in an northeast direction till the tiny spec was unable to view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The L.A. county sheriffs helicopter is on a constant patrol in our area I even wake to the sound of it sometimes in the morning.  I also see from time to time Blackhawk helicopters in formation using the 5 freeway as a navigational tool, but the morning after the sighting I was downstairs preparing for breakfast when four Blackhawk helicopters flew directly over our block at a very very low and loud altitude and kind of circled the area, they appeared to be making a quick survey or search of the area and then quickly left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was a bright light inside of an ovoid translucent mist that had defined edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright orange light was in the center and it pulsated with brightness as the entire shape glided southerly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane on fire before realizing that it seemed to move along without disruption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned right on 16th or 17th ave to watch this event.  There were a few others at that corner but did not know if they too were observing what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother on my cell phone to ask him to look outside to see if he could see it.  He lives on 68th NW and 34ave NW but he could not see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the shape got smaller, appeared to hover for about 30 seconds before changing its course to a more southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path was crossing the lower portion of the moon.  Initially the size of this! object was at least 1/4th the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire object became smaller as it seemed to go further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light became more and more looking like a bright star until fading out entirely as it ascended above the horizon south westerly from the moon.<n>

He normally works nights.  On his &#34;weekends&#34; it is common for him to be up late at night, &#34;playing&#34; with his night vision looking for various wildlife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the occasion of this sighting, my husband had gone outside  and had been gone for enough time that I decided to go look for him.  I decided to try out front first, and as I opened the front door and attempted to step through it, my cat tripped me, causing me to lose my balance somewhat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I righted myself and regained my balance and footing, my gaze went to the mountain tops that are visible from my porch.  I was shocked to see the following in the very dark night sky:  A very large triangle(ish) shaped craft silently flying toward the mountains!  It was flying fairly low, say 500 feet above the mountain tops.  It was perfectly flat on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say large, because this thing seemed almost as big or bigger than my single car garage.  What was most bizarre about this craft was it was all the same color.  The only way I can think to describe it would be as if it were on fire.  There were no flames coming off of it.  It did not &#34;shine&#34; or blink or have lights all over it.  Just the &#34;fire&#34; that the entire craft was seemed to be covered in.  It did not have a tail or leave a trail, I would compare it to looking at the tip of a burning cigarette in a very dark room.  It moved deliberately, and moved across the sky as an airplane would, at about the same speed as a jumbo jet.  It flew over the mountain headed south west and disappeared from view behind the mountains.  There was absolutely no sound coming from it and it didn&#39;t light the ground up underneath as it flew over, almost as if the light of the fire was somewhat muted in some odd way, yet it was still fairly bright.  It didn&#39;t crash behind the mountain, and in fact maintained its flight pattern in a controlled manner as it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went back into the house and ran into my husband who was coming in through the back door.  He said he had seen something also, that &#34;disappeared&#34; when he looked at it.  He was coming into the house to tell me about it.  He described it to me as an orange UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ironically, my son in law also saw something that night.  He told us the following weekend that what he saw was orange, and disappeared also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was most certainly no airplane.  It was most certainly not a meteor, a shooting star or comet.  It is by far the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.  My husband was pretty freaked out by what he saw as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It scared me pretty bad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget it.  Unfortunately no photos were not taken as I didn&#39;t have my camera at the time this happened, and did not have enough time to get my camera before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After severe thunderstorms all afternoon it was a very cloudy night. The moon was barely visible....just a soft glow behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I saw 3 large reddish-orange pulsating lights in a triangular/V formation.  They appeared at fairly low altitude, in clear view below the heavy clouds.  The lights remained hovering in that formation for about 2min, then quickly moved eastwards and disappeared. After the initial shock and excitement, I managed to fumble for my phone and I actually captured it on video for approx. 7 seconds. It is very quick, but you can clearly see the light formation, flickering in the sky and then quickly drift east and disappear.  Fascinating and slightly discomforting.... Truly something I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed three reddish orange orbs of light moving south from over lake Washington towards Renton.  What was strange is that they all had one pulsating light and it was large and slightly diffused.  Over the course of the evening I had noticed numerous typical plane and helicopter lights passing over downtown.  They all had a series of different fine pinpoint colored lights flashing such as red with flashing white, green etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights silently passed by and headed south. Strangely there were not fading lower into the horizon, as you would expect. Other aircraft with blinking green/white lights was following the horizon and fading into the lower atmosphere. These crafts were flying a direct line of site from their current altitude to about 40-50 degrees into the sky. This means they were not flying in parallel to the ground but descending up. I quickly pointed this out to the group I was with and they immediately noticed they were not typical aircraft.  At that point they began to quickly disappear into the sky as if they were leaving the atmosphere.    About a minute later three more red/orange orbs appeared on almost the same path. Their characteristics were similar but the third light seemed to quickly speed up before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that night was crystal clear. The moon was out stars were visible. There were no smoke or vapor trails behind the lights. They moved way to fast to be flairs. They were not moving into the horizon like a typical craft but were disappearing into the upper atmosphere. They did not have a series of flashing lights but a slightly pulsating light with a reddish orange glow. This was definitely not like any craft I have seen before. The details were very similar to other events posted here as recently as June and July 2013.<n>

We observed it for at least 60 seconds as it headed towards the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to fade after that.  Its altitude was hard to determine.  If I had to guess, I would say  4,000 to 5,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed the orange ball it was so dramatic, for a split second, I thought it was an aircraft that was on fire.  You could hear no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife took some pictures and a video which I will forward if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2235 July 19, 2013, as we were contemplating going into the house, I looked east and observed another orange ball of light coming from the southeast and heading towards the northwest.  It appeared to be traveling at the same speed as our first observance.  It appeared to gain altitude as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this object for about the same amount of time as the first one before it faded.  My wife also took a picture and video of this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sit outside, at night,  quite often and have never seen something that was so stunning .<n>

They only appeared cylindrical through binoculars. Pentax 12x50 were used.  They appeared as bluish points of light with the naked eye.  They almost seemed tethered together with an invisible nearly rigid connection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the west side of Phoenix Az.,  Not far from mid-town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The general movement was to the northwest, away from me.<n>

We overlook the Mason Neck area. We can see everything from 1-95 freeway to South East Lorton, all the way out to the Potomac River.  Left to right in that line of sight are the areas of Ft. Belvoir Army Base, to Mason Neck/Woodbridge area on the right.  It&#39;s about a 5 mile distance to the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight was an overcast evening.  I was watching TV with my husband and I looked out the window that faces the river and saw what I thought was at first a reflection.  I kept staring at it, wondering why it looked like Christmas lights, because the roof of the house behind us isn&#39;t that high (and it was July!).  These red lights reflected in the mirror behind me as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both got up to check it out, went out on the deck and saw what appeared to be a formation of lights over the area of the Potomac River.  There must have been 2 dozen at first, and slowly as we watched, they all blinked off until there were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were red, sometimes white, all traveling left, right, and up (and sometimes slightly downward). Some blinked brightly, others stayed red.  I told my husband, I felt like I was looking at the milky way, but it was impossible because we never see more than a few stars at night around here, and with the overcast skies, it didn&#39;t make sense.  But that is what I could compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my phone and was able to get one picture. You can see about 9-12 lights above the roofline when I over-expose the image in photoshop.  I took 3 videos, only one slightly turned out.  It&#39;s totally black except towards the end of the less than a minute video, where you can see a few red lights.  I&#39;m going to see if I can take it into my video software and lighten it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights went away, we watched an airplane fly in the same area, horizontally, right to left, then turn and fly right over our house.  I caught most of that on video as well.  We live near the flight path of Ft. Belvoir, but rarely do these planes fly at night, and they usually don&#39;t go over our house, but stay on the other side of 95. Coincidentally (?) police helicopters flew over our area for the 20 minutes afterwards that I was out and about.  That&#39;s not unusual, seeing as we live along the i-95 corridor, in the busy suburbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what we saw. It could have been a wedding that released chinese lanterns. I&#39;ve actually never seen those lanterns in the sky before, but there is NO breeze tonight at all.  It&#39;s hot and still and humid, so I don&#39;t know why they would be moving all over if they were lanterns. Just my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both 42 year old professional people with a family.  I am well known in the community.  That&#39;s about all I&#39;m willing to put in writing.<n>

It was sitting at roughly 2,000 ft. above ground, and I estimate it was about 4 or 5 miles away, south from my location. It would be the size of a pea at arm&#39;s length.  I tried to draw my wife&#39;s attention to it as she was in the passenger seat, but she wasn&#39;t looking in the correct direction and did not see the object.  As I continued driving, I passed some trees which then obscured my view.  Once I emerged into a clear field of vision towards downtown Elkins, the object was gone.  I am very familiar with general aviation and military aircraft, and this did not fit the bill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I stood to look and there I saw a horizontal line of flickering (such as stars do) lights, colored in red&#39;s and orange&#39;s.  We proceeded off the porch to the road and watched it sit for approximately 4 minutes until it began to &#34;fade&#34; as I can only describe it.  However, we did have a nice moon that night so we could still see the object without the lights and it continued on towards the West where we could no longer see through the tree line.

They moved erratically right beside each other.  They disappeared for a few seconds and then reappeared, but disappeared in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was cloudy, we thought perhaps they were aircraft.  But we discarded that due to the strange movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suggested that perhaps they were distress flares from out at sea, but it seemed unlikely and the orbs were pretty high in the sky.  We brushed it off and didn&#39;t think anything of it after they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, out of curiosity, I googled our experience expecting to find a practical explanation, however, there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many others have reported this same sighting over the years and one occurrence was reported from last night as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all pretty skeptical but this experience was definitely surprising and puzzling to all of us.<n>

Then I happened to notice a glowing light in the eastern sky, approx. 20 degrees up from the horizon.  The sky was dark and rather hazy from clouds and I did not see a craft; it was just the light that I saw.  I did not hear any sound.  The light was spherical or oval shaped, yellow-orange in color, and it moved horizontally at first (from south to north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, it changed direction - appearing to go up and down slightly, and it shifted toward the south a bit.  Finally it appeared to move toward the north and east, and the glowing began to fade (became seemingly smaller) to what looked like a tiny dot, possibly orange or red.  eventually the light disappeared from my view.   The total elapsed time of my viewing was approximately 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time I have ever seen such a thing.  The light didn&#39;t seem to be coming from an airplane, nor from a helicopter.  I am a male in my early fifties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, age 6, was with me and asked me if it was an &#34;alien spaceship.&#34;<n>

The stars appeared bright orange, and larger that normal.  There were possibly ten though I did not count them.  It was a very clear night with the moon hidden behind trees to the right of the objects.  The sky was a light blue rather than black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short period of time (possibly 30 seconds) they started to move with four of the upper ‘stars’ shaping a square and the others moving about in what seemed random patterns.  They continued to move about in the same general area until they started to dim and go out.  One stayed for about 20 seconds or so longer than the rest before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards I did see several lights from planes coming from that general direction.  I could not tell how high they were or if they were high flying helicopters.  Planes at a high elevation are normal for our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movements of the lights looked precise and they appeared to move one direction and then reverse or change to an up or down motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the current weather information Precipitation is 0% Humidity 77% and Wind is 0 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my dog who was more interested in sniffing things than the distant objects.<n>

It was like a randomly placed formation of orange orbs/fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to get my iPhone to get a pic, it only got 3 of them as the streetlight was blinding the shot. By the time I got back outside, most of them had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 7 left when I came out with my phone, but each slowly vanished into the clouds, at the same point in the clouds.<n>

During one of many sightings, three objects formed a perfect line together another with two separate clusters above to the left.  Every object had the same reddish/orangeish light coming from them and would get brighter and then fad out, then bright again.  It could not of been a plane because plane don&#39;t go one behind another.  There were  about three in the front and about 5 in the back.  3 nights ago there was the same thing as in the same color and flashes. But in a perfect triangle.<n>

The field is dark since it is night time of course, but as i got to walking him i looked up at the sky, there were no clouds in the vicinity and the moon was shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a jetliner&#39;s lights in the sky, the regular flashing strobe lights that you see on them at night.  I looked over to what i would like to say was due east of my position when i saw the UFO. It was night so i couldn&#39;t actually see the craft, all i saw were the lights on it.  The lights were in a row, i guess the closest resembling shape of the light system would be that of a police lightbar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were white, amber and red lights on this &#34;light strip&#34; that i saw in the sky.  The object did not move, it was stationary in the sky, and from what i could judge it was fairly high up in altitude.<n>

It looked like they were burning from going through our atmosphere.  My fiancé suggested I cover my ears because he believe they were meteors.  They soon split off and one dissappeared while the other continued to fall diagonally and then started to travel horizontally.  After it was done traveling horizontally it began to fall from the sky.  We actually saw where it landed and took off running towards it and found nothing where it landed.  When it fell it looked as though it were some huge white balloon or something.  Still not sure what went on or what it was but I&#39;m still freaked out from it and no one believes us<n>

I thought it looked odd because it was so bright white and shiny like glass.  My mind started telling myself it was an airplane though it did not look like one at all. It glided through the air so quickly and smooth.  The sky was very clear.  As I looked at it at the stoplight I saw a girl in her car next to me looking at it with an inquisitive face. I tried to follow it but it completely disappeared. I believe it was an oval shape and the brightest white you can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was of a yellowish hue, similar to a headlight.  It was of variable intensity, on occasion only illuminating the area it was in and other times brightening the entire back yard.  I had my son go to sleep while I promised to watch it to make sure there was nothing wrong.  It was in a clearing in the forested wetlands behind my parents&#39; house.  There was no visible source for the light.  Only one car drove down the road the entire time I watched.  It was obviously an artificial source of light, as it would blink on 1-3 times in a one or two second period, then turn off.  I counted the intervals in my head and although it sometimes blinked after a three or nine count, it usually was after a fifteen one thousand or sixteen one thousand count.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t fire or an electrical discharge of some kind, and was far too bright at times to ! have been a flashlight.  I would describe it as a glow, because we never saw a lightsource.  I am physically disabled and was unable to investigate.  There was no reaction from the dog or cats in the house.<n>

But as soon as it showed up it hovered for a few seconds and seem to get brighter and larger then just vanished.  Completely gone.  We all thought what the hell was that.  We agreed that with in the hour we would check news and see if it was a plane crash.  It came back negative for any type of plane crashing.  The next day after talking we though night jumpers with flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally called numerous jump places to ask if they had jumped at 0022.  They all had same response and that is no one is allowed to jump after a certain time and they don&#39;t so that kind of jumping in warren county.  I still have a voicemail to prove it.

The light was orange, like the color of a street-lamp, and bright, like an airplane with its headlights on.  It travelled a slower than I am used to seeing planes fly, but at a steady pace.  It was too bright to be a satellite.  It could be an airplane with its lights on, though that seems improbable given our relation to any airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this odd light fly south.  After a few minutes the light began to pulse, or change, as if the light was turning away from me then back toward me again.  This happened for a minute or two then the light just extinguished altogether.  I kept watching for approximately five minutes, but never saw the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have encountered a sighting such as this, which has prompted me to write this encounter.  The first time was in early April (I don&#39;t remember the exact date), a very similar encounter except this original encounter occurred at 9:30 pm, the light was bright white and not orange, and it was travelling West to East much more overhead, rather than near the horizon.  But everything else was the same, the time-span, the way it &#39;pulsed&#39;, and the way it went out altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very interested if anyone has witness this here in Lincoln county or surrounding areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The two other objects appeared to be the shape of an arrow head and have multi colored flashing lights on them.  The ones in the triangular formation were just bright lights almost like headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost arriving home, I noticed they had formed a straight line as if they were following each other and looked like the were heading North toward ATL.  They stayed in my sight until I got home.  My boyfriend also called asking if I had seen the same thing and he was in a county over from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also my two friends from work called asking if I had seen the strange lights when I left work.  They were pretty obvious and out there.  Almost looking like the lights over Phoenix.<n>

7/17/13 22:40|Waldport|OR|Light|5 minutes|Five reddish-orange lights over Waldport , Oregon in the SW sky.|7/22/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100290.html|308|ndxe201307| Five reddish-orange lights over Waldport , Oregon in the SW sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Family and friends,<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on our deck tonight at around 10:35 PDT we witnessed something amazing.  It was a perfect evening with no wind, clear skies and mild temps.  I was sitting out on our deck.  I had been playing a very soft tune on my guitar that I was making up.  My thoughts were of how perfect the night was, and how much I was enjoying connecting with my guitar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up, toward the SW, and what appeared to be rising over the roof tops were five orange/red lights suspended in front of me.  They just floated there, in a formation of two at the top in a horizontal line and three below .<n> <n><n> <n><n> All lights were evenly spaced in the formation.  The individual lights were not spherical when close/brightest, but  vertically elongated in a line like a lower case i without the dot. They were very short, &#34;1 degree tall,&#34; not long lines of light.  I cannot say how far away the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise. The lights simply hovered/floated at first.  When first seen, all of the lights appeared in a space about 10 degrees wide and about 15 degrees in height in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, they seemed to be directly over the rooftops of the houses fronting the ocean.  The lowest light seemed about two hands above the rooftops.  The lights were as bright as the waxing gibbous moon, but reddish-orange in color.  They reminded me of brightly glowing embers, but did not flicker, pulsate or change in intensity until they began to move away/fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The words that come to mind are suspended formation. I did not understand what I was seeing, and looked upon the lights as a small child might view a new discovery for the first time. I was spell-bound.  Two began to slowly drift out of view/fade toward what seemed to be a southerly direction.  At this point, I snapped back into reality and ran to get my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He hurried outside in time to see a formation of three lights in a horizontal line about three hands above the roof tops.  As we both watched, he realized we needed pix of this. We both ran to get our cameras and tried getting some shots without the flash.  Mine didn&#39;t come out; his did!! It shows the lights near the final moments of their display when only two remained.  He also got some video that we are processing now.  Due to auto focus and distance, the lights only appear as round orbs.  The pix were taken when the lights were much farther away/fainter than when they first appeared as the group of five.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know these were not propelled by the wind.  The movements were too deliberate as they changed position, then remain fixed again. I feel blessed to have witnessed this!!!  This was an experience that he and I will treasure and share forever!! We know what we saw!!!  NO, they were not helicopters.  We see them all the time and they do not move like this, nor do their lights remain in the exact position.  With the changing viewing angles helis show their red, green and white lights.  There were no green or white lights.  There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flares don&#39;t move in this way either since the lights would rise, fall, move left and right very slowly.  I have not ruled-out the possibility than five remote controlled devices could have created this, but the power source/batteries for the lights would need to be very heavy to have kept the lights at the high intensity and duration we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did we see!!! He and I both agreed that nothing of this Earth that we knew of moved in that manner in inner or outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We clearly BOTH witnessed an anomaly.  Was it extra-terrestrial?  Was it local?  Was it spiritual?  We don&#39;t know.  I can only swear to you that it happened.<n>

About the time that we both were saying &#39;What the heck IS that?&#39; it seemed to move a bit to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then its lights smeared as though it were moving very fast and then it simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangest thing I have ever seen!<n>

I first noticed the mile long lights in the sky in the south east about 5 miles away.  I pulled over as the craft was fully illuminated.  I then noticed that the lights became a greyish over red and these half disc objects are now separating from the whole main body.  There must have been about 18 half disc crafts, and as they would separate the lights would go off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all crafts have now separated there was no activity for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it was all over I began to proceed down the highway and noticed that they would turn on their lights only for seconds in communication.  I stopped again and watched these tiny red and white strobing orbs fill the sky, there must have been thousands.  The larger crafts would not allow themselves to be seen while the smaller orbs were present.  The orbs were really close and I tried to communicate with them by flashing my headlights with no response from them.  I tried to vi! deo record them also with a cell phone.  The larger ones would not stay on long enough at a time. Only the smaller ones and I caught one on video.<n>

It or they moved horizontally towards the ocean for about 30 seconds then just disappeared.   They showed up from thin air and vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could no longer hear the plane sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back into my building my roommate said he had heard a &#34;weird&#34; loud boom as well but didn&#39;t look out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside with me was a man who was about to get into his car.  He watched it too then turned, looked at me, shrugged, got into the car, then drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard a boom like that once before when a meteor crashed near my hometown in Pennsylvania.  I looked up hoping to catch a glimpse of a meteor but instead I saw something that I couldn&#39;t identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the sky a few minutes later my roommate and I saw an incredibly fast moving blinking white light moving in the same direction as the three points of light.  It moved far faster than the planes I usually see and didn&#39;t have the same lights as the planes.  Just the white blinking light.<n>

It was like the lights just turned off.  The noise disappeared instantly as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more mysterious incident was that my cell phone would not work; the battery was charged, but the screen kept turning on and off and I could not call anyone (even with full signal).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

We pulled over and stopped.  My husband &amp; I noticed in the sky what looked like fire works- there were 6 circular shaped red/orange flares in the sky going one at a time from right to left, backwards to forwards.  Then went back in straight line from left to right, and the glow disappeared but we could see the shape of the “UFO” craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a very large and shaped very differently.  It had blue gleaming lights –almost translucent in color but you could still see its definition in the sky.  It hovered over the sky. It moved or floated  in different patterns/Up &amp; down and sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In no way was this any aircraft that we have ever seen.

It had a very odd orange color light.  We continued watching it when it made a vary sharp series of turns in an S shape.  Before it disappeared behind the trees it changed to a blueish color then went straight down very rapidly then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 days later, on Monday, July 29 2013 at approx 8:30 PM I was once again in my back yard when I started watching another bright orange light, this time to my immediate East. It moved very rapidly toward the North.  At first I assumed it was a F-16(as there is a Airport and Base in the area) but it vanished.  It wasn&#39;t quite dark yet, so if it merely turned off its lights I would have still seen the plane, but the craft wasn&#39;t there anymore and a sound never accompanied the light.  Another friend was with me and witnessed this as well.<n>

(Yes, I know, this is the so-called Extra-Terrestrial Highway, but it is also a great place to stargaze, boasting some of the darkest skies in the US.  Also, neither of us had ever seen a UFO in our lives).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after dark, we were sitting in our camp chairs gazing up at the sky.  We had a pair of tripod mounted Meade 9/63 binoculars, which we were using to study the half-moon.  At around 9pm, I noticed a satellite traveling across the sky from North to South.   This object’s behavior was similar to many satellites I have seen in my life… with the exception of its slightly orange-reddish color.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, who also saw it.  For the next few minutes, we tracked its progress across the sky, both with our naked eyes and our binoculars.  As the satellite reached about 20 degrees above the southern horizon, it suddenly REVERSED COURSE.  At the same time, a second object seemed to separate from the main object.  The second object was slightly dimmer and silver colored, like a typical satellite.  It continued heading south for about 30 seconds, until we lost track of it.   The original object then RETRACED its track, this time heading from south to north, un! til we lost sight of it near Polaris, the north star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the entire event took between five and ten minutes.  We had time to discuss and verify to each other what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a satellite – or the International Space Station or the Space shuttle, for that matter– suddenly reverse course.  I have no explanation  for what we saw, and I hope that other researchers might have some ideas or input.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It was silent and remained in the same spot.  I watched it for about 45 seconds as it split from one large fireball into two smaller ones and then into 4 parallel spheres of equal size.  Then it disappeared instantly without a sound.  This is the 2nd one we&#39;ve seen.  The other was last year but it didn&#39;t split.<n>

I pointed it out to my friend. We were both amazed. The light was like 5 blocks away and grew in size with time till it was about the size of a single engine plane. It was bright orange, as bright as a wielders arch.  At the brightest point or top of the craft was a diamond shape. It had a tail that pointed downward. The whole thing looked almost as one but did have a shape in the top. All was very bright orange. It moved very slowly and made no sound what so ever. It flew at about tree top level, very close. It was slow enough I ran in to get the family. My daughter and her friend (both in mid-twenties) came out to watch. Four witnesses total.  It was not over the house by the time they came out, so the event was very slow.  We watched it go over the h! ouse and down the Snohomish valley and went out of sight as it made its way South towards Mt. Rainer. That whole event lasted about 30 minutes. We went into the house and were discussing what it might have been and wishing we had a camera. We were in the house for about 3 to 5 minutes and went out again to check the food, when my friend looked up to the North and said look and a second one of exact size, shape, color and speed, silently went on the same exact trajectory. It flew over the house and down the valley, until it went out of site in the far South towards Mt. Rainer again. These must have been under intelligent control as both were carbon copies in every way as the trajectory and behavior of both was exactly the same. It was not floating on the wind, as the wind was out of the east as it is most of the time in this area. I do not think we spoke for about 2 hours as we watched the sky stunned in amazement, but that was all there were.  I have seen strange things in t! he sky before but rationalized them away, as I am not a major believer in ufos. I would never have thought to report such a thing. However this was a major event and I felt responsible to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be watching the sky a bit more closely from now on.<n>

It was during a thunderstorm, and I had seen periodic flashes of lightning.  This was not lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the window next to the TV, a bright circle flashed in the sky.  It appeared very briefly, perhaps for 2 seconds, before vanishing.  It was an extremely bright, white light similar to lightning, but it was circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could faintly hear a sound similar to a train or tornado and when I stepped outside to investigate, the sound faded quickly.<n>

I wanted to send photos to my friends so I had my digital camera with me and did just that. I wanted to get the idea of the surrounding countryside as it is so beautiful so took some shots of the surrounding hills and trees as well as of the buildings on campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I left parking lot 3C, @ 14:27, I took this photo facing, at a guess, approximately WNW to show the hills and trees. I did not notice anything unusual at this time.  I arrived home and up-loaded the photos to my computer so I could send them to my friends and saw, for the first time, something in the sky above the far hills.  I had seen and heard nothing at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to assure you that this is not a hoax, as I take this stuff very seriously but just hoped that someone might be able to look more closely at the photo and figure out if it was an aberration of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your attention,<n>

It wasn&#39;t moving real fast, in fact it appeared to be floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was black in color and appeared like a BOX or suqare shape.  On the bottom of the vehicle, as it passed over, I noted multiple rings of color that were bright,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not get a picture but I noticed no one else seemed to be staring at it, although I was in moving traffic at about 70mph on the highway.<n>

Then I noticed a star blinking white, red, orange, blue, and then a bright white blast, if you will.  Again, I figured it must be natural, due to distance and the atmosphere.   Then the bright white object moved at a speed that was simply unnatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing due west, the Flatiron Mountain range is directly in front of me.  The object was positioned at 2 o&#39;clock and raced south to my 10 o&#39;clock position and the made was looked like a u-turn and moved a little slower heading at my 1 o&#39;clock position, towards Boulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear and dark from where I was observing.  I often see commercial aircraft approaching Denver International (60 miles approx) and aircraft flying over Denver heading WSW at over 25,000 - 30,000&#39;, the three objects were in the 100,000 plus! area!  My Wife came outside after hearing me scream her name, and she watched the third object race from our 11 o&#39;clock and move due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved from point a to b in seconds (5 - 9), I did not have time to run upstairs and get the video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is a true definition of a UFO, I have no idea what we observed, if they are man made then our military has something that would be revolutionary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  My Wife has always laughed at the topic of UFO&#39;s, until last night.  Not saying she is a believer, just she was truly amazed at what we observed.<n>

In the north east sky&#39;s over Ada county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The single large white blue sphere slowly turned to 2 spheres then back to one and repeated this for multiple minutes.  While this was happening the 8 + colored spheres where slowly moving in random spots of the sky but maintained a very close proximity to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive takes 40 minutes from Caldwell to Boise and I watched them for that long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to Boise the larger blue white sphere turned to 3 and spread out horizontally but not I&#39;m a perfect line.  The 8+ colored spheres desolved to a group of 3 to 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally the spheres were over the northeast area of Ada county in what we call the north end.  They seemed higher than the hilltops of table rock at first but as I got closer they moved further east and even higher above the mountain tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went inside and went to bed<n>

I observed a round aircraft that was of an orange color, it looked like the middle of the aircraft was spinning, so that a round orange light would do a 360 turn..  When it did this it shine more deeply when the 360 turn had occurred , no noise was heard.  It was traveling towards the West , South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried getting it on my IPhone.  A video, but my lense on my IPhone couldn&#39;t take a good picture nor the orange hue was visible. Cause it was too far for the lense..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at approximately at 430 am. I saw a bright, bright white light hovering above me, no sound was coming from it..  The light was bigger then a regular plane.  It had no blinking red, or blue lights..  That&#39;s why I know it wasn&#39;t an airplane..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take a video of it for only 20 secs.  But the light seemed bigger then in the video.<n>

One is behind the other one significantly.  Initially they are a steady, un-blinking orange-yellow.  As I stare at them directly, I also notice an oval-shaped black spot moving more rapidly in the opposite direction.  After starting at the bright fireballs for about 15-25 seconds, the upper orange ball begins blinking, and then disappears.  The lower ball follows suite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all 3 are gone from sight (the two balls &amp; the black oval), I notice a tiny blue spot moving in the fashion of a satellite in orbit.  However, after it travels horizontally from the northern section of the sky to the east, its pace slows down, almost to a halt.  For a few minutes I can’t see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, my eyes gazing in that general direction, I can see it again, appearing to barely be moving at all.  It suddenly grows rapidly brighter, and then dwindles quickly and I’m again unable to see it..<n>

I watched it for a minute and noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving in a steady direction.  I thought maybe the fiery look was a combination of different flashing lights but as it got closer and more directly above me it was close enough that I could see this was not the case.  I couldn&#39;t make out any silhouette.  I called my brother and we both went outside and observe it object make a slow arc across town but not in a way that helicopters or planes normally fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was sporadic and it didn&#39;t move in a straight line.  It eventually moved away and ascended so that I could barely make out the light except for what might be confused as a colored star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He noticed a still object in the dark sky and asked if I thought it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because he was driving I was able to look more closely.  It appeared ahead of us and was elevated where a helicopter would fly, but it was completely stationary.  It looked like a horizontal bar with red, white and blue blinking lights and was about the size of a small aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove directly under it and I opened our moon roof.  This is when I noticed that from underneath; it was somewhat triangular in shape and had bright white lights on each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed from underneath it and I continued to watch it, which was now behind us.  From this angle it looked horizontal again, like a long rectangular bar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t notice blue lights this time, but did see white and red blinking ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not ever seem to move, and as we drove away it became less visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode lasted about 3 minutes.  We were on Hwy 101 north of San Francisco between the exits of Terra Linda in San Rafael and Hamilton Field, Novato.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I decided to call 911 to report this unusual site.

Our night started with simple conversation when my friend noticed how well we could see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While gazing at the stars my friend noticed what looked like a shooting star, and then another that occurred right after which went in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first he described to be a bright orange color and the second to be a faint yellow color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one we seen went a lot slower and was a yellow color.  It left a small trail behind it and disappeared into the night sky.<n>

I watched it a few seconds as it silently came across the sky from the North heading Southeast, it&#39;s light steady...never blinking.  I thought it was strange so I quickly finished my text and looked up.  A couple seconds after looking up it got dimmer, and within 2 secs, literally, it was completely gone....vanishing into thin air.<n>

It was one of the most visible skies I have seen.  The stars seemed to just stand out and I live where there is no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked straight up in the night sky (which would be close to one of the stars in the small dipper) I saw something I don&#39;t think I was suppose to see.  I double checked there were no jets in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a visible rectangle which was fully lit light a bright retangle lit fully.  Not like a shinging out of light but a box fully lit with light.  It appeared and it did not appear.  There was no fading just there and then not there.  No movement just in place and seen and then not seen in seconds. I watched and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen ufos throughout my life in western Maryland and here once but this was not appearing as a vehicle but a marker?  There were no planes in the sky and it definitely was not something moving or flying.  It looked to me more like something that was in a specific place permanently but not suppose to be visible but some reason it made itself visible or something allowed it to be completely visible for a brief period of time.  Since you have to look straight up it would not be something unless you were standing outside and looking directly up in order to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very far away like a marker above.  Since it was not fading in or out but just there and then not there and never was in any kind of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I will continue to monitor the sky in this part now that I have seen this.  I have never heard of anything like this in my readings and wonder if you have ever had anyone report this? I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland on Deal Island which is Somerset County, Md.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nearest main town is Salisbury Md.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel to email me if I can provide any further information.  I do not have a cell signal on the island.<n>

I often sit on my patio and look at the stars and regularly look for – and see – satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other night, I saw a satellite traveling from south to north almost directly above me.  Its path was originally like a hashed line.  I attributed this to reflective material on one side of the satellite reflecting sunlight as it spun on its orbit.  Its path then became solid so I reasoned that the entire satellite was somehow now reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far, nothing unusual or unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, mysteriously, it totally stopped, backed up about 5°, stopped again, and then proceeded on its original orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As many satellites as I’ve observed, I’ve never known one to be able to do that.<n>

Neither of us are into ufo lore. A bright red light, looked spherical from our view, flew silently over top of us.  Hard to say how high up but it was a ways, maybe a few miles.  It was moving pretty fast, disappeared over horizon.  A few minutes later we spotted the same or another one, same exact shape.  This one was at a bit lower altitude than the first.  It stopped and stayed in one place for a while and then got back up to speed.  It disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, my other room mate got home and we smoked a cigarette.  Like clockwork, as I told him about what I saw earlier another one appeared, this one much closer than the others.  Much lower altitude.  This one didn&#39;t have any light emitting from it though. Looked like a black ball.  By this time it was getting dark so we couldn&#39;t make out any details on it.  It eventually disappeared into the horizon too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Antigravity type motion,silent,some suddenly vanished<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the sky with my children while we were camping. We had watched the stars appear one by one and had saw a few satellites, some planes, and a few meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we all seemed to notice a moving large looking star that was satellite like until it got bigger, zoomed around quite a bit and then went across the sky but disappeared over us but a bit off center.  It did not go across the sky fully-It disappeared or became invisible right before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, we saw about ten more of them appear and move around like bugs or something that freely wandered.  They had anti gravity motion.  They often chose to stop suddenly and go in the other direction rather than turn as a human aircraft would.  I feel I saw a genuine UFO. Later that night we saw 50+ meteors.  None of the meteors looked anything like the zooming lights we saw.  The lights made no sound.  At times the lights moved very fast and even seemed to warp from one area to another.  We only saw them! for five minutes that night.  This was not the first time that I feel I have seen a UFO while witnesses were present.<n>

I have tried every way I can think of to explain this but I cannot.  These were , in my opinion , the same kind of objects I first reported on the 5th of June of this year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting has one major exception though, I was in my car with the windows down and moonroof open listening to some music.  The lights in my car started to dim, so I started the car thinking I was draining the battery.  Lights back to full intensity, for about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then everything, engine, lights, radio, horn, security system, went haywire for about 10 seconds and then my car went silent.  No power from anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately these lights appeared from above me and spread out in a line, north to south.  The 4th light was directly above me.  No sound could be heard and I was in an area where there is very little or no sound pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds like &#34;encounters&#34; of the third kind but this was more intense.  I felt the need to get out of my car and look up at the lights.  They seemed to be perfectly still above me.  This lasted for 3 to five minutes.  Then the lights apeared to either disappear completely or ascend straight up.  The color of the &#34;objects&#34; was a bright deep orange.  I returned to my car which was still unresponsive to my attempts to start or using my keyless remote to open doors or trunk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after the objects left the lights blinked and the horn honked, like you had just locked the car. I pushed the start button and it started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home and as I was leaving two people outside the gate where I was at flagged me down and asked me if I saw what they saw.  I asked them hat it was they saw.  They told me that &#34;a bunch of lights came down and one of them hovered right over me.&#34;  They wanted to know if I touched it.  From their vantage point it looked like the light was very close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear, no clouds, wind was variable.<n>

I sleep very odd hours, little bits at a time due to the nature of my job as a pharmacy tech at a VA Hospice, as sometimes I am on call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First object was pure white, it looked like a planet which is usually what I look for every night.  It had no twinkle like a star so I immediately went to it and watched it briefly and noticed it was moving and figured it was probably a meteor or a satellite.  It was almost directly over head toward East/Southeast, I had to tilt my head back to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time this was going on, I noticed a solid red light further East/Northeast moving at the exact same speed as the white light.  Both faded out of sight, nothing real spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was an amateur astronomer so I&#39;m a bit more familiar with stars/planets and other less interesting moving objects in the sky.  I also grew up near an airport and I&#39;m sure it was not a plane as, again, neither lights blinked.  There were no physics defying movements, nothing flashy it just came out of nowhere and then faded out.  It all happen within 2 minutes or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an interest in UFOs but I am a skeptic as far as belief in ! alien life is concerned, not because I believe we&#39;re the only sentient lifeforms that exist but simply because of the apparent vastness of time and space.  This information is important because I&#39;ve never reported anything like this before.  As an avid skywatcher in an amateur astronomer&#39;s heaven in a dimly lighted area of Southeast Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have a main street 2 blocks up and a facility right up the street that contributes to light pollution but other than that we have a pretty good view as opposed to other parts of Tucson and far better than most of Metropolitan Phoenix.<n>

This parade of identical objects appeared at intervals of approximately every 2-3 minutes traveling in the exact same manner as the proceeding object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get a better view, I stepped outside of my home.  Visibility was unrestricted, the wind was calm and all was silent among the bright stars.  I was unable to hear any sound from the objects unlike normal air traffic.  The flight path of the objects from the westerly horizon was approximately 45 degrees increasing to approximately 60 degrees as they traveled east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were a solid orange.  There did not appear to be any detectable mass with each light.  After observing this pattern continue for approximately ten minutes and seeing approximately 5 or 6 objects, I decided to get in my car and drive to the waterfront which is approximately ½ mile from my home for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arrival at West Falmouth Harbor, just inside of Buzzards Bay I observed the parade of orange lights continue from west to east.  There was a bright street light at the dock where I stood that did not impede the distinct orange lights.  I observed one cluster of two orange lights side by side in the parade of single lights for another 15-20 minutes. In hope of a better view and to triangulate the path, I drove to Chappaquoit Beach which is approximately 1/2 mile south of the harbor dock and was unable to see any objects so I then drove north to Old Silver Beach and was unable to see any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then returned to the dock at West Falmouth Harbor and spotted 2 more orange objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of an hour, I spotted a total of approximately one dozen similar orange lights.<n>

While all of this was going on my neighbor had stepped outside and I asked him to confirm that what I was seeing wasn’t in my mind.<n>

I was over at my friend Carol’s house again and at exactly 10:10, after looking around since 9:20 or so and just looking at a black, overcast sky, we again saw, if only briefly, the mysterious white glow on the Gulf of Mexico, to the WNW of us, off the northern end of Clam Bayou, almost precisely were we had seen it before, but more to the north (our right).  I tried again taking pictures with my camera set on “night,” but the shutter speed is too slow to hold the camera by hand – nothing came out anyway, no smears or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow “dimmered” on and off four times within a minute or two, and that was it.  We immediately went inside and looked again at Google Earth to see where the glow was coming from, and...nothing there.  The closest house is some way’s away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking through my binoculars at the spot I could see a dim spot of white light, with a bit of glow around, that was partially blocked by mangroves.  Thinking about it now, a couple of days later and knowing that pictures wont come out, if I see it again I will keep my binocs trained on it to see if that’s where the glow is coming from (I was fussing with my camera when the glow was on).  Looking at close-ups of the daytime pictures, there’s just no way the light could have been from someone exploring down there because of how thick the foliage is.  Also, the bayou is closed off and there are no boats in there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if this means anything or not, but I had been going out to the observation deck the previous half hour, flashing my flash light, with no responses during those times.  I also flashed my flash light at the glow, but no apparent response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With this being the fourth sighting of this glow at this relatively compact location (the other sighting being on the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico,  Report #3), plus this time a dim point of light that likely was coming through swamp trees, In addition to two sightings of the amber-to-red lights and a possible landing, I feel certain whatever these objects are, they are at this particular location for a reason.  My gut feeling is that something big is about to happen here.  (unfortunately, my present back problems prevent me from getting out more often…send help!)<n>

I was talking to my neighbor and glanced to the east.  I noticed a big orange/red ball.  I asked my neighbor what that was, and he said probably a firework, since someone was shooting off a few in the distance from where we were, and we could see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching silently.  We noticed it was moving towards us. When it was passing, I told him that wasn’t normal.  He said no it wasn’t.  We both said we have never seen anything like it.  It had no sound, nor a tail.  I viewed it very well.  It didn’t have a white glowing light nor an open place in the bottom like Chinese lanterns have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got an excellent view of the east, north, west and bottom of this object.  IT HAD NO OPENINGS WHATSOEVER!  Brilliant orange red color.  I did focus on it’s rim after it passed by me to see if I saw anything emitting from the sides.  I did see a little energy, one might call it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My close up look revealed that it did not flicker like most you tube videos of orbs do.  It was very bright, but didn’t hurt my eyes at the moment looking at it.  I didn’t have to squint like looking at the sun makes one squint.  It was a big ball traveling across the sky.  It seemed to be intelligently controlled in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not ideal what I saw, but I can tell you in my opinion what I  believe it wasn’t due to the close up view I got of it.  It has been suggested it was a Chinese lantern.  I have looked at Chinese lanterns on you tube.  There is no comparison to what I observed.  There was no white light.  It was perfectly round like the moon.  I know it was not a falling star, nor a piece of space junk that fell from orbit.  I witnessed a piece of Russian space junk falling and it looked like a plane on fire with a long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orb looked more like a ball of energy, perhaps one might say an orange round moon traveling.  The color was not flickering.  I didn’t see any white or black spots.  The color seemed the same all over, just brilliantly colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t see a triangle or any other shape within or outside of it.  I observed it long and close enough to honestly say in my opinion it wasn’t a Chinese lantern which skeptics want one to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a place that makes flares on the east side of Oakland.  I sometimes see them testing early in the morning off in the distance from our house.  They fall down.  I’ve seen enough of those to know it wasn’t a flare.  Besides it was on a Sunday night, and I’m sure they were closed.  They don’t travel at a constant speed and altitude either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object traveled past, I didn’t feel any weird feelings within my body.  I probably wouldn’t of noticed any weird feelings since I was so fixated on the object in question.  Again, it had no openings on the east, north, west nor bottom of object.  I could see it most clearly.  If it landed on top of the house or in front of me, I could not have viewed it any better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the National Weather Service in Memphis, Tennessee this morning.  The gentleman said the surface winds were out of the east at 10 mph.  Speculating winds aloft were out of SE 500 feet and above.  He said they didn’t keep a record of winds aloft, so he was going by what it has been lately with winds out of the east.  I didn’t like hearing winds out of the east, because that doesn’t help me with my case as to what I actually viewed.  The skeptics reading my report will suggest it was a Chinese lantern, which in my opinion clearly wasn’t.   Before saying that I would say it was a ball of energy coming from the fireworks.  I feel so strongly it wasn’t a Chinese lantern due to the great views I had of it on the east, north, west and bottom sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was…. The color was very pretty.  I don’t see Chinese lanterns having such a brilliant orange / red color.  It wasn’t like it was lit up inside an object.  The object was the light itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything I have written is my honest opinion.  I will say the altitude of the object was perplexing to me.  I can’t give you  an altitude, but I can tell you it was big enough and close enough for me to see everything I needed to see.<n>

I saw a bright light between where the fireworks were being shot and where I was located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a firework.  As we watched it, we noticed it was moving towards us.  It seemed to be at a low altitude or either it was very big and gave that impression. It passed overhead and therefore I got a good view of it.  The orb was circular like the sun and moon.  It was very bright, but it did not cause me to squint to look at it as the sun does.  It didn&#39;t have a tail, nor make any sound. It didn&#39;t have any other colors in it nor did it flicker like the ones you see on you tube videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over, I made a point to look at the rim to see if I saw anything emitting around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice a little energy, I guess you can call it, but only when I looked hard at the rim after it passed. It was not a Chinese lantern as some may suggest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a good look at it probably between 2 and 3 minutes, especially when it passed overhead. I know it was not what has been suggested it might have been to me. I had no funny feeling in my body as it passed over, just amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That happened night before last and tonight I have a sore throat, gee I hope that orb didn&#39;t give me something! :o)  I&#39;m joking, but I&#39;m also serious about that last statement!<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has seen this orb or any other in Oakland, PLEASE report it to an online UFO reporting site.  I&#39;m sure all of us that have had the opportunity to see one of these orbs would love to see how many others in Oakland and across the country that have actually gotten to see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m wondering if it is a good or bad thing seeing one...I&#39;m honestly having mixed feelings. What are they?  Are they good, evil, just a ball of energy, a secret government! project or what?<n>

I can not say for certain that the jets were military, but by judging by their size, the fact that they were flying in a close nit formation, and their altitude, I feel safe assuming that the 2 jets were military.  Compared to the size of the jets the metallic sphere had to have been huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought we had not gotten a photo of the object, but after reviewing the photo we did happen to capture the sphere in a very blurry image.<n>

Went outside around 10pm to see a HUGE orange orb it looked like it was a smoldering lava rock but perfectly round not moving a hair..  it stayed in the sky for about 10-12 minutes. I eventually witnessed it just literally blink and it was just gone. .  Wife and I were very weirded out soon after maybe 30 minutes later we started hearing fighter jets what it sounded like.  Around 12 am I heard it for the 3rd time eventually she went to sleep and I stayed outside.  1:43 am rolls around and what looked like jets with odd red pulsating lights some with different formations of light patterns on the belly started to damn near break sound barriers.  The crazy thing is I could 100% identify jets but some of them didnt have thrusters on the back and the one that stuck out most was straight narrow with three red lights on the belly and didnt have a thruster nor sound.  So idk wtf is going on!  but someone said it was a top secret training exercise. . Idgaf who you are but if you believe its a training exercise at 1 -3 am your just a sheep to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

No noise noted.  Object was very large and no other lights were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2-3 minutes, it left our sight and after another 2-3 minutes, it was followed by another identical object traveling along the same route and heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation was estimated to be around a 1000 feet and object thought to be from 3/4 to 1-mile away at its closest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed was much faster than a helicopter, but somewhat slower than a fighter jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I though I detected a reflection of its light on some surface at the object&#39;s rear, but I could be 100% positive about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most air traffic in our area is from N to S and the only E-W traffic we see is usually at very high altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frequently, we see choppers from the KY Nat.

I thought that it was moving very slowly to be a plane and was way to high to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife to pull the car over so I could see if the object was moving or not.  When she stopped the object was in fact not moving at all, it then started to move backwards and forwards for a few seconds and then stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe a minute the craft started moving to what I believe would be its port side, assuming that the craft was facing towards our position, and moved just a little and then it seemed to jump forwards in the same direction it was heading and then stopped for a second and then took off.  It looked like something you would see in a sci-fi movie where it went into warp speed or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few more minutes and did not see anything else in the sky other than the starts that were there.<n>

It was shaped like a triangle but it had mass and rounded features.  It had blue and white lights to the back of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went very slowly over the house and continued its way across the town and up the west valley moving about the same speed and staying fairly close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so stunned that we just stood grasping each other for a few minutes and then one ran inside for the others and we all stood and watched it until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all agree it was NOT an airplane or helicopter.  The sound was something like a very high pitched but very very quiet jet plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time we had all seen anything like this!<n>

In comparison to airplanes, this thing is monstrous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about an hour.  The object was viewed between two stars but after about a half hour, has moved to the right and was slightly closer to the right hand star.  The location is southwest of Debec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s very easy to see with the naked eye.  We tried to video it with a cell phone but was not able to zoom close enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite a remarkable sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s still going on at the time I filled out this form.  That&#39;s about an hour and a half that it has sat there, just slightly moving west.<n>

As we approached closer, I noticed there were 5 bright glowing red circles high up in the sky, but not as high as an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend tried to take photos and video with my iPhone 5 but they were not coming out...I had to turn around and see if the lights were still there. I exited Lincoln highway and turned back around heading east on I-80.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were still in the sky, in the form of a triangular shape, parrallel with the ground in the same manner an airplane would be flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As risky as it was, I had to pull over on the highway to take photos and attempt a video (only one light was left at this time).  I was trying to figure out exactly what these lights were and I immediately thought of lanterns because they were glowing...but they were moving in sync and in form which boggled my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the weirdest part, I have seen these lights before in 2006 in Tinley Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to be a big believer in UFO&#39;s and have always looked towards the sky, but over the years I have no longer cared as there are no answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only reporting this for due diligence. Whatever the lights were, it was either a clever trick using lanterns or something that is beyond what we will ever know.  I want anyone reading this to know that I have a witness,  I called the non emergency police to see if there were any other reportings, I have (sadly) bad photos and video, and I was compelled enough to turn on my hazards and pull over on a busy highway to try and document this.  If it&#39;s someone playing a trick, they need to be caught, and if not, then it can only help.  I have become very rational since 2006, and I wanted to view these objects to come up with the most rational answer that I could, but what I have posted is all I can say.  The most important note is the the lights were the exact same lights I happened to witness in 2006, and appeared traveling across the sky.  It appeared the first 6 lights formed almost a &#34;flock&#34; if you will and disappeared, leaving one light behind that I was able to record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want people to know I am not looking for fame, attention, money, I just felt it was my obligation to report this and have it documented somewhere for someone who still cares.<n>

They were uniform in color, shape and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These amber colored lights were at least 50x larger then the biggest star visible to the naked eye and as bright as car headlights set on high.  They were staggered in their allignment and some of the lights hovered and appeared to wait as others that were observable through the trees slowly rose up to complete the formation.  I would aproximate that there were at least 15 crafts visible and hovering above the trees, but it was also dawning on me that this was not a normal occurence and you just don&#39;t see things like this unless you are watching a Will Smith movie!!  I was in panic mode now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly backed down the street and into my parent&#39;s dive way. Barefoot and tripping over myself I stumbled into my parent&#39;s house.  Breathless and in broken English I tried to explain what I had just witnessed.  Better yet, I talked her in to coming back out with me so that I could show her firsthand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at the spot where I had seen the crafts and two were still visible. I suggested we drive around the reservoir to see more.  At this point we did notice the sky was bright pink and we both felt cold electrical charges though out our bodies.  After a half hour or so I turned around to take my mother home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached my parent&#39;s street I commented on how I was feeling that cold, electrical feeling again, only it was even more pronounced. My mother responded and told me not to freak out but there was a good explanation for this.  There was a craft directly above my car!  It was at this time I saw an amber glow outlining my car.  To the right of us we saw 15+ crafts hovering above my parent&#39;s house. Just as before, only this time I had a witness, and better yet, I wasn&#39;t alone!!  Both, my mother and I have had a long history of unusual happenings-though never something this big or tangible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we arrived back to my parent&#39;s home, all the crafts had vanished, that quick.  All that remained was  a bright pink sky and we both continued feeling that cool electrical charge throughout our bodies for a half hour or so after seeing the last of the crafts.  One point I forgot to mention above is that my satellite radio was not working during this event.<n>

At 10:15 pm on July 13 2013 I was watching TV when I looked out of my living room window to the South and saw a red/orange object traveling from the East going to the West. It looked to be about twice the size of the brightest star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out into my back yard and saw that there were two of them.  I got my phone in video mode and filmed them until they went behind my neighbors trees.  I saw that there were three more coming into view and I filmed them as well until they also went behind the trees.  I switched my phone into HD mode and got another, much better video of one of the objects.  When I zoomed into the last one you can see its colors changing rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all traveling at the same speed and in the same direction but not in a straight line.  One was a little lower than the rest.  I don’t know how fast they were moving but they came into view from around a tree to my due South and went out of my view behind my neighbors tree to the Southwest of my house, in about a minuet to a minuet and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the six objects all were out of view I stayed outside for another half hour to see if there were any more.

We noticed an orange cylindrical comet shaped object traveling across the sky at a high rate of speed (much slower than a shooting star but about twice as fast as International Space Station), traveling from East to West 265 degrees magnetic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was losing altitude and a orange tale was noticeable, tale increased in length (Est. 10 mile long tail) as it approached the far west skyline.  Approximately 20 degrees off the western horizon object stopped in sky and ejected 2 orbs then ejected an additional 2 orbs for a total of 4, they were very bright and would move in different patterns from a triangle to a horizontal straight line pattern slowly ascending then descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this activity for about 7 minutes when they slowly disappeared.  I did take some pictures of this event, two of the pictures are somewhat skewed due to me moving the camera, all objects were perfectly cylindrical.  I also attempted to take video with my I phone but it locked up because it was processing pictures.

While sitting in the driveway with two friends about 10 pm on Saturday, July 13, my female friend said, “What is that?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming from the southeast over the valley was a bright reddish glowing object, about the level that a small plane would fly at, and traveling at the speed of a small plane, traveling on a southwest path some distance away.  My male friend got out his binoculars which have excellent optics and looked at the object.  He said he had no idea what it was - no wings, no noise, just a round glowing light.  I looked at it through the binoculars and saw only a bright orange-red glow.  She looked at it and saw a tint of blue besides the red.  We all heard no noise, saw only a round glowing object with no wings or discernible features. He watched it the longest and said it turned yellowish and disappeared.  She and I could not see it at that point because our view was blo! cked by trees.  She commented that there is no place to land around here.  He insisted it did not land; it was still traveling when it turned yellowish and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen anything like this before, and it definitely was not a Chinese lantern since we all viewed it through excellent binoculars and saw no flame or any features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my 60s and my two friends are middle 50s.  All of us have technical backgrounds.  I do not drink and my friends were not drinking that evening.<n>

It was unusual because it is quiet. Makes no noise at all.  We watched as it changed directions and headed out of sight.  I attempted to look at it through binoculars but once I got the lens aimed the object through the lens appeared to be jumping all over the place.  This all took place within 2 minutes.

Within minutes however another appeared flying much faster and it too vanished rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We  then saw what appeard to be a plane traveling in the same direction but it too vanished.  The final orb was going slower but instead of getting smaller or becoming faint like the others it seemed to flicker and go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can imagine we began looking all over the sky  quite nervous and sure enough we saw several smaller white lights flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two appeared to be stars but one went out and the other fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire work show progressed without anyone else taking notice but during the show there were two flashes in the area of t! he fallen UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are rather worried because we were in an area over looking the city and seemed to be the only ones to notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that me and my girlfriend both tried to take pictures on our cell phones and though we could see the images clearly on the screens once we took the picture you could not see the UFO&#39;s any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a full time cook and my girlfriend is currently an employee at an ambulance service as an EMT.<n>

My wife and I run out and sure enough I see two of whatever they are, moving from east to west.  Difficult to say the distance but they seem fairly close (I estimate a couple of kilometers or less at about 1500 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were a pretty steady orangish red and seemed to move at a constant speed about the same as a very small airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor said he watched them for a good three minutes before I came outside, all followed the same route, east to west until they were right in front of us and turned north towards Ottawa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects never changed altitude nor did their speed change and no sound at all.  About a minute after heading north they just dimmed and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to run and grab a camera and got 3 shots of one of them before it faded out, of which only one picture shows the thing as I saw it, the others show narrow trails of light in a squiggly pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night with no wind at all, temperature was about 27 Celsius (about 80 degrees F.)  This experience was at the same time fascinating, chilling and very bizarre.<n>

I walked a couple steps before I glanced up at the sky something having caught my eye.  I found that what had in fact caught my eye was a single burnt orange and perfectly round orb/fireball looking object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silent.  The night was absolutely clear this night and I was absolutely certain this object was not a star or the moon.  For the next 20-30 seconds I’d guesstimate I tried to reason it was some unfamiliar aircraft and I began to look for lights on the object I’d recognize.  Red, blue, or white lights that are typical on more common aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft do not have blue lights.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused more on this object I realized it was going at what seemed to be a very fast speed, and it appeared to have a hazy effect around it which appeared to emit an off, faded yellow type aura around the orb itself.  The object was low,  I can’t say specifically how low, but I will say it was very large and it almost looked as though it was approaching at an angle as if to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **According to our local forecast center the Wind speed at 9:53pm on July 13, 2013 was 11.5 mph and its direction was ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To continue on… as I continued walking forward I glanced down at my phone which is how I can record the time I saw the object.  I did not think to take a picture or video, for some reason the idea simply was not present.  A minute or so later I looked up to see any changed in the object and did not see the object.  It had simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked home, quickly and somewhat leery at this point (as the object had disappeared).  And continued on with my nightly routine still not entirely sure how to respond or what to think to what I’d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple days I decided to see what I could find online about similar experiences and realized there are many.  I found this website, and although unsure of it, am choosing to share my experiences here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -B<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Turning at weird angles and silent.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100470.html|424|ndxe201307| 2 Bright Red Lights - Then 2 More!  Turning at weird angles and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Saturday night, 7/13/13 at 9:30PM, when I decided to let my dog out the front door and smoke a cigarette.  My family was on vacation and I was the only one home unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just above the tree line, with considerable distance, was two bright RED lights (more later)..  These lights were circular, and much brighter and about twice the size of red blinking lights you would see on a plane, but not blinking.  I stared at it, and thought...hmm that looks kind of funny, and started to realize it was not a plane.  It was hovering, or moving incredibly slow, but definitely moving.  The two lights were always parallel to each other, but at a slight angle. I ran and grabbed my phone inside, just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, I noticed the lights started moving faster, and they started turning in a weird angle that no plane could.  Almost as if it was doing barrel rolls, or slowly spinning around each other.  This is where it got weird....I then notice two more red lights! , come out of no where!  They were just as bright, and also a similar distance between the two.  They all started moving off to the north, but you could tell they were separate bodies, or seemed to be.  Changing speeds, faster then slow to a hover.  The second pair of lights were at a weird angle, and definitely not perpendicular to the other set.  One set started going behind the tree line, and I ran down the street to try and follow it, but lost it.  The second pair of lights, again was moving at weird angles, and then all of a sudden disappeared.  I did see them pop up again, but then disappeared again.  After that, I stared at the sky, and saw nothing.  The weirdest part, is there was absolutely NO sound... They seemed like they were over the Connecticut River, and usually if we see a helicopter searching in that area, we hear it and it is incredibly loud, but nothing was heard.  When I grabbed my phone (Galaxy S2), I tried taking pictures, but they came out completely ! black because of the dark.  I even made a video, and it has th! e audio of me encountering the UFO and wondering what the heck was going on, but again it was completely black.  Incredibly disappointing, especially when I was trying to explain my story.  Another crazy thing, was the fact that my aunt sent me a report of an incredibly similar story about a half hour north of me, near Greenfield Mass (I can&#39;t remember the town name exactly, but I&#39;ll have to find it again! and try and get back).  That sighting was said to be at 10:00PM the same night!   His story has similar red lights, but he also saw a few different color flashes.  This night was a little cloudy, but nice and comfortable, with only light wind.  I&#39;ve never seen a UFO before, and I&#39;m still trying to comprehend what I saw.  I&#39;m usually a skeptic with anything funny in the sky, but this was different.<n>

Directly in front of me to the south, I saw a bright orange ball of light, almost flame like, moving upward at a fairly steep angle, rapidly heading south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within what seemed to be maybe a matter of twenty seconds or so, I saw two more come up back to back and do the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next door neighbor was coming out of his front door about this time and we saw this same thing happen multiple times.  With the sheer amazement of what we were seeing neither of us could honestly say how many there actually were.

After retiring continued his career in aviation.  I my self have  done my share of private flying.  I feel that I can honestly say that I have been around enough fast planes to know that these were no airplanes.  It almost looked as if missiles were being launched.  I thought at the time about the possibility of fireworks.  There never were any explosions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went as far as calling 911 non emergency to see if anyone else had reported this event while it was taking place.  The dispatcher I spoke with was not aware at the time of any calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not one of the types of people that says &#34;it&#39;s aliens.&#34;  I am simply writing to repot about the extremely strange objects in the sky that we saw.<n>

We got up and moved to a clearing to get a better view of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to come in from the ocean, get to a certain spot and then take a R turn to head North.  As they flew away from us, they gained altitude and flew up and away into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two of them to begin with, then after they made their R turn north, another came into view.

I asked my girlfriend if she saw it, she did  but said it was probably a star.  I would think that with the sun going down stars would first appear to the east when darkness sets in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So once we got to house, I grabbed my camera and tripod and went out side and quickly snapped two pictures of the object.  To the naked eye it looked like a very large bright white light that was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the camera was set up, I noticed that the object was moving very slowly west and that it seemed a lot closer than a stars appear to be.  The two pictures I took were the best I could do with the equipment I have, which since we have been seeing strange things lately; I have with me at all times now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures were uploaded and I looked them over and was surprised to notice that in both pictures there was the object; and then there was a small blue light/object next to it. what was even more strange is that this blue light is in a different spot next to the object in both photos; like it was orbiting the larger light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Larger object in the second photo also had what appeared to be a split between it; which was strange but could be clouds shadowing it.  I am happy to have gotten this on camera, it is definitely unidentified to me.  If you have seen this before whether its normal, strange, or camera glitch; please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that I found something worth while.<n>

The first one appeared to be basically traveling from South to North as if possibly heading for Ellington AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a solid reddish/orange light and no normal flashing navigation lights. Just a solid glow.  We, with our best guesses, estimated it to be flying at about 500-600 feet and it didn&#39;t appear to be traveling very fast.  Maybe 75 - 100 MPH or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was very little if any wind at the time.  It was hard to really gauge how big it was because it was hard to tell how far away it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew completely silent, no noise at all.  It continued on its course until it went out of sight behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one appeared about a minute later on the same heading as if a carbon copy of the first but as soon as this one got almost directly in front of us the light flickered a few times and went completely out then we could see the roundish or maybe octagonal shape of &#39;what! ever&#39; it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the light went out it began a gradual descent and it appeared to have gone down due to loss of power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove around for a while to see if I could spot any suspicious vehicles or objects in the area and I didn&#39;t see any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went out at 9:00 last night and was blown away by this ..ok,  I don&#39;t believe it was from outer space, just, the brightest red cone shape with an oval yellow/orange base to it.  It was moving slow enough that I wished I had run in and gotten my camera but was too afraid it would be gone… I watched this glowing/flickering red that was a gorgeous color and it seemed to move around as it was going through the sky.  I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it until it was too far away to make it out anymore.  No sound to it at all… I literally froze in awe the first minute… I would love for someone to tell me the rational explanation as to what this was.<n>

Altho I had not heard a sound my first thought was of fireworks.  They were traveling northeast, some what toward me at a very slow rate of speed.  They were in a straight, side to side pattern, with brightness remaining constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second thought was of a glider plane with a light on each wing and one on the nose.  By this time, I had interrupted my conversation with my dad, to explain to him  what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed way lower than the few clouds we had that night, and remained at a slow constant speed.  To me it seemed about 150 ft up. I was standing on the pond bank by now for an interrupted view.  The two outside lights dropped uniformally lower slightly to suggest a triangle, removing the idea of a glider plane. They passed through the night sky above where the moon appeared to me to be,with enough ! moon light between them to see that there was no craft attaching them. The center light faded out as they passed from my left to my right,with the outside ones continuing on,until momentarily they also faded out,leaving no trace of anything having been there.                                                                      At no time was there any sound,nor any fireworks going off in the area. The  multitude of similar reports across the nation ( discovered after the fact) is the causation for this report. I make no assumptions, only this eyewitness account.<n>

The room features large windows, and a glass sliding door, so the sky can be seen from three sides of the room.  I was sitting on the couch, and behind me was the largest window in the room, with no curtains.  My partner was sitting on another sofa to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, my partner looked past me, out the window.  I turned to look at what she was pointing at, and it looked like a triangular craft of some sort, with yellowish green lights on the sides.  From where we were, we could only see two &#34;sides&#34; with lights. It moved pretty slowly through the sky, and it looked lower than a regular plane would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed by flying west over Haddon Heights, NJ, we saw what looked like a military plane or chopper with a bright search light on it.  After the onject passed over, our German Shepherd was barking and acting strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes often pass over on their way to Philadelphia Intl airport, as we are in a flight path.  What we saw was not a commercial aircraft, and made no sound like a jet would make.  It hummed in a low pitch, no loud jet engines heard.  I am wondering if others saw it since it wasn&#39;t yet late and many people would still be awake.<n>

Like when you see a shooting star how it leaves the tiny white line for just a second, BUT this one was reddish-orange (more red than orange) the trail stayed for about 40 seconds then slowly fadded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked for about an hour about the event my buddy was staring at the sky when it happened and said he saw a &#34;teardrop like thing start to fall and thats when the flash happened.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the only difference between our stories is that he says he saw the flash first &#34;like a flash from a camera, then the red-orange trail&#34; we both watched the teardrop fall but we beli! eve it fell into the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: goose bumps, the hour we stayed outside two unexplainable events happened a mysterious fog roughly 15 minutes after sighting lasting 5 minutes but covering entire mountain side, and also a neighbor&#39;s light, dimming and getting brighter as if loosing power but at 3:23 in the morning????

It flashed for one second and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was somewhat confused because it was the brightest object in the sky for that second. Then there was another flash of the same color directly to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I jumped off my hood and ran to the center of the road to try and get a better look but it disappeared in about a second as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I was standing in the middle of the road facing back to my car, facing south, I was looking straight up when a blue meteorite flew overhead and there was a final flash of the same color directly overhead that lasted the same amount of time as the other sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise and the object was not visible in between the flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other people with me each saw at least one of the flashes<n>

The lights appeared to be attached to a triangle shape.  It was hard to gauge their height and size, but they appeared to be pretty high in the sky.  The first batch of 10 moved to the north, then stopped in a formation, and appeared to get smaller, as if they were going straight up; the lights were still strobing.  Several moments later, a single light followed and went past the original group, and one more followed after that, disappearing to the north.  The original group of 10 got progressively smaller and eventually just looked like a constellation of stars.<n>

Around 11:30 pm my 14 year old grandson wanted a soda from the convenience store a couple blocks away.  We walked to the store and while I waited outside for him I noticed what I first thought was probably a plane about a mile or so away, traveling west towards me in the night sky.  But as it got a little closer I realized it had no blinking airplane lights and seemed to be traveling slower than most planes I’ve observed coming into the Auburn airport, plus it wasn’t in the normal flight path for the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after a few more minutes it was maybe a half mile away and appeared to look more like a illuminated sphere shaped object.  My grandson came out of the store and I pointed it out to him.  As we walked east down an ally just off E main street towards G street SE we watch it come closer until it was almost directly above us. It was a silent, whitish glowing sphere about  10 - 20 feet in diameter and 250 feet high (just below a patch of clouds creeping by).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we heard the sound of a commercial jetliner and  within seconds we saw it traveling northeast directly towards the object but  well above it.  As the jetliner entered the clouds and passed over the sphere object, the object suddenly stopped and hovered for about one minute and then slowly ascended straight upwards through the clouds and out of site.<n>

I&#39;m using my sisters room to sleep in, and I have been laying watching tv.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something.  At first I thought it was just a reflection from my computer on the glass, but I closed my laptop and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and looked out the window. about 75 feet about the tree line was a triangular shaped craft. Light at each corner.  I thought maybe a stealth bomber… they do training runs through our area.  However no sound whatsoever.  I mean you couldn&#39;t hear a thing. and also, it was moving way too slow. Like 25 MPH, max.  The craft was at best guess, 20&#39; each side.  I&#39;m guessing here. but the three lights on the corners were prominent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went and got my other sister out of bed to see it.

We spotted objects in the air flying out of the east horizon.  They moved strongly west (slightly southwest) at speeds consistent with incredibly fast/low flying fighter jets which we have at our local air base in Fort Wayne, IN.  They flew almost directly above us but slightly to the south of our vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were objects (at least three dozen or so) which appeared to be circular in nature but more oval shaped (similar to the body of a jellyfish).  There were no sounds at all or any beacon type lighting.  They blended in with the sky very well but seemed illuminated by the ground lights of the city/suburbs near us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was not visible to us for any comparison but they were much bigger than any stars (about the size of a quarter or fifty cent piece hel! d at arms-distance).  When we first noticed them, they came in “squadrons” of about three in a seeming v-type formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several of these and were followed last by a very large clustering with no definite formation other than being in a large group.  They were all flying at speeds consistent with each other and very close together, not breaking from their location in relation to their set patterns and the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be headed for a specific location and quickly.  It is a cloudless, very calm evening with virtually no distinct wind at ground level.  Our ground elevation is 826’.<n>

It started in Elk Grove Park while watching the fireworks when a family sitting on the lawn area in front of my family began pointing up to the sky before the fireworks started.  We looked up and saw the same type of unexplained phenomenon that I have been seeing virtually every night since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night 7-12-2012 after seeing 6 flying orbs the previous night I stepped into my back yard at approximately 10 pm anticipating to see some more action and again they appeared.   I looked up and initially saw only stars then out of nowhere what at first appeared to be a satellite grew very bright with an intense white light as it moved in a North East Direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moving light pulsed several times before dimming out then disappearing.  4 minutes later what at first appeared to look like an airplane due to a much lower altitude appeared from ! the south and as it flew overhead lit up several times almost as if it were pulsing with an immense bright white light.  It generated  no sound as it flew over and right when it was directly overhead it came to a slow crawl as it lit up immensely again  as if it recognized I was looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my video phone but was unable to catch it on video due to the low battery on the phone.  After stopping and lighting up extremely bright it continued on its original path before disappearing out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to all the recent activity around here I am beginning to wonder if these crafts are related to Beale AFB as they seem to travel to and from the general direction of the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are definitely not conventional aircraft or satellites.<n>

I&#39;m not sure how els to describe the sound,other then world war 3! we checked local news to see if maybe there was construction going on to explain this or if we were in fact being &#34;attacked&#34; ..we couldn&#39;t find a thing. the noises stopped around 10:30 but shortly after around 11:00 they started aga! in,only this time right out the front door!! we could clearly see bright flashes of white lights with an orange red glow-now i&#39;m a rational person i tend to believe there&#39;s a reason or explanation for most everything,but this was very weird!!! the lights would come &amp; go but in almost the EXACT same spot each time-again we could clearly see the big dipper along with other constellations this made NO sense at ALL!! how is it these lights came with no clouds? why where they there? so again we checked the local news,nothing! we even turned on the computer scanner sure we would hear a rationale explanation for this,but we did not find 1!! so we stand outside watching these &#34;strikes&#34;  of light but that sound,that sound ill never forget! it was so eerie..I&#39;ve heard people say they have seen crafts but never any noises at this point now i&#39;m thinking outside the box! as the entire block gathered 1 a retired police officer &amp; his family the other a judge here in billings,so ! on so forth &amp; we are all completely confused! all of us watchi! ng now w e see the bright white lights behind those lights an orange reddish glow from below &amp; behind this &#34;event&#34; we&#39;ll call it seeing as no1 has mentioned it on the local news or anywhere other then social media sites,we did not see any kind of &#34;craft&#34; or anything like that,other then when the light came it was very peaceful outside,clear beautiful sky&#39;s no storm cell&#39;s NOTHING out of the ordinary except these weird lights above &amp; behind our homes! the stranger thing is they moved around billings in a FULL circle,my husband called his sister in Lockwood about 8 minutes out of billings-as we listened &amp; watched in disbelieve we could hear &amp; see it moving,she also heard &amp; seen these strange lights &amp; sounds out in the Lockwood area! she had thought maybe a storm had kicked up out of the blue or maybe the refinery was having issues as they sometimes do here! she also said the noise was so loud that the car alarms in HER area went off each time this happened-but in th! is case i think we can safely say this was NO storm &amp; had nothing to do with the refinery&#39;s! again this went on from 10pm to 1am..if anyone can please help explain what this may have been i would be very grateful for any information! it was july 12,2013.. on &amp; off from 10:00pm to 1:00am .. very fast moving lights bright white very loud war of the worlds sounds,along with an orange &amp; red glow about it more at ground level,i know this may sound completely crazy but not 1 of us can figure out what the heck was going on!!! in total there was me,my husband &amp; to be far i would say 20+ people - some with their children so not counting the little one&#39;s,but thats how badly this &#34;event&#34; has freaked us all out! .. again i&#39;m a fact based type personality so i am trying to find some logical explanation for this..i guess a &#34;had to be there&#34; moment to understand the bizarreness of it all- between the extreme sounds &amp; amount of lights it was all just VERY VERY bizarre! ! i know it is near impossible for just us in the heights to hav! e seen &amp; heard this! i think most people are just ignoring it or chucking it up to something logical like i was trying to do which is why i&#39;m just now posting this,a friend of mine looked all over the internet to see if any1 els had posted about seeing these &amp; she found this website - so i know this is very long i just want to know if any1 at all knows what it could possibly be! while we watched it did cross our minds that maybe we were being struck by a meteor shower by the sound of it &amp; at first site! it was not that so..again sorry so long just looking for good info on this event! i almost forgot my husband just reminded me as i read to him what i am posting-this is very important i cannot believe i left this part out sometime around 11:00 pm all th way until 1:00am we did hear &amp; see 1 helicopter &amp; several air plans you could see &amp; hear they were not big crafts like jet plans going back &amp; forth city to city these looked &amp; sounded smaller like maybe military or we could be totally! wrong &amp; it could be just the local air port,its just kind of ironic the sky was completely clear untill this event &amp; than we seen &amp; heard air plans &amp; a chopper..thankfully my husband reminded me of a very important detail i almost left out! ..  b/c i am certain the crafts we DID see are from the area i didnt check the little box that asks the # of crafts seen,but in total we seen 1 helicopter &amp; 2 air crafts - not like ufo air crafts they looked like ours ..i would say for certain they are ours ..but did not witness any strange air crafts- i.e. ufo or strange looking crafts .. i just want to be as clear as possible and give all the facts &amp; give them right so theres no confusion ..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The neighbors (over the hill and unseen) had been sporadically shooting off backyard-style fireworks for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:00 pm   I went outside to get something from my vehicle.  I immediately noticed two bright orange circular lights traveling above the tree line, moving slowly and steadily in a W to NE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vermont has been under a near month long deluge and was one of the first dry nights we’ve had in weeks.  The stars were out and it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside the house and called 2 of my family members outside to observe the lights as well.  We watched together as the lights traveled across the sky.  There was no sound relating to the objects or their movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were following the same path and were in single file, about 12” apart in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3 minutes the first light completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later the second orb did the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute or two what we thought was the first light reemerged distantly “down” the sky and to the NE, where it stayed and “twinkled” from light orange to white to orange.  (It was still there an hour later when I left for the night so I don’t think it was the same object).  We didn’t see the second light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One family member stayed outside for another 10 minutes.  She alerted us that there was another light, traveling in the same trajectory but MUCH lower.  This circular light was a deep orange and disappeared into the tree line at Due West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few minutes to see where it would reemerge but did not see the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get one photo of the first light before it disappeared.  It is attached here for your perusal, although the quality is poor.<n>

I didn&#39;t notice this object while I was taking the shots, but it shows up in several and appears to be moving across the sky.   I have tried to enlarge it to get details but only end up with a circle.  This circle is first seen at the edge of a cloud and in successive photos appears to move west.   I will try and forward the photo set which will have an incorrect date.  The shots were taken within a 3 minute time span.  I hesitated to file this report because I thought it may be a natural object.  When I read a post dated that evening in Atalla, AL, which is about 20 miles away, I decided the photos may be of some significance.<n>

I knew it was not a plane as I saw no wings or sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft suddenly made a sharp turn to the North which really was not like any plane would ever turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two jets also turned to the North in a way that any jet would turn could see them both dip down and turn North still keeping a distant from the craft.

Object began to fade out as it made a sharp radius turn from where it appeared, and began an initial heading to the North in the vicinity of the head of the constellation Hercules before the course correction and took a final heading of west-north-west before it faded out completely.  At its peak intensity, it was the brightest thing in the sky-  Tiny sliver of moon had already set below horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From its initial appearance with no discernable velocity in relation to other stars that were visible and then begin motion as it did, final velocity before going black- maybe 200 knots, assuming jet that passed through later was travelling at about 450 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No marker lights, no strobe visible when it went dark, so not likely a commercial or private aircraft.  Too bright to have been a wing light, (as those are usually in pairs (one on each side of the aircraft), and which tend to have a slight yellowish cast as well- so not a wing light), as well as being too close to one airport (St. Cloud) to be any commercial or commuter aircraft that may have took off to be that high.  Not to mention too many variables to appear as often as this one has at the same time as it has appeared.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only other aircraft visible came through about 10 minutes later with strobe and red and green marker lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It appeared to be lit from within.  The object covered the sky from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds.  It was so dimly lit that it was hard to tell exactly where it was and appeared to be jumping or skipping across the sky.  I think that was only because my eyes were having trouble tracking it, being so dark and so dimly lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be very high and very large but I did not pick up any details on shape at all.

At first I just thought they were planes but noticedthey were solid orange and didnt have the typical blinking lights of planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe them for a minute or so then lost them as I turned into my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled in my driveway and got out of my car looking for them and didn&#39;t see them at first but then noticed one in the sky followed shortly by 2 planes flying directly towards it from the southwest flying northeast towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the 2 planes were flying in parallel with one slightly behind but then the one behind fell in line directly behind the plane in the front.  They were clearly jets as they left the lines in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange object rose into the any and then disappeared as the jets continued northeast towards Worcester.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into my house shocked by what I just witnessed to get my wife and told her the story. I told her to come out and see the lines from the jets in the sky, upon going outside I pointed north to where we saw them and we saw 4 more round orange flowing balls rise above the treeline as if over Worcester and descending rapidly up into the sky only to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us now shocked ran north across our front yard and noticed a neighbor out in his yard.

When I switched my phone from the camera mode to the video mode the object shot off at an alarming rate.  The object was over water the entire time.

Our summer cottage is right on the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came outside and noticed a large orange coloured object hovering over the water.  I would estimate its position to be on the west side of Nottawasga Bay, maybe 10 kilometers off the shore of Craigleith/Thornbury area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright orange, slightly reddish coloured light hovered off the water 50 to 100 feet; hard to tell being a few kilometeres away.

I had to wait to take the first picture because of a palm tree as the object pasted the  palm I took the first of four pictures this object was just East of me  by 25 yards and no more then 30 yards and still lease then 175 feet up.  This made for  some very close pictures.  The first shot I did not zoom in and had the flash on  as I walked around a tree in my yard I zoomed in a! nd tried to turn the flash off witch I did not do I took the second picture as it was even with me going by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third and fourth picture  the object was past my home going North- North West. I was walking back to my pool pump and right over the same River Front home was the second  Orange/Red sphere it looked as  if it was on the same line as the first this one did not have any mist or cloud coming from it and both had NO sound and moved NO air.  The reason I could only shot two pictures is because on the screen on my camera their was a message that my chip was full so I had to delete some old photos as the object was coming at me.  I loaded the photos to the computer and took a look and that is when I found  the second picture I took broke though the cloak and I was looking at the bottom and the side of a craft amazing and the best UFO picture I have ever seen  and I think  you will agree with me on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will e-mail photos to the main e-mail you give on the web site. N! ote one of the question you have with the check boxes is did the object have lights.  This craft did not have blinking lights like a air plane this craft had a large rectangle on the bottom of it that has what looks to be White hot light that I did not see as it went by me and I took the photo.  The light looks so bright that it should of made anything on the ground look as if would have been day time.<n>

These were individual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were really bright odd colored stars. I pulled over and saw that they were slowly moving across the sky. I watched them for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove further down the road and there was another vehicle pulled over and 4 people were standing outside the car gazing into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stopped there and got out of my car and watched with them for several more minutes. We heard no noise.  The lights were solid Amber (orange colored).  We don&#39;t believe these were airplanes.  They had no other colored lights on them as you would see on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also none of us has ever seen a dozen planes silently flying in a line.  The elderly gentlemen I was standing with said they had never seen anything like this before, and in their opinion they were not planes.  The lights flew straight for a while, then headed upwards and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night. But the lights were very visible until they went upwards.  WE could not make out an exact shape.  Maybe roundish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cell phone would not work fir several minutes after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make a phone call.<n>

It scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside my house talking on my cell phone.  It was 10:20 pm.  The object had two very bright green glowing lights on the top and on the bottom it had one very bright glowing red light, i could see it was round or oval shape and metallic like a silver colour.  It was small, maybe three feet across, it&#39;s hard to say the size because I was scared. and I did not stay outside for long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was above the houses across the street from me at first, I registered its presence, I told my friend , and it started moving towards me, it made a noise like power lines make, it was a quiet buzzing sound, vibrating sound, it was moving steadily towards me very smooth and steady . It was not shaking or tilting to its sides, it moved very precisely and as far as I could tell there was no one on my street at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it move towards me i ran inside my house and locked the door. It became obscured by the garage of the house to my left which juts out and that is the last i saw of it. I think this may have lasted 10 seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very scary because it moved directly towards me.  It was small but it did not look like a toy or a remote control something and it seemed to move perfectly , which really made me scared .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i was excited and could not believe what I was seeing because it seemed like it was a safe distance away , but it moved towards me from what seemed like a far distance pretty quickly .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best word is efficient , if what I saw was a toy or someone built it then i will be happy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I think I saw a ufo .<n>

At first I thought an Airplane was on fire.  But as it got closer, I noticed there was no noise, and it seemed to be kind of floating across the sky, not low but lower than the Airplanes that usually pass over, and looked like more of an orb with a light beam going around the inside of it, but not escaping the circle, so I wouldn&#39;t say it was emitting beams of light.  It continued that way until it went out of my line of sight.  It was a cloudy night, just had heavy rain and severe Thunderstorms a few hours before, even a funnel cloud the next town over in Coventry, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take out my phone to record a video but I didn&#39;t do it right so I don&#39;t have a video.<n>

This was 10 times brighter than a single star and seemingly 5 times larger (tho it was clear we were viewing it at a great distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was stationary or moving very slowly.  At the beginning of our viewing I would estimate it at 45° above horizon; by the end of our sighting 20 mins later it seemed more like 20° above horizon after which we drove into trees and lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane as we saw a small engine pass by (3-5 miles away). Later in sighting, stars did come out so we could compare both light sources (they were not the same).  It was too large for helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took photo and video with iphone 4 but they only show a speck of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be unrelated but upon arriving at the coast an hour later we saw and heard the last three loops (15 mi! n intervals) of a lone military jet circling out over the ocean with our small northern beach town as the eastern edge of that loop.<n>

Spikes protruded from the object that were pulsating colors:  Red on the tips of each spike , then white to the body of the balled object and the balled object pulsed a blue light itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing for a good half-hour, it slowly began to either move at a rapid speed towards the western horizon or descend to the ground.  The tree tops at the end of the street prevented the 3 witnesses from verifying its motion.

Just as I was thinking all of this it quickly changed directions and began travelling south while picking up speed.  It was very bright and the light pulsated twice before coming to a complete stop then lit up extremely bright then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as it disappeared two more similar objects appeared in the sky but this time they were headed from the west heading east and were flying one directly behind the other but displaying the same flight pattern as the previous object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were also quite fast and ended changing direction again to end up in the same approximate location as the first object! when they too came to a complete stop, lit up extremely bright then disappeared.  All together there were six objects all identical to the first and all stopped at the same approximate location in the night sky before lighting up very bright then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure what these objects were but they definitely were not conventional aircraft and definitely were not satellites.<n>

The object moved behind trees and then vanished quickly in the distance.

We were looking at stars when coincidentally we were both looking at the same spot in the sky.  We saw an aircraft.  It had pulsing orb in the back of it acting as the engine i suppose, and it maneuver&#39;d in amazing ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw it, we didn&#39;t realize it was a UFO.  We just saw how this aircraft was maneuvering some impressive feats that no aircraft today can perform.  It seemed to defy all laws of gravity and maneuver in what way it please, without any fixed projection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was able to do a complete 270 degree turn, flawlessly and instantly (the whole incident was quite quick.  So try to imagine this happening in front of you).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft did not move like any Air Plane, or Helicopter.  The feats it performed are quite impossible actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So pretty much we saw it go from one side of the sky to the other in mere Milli-Seconds.  It did an oval shaped turn, and it had a pulsing orb light coming from the back of the vehicle.  It continue traveling in its projected path and then it disappeared instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a Military Base (Air-Force) nearby so military testing of new crafts could be one possibility, but from what i saw, i doubt we have anything even comparable.<n>

It looked to be over the water and near the cliffs of palos verdes estates which was approximately five miles south from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought not much of it and thought it was a blimp but then I wondered what a blimp would be doing in that area, especially at such a low altitude (1,000 feet approximately).  I hoped to get a better view of the object when I was on the pier and sadly I did not have my camera,  I often take my camera with me for sunset but on this day I went earlier than normal on my evening walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed the blimp idea and still wondered what it was and then the object looked like two grey balloons side by side but this was not a hot air balloon or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared the pier the object moved at a good speed towards the land and by the time I got to the pier I could not see the object, it was as if it had disappeared into the palos verdes peninsula hillside above the cliffs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched for the object for many more minutes but could not see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been interested in UFO&#39;s for twenty years and have never seen one and was not thinking UFO at the time at all, I just wanted to know what this object was as it certainly was not a blimp, balloon, cloud, helicopter, plane, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I heard you speak about the recent flap in UFO&#39;s on Rense and then saw the recent LA sightings, I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the size it was at least the size of the goodyear blimp, maybe twice that size.  There were many people about on the beach, strand and pier but I seemed to be the only one noticing this thing,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if people down south in Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes got a good look at it.<n>

We could not see a shape, only a light in the sky that moved in a stange manner,sometimes stood still and continuously changed colors in a fairly consistent pattern but not in a blinking fashion.  The light was larger than a star and was located to the north-northeast of us in a range of 20 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  It sometimes appeared to move towards us and then away from us before moving and disappearing quickly off to the right (east).  The colors and brightness and movement were unlike anything I had ever seen in the sky.

It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and disappeared into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it through very top of my windshield. The sky was clear and there were no other objects in sight. It was much too low to be a plane. It was not a shooting star. It was visable for maybe 2 seconds. I had the window down in my car, the object emitted no sounds that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was following me in his car. We were returning from Santa Rosa and had been in transit for about two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was at a distance of approximately a half mile behind me, so he viewed the object from further away than I saw it. The object passed just within my vision. If it had been a second later, it would have been directly above my car or behind me and I would not have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home in Applegate about 45 minutes later, I told my friend that I had seen something in the sky. He said he had also witnessed the object and described it exactly as I had seen it, except he had viewed it from further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both in awe and have never seen anything like it before.<n>

My girlfriend saw something moving that she quickly turned my attention to, and as soon as I did the moving object lit up like a shooting star and picked up a bit of speed heading toward the Big Dipper, specifically the star that seems like it&#39;s connecting the &#34;cup&#34; and the &#34;handle&#34; of the dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it got to that star, the UFO lit up a couple of times, before changing direction and started to head a right above the &#34;cup.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star that it flew by seemed to glow brighter as the UFO passed it, and the UFO was now past the right-most stars of the Big Dipper and seemed to dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, to the left of the dipper, we saw what seemed like a shooting star this time.  It lasted as long as a shooting star was supposed to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was odd we would see that in addition to what we had just seen.  Only a few moments passed when we saw the same looking object, this time going from left to right along the handle and moved down the &#34;cup&#34; once the &#34;handle&#34; ended.  It disappeared again. We saw the same looking object 3 more times, all around the big dipper.<n>

I kept seeing flashing lights far away in the sky.  I was alarmed because lightning that far away is not that bright.  I saw a rectangle shape that looked like a missile launching (that is the only way I could describe it because it was so big and bright)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car in the middle of the road and looked backwards. The light was in the middle of the sky through the lighting it was so bright and it started getting bigger and I saw it shrinking (I thought it was coming toward me)<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I quickly drove home as fast as I could.  When I got home the lighting was still going on for 45 minutes.  My thoughts are is the lighting was a cover up for its showing.  I&#39;ve also seen a blue orb this past week come from the trees in the woods across the road in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think all of this was real I was trying to come up with excuses but after this Huge appearance I know its real.<n>

As I got her attention towards the star it began to flash, the flash had a huge diameter about as large as a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and told my brother to come look, we all three stared at it as it began slowly moving down and getting bigger as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly its speed picked up although still controlled and it went out of site, at this point I thought it was a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the car an left to look for it, we saw no emergency vehicles or fire or anything else so we came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then heard that there had apparently been a &#34;hot air balloon&#34; crash at the bottom of the hill we lived on.  This &#34;hot air balloon&#34; was the same thing we saw in the sky we went to the bottom of the hill, we saw several regency vehicles (multiple cop cars, fire trucks, and ambulances) all had their lights on but none had sirens.  We got to where we! had a clear view and there was nothing there, no hot air balloon, no fire, no trace of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran up the hill an came back just a few later, it was probably 23:10 by now.  This time we drive by and there is once again no trace of anything, and now no emergency vehicles are left either.  The alleged &#34;hot air balloon&#34; wasn&#39;t on the news or anything else, there has been no mention of it.  I was a huge skeptic until this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light we saw was bright red, it would flash orange.  It was no hot air balloon.  If it was shouldn&#39;t it be on the news that a hot air balloon crashes at the bottom of a hill on a gas station?<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, I had vivid dreams after the event.  At one point I looked at my body from a third person view.  I could see myself but could not control myself.<n>

It was not descending like a shooting star, and seemed to be changing directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting there stunned for a while we then saw two more objects flying across the horizon, above the ocean.  These looked longer in shape, white light, not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects changed positions and seemed to be in a formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects disappeared in the ocean or possibly over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then sat out for another hour with no other incidents.<n>

About a minute or less apart from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls did not blink, but remained solid.  Sometimes flicked a little. Changed color somewhat. White, green and blue mostly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get my wife after I watched the first 2 or 3 objects.  My wife saw the remaining 4 or 5 objects with me float majestically up an into the clouds.  When asked, she agreed that they did not have the appearance of either an airplane, helicopter or fireworks. &#34;Didn&#39;t know what they were,&#34; and also thought what we witnessed was &#34;unusual.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after my wife came outside I ran about a block closer to where the ball-shaped objects were flying so I could try to hear a sound or get a better view with binoculars. Silence. I could not hear anything.  Through binoculars all I could see was the glowing round light.  The objects seemed large.  At least the size of a truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very last object was bright darkish red.  Larger than the other objects at first. (or the light around it more intense?)  Not a ball.  More like a giant red flame in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object quickly moved up erratically and over the trees unlike any conventional aircraft and then slowed down.  It headed in the same direction as the other ball-shaped objects.  The bright red color slowly turned into what looked similar to the same color/shape as the other luminous ball-shaped objects.  Disappeared into the clouds..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes went by.  My wife went inside the house. I retrieved my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed two objects meet roughly in the same location as the objects were flying. First I noticed a red light and then a blue light joined it.  Within a few minutes the blue and red light started to fly in my direction (heading south west) while slowly descending!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon I thought I could hear a humming buzz of what I thought could have been a helicopter or a small propeller plane.  I don&#39;t know for sure. I&#39;m usually good at identify craft by their sound.  The &#34;helicopter(s)&#34; nearly flew over me at a very low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably not a coincidence that the &#34;helicopter(s),&#34; if that is what they were, met where the objects were flying and then flew in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to photograph the &#34;helicopter(s)&#34; with the blue and red lights.  The photos are strange to say the least.  All that is visible are one blue cylinder and a red cylinder side by side seemingly too close together to have been a plane.<n>

I am a customer service rep for a large Insurance Company and as I was on the phone I was looking out the door as I usually do and saw this bright white circular light coming thru a giant cloud in the sky,  it almost looks like it was in front of the cloud  it was very visible and stayed in one spot just shining really bright and not moving for at least 2 minutes,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was transfixed on it, couldn’t look away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and stood at the door watching it and then it very slowly moved to the right and disappeared....just a note to say that I have worked at this office for 4 years and I constantly look outside thru the front glass door and watch the sky and have seen planes, helicopters, even a blimp but I have never ever seen anything like I saw yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately text my husband to let him k now what I saw in case any reports came out from anyone else on the news or just in general to let! him know I saw it.<n>

I started awake at 4:45am to strangely blue light filling the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I checked it out, I didn&#39;t see anything but the sky returning to dull, grey and overcast.  Figuring I had woken up because I was cold, I threw on some underwear and went back to sleep (how I&#39;m confident I was not sleepwalking/dreaming).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up again that morning (still before 5:00am) and checked the window to find a 40-foot disc suspended 15 feet above the neighbours&#39; house (a stone&#39;s throw away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 lights on the top-side of it and a blue cylinder of light coming from the bottom onto the roof of the house below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This image is vivid for me, but everything after is vague.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc departed and I threw on a shirt and went back to sleep.<n>

7/7/13 23:30|Battle Ground|WA|Disk||Swift disc shaped object with reddish-orange lights in Washington state|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99972.html|550|ndxe201307| Swift disc shaped object with reddish-orange lights in Washington state<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the front porch facing south towards the Columbia River when I saw 5 dull reddish-orange lights moving quickly on the horizon, like the lights on a craft.  They were unblinking, in a fixed position that appeared to be arranged on a disc shaped object that was only barely illuminated and visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The city lights were reflecting off the bottom of whatever this was more than it was being lit up by the lights that were on it.  There were also two “normal” airplanes, one heading southwest towards the Portland Airport that was fairly low and clearly audible, and another heading due north that was too high to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of those planes moved at what one would consider a steady rate and direction of travel for a typical airplane, lights blinking clearly even on the more distant one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object seemed to be at an altitude between these two, but moving in a serpentine line south and east very, very quickly and what was impossibly smooth given the rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d say I’ve never seen anything move like that before, but this is the third time since January of this year that I have seen something unexplainable like this in nearly the same position in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last two times my significant other was with me as well and was actually the first one to notice them. However, this was the first time the lights have been dull and reddish-orange, instead of bright and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen a lot of planes coming and going, living near a major airport like we do, but neither of us have ever seen a plane that can move anywhere near this quickly, smoothly, or silently.  These make the fighter jets we see coming and going overhead occasionally look slow and clumsy.<n>

My boyfriend noticed an orange glow in the sky.  It was in the southern sky, above our house, moving to the north.  This was larger and brighter than any star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been a plane, it was moving too slow and did not have any flashing lights.  This could not have been a firework as it was lit too long, traveled too far and was too high.  It was in the sky for about 3 minutes.  This &#39;light&#39; traveled towards the north before it disappeared.  It just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, after this &#39;light&#39;, there were no planes in the air for almost 24 hours.  This is strange, as we are located in a flight path and see planes at least every 30 minutes.  But there were no planes anywhere for almost 24 hours after seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Chicago Heights, Illinois which is a southern suburb of Chicago, IL.

I did not know of this site as I have never looked into UFO reporting websites.  I was told to go to MUFON and have not sent any other reports.  A UFO researcher told me what I saw was a falling satellite, but I disagree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were going to the gym on the night stated in the report.  We were walking out of my house and I saw something on fire behind a huge tree across the street from my neighbors house.  It was just passed the 4th of July, and in TX, people set off fireworks around this time constantly.  I thought it was an aerial firework, the tree hid the rest of the flames, so it was not seen for maybe 10-30 seconds.  My friend and I were outside talking then all the sudden the object cleared the tree.  I said &#34;What ((deleted)) is that?!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am legally blind, so there are many things that I cannot recognize right away that my friends always tell me what an object is.  My fiend had no answer.  We watched it for about 20-30 seconds before I realized I had a smart phone with a video camera.  The video I took, which will be pasted below, does not do what even I saw, justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was just what I described as this.  When you light a match, and hold it sides.  This object was on fire. We could not see anything other than the flames.  The sky was very dark, hardly any wind and no clouds in the sky.  I would say this object was about 400-600 feet in the sky.  It was hard to tell how big or small it was.  It was not enormous to say the least. It started at E/SE, then moved across the sky finally going upwards to the NE.  The entire duration was probably 3 minutes.  I stopped the camera once it was going away.  Towards the end of this sighting I heard helicopter blades, but they were behind us on the opposite side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the NE direction, about 3-4 miles away is a small tiny airport where only small helicopters and crop dust planes go to and from.  This is where the object went, but went upwards.  I called the police and they were concerned that something was on fire and could land in a field and catch fire.  We have lots of dry land that go up quickly so that was their concern.  After we called them we decided to go out there.  we found nothing except the police riding around looking around like we were.  I later called them back, they said they contacted the little airstrip but nothing was going or coming.  I called our local news station in Corpus Christi and they were not interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did tell the police that I had video footage of this object, the dispatcher was excited.  She sent the officer that went looking to come look at the video.  He could not explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the video.  From what I saw with my own eyes, which my friend can conform is that this thing on fire.  It was going across the sky.  The flames never stopped and it kinda seemed like there were 3-4 flames.  The flames were shooting up, never sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cellphone had about 25-30% power left, after only filming this object for over a minute the phone did run out of power very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aARI4vBDVZ4  Thank you !<n>

We saw four orange lights in the distance that were in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer to the lake they formed a straight line. We ran to the lake front and watched two disappear but two remained together.  They got extremely close and my son said he saw flashing from one and a flashing response from the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One then just disappeared backward and one went up and down the lake front then started to go backward and flashed as it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take my I-phone out and took some footage.  Our neighbors were on their porches and took off in the car; I believe to take better pictures.<n>

I did not, at first want to report it, but felt that over time it may be helpful to someone interested.  I also reported in August of 2006 of two other sightings as well, one from my home and the other at work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular sighting happened around the first week of July.  The sky had intermittent cloud coverage, but for the most part was a beautifully clear sky.  I was sitting on my deck sky watching as I like to do, observing Jet traffic, birds or just anything, man made or not.   There is a lot of air traffic where I live and I am very familiar with aircraft, plus their flight characteristics, performance and so forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 7:00 pm, a passenger jet flew overhead at about 20,000 feet, heading East.  I watched the jet pass overhead for about 5 seconds and switched my attention to something else on the ground momentarily.  Then I decided to look up again at this jet.  As I did, I noticed a white circular object rising up heading directly underneath the jet, as though intercepting it.  I missed where this object was ascending from or flight path it was taking before this, it was just there is all I can say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular from my view, rising and changed direction underneat! h the jet and passed through the contrails of the twin engine jet, missing the jet plane by what looked like a few hundred feet or so, then continued to climb at a fairly steady speed and went North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get my binoculars, which were just inside the house, upon my return, the round shaped object had just entered into some clouds and I lost sight of it. Its speed was about that of a fast climbing military jet, going to afterburner mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was about half the size of the passenger jet when it reached the same altitude, judging by it passing through the exhaust stream of the jet.  The event lasted about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I answered his call only to be told to rush outside with my camera to the park that was located directly out front my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera battery was dead and I knew it so I immediately put on my shoes and just ran out the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached him he was standing at the furthest point of our small park looking towards the west at the horizon just over the tree&#39;s.  I asked him what it was he was seeing and he preceded to point and say look just over the tree&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw it, an entire fleet of orbs some red and some white.  Some were in formations of two side by side really close and others were flying around slowly like dust would in the glare of the light coming through a window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw about 15 to 20 orbs all coming from the west just over the tree line and then proceeding to head towards the south direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was NO SOUND, they were far away though but you would think! that many planes all together would give off some sort of sound eventually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor was taking photos but I have not talked to him yet since the incident but at the time he said they weren&#39;t all showing up on his lcd screen but I will find out soon if there is valuable data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was telling my neighbor how crazy and awesome it was and he preceded to tell me that before I came out their were hundreds more of them.  He actually said that if he placed his hand in front of him he wouldn&#39;t have blocked them out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was faintly cloudy but I could still see stars from behind the thin cloud blanket.  All the orbs would get to a certain spot in the sky and suddenly just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about a minute or two after they all had gone and it seemed as if no more were going to show up, I turned around and looked at the sky just trying to look every where at that point and I saw a very wide but faint light going around in a circle in a clock wise direction against the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my neighbor while he was on the phone with his wife and he got off the phone walked over to me and saw it as well but it seemed like it could have been a spot light coming from somewhere in Manchester so we just decided to ignored it and it eventually stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know who or what was flying last night but we do have a  Airport close by. But if it was military why would they fly in the hundreds risking freaking everyone in Manchester out.  Too many questions would be asked but that’s my opinion.  I will admit I have seen plenty of weird things in the skies and I have actually gotten used to it but when my neighbor whom always makes fun of me for admitting to being a believer calls me freaked out and sees it for himself it is a great feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have learned to not get too far ahead of myself and I understand there is many things these could have been but I have ruled out  Meteors, Lanterns and balloons.  I&#39;m just curious as to now who else had seen them because it has to be impossible that these went unseen by anyone else.  These orbs were floating around for a good five minutes or more.  They were over the highway and plenty of residential areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to also find out what was flying in Manchester, N.H., for planes at the time of this event.  Does the city know?  But as usual this will be just another pawned off sighting.  I&#39;m going to do my best to figure this all out.<n>

July 6, 2013, I was sitting on my back steps and suddenly I saw a large bright glowing circular object traveling from South going North at a height an airplane would be, a low flying airplane.  The first object was in sight about 45 seconds as it appeared to be getting lower over Missouri, and then it went out of sight.  I called my housekeeper out to tell her what I had seen and while she was there, another object of the same description following the same path came into sight.  The objects appeared to be the same, both bright glowing orange light, not fire.  The second object followed the same path as the first, disappearing over Missouri.  After a minute a third object in the same location I first saw the first two objects appeared.  The third appeared smaller, did not glow as brightly and appeared to follow a different path then the first two.  I lost sight of it in the tree tops where it appeared to take a more Eastern path then the first two.  Also, the third object was making a sound like an airplane engine.  None of the objects had any blinking lights on it as an airplane must have.  The first two were just a steady bright glowing orange, and the third appeared smaller, but also was higher possibly.  I called the sheriff&#39;s department on the 7th of July to see if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw, and the person I spoke to said there had been no reports of any UFO&#39;s.  The flight path was not straight but the first two appeared to be traveling with the circumference of the earth.<n>

We do this on occasion, and recently have been seeing a number of unusual objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this evening, we both were sitting in lawn chairs facing approximately due south behind our house.  We are about 2 miles from the foot hill before the Hurricane Ridge hill which is about 4 miles from our house.  At about the roof line of the house, which is two story in back and just to the left of it, an object with 3 bright lights, all on the horizontal plane, appeared to have come over the top of the Hurricane Ridge hill.  I say object because the lights were all evenly spaced and moving together as one. We could not see an actual hard surface and did not observe any stars around or between the lights. Just off of center of what would be the bottom of the object, was a red/yellow light.  The three main lights were slightly yellow in color.  Holding my arm out at length and gapping my thumb and forefinger, it was about two inches wide at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a green laser that we use when we see an object that appears to be different.  We are very careful to make sure an object is not a plane or helicopter with flashing lights when using the laser.  I pointed the laser at the object and turned it on.  The instant that the laser pointed at the object, all of the lights went out simultaneously.  Not one after the other, but all together.  The lights were moving synchronous with each other and not moving up or down.  I realize that being right after the fourth of July, there could be fireworks.  This was not fireworks or balloons or flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do wish that I would not have used the laser, because the object was moving from the south to the north in a slow motion. I think that it may have crossed over near us, but it went out immediately after the laser hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 5 seconds after the object vanished, two objects that you would normally consider as satellites, came from the same direction, but were moving in opposing arcs, where they crossed each other’s path, above us. They were moving at a much faster speed than normal satellites do. I did not shine the laser at these two objects, as I just got an impression that it was not a good idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I don’t remember the exact day, there were a number military helicopters and aircraft in the area at night. It may not be related.<n>

I had just gotten out of my pool to bring my dog out to go to the bathroom .. He was barking quite a bit at the window ,which isn&#39;t rare, But for that time of night with no squirrels to see,  It was a bit odd.  Took him down a path down in our woods that runs along the Charles river wetlands..  Around the bend I noticed the light which had a shape to it but couldn&#39;t quite make it out...  There were trees blocking a defined view..  But behind the trees and brush, It is a very large opening ,roughly 5 football fields … The grass is tall in the wetlands and could see the object through the grass and it was def silent and solid...I could here the grass moving as it continued its path/coarse..I throw a large stick in its direction(my dog was barking quite a bit at this point)And the light dimmed before the stick reached...I stood and watched..  Several min, maybe 2 min later ,the light came back on maybe 3oo yards out (It had moved! quite a bit) but the light wasn&#39;t as bright as before.....I was about a half a mile from my house at this point, with no flashlight and dense woods, besides the path I was on...  I took off quick on foot at that point..<n>

I told my husband that something wasn’t right.  Thinking it was just a physical affliction we opened our windows just a bit to get some fresh air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband in rolling down his window (driver’s side facing north) he stated, “OH MY GOD, What ((deleted)) is that!?”  I have never heard my husband ever get scared but his voice sounded shaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first maybe he saw some animal he was not used to seeing as he was staring somewhat back over his shoulder out the window while driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got mad and told him to stop and pay attention to the road.  He insisted I look out the driver’s side backseat window.  His urging me lasted at least 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally leaned backed over the middle divider between us and looked out the driver’s side backseat window and stated to him I see nothing.  He said, “NO, look up, look at the sky.. those lights WTF is that?!!!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was these reddish orange lights… they were either hovering or moving extremely slow.  They appeared to be over the wild life preserve there. Possibly over Peak Hilled Rd.  There seemed to be no geometric formation but rather they were in a line, not straight line but sort of zigzagged line.  They made no sound and moved entirely too slow to be a plane.  The lights seemed fuzzy or flickering as if they were on fire and did not blink nor did were they sharp like a plane or helicopter would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky so I ruled out the possibility of clouds making the lights look like that.  My kids (all 5 years and under) were scared.  My husband didn’t dare stop.  I watched them out of the window until we got close to the highway where the trees blocked out view.  When the lights came back into view they remained in the same spot for a few seconds and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got onto the highway at exit 23 heading south, I looked back north east to see if they had reappeared or if maybe I had just lost sight of them and they were nowhere to be seen.  We had never seen or heard of anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to google what we saw and found that there are multiple reports from all over the world just in 2013.  I firmly believe what we saw was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a counselor and study psychology in college and critically analyze everything I see or read. I have come to no other conclusion but that it was in fact UFOs.  I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to report it.<n>

Brightness of the light is equal to the stars but 5x larger .<n> <n><n> <n><n> This i believe is wide spread in my area,very common and no ultra-lights take off or fly at any airports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Langley AFB is 3 mile away from this last sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure there has been pilot radio reports of air traffic in unassigned locations and unusual speed and extra large lighting circumfrence with no strobes or navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen what i believe as the exact craft 9 times some at high altitude so as to possibly rule out a ultra-light!  A non threatning craft but somehow sneaky dimming its light when other aircraft come near or when approaching the Newportnews/Williamsburg  International airport which it over flew at about 4000 feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a rare event,once you see the color its a easy distintive unique big size is very easily reconized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take look for yourselves please,i just know this craft does not follow the rules .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive seen 9 in a couple of months!<n>

I had been tending a small bonfire sitting in a lawn chair.  I was looking at stars with no visual aid, and saw a satellite heading for the north pole from the southeast.  A reflection in my eyeglasses caused me to turn to my left, where I saw an approaching orange, flame-like glow in the northeast sky at about 45 degrees.  The object was not making any sound, and I expected it to eventually pass overhead.  I actually thought that it might be a hot air balloon, due to the glow and the altitude.  As it continued to approach I noticed that the light had momentarily dimmed, and it was suddenly traveling to the east at a rate of speed that would be greater than a hot air balloon. (surface wind speeds were not above 5MPH at the time).  The light flickered a bit, reduced in size steadily as it travelled away from my position, and ultimately disappeared.   I do not think the time that elapsed from the start to the end of the sighting was more than three or four minutes.  I was not frightened by this sighting and I continued to scan the skies for satellites and aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty minutes later, I witnessed the same exact thing once again.  I was so intent upon making out a shape that I did not run into my house for my camera or binoculars. Because of the time between sightings, I wondered if it was a sightseeing aircraft from the July Fireworks event being held at the Hartness Airport in Springfield.  I looked up the event on its sponsor web site and noted that a group with small experimental aircraft had been offering rides to youngsters that day, but not beyond 4 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place in one of the villages that comprise the town of Rockingham, Vermont.<n>

Three bright white lights suddenly appeared and slowly lowered to the ground with a sparkling trail behind them.  A few seconds later, in the area of the lights we observed three lights which held in place.  They were in a trianglar shape which eventually appeared to rotate.  Not falling nor rising.  The lights moved into line with each other and a fourth light appeared.  The lights stayed in a steady straight line.  All evenly spaced apart.  After about 10-15 seconds the lights appeared to move closer to the ground.  Trees blocked any further viewing.  During this event the lights stayed bright white and steady.  No fading or flashing.<n>

7/6/13 21:45|Bowling Green|KY|Circle|5 minutes|Spotted silent craft w/ pulsing circular lights (predominantly red with some yellow and orange tones) heading west at a low altitude.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99813.html|623|ndxe201307| Spotted silent craft w/ pulsing circular lights (predominantly red with some yellow and orange tones) heading west at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening my husband and I were taking a bike ride through our neighborhood when I spotted a red circular light in the eastern sky.  At first I assumed the light was part of the fireworks that had been taking place off and on throughout our ride, but just a minute or so later, we rounded a curve to find the light was directly in front of us just below a low cloud cover.  The strangeness of what we saw stopped us both in our tracks, literally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be stationary and at an altitude of about 3000 – 5000 feet.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object whatsoever throughout our observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to observe, the craft made its way toward us in a westward direction at what appeared to be a steady altitude.  The speed appeared to be about that of single engine plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed directly overhead it was obvious that the object was illuminated unlike any airplane we’ve ever observed.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, were pulsating rather than blinking, and were predominantly red and either yellow or orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we observed definitely was not typical of airplane running lights.  We were unable to make out a shape other than the circular appearance of the lights, and there was no unusual motion – just a steady westward track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to observe the object for about five minutes before it disappeared in the distance.  We estimate that the craft would have flown just south of the Bowling Green airport as it headed westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, what we saw was unusual enough that we both felt it important to report our observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The complete lack of sound at such a low altitude and the color and circular arrangement of the lights were unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.<n>
7/6/13 21:45|Toronto (Scarborough) (Canada)|ON|Sphere|5 minutes|Bright blue orb in Toronto.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99863.html|624|ndxe201307| Bright blue orb in Toronto<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog around the neighbourhood and talking on my phone to a friend.  I saw a bright blue &#34;orb&#34; that was much larger than a plane.   It was as bright, or brighter, than a star/planet, but the only way to describe the colour would be &#34;LED blue.&#34;  It also appeared to have this &#34;spot&#34; on it that was pink or red, but i wouldnt call it a &#34;light&#34; (like the lights on planes) it just appeared to be part of the colour...it didn&#39;t blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my attention and I stopped and looked at it, while telling the person on the phone all about it. I&#39;m not someone who is &amp;quot;into&amp;quot; UFO stuff.  I&#39;m describing everything I&#39;m seeing to him and he says take a video, I try to but you cant take a video and talk at the same time (iphone.)  I thought it would go away or that maybe it was a star or planet, but when it started bobbing I had to hang up on the friend to shoot the video.  2 people behind me were walking on the sidewalk ! and also looked up at it.  They kept looking up at it as they walked away, but they didnt speak to me and just kept walking and looking back at it.  I cant estimate the distance because I am really bad with that, but you can tell by the size and distance of the plane that passes by on the video that it is very high up and much larger than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i started taking the video it appeared stationary.  Although it was bright blue to my eye it showed up bright white on the camera, although some shots when it moves show it blue.  Anyway, it was just hovering very high in the air.  I can&#39;t say it was &#34;in any directio.&#34;   but I was facing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a plane travelled across the sky (from west to east) and below it (I couldn&#39;t see the plane&#39;s entire path because a house blocked the view at that point).  But, it started to move subtly when the plane went under.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it bobbed a bit and dropped and then quickly &#34;zoomed&#34; off in a westerly direction.  The same speed as watching a satellite against stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran around the corner! to the street behind the house to try and see it, facing west.  There were so many trees but this time it showed up blue on the video too.  It appeared to sort of bob or &#34;float down,&#34; faster than before and then drop out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran around to the park to see if i could find it again, but it was gone or my view was blocked by all the houses and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never saw anything after that.  When i went home and watched the videos I noticed that when I thought it was stationary it was actually slowly moving at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving and stopping.  Fast and slow at the same time if that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link to my videos:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8OFCaNNvG0<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mSGP0H6eg<n>

We noticed a bright, round light that appeared to be several miles away.  The light hovered in one spot for several seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance said, &#34;It must have disappeared behind a cloud.&#34;  However, there were no clouds in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later the light reappeared slightly to the right of its original location.  It then hovered in the same spot for several seconds before disappearing for the second time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later it reappeared just to the right of its last position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s where it got weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light remained in one spot without moving and then started to grow from a round, bright light into a long, cylindrical shape, and began shining brighter.  It then appeared there was a line in the middle and the two sides grew outward but were still connected.  It also seemed to be rotating in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time a fighter jet scrambled from Portland International Airport and began flying toward the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The now oblong light continued hovering and rotating in place before finally dimming and disappearing for good.<n>

They appeared at first to look like maybe chinese lanterns as they were floating from the horizon up and eastward toward Columbus.  They appeared to be fairly close, like they may have been released from the Battelle Darby Metro Park a few miles south of Broad Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch as I had never seen any lights like this.  I wondered if they might have been a new type of firework as this is July 4th weekend and a lot of folks were letting off private fireworks in the area.  These lights didn&#39;t extinguish like I would have expected however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned south on Murnan Road and lost sight of them because of some trees.  When I caught sight of them again, they appeared to be over the city of Columbus maybe 10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my husband and I were surprised by the distance they covered.  We continued to watch as I tried to follow in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From Murnan, I turned north on Alton, east on Hall, south on Galloway, and then east on Alkire.  Our view was obscured by trees during a good bit of this drive, but by the time we got to the golf course we then saw 4 bright white lights above the Grove City suburb just southwast of the city of Columbus.  These may or may not have been related to the 8 orange lights we viewed a bit earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over into the back of the firehouse parking lot to get a better view.  These 4 lights did some unexpected things--on occasion one or more would fade out and then illuminate again, the lights would move around a bit, combine and then break apart.   There would be 4 then 2 then 3 then 4 again until eventually they all combined into one very bright white light which kind of blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time we both attempted to film with our iPhones but just couldn&#39;t get ! it together before the lights were gone.  They were absolutely! mesmerzing like I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off them.  We waited awhile, ready to film but they didn&#39;t come back- until later that is...<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1020 pm, I was on my deck watching the sky when one orange light, just like the original 8 we  saw earlier this evening, came up from the west horizon and floated up and eastbound, more toward Hilliard, a suburb northwest of Columbus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was followed by a second orange light maybe 20 seconds later and following about the same path as the first.  These both faded as they went upward as if they were going into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening was partly cloudy, it had rained earlier in the day.  The temperature was around 76 degrees.  There were a lot of private fireworks going off as this is the weekend following the 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first sighting was at dusk and the second was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an area that is northeast of Wright Patterson AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also have Rickenbacher close to the sighting area- it was a former AFB.<n>

The sun had already set in the west but there was still a sliver of light in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These four lights were in lateral wavy line.  Then they moved into a triangle formation.  Each of the three round lights were at each point of the triangle and the fourth went to the left of the triangle and it&#39;s light went out.  They were in the triangle formation for about 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they went into a straight vertical line along with the fourth joining the three, which the fourth lit back up to get into formation.  They were in that pattern for about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they dispersed from the pattern laterally from one another, however staying relatively close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of them started to descend in altitude until we could see them no more due to the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole duration was approximately 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could tell these lights were several miles away and that they flew with a purpose, not a random act.  They flew at a leisurely pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew they were not fireworks and they were not planes.  There were people shooting off fireworks on the other side of the South Drive-In Theater.  There was also a commercial jet flying to the southwest of the four UFO&#39;s, heading southeast during the time the four lights were in the sky.  Afterward, there were two helicopters that flew over to where the four UFO&#39;s had been.  The helicopters seem to be searching for while.  They searched for approximately 10 minutes or so.  Although, we did not pay much attention to the helicopters after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  All four of us saw them.  A lady in a car next to us was recording them with her cell phone after I pointed them out.  I hope she puts the video on YouTube.  I did not have anything to video record the four lights unfortunately.<n>

We had just regular 7x50 binoculars with us and switching those between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were couple planes flying overhead and we can clearly see them through the binoculars.  The skies were full of clouds and we could see the planes disappear into the clouds. Each plane was leaving a straight line of white steam from its wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching one plane to the north west when I saw a reflection of the Sun on some type of metallic sphere.  I only saw it for about 2-3 seconds as it passed at an angle where the Sun would have reflected briefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However it was enough time for me to get the direction in which it was moving.  	It was already near a big cloud and it created what I can only describe as a set of giant smoke rings that were just being spread from what at that point appeared to be nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observing conditions were perfect and since I was watching planes up that point I got a pretty good idea of the scale of that object.  It was at least as big as a 747 or slightly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened very quickly and I heard no sounds from that direction.  The distance between us and the object was about 15 miles.  My son saw the flash, but since I was the one looking through the binoculars he did not see any of the &#34;smoke rings&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically this looked like a giant mirror like chrome marble floating through clouds.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before or since.  What is bothering me is that I have absolutely no logical explanation as to what that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were both facing the northern sky, when two orange fireballs or orbs appeared in the northern sky.  The objects were bright orange in color, and low on the horizon.  The objects made no noise.  Due to the darkness of the remote location, I was unable to estimate a distance of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects hovered in the same location for an estimated 5-10 minutes.  The objects then started to move slowly to the west one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved an estimated 45 or 50 degrees from their original hovering location and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the objects stopped, they hovered again for an estimated one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the one minute time frame had elapsed, the objects simply faded out into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the objects were moving, wild coyotes in the area started howling until the objects disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other abnormal aerial objects were witnessed until we left the location at aproxmently 0500 hours.<n>

7/6/13|Pasco|WA||45-60 seconds|On the night of July 6th 2013 a friend and I were driving down Road 100 in a rural part of Pasco, WA. As we were driving we noticed a b|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99990.html|659|ndxe201307| On the night of July 6th 2013 a friend and I were driving down Road 100 in a rural part of Pasco, WA.  As we were driving we noticed a blue blinking light in the sky, it was probably 75-100 feet off of the ground.  The light was above a house, so we thought it was a light on a pole, probably to signal to airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving, I noticed that we had driven past the light, however it seemed like we had reached the light sooner than what it should have taken.  I did a double take and at the same time my friend had noticed that the light was actually going past us and we were not driving past it.  We immediately stopped and did a U-turn so that we could head back into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving into town though we noticed that the blue light had gone out further and was hovering over Kennewick, WA.  Soon after the light was over Kennewick we noticed it do a loop and a turn and start heading towards us again.  We were very afraid at this point so I started going about 70 miles an hour down this empty road, the light soon shot past my car and ended up being behind us.  The light did appear to be pursuing us, or at least heading in our direction, it never got to close to my car, it kept its distance at about 200 feet away from us.  We soon got into town, and as I looked into my rear view mirror the light just kind of dissipated into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was hovering above a  house on Road 100, that&#39;s why we had thought it was a pole because it had been sitting above this house for a few good minutes.  Once we got closer that&#39;s when the ball of light started to move.  The light was like a cobalt blue and it blinked the whole time.  I remember driving and seeing it flying by my car, it would blink and then blink out and be in another location when the light came back on. I would describe its movement being similar to a toy helicopter.  It would move in odd patterns and was very wispy like a toy helicopter would be, although it was much larger and faster than any toy I&#39;ve ever seen.  The craft changed altitudes a few times where it would be very high in the sky and then lower to the ground, it was also very fast.  I don&#39;t know how many miles away Kennewick is from Pasco but it seemed to get out there pretty quick, considering this whole experience only lasted about 45-60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I would have stopped to get a picture, but I was far to nervous to even think about my phone at the time.  The only other strange thing that happened that night was when we got home and my friend looked at her phone she had a strange picture file on her phone dated 12/31/1969 taken at 4:00 pm.  She can&#39;t delete the file, send the file or look at the file.  This may just be coincidence, but the file was not there before the experience.<n>

It was low flying, with three lights underneath it, orange in color.  They were arranged evenly spaced apart, emitting a bright light in the center of each spot, and i believe it had a bright light coming from the immediate side of the object. my brother on the other hand says he saw the profile of the bottom as we drove under it, and thinks it was a hexagon shape. we puled into a nearby parking lot and took a video of it as it made a tight zigzag flight path away for the next 5 or so minutes. might i add, no noise<n>

We saw some type of redish/orange sphere floating across the sky.  We did not think anything of it at that time.  Then we went out side about a half hour later, we were sitting outside and we saw another one, exact shape and color floating in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared behind a tree and we walked where we could see behind the tree and it was gone! So we we decided it was a little weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside about a half hour later and saw another exactly the same so we ran back outside and watched it.  It moved very quickly, soon enough it disappeared right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the three were flashing or anything, it was just a very steady light that moved along and disappeared.<n>

It looked similar to red burning charcoals and kind of flickered. I saw one in the same area on june 21 and had my camera with me.  I video recorded it for 20 seconds, and it was moving north and disapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner than i took off i saw another one coming from the same direction.  I quickly pulled off the road and video taped it again.  It moved north until it was not visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later another on came from the same area that the last one did and moved at the same steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued taping and and have several photos also.  I followed it as it went north until it started flickering like a yard light that is slowly turning off when it&#39;s getting light out.  It may have been moving into clouds but it suddenly reduced its size from lets say a zero to a period and also turned white at that time, and within two seconds disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same thing in goshen the night before except it moved straight up until it disapeared.  To the west were about 5 or more somewhat close together and moved at different speeds at an upward angle, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have some photos and short video of them also.  I have never seen anything like this before, and have no explaination for it.

While at a stop sign we noticed a red object in the sky directly in front of us.  This object was star like in appearance and about the size of a large star.  I’m not sure how far away it was but it wasn’t close to us, the best I can guess it was about as high as a commercial jet would be and at a 45 degree angle.  The reason it caught our attention is the color.  I have never seen a star like object with this type of color.  It was a brilliant red color with a tint of orange, but more on the red side.  This object didn’t appear to be moving and because of our curiosity we continued west to find a better spot to pull off of the side of the road and look at it.  It is wooded on both sides of this road and by the time we found a spot where we could get a good look at it, it began to fade and within a couple of seconds it disappeared.  We continued west and began to talk about something else and my son said, “There it is”.  It was about 4 to 5 minutes between the time it disappeared and the time it reappeared.   We quickly found a spot to pull over, stopped and got a good look at it.  We tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but it didn’t work.  My son took our binoculars out and said that it looked like a regular star, but it was bright red.  Before I was able to look at it through the binoculars, it again disappeared.  We never saw it again.  Total good observation time was about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my private pilot’s license a number of years ago, I am an amateur astronomer and am reporting exactly what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not an airplane, any type of fireworks or anything that I can explain.  I have seen many satellites before, the International Space Station, all types of aircraft and it was none of the above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a person who has looked through a telescope (6” Meade reflector) many times, it wasn’t Mars!<n> <n><n> <n><n> To sum it up, we saw this thing twice, it disappeared twice.  It was bright red, red-orange.  It didn’t appear to move.  There were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a person who does not make stuff up, I can’t say it was some type of space craft, but was out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

EST. The object moved from east to west above my house in Franklin Square New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the exact same object last night, July 4th at about the same time, but I assumed it was just a Chinese lantern or some form of fireworks since it was the 4th of July.  Now that I saw it again tonight, July 5th, I figured it was worthy of a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes that fly over my house always are going in the same direction and in the same path but this object was moving in a different path.  In less than a minute the object moved from the eastern part of the sky to the west until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise coming from it.  It slowly, gracefully floated across the sky.  It did so in such a way that led me to believe it was not the all too common paper lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not just sitting in one part of the sky but moved just like a plane would completely across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light was not flashing but was constant throughout the objects traverse.<n>

One witness was gazing out over the ocean and saw a strange set of lights that were rotating in a horizontal circular motion very close to the condo.  She told the other two witnesses to come outside and see this UFO.   They both came right away and saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran to get our video camera.  By the time we got back to the balcony, the object had moved horizontally to the southeast of us away from the ocean.  We shot some still pictures and by the time we videoed, it was very small and far away.  However, we noticed there was another red light to the bottom left of the larger set of lights.  After a moment, the smaller light joined the larger set of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up the UFO Hotline number and called immediately to discuss next steps.  We were told to give the direction we saw the UFO and describe it.  While we were speaking to them, the UFO moved back toward us Northeast out over the ocean behind our condo out of site for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were then able to video the circular flashing lights that were red, blue and white.  At one point, it changed and took the shape of an angel with the white light coming down in the middle and the red lights on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes the lights would be circular and rotate horizontally and sometimes they would be solid horizontal red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At other times, the lights would just be blinking.  We were on the phone with the UFO hotline for 8 minutes reporting at starting at 10:42 PM EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ruled out human aircrafts that we know of due to the wavy movement of the hovering of the object.   At one point, it was almost like it was standing still but it was making small fast smooth movements left and right and then left and right again.  After standing in roughly one spot for several minutes, the UFO was just hovering in one spot.  We were on the phone with UFO hotline the entire time after it came back in our view and recording video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as a note in case you are wondering, there were no drugs or alcohol involved in this sighting.  It is 11:34 PM EST and we are now uploading the untouched video to YouTube for sharing with Director@UFOcenter.com.

(5JULY2013)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At almost exactly 10:20pm CST, I was getting ready to walk out onto my back deck to watch some of the fireworks that many of our neighbors were shooting off.  We live on an unincorporated street between two cities and so people come to this neighborhood to shoot them off legally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out the back sliding glass door, which faces North and in the NE I saw a light that was far more definitive than any firework.  It was consistent and moved toward my direction at a hovering, casual pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came closer, the lights and shape became more defined.  It was difficult to say a distance but my best guess at its closest proximity - 2 miles away.  If I had to judge relative size, I&#39;d say a 50 meter diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always imagined something more extravagant if I ever saw an object I couldn&#39;t rationally explain but the object had a saucer style shape with a small ball on top.  Colors rolled from the underbelly of the disc, all the way up to the ball from a soft yellow, to a dull orange and the ball was almost red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it coming in for about 10 secs, at its closest proximity for about 10 secs, silent and motionless, in which time I yelled twice to my neighbors two house down, &#34;Does anybody see that?!&#34;  I&#39;m certain that the fireworks and children yelling drowned out my voice or they simply thought I wasn&#39;t talking to them because nobody responded.  I took out my phone and called a friend to tell him about what I was witnessing.  In about another 10 secs, it silently slipped away at exponential speed, directly north and then up, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered fireworks, some sort of RC device and anything I could imagine within human or natural capacity...I&#39;m just left with questions and curiosity.<n>

When I looked up into the sky, I saw a fairly large orange glowing orb moving rapidly overhead right about 90 degrees of elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from East to West (retrograde, so was not a satellite) and lasted about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness did not seem to change other than dimming as it moved away from us.  The visual angle subtended an arc of about 120 degrees across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one or two minutes later, we saw a group of three similar objects along the same flight path as the first one.  My daughter used an iphone to take video, but it is fairly dark and hard to distinguish the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes later two more objects passed overhead, again on the same flight path. There was no sound from the objects.  It appeared as if they were glowing from heating up the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved much faster than orbital satellites (International Space Station, for example) or airplanes, ! but much slower than meteors and did not change brightness as a meteor would upon entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired military fighter pilot, retired commercial airline pilot and former astronaut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by former U.

However, it was moving very quickly straight upwards, a lot faster than any aircraft I had ever seen, so I watched it because it was quite unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped completely and suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved towards the left very quickly, then stopped..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then calling for my boyfriend to come and look at this since he is an aircraft inspector and what I was seeing was quite bizarre.  He came out as soon as he could.  When he got there, the craft had moved back into it&#39;s original position, but then the blue light changed to green but the red light was still blinking and then it slowly started to descend in the sky and disappeared behind the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some other people were lighting fireworks off in the neighborhood, but not in that area that the craft was i! n and I&#39;ve never seen a firework or anything of that nature perform these maneuvers or blink in the way it was blinking because it looked just line any other airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I&#39;ve never seen an aircraft or helicopter move as quickly as this did and perform these impossible feats either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend saw it for the last 10 seconds and when I told him what it had done he told me that it would be impossible for any aircraft to do that and I agreed.<n>

The brightness of object was that of a flame.  The speed was relatively slow.<n>
7/5/13 22:00|Chelan|WA|Light|30 seconds|Orange light traveling over Lake Chelan WA at 20,000 MPH with a course change.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99853.html|685|ndxe201307| Orange light traveling over Lake Chelan WA at 20,000 MPH with a course change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 5 July 2013 shortly before 2200 hours six adult witnesses including one Deputy Sheriff from Washington State were at a residence in Chelan Washington on the back deck of the residence overlooking Lake Chelan.  The deck of the residence faces northwest and looks out across Lake Chelan with an unobstructed view.  The weather was clear and about 75 degrees with some light haze to the north from a forest fire about 20 miles away but the sky was clear directly over the residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group of six adults were all together when we observed an orange light in the shape of a circle or orb.  The relative size of the object was difficult to determine but our estimation is that it was about the size of a Boeing 747.  We believe the object was at an estimated altitude of between 20,000 to 50,000 feet traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  We believe the object was moving about twice as fast as a visible satellite so a rough estimated speed may be 10,000 to 20,000 miles per hour.  The object made no noise as it passed overhead.  As the object passed over the house the group ran to the front of the residence facing southeast and observed the object make a course change from a southeast direction to a south direction.  The course change was obvious but not instant (more gradual like an airplane might make).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow of the object was that of a yellow orange steady color.  The relative light being emitted by the object stayed steady as the object came into and went out of view.  It did not fade like a satellite does as it passes into and out of the shadow of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the size of the object was difficult to determine but the speed was about twice that of a typical satellite viewing.  Just to be safe we did check where ISS was using the iPad app Starwalk and it was not in view at the time.  In terms of size if you were to hold a dime out at arms length the diameter would have been a little more then half the size of the dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers included four people in their mid-30&#39;s, and two in their mid-60&#39;s.  The group includes a business banker, deputy sheriff, retired medical assistant, a business owner, and two stay at home moms.  3 of the 6 have bachelors degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The word that comes to mind on this one is &amp;quot;unbelievable.&amp;quot;  We did some research and are aware of the Boeing X51 but we are pretty firm on our minimum speed estimates of at least 10,000 MPH (that is a very conservative estimate).  The X51 is only at 4,000 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes after the sighting and the initial call into the UFO Center giving the above information we did observe a commercial jet liner pass overhead traveling west.  Estimating that the jet was at 30,000 feet at about 400 MPH to 500 MPH this helped confirmed the above stated speed, size, and altitude.<n>

It seemed like it was going very fast and it didn’t make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other planes around at the time that we noticed we watched it until it went over the trees.

A few seconds later, the first orb was followed by a second orb.  The orbs were 3 or 4 times larger in diameter than a bright &#34;morning&#34; or &#34;evening&#34; star.  At first we thought they were approaching aircraft, but they didn&#39;t blink like aircraft lights, and instead of getting closer and passing overhead, they became stationary in the sky about 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon (hilltops), and after about 10 seconds gradually faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first 5 minutes of the fireworks display, we saw four more orbs.  They behaved just like the first 2, rising straight up one or two at a time, floating for several seconds, then fading and disappearing.  The orbs were clearly far, far distant from the fireworks, which were going off more or less directly over our heads.  We were actually watching the orbs more carefully than the fireworks!<n>

It was very dark on the beach and the sky was amazingly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We laid down on the sand to look at the sky, and I saw a shooting star.

About 3 minutes later she said, &#34;Is that one?? but she quickly realized it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object she was looking at and it looked similar to a star and it looked to be a pale yellow in color but much larger and obviously much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached in my pocket for my phone to film it and remembered I had left it at home to charge.  It was moving at a steady rate from what seemed like South to North, but I&#39;m not great with direction.  After about 25 seconds of watching, it looked like it kind of zig zagged or vibrated at the same time, both of us said, &#34;Whoa,&#34; at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only did that for maybe a second or two then went straight at a steady speed for another 20 seconds or so and then did the zig zag thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both sat silent in amazement until it disappeared about 20 seconds or so after that.

As we were looking at the second one the first one disappeared. then we continue to record the second one trying to figure out what it was. we watched it move around up and down with no sound until that one disappeared without watching it actually fly away. as soon as it was gone be looked at our video and I tried to count how many Dr were on each side that appeared to be legs.  it was hard to tell if there was three dots or four dots on each side because it was slightly blurred. when we looked at the video the next day I could not see the doctor at! all.<n>

There were no stars behind the spheres.  The balls were uniform in their brightness and color.  They did not emit an aura.  They were simply red lights each about the size of a basketball I would hold in my hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Identical spheres kept appearing one right after another at a regular pace until I could see 12 altogether.  I heard no sounds other than the few remaining fireworks going off.  All 12 spheres were equally spaced in a straight line moving slowly to the North.  After about 3 minutes the 2nd and 3rd sphere moved out of line forming a triangle with the 1st one staying in the lead.  The remaining 9 stayed in the same straight line behind the triangle and did not decrease or increase their distance from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in to get my roommate so she could see this too.  By the time we got back to the porch we saw the last two leave our field of vision at what I judge to be over the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  This whole sighting lasted about 5 minutes and at no time did I have to tilt my head to watch the progress of these red balls in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterward I went to the internet to see if any information might be there to help explain what I had just seen.  I was shocked at the quantity of reports.  Both my roommate and I are senior citizens who do not regularly pay attention to this sort of thing.  The following is a video link I found that is almost identical to what I saw except that the balls of red light I witnessed were much, much larger.  Other than that there are some very minor differences between this video and what I have reported here.  I am comforted by knowing that someone else has witnessed these red balls too.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY<n>

It was about 1000 yards away and slowly rising or gliding.  I looked for a craft but, the lights were very bright and I could not see beyond them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had spherical lights that were bright, glowing soft orange and red in color that seemed to fluctuate.  It was pretty close as it appeared to be over another part of my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camcorder and ran outside and it was gone.  The orange color was incredibly beautiful, like a tangerine orange and very warm and soft at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed the event from inside so I cannot say if the UFO was silent.<n>

It has quite a bit of electronics on the summit - TV and radio  transmitting towers, microwave repeaters, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a ‘star’ start to drop straight out of the sky straight down on top of Shasta Bally.<n> <n><n> As it came closer to Shasta Bally is got bigger and brighter then is stopped and hovered over the mountain - it was about the size of a silver dollar sitting over the mountain and it was an extremely bright white light illuminating the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered there approx. 30 seconds and then moved to the right then back where it had been and then back (to the west) dropping down behind the mountain (which really illuminated the mountain even more) before it shot up and out of sight leaving a tracer line as it disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first sighting there have been at least 6 in the past 5 months with 2 ( 2-3 weeks ago) in one night.  One was a bright white light and the other was a bright red light.  I saw them within 10 minutes of each other.  Before the sighting on July 4th they only hovered for a few seconds before darting off leaving a tracer line and disappearing into the sky.  Their  hovering size was not as large and bright as the one on the 4th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another on Friday night 7/5/13 which acted like the others - didn’t stay very long before leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go outside to smoke several times at night so what are the odds - I’ve seen so many?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The number of visitations per night must be astronomical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo of Shasta Bally and all the electronics:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nps.gov/whis/parknews/images/Shasta_Bally_Summit_web.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Northwest.  The light was morphing in color from red to orange and seemed to have a glowing haze around it.  It appeared almost blurry at times.  The object was moving parallel to the horizon at a very slow rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved off to the Northwest, it seemed to either accelerate, or blink out because the light turned a solid red color and became significantly smaller in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emitted no sound whatsoever and was at a distance relative to us where we would have heard at least residual engine noise.  From where our position was, I would estimate the dis stance of the object to be about 10 miles away, and about 20 to 30 degrees off the horizon.<n>

They were several miles away and I thought might be airplanes but they were very close together.  Thought they might be helicopters but they veered towards and away from each other.  There&#39;s no way (at least I&#39;d hope not) that pilots would fly in such a pattern.  After about a minute, one headed north and the other towards me and they both disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About another minute later, 2 more appeared at about the same place I saw the first ones.  Same red/orange color and similar flight pattern, however, they both headed northward (away from me) and disappeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might have been about 5 minutes after that I saw another one.  It traveled the same pattern but after about 30 seconds it went upward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night had scattered clouds but where I saw these things I also saw clear sky and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in Southern California near an Air Force Base and I am fairly confident in my ability to identify air craft and lights on air craft.  What I saw tonight was one solid light with no visible craft/attachments.  No discernable lights on wings or different colors. They were too low to be satellites.<n>

I live on a hill that overlooks the west side of town. It was about 11:30 pm.  I started looking up and around at different fireworks.  And I immediately spotted craft floating above certain areas of town including right above and behind me on my street.  They were in twos and singly positioned and hovering right above firework height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though they were trying to be like blended with the firework light or they are the government security watching our town.  Until I started staring at the one whitish-yellow light craft behind me and up in the sky about 1000 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went directly in the wide open middle of my street alone because, neighbors were in their yards doing fireworks. I stared at craft intently for a few minutes, it then started to ascend up and up and up.. til it vanished or looked like a star.<n>

It moved methodically and quickly in a straight line.  It didn&#39;t pause or stop or hover, it kept moving at an even pace.  I observed it for about 20 seconds until it began to fade and finally disappeared completely.  It didn&#39;t flicker, but it remained incredibly bright redish/orange before it moved out of sight and faded.  It was a very clear night, not cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m normally skeptical though I do believe there is life elsewhere in the universe.

One of the orbs were bright red and just keep going straight up and then it made a 90 degree direction in less than a minute it was going very fast I would say they were going 5-15 mph.  Then the one orb went above my house and just keep going. July 4th, 2013 was the day where the most UFO activity took place, but there has been just only one orange orb that been going on since June 31. It was above our church on M-150 about 80 feet and decided to show it&#39;s capabilitys by disappearing and repairing 50 yards to the left within less than a second.  Then reappeared  just! a sec later in 20-30 yards under where it originally started.  Whitemans airbase is 50 miles from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not Chinese sky latterns because there was no wind. Chinese sky latterns perform those capabilitys unless directed with wind.

Heading north and silent running.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99854.html|732|ndxe201307| Glowing pinkish red object. Heading north and silent running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewing Location: Looking inland from the beach off Fairfield Beach Rd. across from Pine Creek Marsh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: The object was moving when we first noticed it. We were looking inland so the object was over land and not the water. It was headed in a northerly direction. From start to finish the distance traveled was about equal to 4 feet between outstretched arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred a little after sundown. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. Sunset was at 8:28 .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light resembled a road flare from a distance.  Red and roundish in shape. We only saw the light and not the object creating the illumination.  The light itself was too large to be a plane side-marker at the perceived distance.  There were no other lights around the main one.  The shade of red was not the deep red of a an aircraft marker but a softer shade and unblinking though atmospheric conditions caused the light to modulate somewhat.  A tiny white light took the place of the red light toward the end of our viewing and as it traveled this light faded out.  We heard no noises coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
7/4/13 23:00|Miami|FL|Fireball|15 minutes|Bright orange-red firball, rose vertically out of fireworks (thought it was some special firework) then travelled horizontally silently|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99643.html|733|ndxe201307| bright orange-red firball, rose vertically out of fireworks (thought it was some special firework) then travelled horizontally silently<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a medical doctor and love watching fireworks like anyone else. I was out on the rooftop of the garage to my apartment complex in Country Club, Miami looking at the fireworks because one can get a great panoramic view from up there. I had been watching the fireworks for about 40mins so I knew pretty much the patterns/details of the various groups of fireworks from around the neighborhood. I noticed 3 orange-red lights flying about 8 miles away I would estimate.  They flew at the height of a plane about to land but their trajectory was horizontal, they flew much slower than a plane at that height and they made a triangular configuration.  I am pretty sure they weren&#39;t from the same object and that their formation made it seem like it could have been a triangular object. I went into my pocket to grab my ipod touch to take a video but i forgot it in my apartment and they went out of sight behind some buildings. This lasted in all approximately 10-15 seconds f! rom the moment i noticed the strange lights to when they went out of sight. I went back to my place to say goodnight and take out the garbage, but I found what I had seen so strange that I grabbed my ipod and went back to the rooftop.  I spent about 20mins looking at fireworks and then I saw the strangest thing I had ever seen.  About 2miles away (pretty close), another complex was having a display.  These were the closest fireworks to my location. What i thought was another firework rising to explode was the same colour fireball I had seen earlier, but much closer and brighter. Imagine looking at fireworks shooting upwards…..naturally, you&#39;d expect it to explode as per usual; this orange-red fireball kept rising and rising and then started coming in my direction. I kinda froze a bit then remembered I had my ipod and took it out nervously to video record it. I got about 4 seconds of it before it turned sharply to the right behind my building, but because I was on the rooftop I! was able to run along the top to see it in view again. It was! travell ing horizontally and then started making circles around where the fireworks were exploding. I listened very carefully to hear if it was a helicopter (with very weird bright orange lights) but couldn&#39;t hear anything. my battery to my disgust went dead and I only got a few seconds of it. I was so disappointed. After that, I saw the same thing happen again: a bright red-orange flare-like light come up out of where the fireworks were going off, not explode and then change direction from upward to horizontal to circular. This time the light was clearly pulsing, but randomly. It wasn&#39;t a predictable pulse, sometimes very very bright, other times very very dim to the point where you  could barely see it. I saw this 4-5 more times after this but these times the light (which was always alone) was just in the sky moving horizontally, then circling back around. It felt like deja vu each time and I kept saying out loud, &amp;quot;what the fuckkkk is that thing&amp;quot; I came down from the roo! f and walked as far as i could in the direction of the light (which was gone by now) to see if I could hear any noise like a helicopter which is the only explanation I had that made any kind of sense). There was not one photon of white light however, only orange-red and no sound. So I decided to google &amp;quot;Fireball July 4th Miami&amp;quot; and a combination of other key words and I came across this website. I actually sent my friend a text message after I saw the very first light at 11:27pm. This was the text: 11:23pm &amp;quot;Dude r u looking at fireworks? &amp;quot; 11:27pm &amp;quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re gonna be a lot of UFO sightings tonight esp since millions of eyes r in the skies. I swear I just saw the weirdest light in the sky. Thought it was a firework going up as usual but it didn&#39;t explode then started traveling horizontally. I got some of it on my ipod video. I followed it. It was bright red like a flare but traveling like a plane and pulsing, not blinking then it just faded and disappeared. WTF?!?! :s&amp;quot;<n>

At first I thought it was just some weird firework, but it kept traveling towards us.  I thought this can&#39;t be a firework, maybe fireworks had hit a low flying plane and it was on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my friend and said, look at this!  Do you know what that is?  She had no clue.  It kept coming closer, and as it did, it did look a little triangle shaped, but hard to tell because it looked like flames burning all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came more directly overhead I saw a red light coming from the front that came out into a fan shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching it as it traveled farther south and then it was gone.

I stoked the fire and started walking east towards my wood pile when I noticed 2 (Incandescent) looking lights heading west bound and low on the horizon(15-25 degrees, just below the cloud ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were helicopters, yet I heard no rotor wash.  The 2 craft continued heading west towards me, when I summoned family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft approached we thought at first Japanese Lanterns because the lights changed from incandescent white to orange with a vibrant red corona around the object that looked like flames on the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were now close enough (1-2 miles away and just below tree top level),to easily define them as spheres or orbs.  At first sight they were golf ball size as they came closer there size increased to softball size at the closest.  The 2 craft then stopped and hovered momentarily.  One craft then went 90 degrees and headed nort! h at a steady pace towards the city of Enumclaw, where then, it suddenly blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1 remaining craft still hovering then changed its elevation going straight up to tree top level and then moved 90 degrees to the south for a short distance then heading back on the exact same course where it stopped at the same altitude and location it started from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then started again to raise up, and I decided to take my l.e.d. flashlight and signal the craft and get some kind of response.  I immediately commenced flashing out a series of three flashes then two flashes followed by a 5 second break and then started the sequence again.  The craft flashed back the exact same series and commenced raising in altitude, this time making a 90 degree left followed by stopping at the same location and then heading 90 degrees right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft started getting smaller and began fading out when at tree top level on craft appeared out of thin air and came towards us then from right behind tha! t craft or from within, a second craft appeared then a third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 of the craft broke to the south of the lead craft into an angled formation like one side of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft from the original sighting was slowly going behind the trees then blinked in and out finally blinked out and was gone.  The first craft of the second sighting at that point turned 90 degrees North and sped off at a high rate of speed then blinked out the second craft approached then blinked out the third craft raised up in altitude and then blinked out.<n>

After the third ball of light gained altitude a fourth came from the same direction in the same manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These bright balls of red/orange followed the same flight pattern except for the first two that flew together.  There were a total of six.  As far as the timing in between each I can’t tell you, but they were coming one after another and right before they would disappear the next one would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 13 years, I use ! to live on the edge of the Dunnellon FL. Airport, were they trained acrobatic planes and I have never seen any normal planes fly that close to one another. There was absolutely no sound and I would think six planes one after another would be very noisy.   It was also very cloudy and we hadn’t seen any planes but heard a few earlier before this happened so, the orange/red balls were flying low enough beneath the clouds to see them.<n>

I was in my car with my 2 daughters ages 15 and 11 when I saw an orange object traveling at a fast speed over us. It originally appeared triangular in shape but as it moved higher up in the sky it became sphere shaped. A few others were following it so I drove my car in the same direction.  They started flying higher up into the sky and eventually disappeared. I got out of my car and videotaped 3 more traveling in a straight line.  After those disappeared, there were about 6 others following in the same direction at different times in a 20 minute period. Please note that this was the second year in a row that I had witnessed UFO&#39;s in my neighborhood on July 4th.<n>

These were nothing like any known craft - civilian or military - that I have ever seen. I am also familiar with satellites etc. I was out on my back deck watching fireworks. When my fourteen year old son decided to go back inside. Thus I turned around to watch him go in. I immediately saw a very large and very bright object coming horizontally from behind a nearby tree. It was followed by five more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all evenly spaced. Three in a horizontal line and then one slightly above the last with two more in a  \ formation.  They were moving very slow and very smooth with no sound. They moved from south to northeast and eventually seemed to &#39;twinkle&#39; once and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this exact same formation and movement happen three more times with what appeared to be more objects.  My sixteen year old son came out before the last of these three occurances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw two of these objects come from the east moving westward at the same rate of speed and the same &#39;twinkle&#39; and disappearance.  Then one item the same pattern two more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest and most beautiful thing I have ever seen in the sky.  It all occurred over one hour.  We stayed out for another half hour but saw nothing unusual. I tried to get video and pictures.  I ended up with a fifteen second video of one object.  And four pictures of one object.  I hit record numerous times but for some reason only one video recorded. It was just too dark for my camera to take any more pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really want to know what this was<n>

It was about 7 times larger than any star or planet I have ever seen.  It seemed to be about 25 deg in elevation.  I use a lot of FTA satellites and in location comparison the object seemed to be around 135W with the height of 97w. It was very bright like looking at a red laser pointer but 10 times the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Eden Roc Hawaii just past 24th street.  The object moved very slow in the sky at first then started to drop to the east very slow moving about 10 deg to the east and dropping 5-7 deg in elevation.  It kept the same brightness and just disappeared above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about 1800 feet in elevation and in the direction of the object there is a forest reserve and open ocean.  There are no other islands in this direction and we never have air traffic after dark in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a vet and I was in the navy never seen anything like this. My best guess is light! reflecting off a satellite but it just don&#39;t seem right based on size, brightness, and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks ((name deleted))<n>

Around 10:20 pm or so, we saw a red light move from the south towards the north, towards us.  It was high in the sky, but as it approached (got closer), the light became a bit larger. It appeared to zig and zag lazily and then stop at some points.  The red light was steady, but alternated with a white light.  There were no sounds and no other moving objects in the sky.  It slowly moved northeast a bit and just disappeared.  A few minutes later, the exact same thing happened again, starting at the exact same starting spot as before.  At around 10:40 pm or so, I looked to the northeast and saw a black object that was like the shape of a balloon with a bubble on top floating down from the sky.  It was about 50 feet in the air and I thought it was a parachute at first.  I screamed &amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot;  The other two witnesses turned and saw it as well.  My son screamed and ran toward! s the house.  My boyfriend ran towards the fenceline where the object appeared to fall.  He said he saw a disc like object go immediately straight back up into the sky.  Around 10:45 pm, we decided to shoot off one last round of fireworks.  When we shot some that went into the sky, the red light came back again.  This time it appeared from the exact same place (south), moved north, and disappeared.  It just went out.  At 10:50 pm, my son and boyfriend saw the red light again, and it went through the same movements as before.  We are not sure if it is the same craft or not, so I reported each sighting as one separate craft.  Google Maps has the incident area as 42 degrees 05&#39; 14.17 N and 83 degrees 33&#39; 13.91 W.  It was too dark to get any shots but we did get some videos.  We will email them as soon as we get them off the phones.<n>

We watched it move slowly (at first) in a straight line from east to west, debating the whole time what it could be.  Being cloudy/overcast that night, we thought it must be a helicopter but it got closer and was completely silent.  At its closest it looked more saucer shaped (flat on the bottom with the glow/fire/light emminating upwards).  It moved so slowly and seemed so close overhead (but it was hazy).  I went inside to tell others &amp; get a camera but quickly returned to see it had moved away considerably faster than it had approached and it was barely visible to those who hadn&#39;t seen it for the duration.  It appeared to be gaining altitude and moving quickly to the west/northwest and disappeared from my view.  The light/fire was strange because the color varied/moved as a! fire would but appeared to be contained in a ball (or dome shape when it was closest) yet the ball was not clearly defined.  The edges looked &amp;quot;hazy&amp;quot;.<n>

Luckily we noticed it right away and we were able to see it travel the entire sky in 30 seconds.  In our estimate the object must have been 5 - 10 miles up at a minimum.   For the object to travel across the entire sky with out any sound barrier being broken befuddled all of us.  We were able to determine that it was not space junk or an asteroid due to the direction it was taking.  It went clear across the sky in a straight path, and not in a parabola direction.  First time any of us had seen anything like that.  Some people were scared, while others were just confused.  I thought it was really cool.<n>

Moved across State Highway 63 Witnessed by 2 and an Arkansa State Trooper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were coming to Walnut Ridge around 10:15 to 10:30PM, we topped the hill about 1/4 of a mile north of the Black Rock Rest Area, as we were approaching the crest of the hill my wife thought she saw fireworks on the left side of the highway in a field.  When I looked I saw a bright orange light about 5-10 feet above a tree which was around 40-yards off the left side of the road.  Expecting to see the burst of fireworks exploding I was surprised when it didn&#39;t.  As we moved past it and descended down the hill I was watching the light in the side mirror of my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to turn around at the rest stop and drive back to the top of the hill to get a closer look and before I turned in to the rest stop I noticed an Arkansas State Trooper on the left side of the highway facing up the hill.  As we pulled around the rest area to the north side exit I stopped my vehicle and looked to see the object moving left across the highway at the top of the hill.  As I looked back towards the parked State Trooper he turned on his spotlight and directed it at the orange light we were watching as it moved across the highway and disappeared behind the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went on to town and when we were later returning home I saw the Trooper at the gas station in Black Rock and decided to pull over and talk to him about what we saw.  He said at first when he saw the light he thought it could have been a helicopter, he said he often flashed his spotlight at them and they would flash their spotlight back at him, but he said their light was white not orange like this one was.  And this one didn&#39;t flash back at him. I asked him what he thought it was and he looked back at me and we both smiled and didn&#39;t have to say another word.<n>

There were planes in the sky at this same time. Head-on, you may see a very bright light, but they always show flashing, colored lights at some point in their flight. I was intentionally sitting out back by the pool watching the sky, with the hope of seeing a UFO on the 4th of July.... again. I saw a similar one (not quite the same... 4 lights under one vehicle) 2 years ago, but did not look long for one last 4th of July.  This sighting consisted of a bright light coming out of the south, directly at me, in the far distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds I could see that it wasn&#39;t one light, but two. When I could see the clear separation between the lights, I watched as the vehicle slowly turned 90 degrees to the east (as the two lights merged into one with the turn), proceeded a short distance east, stopped for a few seconds (as to watch some fireworks below?), slowly backed up and turned onto the original flight path (as one light again became two), then continued almost directly over me at a fairly low altitude (lower than any passing commercial jet and somewhere close to single engine private plane low to medium altitude).  It was silent and flying faster than any plane, jet or prop, but not super fast. It continued to the northwest and disappeared toward the big dipper at a constant rate of speed.  I estimate the total time I saw it from horizon to horizon was about a minute.  No plane that we have would clear that distance in that time at that low altitude and not make a sound.<n>

Last night on the 4th of July 2013 my small town had their fireworks celebration.  As I was watching the fireworks, I noticed several red lights that at first I thought were embers, but they were too high and traveling at a high rate of speed way up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed these strange lights about 4 separate times over the course of the fireworks show.  Several groups of 3 or 4 of various sizes together and two single objects.  They were a bright red color and looked like an air plane would look up in the air except for they seemed to be traveling much faster than an aircraft usually does and they only had a red color to them.  Airplanes usually have several colored lights on them that blink.  These craft were red in color only and the light did not blink, it stayed the same intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking that they must be meteorites or something and then later on that night I listened to the C2C show on YouTube and heard the report that people are seeing these strange red lights in the sky all over the country.  I wish I had taken my camera because they were very plain to see and it was a clear, cloudless night here in Nebraska.<n>

It move a bit from right to left and soon vanished from our sight.  It was not very high in the sky, just above the trees, but our elevation here is about 2,000 feet.  So even though it was over the waters, we ruled out a flare of any kind.  There is no air traffic around here, and especially around this time.  Hope someone else saw it, cause I just cant stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live off Georgian Bay, but a few miles further to the west.  It is really the same water way but we live on a point of land that juts out into Georgian Bay.  Our mailing address was formerly Penetanguishene but has now been changed to Tiny, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 01, just after 10 pm a red flickering stationary light was observed in the night sky, in an area where there were no official fireworks.  The light was followed for a while. It didn’t appear to be making any sound.  The beach area is quiet with little light pollution, and with not much activity as the water level is low.  The light flashed off in a direct line, quickly and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, July 04, at approximately 10:20 pm as we walked along our quiet street that has a lot of mature trees, and is close to the beach.  Just above the tree line we observed a hovering object with bright lights flickering all over it.  It is a very quiet night, with a lot of cloud cover and yet it was very bright (orange/red colour) and did not appear to be that far away.  We could not hear it making any type of sound.  Then after we observed it for about 60 seconds, the light started dim, and then it was just a red dot, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked down to the beach, and on our way back, over the opposite tree line that runs parallel to the beach a bright green light (like a laser) flashed across the night sky over the tree line, as if something had flashed a laser light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, this past October (we have the date and time recorded and a drawing and can look for them if you are interested) we were walking along the same beach in Tiny, Ontario, just after 10 pm we saw a large orange/red fireball flash across the night sky and disappear above the same tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a beautiful area but likely won’t be for long as ‘the development devil’ is biting at the areas heels …<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was the Fourth of July, and I was looking out of my window at some people down the street, who were shooting some firecrackers.  They had stopped to refresh their supply, so I looked up into the sky and caught a glimpse of something that glowed super bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a star, because of how bright it was and because it was a circular object.  The object was bright orange mixed w/ a little red.  I stared at it for maybe two minutes and looked at the other stars around it and realized that it was a great deal bigger than the other objects around it.   I looked back at the object and saw it had changed colors.  I swear to God Almighty the thing was purple when I looked at it again.  I stood there in amazement just looking at it, wondering what on God’s green Earth it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away for a second or two to find my binoculars, w! hich I usually keep in my room to watch birds and such.  I didn’t see them, so I looked back at the object (it had turned back to orange by this point), and it began to move east-northeast towards the beach.  It was moving at a very high speed,  no doubt faster than an airplane that you would see during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew for a minute or so and disappeared.<n>

I had just walked inside when she called in and said there is something unusual outside that I should see.  I quickly made my way out and we both beheld two small, fiery looking, reddish orange lights in the sky, progressing slowly from the north to the south.  As they traveled in the sky at about a 2 o’clock position toward the east from our position, their speed did not noticeably vary, nor did their distance from one another.  From our vantage point they appeared about 4-6 times the size of a large star.  There was no noise associated with their movement, and their lights did not flicker, blink, or change color.  As they progressed south, both lights rather swiftly and almost simultaneously faded out.  They did not visibly travel beyond the horizon or behind some object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after the first two disappeared, two more arose or appeared from the same spot toward the northern horizon, and began drifting at the same speed and route as the first two.  They looked nearly identical to the first two and traveled at about the same speed, and were otherwise indistinguishable from the first pair.  Once these disappeared as the first two, two new objects appeared just as the first two sets and proceeded in all manners as those first two sets until they too disappeared in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the duration of the events, the clear view we had, and that we were naturally looking into the sky because the town’s 4th of July fireworks display had just ended, we presumed that many other people had seen this sight too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Where our house sits relative to the fields and lakes around here where folks launch their fireworks we can only catch the highest bursts, and those only through gaps in the trees.   We do have a relatively unobstructed view of the southern approaches/departures to SEATAC.  I’m a private pilot (single engine land, ground school for IFR; ‘haven’t flown in years, though), and do enjoy watching the SEATAC traffic when I get the chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the fireworks, at between approximately 10:15 and 10:45, we saw 5 orange’ish/amber lights not apparently connected to the usual approaches and departures (departures were to the south at SEATAC last night), not associated with any other lighting typical of the aircraft we see around here, and not apparently connected to the fireworks, moving from low on the horizon west (True bearing; magnetic variance is ~17 degrees east) of us to various headings and elevations.  Each light was a discrete, constant point source.  I am not familiar with any aircraft lighting systems that have a single orange’ish/amber constant light.  No sound was associated with the lights.  There were no apparent trails indicative of an exhaust plume.  The lights all appeared to be the same size, shape, color, and initial intensity, though their directions of flight were varied.  We had a commercial jet pass farther to the south of us than the first pair of lights we saw, sometime between the appea! rance of the fourth and fifth lights as part of its departure from SEATAC, and we could just make out the sound of its engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two lights we saw appeared to be moving together from west of us to east-southeast.  They were climbing together but not apparently connected to the same structure as they moved toward and a little southward of our house.  They seemed to shift position a bit with respect to each other, and were likely no less than 100 ft apart from each other while we could see them approaching.  One of them started to pass in and out of the thin broken stratiform cloud layer we had last night before we lost sight of them from our vantage point at a window on the west side of the house.  Given their trajectory and distance from us, their speed seemed to be somewhere around 120-180 kts, but we couldn’t see any aircraft structure to get a really confident estimate of distance, and their shifting position made speed estimates from looming difficult.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third light we saw appeared a few minutes after we lost sight of the first pair.  This second light appeared identical in every way to the first two (i.e., size, orange’ish/amber, discrete, constant point source).  We noticed it starting from a little bit north of where the first two came from, westward of our house.  It seemed to be climbing at about the same rate as the first two at first, but to the northeast.  We lost sight of this light when it passed into the clouds and to the north of our house.  It seemed to increase its vertical speed as it was entering the cloud layer, and perhaps turning to the north, since its headway to the east slowed down considerably as its size and intensity wained (we could see it climbing through a large gap in the clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth light appeared in the same area of the horizon as the first pair a few minutes after we lost sight of the third light.

Either a carefully carried out national hoax, or clever aliens disguising themselves in fireworks, as a logical fallback assumption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from this theory we were watching fireworks on the roof.  Suddenly, 5 ball like orange lights rose from the horizon line.  I pointed it out and my older brother and his girlfriend went, &#34;Holy crap, look at that.  Do you see that,&#34; and took pictures excitingly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was weary of this happening the whole night.  I kept looking up and thinking about ufos beforehand oddly enough.  Everything felt surreal.  2 years ago, we saw the same thing in Kirkwood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew in single file for about two minutes, making random arrangements.  Suddenly, two began to flicker out.  I said outloud that I bet they&#39;re going to make a triangle.  Within minutes they did.  My brother was astonished that it came true and I got the chills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She snapped pictures and showed me.  I think fireworks smog the atmosphere so these ufo&#39;s can be given a chance to spy.  Who or what was behind it, is still unknown.  I was a little terrified but also amazed.  I felt dizzy and confused after the experience.  They felt fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, red lights rolled through the clouds in fleets.  A loud humming sound was produced.  I was alone, during this separate sighting on the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Tamalpais when a mysterious black object came from behind one of the hills and came to a dead stop and continued to hover to the right of me approximately 100 yards away.  This object made absolutely no sound and from where I was at on this hill was eye level with me and below treetop level.  I stood there and watched it for a solid 10 minutes as it changed colors from green to red to a yellowish orange.  It was mostly dimmed down and black for a few minutes but then started glowing like a lit up Christmas tree as I continued to observe it.  It was oblong, taller than it was wide and took on the shape of a bell or lampshade with a brim on the bottom much like a hat.  Finally after 10 minutes it turned a solid white color like a lit up lightbulb and lifted up and took off to the east at a fairly high rate of speed.  There was a couple of people walking their dog down the hill from me that I tried to get! their attention to witness this but I did not want to yell and wake up the neighbors and I don&#39;t think they even noticed this object even though they were almost right under it.  It was dimmed down so low that I really could not see much detail except that it was definitely oblong and seemed to be pointed at the top and slightly curved on the sides and like I said to myself this looks like a lit up Christmas tree glowing like the object itself was luminous.  The colors were kind of blended together like they were coming off a hot grill on a black glass like surface.  Although I have seen many of these luminous objects at quite some distance away through the binoculars, this is the first time I was able to see something this close up.  I always see them to the east of San Rafael over the Bay and consider it a hot spot for sightings as well as Tiburon at a place called Blackies Pasture which is another hot spot.<n>

A plane flew by in what is a common landing path for the Louisville airport, which I noticed.   I looked up again and saw a light with a large halo around it behind and beneath the plane.   At first I thought it was just another firework and didn’t pay it much notice, but it didn’t explode and moved horizontally in a similar path as the plane.  I next thought that it was odd and noticed that the halo was shrinking but it was still bright.  I started recording the light as it moved across the sky with my phone, buy by the time I started the halo that was around the center mass had shrunk considerably about 3 times from the original size.  I continued recording until the light was no longer visible because of trees obscuring the view.  From where I was standing and started recording to where I could no longer see the light covered a conservative 30 degree span of the sky.<n>

We knew they weren&#39;t fireworks because the lights didn&#39;t fade out.  They seemed to be moving in batches.  At first we saw about 3 or 4 moving separately across the sky, much faster and swifter than an airplane moves.  Then one by one they would disappear into the sky.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact direction they were going, but I can verify that these lights were moving horizontally across the sky, like the same way a plane would...only much faster.  We then saw a few other groups. All of the moving lights were spread pretty far apart, but appeared to be going in the same direction. I attempted to record one with my phone, but the quality isn&#39;t nearly as good as I would&#39;ve liked it to be.<n>
7/4/13 21:51|Captiva|FL|Light|46 minutes|I saw 3 amber lights like I've reported before, plus an extremely bright &quot;slow&quot; flash of light.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99892.html|800|ndxe201307| I saw 3 amber lights like I&#39;ve reported before, plus an extremely bright &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot; flash of light<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4th of July UFO sightings on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, 33924<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this is my sixth sighting in a series of sightings that started on Captiva on Monday, June 24, 2013, two weeks ago, and I’m filing it our of sequence, I felt it was important to file now it in light of what Peter Davenport, Director, The National UFO Reporting Center, wrote me relating that there were an unusually large number of 4th of July sightings that “WERE NOT” fireworks, that the Center has just received..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first report, which was two hours in duration, was filed on 7/6/2013, with MUFON, and then with the Center.  I will file the other reports, in addition to yet another sighting a friend and I had last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY - I was on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island when at 9:51 p.m.  I saw two solid amber lights of the exact color of the 6 that I watched for just over 2 hours on June 24.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:05, a third redish-orange light came on above the first two (I just reported on those 2 hour sightings of up to six amber and one white UFOs starting with key words “Long duration UFO Sightings” with maps).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights went out at 10:12.  The lights went on and off as if on a dimmer switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:36 a nearly blinding white light appeared just west of due north over the gulf of Mexico, just above a cloud layer that was on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white light slowly came on like on a dimmer switch and appeared to be at least 5 miles away.  The duration of the white light sighting was about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a marine biologist, 60 years old, and a scientist first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were exactly due north of me, just off horizontal of each other, and about a 3 finger-width-at-arm-distance apart from each other.  The lights were initially about the width of a hand at arms length (9 degrees above my eye level horizon) above a tree line, then slowly drifted apart about 2 hand-widths and then drifted down to just treetop level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trees (Australian Pines) are about 70 feet high and approximately 3.5 football-field-lengths away from where I was standing that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The treetops are 4 degrees above my eye level horizon.  I used a “speed square” and a yard stick to measure degrees (see attached photos).  My eye level is 5 feet 6 inches.  Using this simple device one with mathematical background should be able to figure out what the actual height of a craft/light is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beach I was standing on is about four feet above sea level.  I estimate that whatever it was that was making the lights was approximately 7 to 8 miles distant, and at the high! est point they were a guesstimated 6,000 feet in the air; at the lowest about 3,000 feet or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were fireworks at the beach at North Captiva Island 8 miles to the north of me.  What I saw WAS NOT fireworks, as I’ve seen these lights before with a friend.  And because of their downward and left to right movements, I most seriously doubt they were “Chinese lanterns.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them at times with 10X42 binoculars, but could not discern a craft.  During the first five to six minutes first the object on the right turned off – as if on a dimmer switch – then the one to the left turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds the both came back on and slowly drifted down to tree top level – they were also moving left and right at least 10 degrees. And then both went off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later they both slowly came on at the same height they were initially.  Then a third red-orange light came on to the right and just above the other two craft.  For some reason I thought that they were observing the fireworks, which were going off about a hand width to the left of them, and at least two hand-widths below them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last I saw before the lights went of for the duration of when I was observing them (another 45 minutes….of getting chewed up by no-see-ums), they appeared to be drifting to my left, going lower, and toward the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks were over by 10:15 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the main lights went off I observed, for the fourth time since June 25, what I call a “flasher,” in exactly the same area where I saw the lights.  I will describe “flashers” in my next reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw, “out of the corner of my eye,” (exactly in the same fashion one would find the 7 sisters, which are a tad too dim to see directly), straight ahead of me and in the same area the first lights were, a brief, dim, “strobe flash.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I already had learned to train my binocs on such areas, and saw, well, a flasher, which comprises a rapid series of strobe-like flashes which are about a quarter or just less the duration of a normal strobe light flash, take up pretty much the entire view+ a tad of my 10X 42 field glasses.  Like I said, they are just a tad too dim to see with the naked eye, except for the initial flash, which one would think is eye trickery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got lucky again this time because I had some practice in spotting them before in binoculars, and watched them for maybe a 10 full seconds (actually a long time to hold them centered in binocs), before I lost them from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if it they just “blinked out,” and I could not find them again in my binocs – again, a difficult thing to do because they both take up the entire viewing field, and can’t be seen easily with the naked eye unless you are lucky enough to see the out of the “corner of your eye” and know how to immediately train your binocs on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:36, about a half hour after the fireworks were over, a relatively dim white light “came on” like one would slowly turn on a dimmer switch, and after about 30 seconds became from just a tad of light to “blindingly” bright, like it was very rapidly – very rapidly – coming straight at me.  I got VERY frighten when it was at it’s brightest, like it was no more than 20 feet in front of me, and was in the process of turning to the right and running like hell, when it immediately dimmed down and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted no more that a minute.  I had been, from the start of this event, flashing my 6-volt “lantern” at the objects from the beginning, including “SOS” signals, just like I did in my first report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I stayed at the beach for a while longer after the brightest light came on, but I’m not really sure as of this writing two days later.  End of report.<n>

We traveled out Cheshire rd east just before 5 Corners rd Delaware county.   Rain ended, saw 3 orange triangles just floating in sky we both saw them my husband and I.  We both said that&#39;s not fireworks not a helicoptered or a plane.  Put window down told my husband there was another one with them now 4.  One seemed to move not fast slowly off west.  We had to come to stop we found a place to turn around and went back to try to take a picture but all were gone.<n>

These lights were about the same elevation of a helicopter that is on its way to land, so maybe a couple hundred feet above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe this event is the Phoenix lights that happened in 1997 in Phoenix, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were going very slow, maybe about 10-15 miles per! hour, no sound, very close to us, amberish-orange color, and two lights were trailing behind the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what to make of this, but I will definitely never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, parents, and I were all witnesses to this.<n>

I had my daughter try to Video the objects, she did get some video of them, I went in the house to grab a pair of binoculars, I turned on the Flight Aware website for Grissom and the Live ATC, there were not aircraft noted on it in the immediate vicinity at the time and No ATC chatter. I returned outside, and could still see 3 of the objects now headed west, and beginning to disappear, as if the lights were fading or possibly turning off, we then lost sight of them at approx. 2205. No other aircr! aft were noted during the observation. Noted that as the Objects approached the fireworks stopped for a couple of minutes then resumed as the objects passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 58 yro Retired Astrophysicist, served in both Army and Marines in Law Enforcement, as well as being a Private Pilot. My daughter is 15, neighbor also witnessed the objects, and maybe a number of people in the area as there were a lot of people shooting off fireworks at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call the sheriffs dept they had no other reports of this at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One had a red hue about the same as Antares the other had no color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked closer I saw that they were moving very slowly to the north the red one ahead of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their distance from each other was less than the spread of the three stars at the head of Scorpio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for less than ten seconds they both faded out while they were still just west of the head of Scorpio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was one faint light I would assume it was a circumpolar satellite passing into the Earth&#39;s shadow, but their brightness was about the same as the ISS and one of them red?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very bizarre.<n>

We were about 5 minutes away from home, I was in the passenger seat, and all of sudden i saw this glowing red orb/fireball come flying from south west, going above our car and continuing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my wife pull over, and we both got out of the car.  I quickly took my iphone and captured a video, and took a picture with it.  I do not believe this was a &#34;Chinese&#34; lantern or anthing similar to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the picture, even though it was with iphone, you can see the shape of the object and tell there was a energy field around it.  The video is not the greatest, but you can see the pattern of its flight path, straight across like a craft flying, not flying high into the sky like a balloon rising.<n>

Then we noticed how they were moving and how close to each other they were we then knew they were not helicopters.  They were moving into very close to each other then out again. At a couple of times they completely disappeared then came back. We seen many fireworks that night and knew these were not fireworks, we then thought maybe remote controlled helicopters but they were too high for this. Would like to know if anyone else saw these. It was around 2145 military time i believe, give or take 15-20 minutes. And it was in the Westminster area.<n>

At first I thought it might be part of  the fireworks, but it was steadily flying in the opposite direction of the fireworks.  I thought it odd that it was so vibrantly colored and that it would be flying so close to a major fireworks display.  I tried to photograph it, but by the time I got my camera, it was too far away to properly capture it.  However, when I first spotted it, it seemed fairly close to the ground.<n>

I witnessed a couple of orange balls of light that were pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there were probably upwards of 10-20 thousand people at the park so I couldn’t have been the only one to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started at the southern part of the city and moved, what looked like, along the rivers path north.  The orange light would pulse on and off.  It seemed to be sporadic and not at the same timed interval.  There was no sound, it was hard to judge the distance up in the air.  Though it could have been an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I previously served in the Army and know of UAV’s and their ability to fly with a lack of noise at a certain height.  It looked to be moving too slowly and the light would have flashed at a specific interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it had made its way “up the river” and was near the Wisconsin Minnesota border, I noticed another one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it looked as if they were hovering, I am not sure if it was due to the distance away that they didn’t look like they were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But they didn’t seem to be getting any further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting posted on 5/6/13 of orange lights, that are almost lanterns sounds just like what I saw as well.<n>
7/4/13 21:45|Crestline|OH|Circle|5-7 minutes|Large orange craft with flickering fiery orange tail over fire works field. UFO Under intelligent control.|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99678.html|809|ndxe201307| Large orange craft with flickering fiery orange tail over fire works field. UFO Under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4th 2013 at or about 9:45 p.m. I was watching fireworks from my yard on the North side of my garage. I live in Crestline, Ohio.  As I watched the fireworks display at the local High School from my yard I noticed what I thought was even more fireworks out of the corner of my eye, through the tree limbs and leaves to my right.  As the Glow of these extra fire works became more noticeable for some reason, I began to watch them or as it turned out to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a large glowing object with a fluctuating orange semi structured, moving orb like craft. I call it a craft because it was definitely under intelligent control.  The object left the obscured view from the trees and leaves and showed itself to be moving slightly slower than a small private plane and as the object entered clear sky after a short light misty rain, an orange spherical like object with a fluctuating tail, resembling a rocket engine exhaust flame, slowly navigated from the eastern sky at maybe 3000 ft about the lower altitude of a small private plane. I estimate the size to be similar to the size of  a small Cessna at that altitude coming from the direction of  north Mansfield, Ohio; as this orange slow comet like object,  with a flickering orange tail approached the center of the village of Crestline and the fire works display field, the craft made a gentle course correction to due north towards Cleveland from the east to west trajectory the craft had be! en on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft was directly overhead there was no sound from any jet engine or a prop. In fact there was no sound at all. It seemed to me only a helicopter could go that slowly and not fall out of the sky but there was no pressure wave from any rotors. And helicopters don&#39;t usually glow orange and have a flickering definitely orange tail. This all happened with in the space/time of about 5-7 minutes and the craft gradually and gently increased it&#39;s altitude, disappeared into the northern night sky seemingly on its way to Cleveland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was so unusual it drew my attention to it, I have never seen anything like it in the night sky other than a very distant meteor but meteors do not change course and usually have a bluish cast and remain in one trajectory. I have no idea what this object was. I do think this observation merits reporting because of the uniqueness of the circumstances. Make of it, what you will, perhaps more sightings of this object will come to light near the same date and time and geographical location. For me it will remain a UFO for the time being. I do not drink or use drugs, I was eating watermelon in a lawn chair enjoying the fireworks in a light misty rain. I could not discern the actual shape of the craft itself only the dimensions of the bright flickering rocket engine like orange glow from what I assume was directly behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Crestline, Ohio  7-4-2013 21:45<n>

They were changing formation often.  First they would be in the formation of a triangle, then they would go into the formation of a straight line.  One time 2 of the objects would rotate around the third one.  Twice it appeared that they would all blend as one object for 2 seconds before breaking into 3 objects again.  There were 4 of us who witness this event and we can all see that there were some rotation within the object itself.  We were all so in awe with what we were seeing.  Anyhow, 2 of the objects disappear so quickly like a flash of light going 500 miles per hour type speed.  The third object hover for a few seconds longer and it just shot up into the air so fast it look like it evaporated.  Amazing, just amazing.  These objects were larger than a helicopter.  Believe me I was in the military for 5 years and I know ! what and how civilian and miliar choppers move and these objects were not either these objects were out of this world<n>

Cavalry Cemetery Mausoleum.  Corner of Wherle Dr. and Genesee St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reason for being there:	  I was watching the fireworks show from the Cheektowaga town park.  I chose that 	location because I wanted to view the show with a much smaller crowd around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observations:		  What drew my attention to it was that it was not behaving like an aircraft, and was clearly too high to be a helicopter.  Due to the proximity of the buffalo Niagara International airport, I am quite familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft and helicopters.  I make my assumption of its altitude because it was clearly above any clouds overhead.  In addition, it produced no noise, and no strobe lights and no navigation lights where visible.  At the start of their cycle, they where small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time they where overhead, they appeared as a faintly orange ball.  By the end of their path, they where large and darker than the midnight blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not the only person to observe these lights.  At least 8 or more people saw them too.  There was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sequence of events:  Roughly at about the same time as the show started, I observed a red light followed by an orange light.  It first appeared to be coming from the Southwest, slowly traveled with a gentle wavering, passed directly overhead, and continued Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4-5 minutes after it moved out of sight, another one appeared from the same location and slowly made its way to the same destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly around the middle of the firework show two of them traveled overhead, and merged close together, then apart, but still held the same course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These “fly over’s” continued through the firework show. I do not know when they stopped, as I left the area after the firework “grand finale”.<n>

These objects were noticed by several others around us in the field and there were a lot more people that had to have seen them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after spotting these objects i told my wife to give me her phone and i got them on video.

They were moving quicker and more fluid like than any other aircraft I had observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circling oval pattern abruptly stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds.  Now only 4 lights remained and they quickly shuffled around each other in their own unique oval shaped patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 seconds of this the lights reduced down to three in which they formed a triangle in the sky. The lights then began to weave in and out of each other, yet always returning back to the original triangle shape.  The sharp degree turns that these crafts would turn at was remarkable; they could flip a direct 180 degree turn at a really high velocity as if momentum was not a factor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This triangular light pattern lasted for about 20 seconds until 2 suddenly disappeared as if flying north at a really fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last light remained for a while longer, the departure of this light was observed as if it were shrinking in size and dimming in luminescence to blend with the city street lights until we could see it no longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We potentially considered this last beam of light to have landed as it sunk to blend in with the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three individuals can vet for what they saw on the mountain that day, and we all agree that these air crafts were far more advanced than anything we have seen in the skies before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very inspiring and beautiful spectacle we were graced with.<n>

At about 9:30 p.m. July 4th, 2013 myself and six other people witnessed glowing orbs flying overhead from west to east. There were six groups of them flying by that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first group were three orbs, glowing red. They seemed to flicker. There was no sound. They looked pretty low, I would guess maybe only a few hundred feet above. They were moving fast, way faster than the 10 mile an hour winds the weather report says for our area. As they moved closer to the east they seemed to fade but you could still make them out, we watched until they went too far to make out with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second group was another three orbs. The third group was three orbs as well. The fourth group was two orbs. The fifth group was two orbs. The sixth and final was a single orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These all followed the same path, from west to east. They all moved about the same speed, although in the first group, one was moving out ahead of the others at a faster speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all dumbfounded as to what this could have been. There was no sound. They were moving very fast. This event lasted about 15-20 minutes. I have witnessed lots of balloons, lanterns, remote planes, toy rockets, flares, fireworks, etc. and I can definitely state that this was not that. The only thing that might even remotely explain this would be some type of lantern, like the Chinese floating lanterns. But that doesn’t explain the speed at which they moved or the exact path they took across the sky. I can definitely say that this is the most eventful 4th of July I have ever had!<n>

We were sitting in a van located just south  of the bridge on Long Lake, in an elevated piece of property with great views of the lake that runs southwest to northeast.  We stayed in the van because of the mosquitoes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:30 pm we saw a slow moving glowing , circular object (orange , yellow)  in  the sky,  about 5 times the size of the North Star, it was then followed by another, and another.  I got out of the van to listen and yet they were silent.  After about the third glowing object, others came in clusters, and then singles again.  There were about 25 in all.  It looked like an invasion.  There was one that looked brighter and bigger  then the others and stood motionless while the others passed.  It disappeared! while they were passing it and  reappeared when all had passed.  They all moved slowly and made no sharp turns from a westerly southwesterly direction to an easterly northeasterly direction.  This amazing sight  lasted no more than 10 minutes, but we will remember it for a lifetime.<n>

When we first saw the objects through the trees they appeared as partial shapes of bright color which confused us for a moment; we knew that various towns would be having fireworks so that was our first thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, although these objects were brightly colored they didn&#39;t appear as sporadic bursts of light in the way that fireworks appear in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally drove past a field we saw the objects very clearly.  There were two sets of two brightly glowing objects that hovered and maintained a certain distance from each other.  Each object had an outer half sphere that glowed a bright reddish-orange and there was a glowing white sphere protruding from the center of the outer reddish-orange half sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very dramatic looking because of their glowing brightness, their stillness, and their distance from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren&#39;t in a close formation although we could see them all at the same time at approximately 500 to 600 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, we had no place to pull the car over so we continued to watch them until the road curved and we could no longer see them behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects glowed intensely and their luminescence was the most striking feature about them.<n>

I was excited and kept telling her to watch.but she was not interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She just said, &#34;Yeah,yeah,yeah ufo&#39;s gramma.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I spotted another one traveling the same route and watched it to try to determine what it was but couldn&#39;t compare it to anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after my daughter came out of the house and another single one came by and she noticed right away that it was strange.  She immediately quipped that it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at this one too trying to determine what kind of light it was and because it was slow moving I came to the conclusion that it was just the government moving some new  aircraft around and with all the activity in the sky no one would notice.<n>

We watched it for about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we watched, the light appeared to very slowly ascend a noticeable distance.  The light resembled a stoplight with a slight hourglass shape.  It did not make any sudden movements and no noise could be heard due to fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object suddenly disappeared as if someone had turned out the light.  We are located within thirty miles of a military base/camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not scared...only curious.

We watched it as it moved from right to left across the sky, it was a lot higher than the fireworks were.  We know it wasn&#39;t a plane a helicopter or fireworks.  We reluctantly called the police department and reported what we saw.  Of course the dispatcher thought we were just seeing fireworks, but we know it wasn&#39;t fireworks for sure.  It was a UFO under intelligent power.  We always wondered if anyone else saw what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

7/4/13 21:30|Castle Pines|CO|Triangle|20 minutes|3 bright white lights in triangular shape seen over Denver|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99690.html|831|ndxe201307| 3 bright white lights in triangular shape seen over Denver<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the person who called the hotline from Castle Rock, CO.  My niece, her husband and myself on night of July 4th observed strange lights in the sky.  First noticed a “diffused” area of light kind of in a bar shape.  My niece’s husband saw it first and thought it was headlights on a mountain side.  They had just moved in with us and he was not familiar with direction, the mountains where far to the west of the lights we were looking at.  When I noticed it I immediately thought it looked out of place went inside to get binoculars.  Upon looking through it at binoculars the object had changed from my initial observation, it was now three bright lights in a triangle shape.  I would compare the brightness to a commercial jet landing light.  I handed the binoculars to my niece’s husband so he could see; he then handed back to me and as I was looking one of the lights went out leaving two lights.  Shortly thereafter another light went out leaving only one light.! The lights where stationary or moving very slowly to the north away from us.  The lights varied in brightness over the course of the observation.  We observed the lights from approximately 12500 block south and 8000 block east, approximately 15 miles south-southeast of downtown Denver.  We were on top of Surrey Ridge in the Daniels Gate subdivision of Castle Pines were we have a complete view of the city.  Lights where straight north of our location, I would estimate just east of downtown or to the northeast of downtown.  If I made an educated guess I would say they where over Brighton, CO.  After looking through the binoculars for the second time I handed them to my niece so she could see them.  I then went up to our loft where I have a spotting scope (Celestron Ultima 80) to see if I could make out any detail.  The one light still looked as a single light I could not make out anything additional.  Object was still nearly stationary.  I did notice in the field of view co! mmercial jets flying past (heading towards landing at DIA) and! a helic opter.  However I noticed another group of lights to the west or left of the bright light.  These lights where much dimmer and varied in color, I would guess there were 6-12 lights, hard to say exact number because they where flashing off and on.  This object was also stationary.  Total length of observation was approximately 15-20 minutes at which time the lights disappeared.  Time was about 9:30-9:50pm mountain time.  I went back down stairs and looked through binochlers some more to see if I could locate objects, I did pick up the flashing colored lights and they were now northeast of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The structure of the UFO was comparable to a upside down light-bulb. At the bottom of the UFO there was a single hole that i could see inside the craft through, the hole was also emitting red-orange light with a ball of red-orange light that was positioned at the center of the hole in the UFO without struts or bars attached to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the trees moving and I looked to my left near the top of the trees at my home and saw the UFO hovering behind the tree. The UFO then slowly moved at a speed around 10 mph to the end of my street. I yelled to my girlfriend who was beside me to look and I pointed at the UFO. The UFO immediately started hovering higher and moving away from my location at around 30 MPH and gradually built up speed and rose higher until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the UFO, two of my friends and I were watching the skies for the UFO in case it returned. We watched for about an hour and noticed six other red orbs in different locations in the sky, Three of the six orbs were flying individually. The other three orbs were in a triangular formation and flying in the same direction as if part of the same aircraft.<n>

Looked like bottom of a tin can. Had a single reddish-orange light that was solid, not blinking.  Was headed in northward direction.  Light was on north side.  It was partly cloudy and I was able to make out the shape as I passed through the clouds.  I think I saw it again a half hour later, going same direction but further east of my location.<n>

The lady in the parking lot in front of us asked, &#34;Do you all see that? What is it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all turned around and saw an orange/red blob in the north moving from east to west fairly slowly.  There was no sound, no flashing lights, it just quietly moved along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved further west, another one came into view from the east.  As it came into view, the one that was to the west just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched the second one, and it did the same as the first: moved towards the west, and a third one come into view.  The 2nd one disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched the third one in total awe.  It eventually moved towards the west and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fireworks show, we got on the highway to head home.  We were headed north on the highway towards the direction of where we saw the 3 lights, when our son said, &#34;Look! here&#39;s another one!&#34;  Sure enough, out of the east came another one.  It went over the top of us, and as we were looking out the west side of our car to catch another glimpse of it, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple days later, we were talking to a friend of ours who lives in Stilwell.  We told him what we had seen with the other people at the show, and he couldn&#39;t believe it.  He had seen the exact same thing!  We couldn&#39;t tell you how high up they were, but they were no higher than a low flying airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there was no noise whatsoever.  No flashing.  Just a solid orange/red light that moved from east to west.  My guess as to how long they lasted would be each one was about 20-30 seconds before disappearing.  They were all at the exact same level.  Like clockwork.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no alcohol involved, so we know we weren&#39;t imagining things!  And when the people who we didn&#39;t know started flipping out, we knew it was the real deal.<n>

It was red in color and about every five seconds changing to a burnt orange for almost a second and then back to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw it moving south as it made a fast sharp left turn heading east and then moving at a slower speed. As it moved east it looked to have a burst of speed every time it changed color, then slowing down again. The light traveled about a third of the sky then just simply stopped and hovered for about 40 seconds. While it was just sitting there it was still changing color from red to burnt orange then back again, and every time it changed color it got dimmed in brightness, the it simply just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some cloud cover because it lightly rained just before the fireworks display. At the time of the sighting there was no rain but the clouds remained. The light was below the cloud cover the entire time that we saw it and there was no wind movement and we heard no sound other then a few people setting off firecrackers.  It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen!<n>

At first glance, I thought they were hot air balloons though I thought it odd they would be flying at night, especially on the 4th with fireworks going off.  They were traveling in sets of two, maintaining their distance from eachother. They appeard to be glowing balls of fire.  When I got home a few minutes later I watched the first set go off into the distance until I could no longer see them, then the first glow in the second set faded away, the second glow did the same. Then I observed another set of two follow the same path and fade away as well.<n>

I looked to the north and saw a very bright &amp;quot;fireball&amp;quot; heading west.  We frequently see night launches of rockets from Kennedy Space Center, and while this was similar, it seemed closer and it was heading the wrong way.  (The rockets always arch up and to the east.) This seemed to be moving about the same speed and had that same look as a rocket, but larger and brighter.  It got progressively smaller and and more dim.  I assume it was going higher and/or moving further away.  Could have been some sort of military aircraft, but there was only one, we could hear no noise and there isn&#39;t a military base near here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking directly North we have an open view of the city.  I&#39;m not sure the exact time as the fireworks started about 21:00 hours and continued for most of the night but my best estimate would be somewhere around 22:00-23:00 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the fireworks over the city we both noticed three lights moving around about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Their distance from us was hard to judge but my impression was that it was a good distance away &amp;gt;4 miles.  The lights seemed to fade in and out of sight in order from three to one then three again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights maintained what seemed an equal distance from each other at all times.  A perfect formation in a triangular shape.  If the lights were on the corners of a flat triangular shape then the flat plane of that object looked to be twisting and rolling slowly but the lights remained visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the lights were much larger than any of the surrounding fireworks which made them stand out more and the color was the light yellow of a typical street light as I recall.<n>

We witnessed 2 identical crafts one in front of the other flying fairly low going West.  Both had  a thin band of reddish orange windows going around their circumference that appeared to be lit up.  They might have been lights but I could see divisions between each &#34;window&#34; or light whichever it was.  There was no sound whatsoever.

Me and 1 friend.  Just as fireworks were beginning, before it was completely dark, I noticed a strange orange/red light moving through the sky rather slowly, from south to north, just behind the beach line.  I am just guessing at the height, but it seemed to be about 60-100 feet in the air.  I alerted my friend to this odd, slow moving &#34;firework&#34;.  It had a red light in the front, and it was light enough out that we were able to see the outline of a rectangular shape &#34;craft&#34; silhouette with the light at the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at each other and said &#34;Whoa, that was weird&#34;.  There were many other people present at the beach, not a single person besides us seemed to notice the odd light in the sky (Perhaps because they were focused on the fireworks being shot out over the water, whereas this was behind the beach)  As the skies darkened, we saw another light moving in exactly the same manner.  Due to the fact the sun had set, we were unable to see a silhouette behind the light, but as the light passed, it was not visible from behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another and yet another of these lights passed, at about 3-5 minute intervals. 2 of the lights dropped rapidly to the ground some distance away, and then after about 30 seconds, rose back up and proceeded in the same path as the other lights.  The last and 6th light we saw flew directly over our heads as we were leaving the beach.  It seemed to be about 40-60 feet high, totally silent, and once passed, the light was not visible from behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being that it was 4th of July, I would have normally written this off as being chinese lanterns........but, we saw the large shape behind the first light (a rectangle approximately 6 times longer than the light itself) and the added rapid fall and then rise of 2 of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights were viewed by 2 adult males, no drinking or other &#34;stuff&#34; involved.<n>
7/4/13 21:00|Port St. Lucie|FL|Circle|20 minutes|Circular Red/Gold Lights flying overhead|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99699.html|858|ndxe201307| Circular Red/Gold Lights flying overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 4, 2013, between 2100 and 2200, we were in our backyard shooting fireworks. One of our daughters was looking up in anticipation and noted 3 moving lights in formation. When first observed, the lights were located to our southeast.  I at first thought they may be the headlights of a small plane since there are many that fly in this area. However, it became clear these were different and unique.  Approximately 10 minutes later a fourth light passed and a fifth passed approximately 10 minutes after the fourth.  All lights were similar.  There was a fairly strong westward wind and it was partly cloudy with the clouds travelling northwest.  The following is a summary of the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Formation, speed and flight path:  When the 3 light formation first appeared, the lights were noted at about 45 degrees from vertical while facing south east and appeared to be travelling directly towards our location. For the fourth and fifth lights, the same pattern was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 light formation may have been a vee, but with only three, this is likely an assumption although the middle one seemed to slightly lead the others. They remained close together approximately in the same position relative to each other as they approached us and travelled overhead. As they moved away, it appeared that the formation may have separated but the light intensity changed and this again may be as illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to judge speed, although it seemed to be constant. I have observed many planes flying overhead and most commercial flights that are landing at PBI, can be seen travelling between 10,000-15,000 altitude and I believe their speed is much less that 500 mph as they ready their approach. The lights appeared to be of similar altitude but this is very hard to judge. Based on this assumption, the speed would be greater than the commercial flights by approximately a factor of two which could be over 500 mph. This is very hard to judge and is highly dependent on altitude. For example, I have also observed satellites and they do not appear to be moving rapidly, but due to relative altitude, they are in fact travelling much faster than a plane. The speed seemed constant and unwavering during the approach and while overhead. after they passed and were moving away, it is possible that the speed changed dramatically since the brightness  faded rapidly as though they were travell! ing rapidly away from us. However, this occurred in a very short observed distance so if this were the case, the altitude would have to have been increasing as they would be moving in nearly a straight line from our angle of observation.  This is unlikely. The more reasonable  condition is a change in intensity as described below. The flight path was straight from the southeast to the northwest with the potential change observed just before we lost view. For example, vision of one light ended well before the other two.  For the fourth and fifth lights, the same pattern was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was specifically looking for flight changes that would be difficult for any known aircraft but this was not observed. The speed seemed to be well within known craft and there were no observable changes in acceleration. Overall, with the potential exception of the anomalies towards the end of the observation period, no unusual flight information was observable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights:  Each of the lights looked about the same,  although the intensity of light varied between the three each was constant to itself during the approach and while overhead. The one in front was the brightest and the other two  were close but slightly different in intensity with respect to each other.  The intensity of the fourth and fifth were similar but cannot be compared directly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were different than any plane light. The light was not a beam but was more of a glowing effect. The main light was golden yellow emanating from the center with a bright red perimeter that was concentrated on the front or lead end possibly half way around, however, with no clear demarcation point. The general intensity was much brighter than stars and similar to plane head lights until they began to fade after passing. The lights were beautiful and glowed in a consistent fashion providing the impression of a Christmas ornament. The intensity was the same upon approach and while overhead. The intensity lessened after they passed and the red glow became much less observable. While overhead, they appeared to be circular, however there may have been a slight ovality with the long end aligned with the travel path. This, however, is a guess in that the two colors may have been deceiving the eye. Also, the shape of a light is automatically assumed to be circular or spheri! cal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing, the light intensity slowly faded and then changed dramatically when the angle was about 45 degrees. One light faded and extinguished from our view while the second and third remained possibly 30 seconds to a minute longer with each fading and finally disappearing.

7/4/13 21:00|Cary|NC|Light|several sightings through|Red glowing light flew overhead prior to fireworks show|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99688.html|860|ndxe201307| Red glowing light flew overhead prior to fireworks show<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (July 4, 2013) I had a series of several UFO sightings around 9pm, while outside watching the Fourth of July fireworks at Regency Park in Cary, NC. I was sitting near Symphony Lake, under some pine trees. I had a clear view of the lake, and of the sky above the lake where the fireworks would be (there was a gap in the group of pine trees, with a direct view of the spot across the lake where the fireworks are set off). We were all looking up at the sky, waiting for the fireworks to begin. Before the fireworks started, I suddenly saw a bright red glowing light fly over the lake. For a moment I thought it was the fireworks starting, but quickly realized it wasn&#39;t. The reddish light appeared quite large and low in the sky. It appeared about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane would fly. The strangest thing was that the light pulsed, or glowed, in a slow and steady rhythm, completely different from t! he lights on an airplane or helicopter. It glowed bright, and then waned, and when it had just about disappeared, it would resume glowing up to a bright red, and then wane again. It flew in a straight path above the lake. It flew overhead a total of three times before the fireworks started. I overheard one person near me commenting on it, wondering what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I also saw a different light formation fly over the lake. These ones were different: there were two lights, a yellow light and a green light (yellow on the left, green on the right), and they appeared to be connected as if they were on a solid object. These lights were smaller than the red light, about the size of typical airplane lights. They flew without blinking or pulsing. They flew overhead twice before the fireworks started, and then once during the fireworks show, at which point several people around me were joking that “that plane is going to run into the fireworks,” and other people said no, it must be higher than the fireworks. I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was higher than the fireworks or not. Then, after the end of the fireworks, when everyone was walking back to the parking lots, I saw the yellow and green lights fly overhead one more time, over the road (a little lower than an airplane would fly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not my first UFO sighting; I&#39;ve had at least dozen UFO sightings in the Raleigh-Durham area in a little over a year. Most (but not all) of my previous sightings have happened when I&#39;m driving at night.  Most of my previous sightings have also happened when I&#39;m by myself, which made me question, at first, whether I was imagining things or not. Most of these sightings have been similar to what I saw last night-- strange colored lights flying in the sky, that don&#39;t look like airplanes or helicopters, and without any noise. I&#39;ve also seen one &amp;quot;black triangle&amp;quot; with lights that hovered motionless directly over my car, and I&#39;ve also seen white starlike lights moving in the sky (seen in daytime, and once at night). My first UFO sighting, in April 2012, was the one that scares and baffles me the most. I would be willing to discuss it over the phone. The sighting last night was the first one where I could verify for myself that other people were seeing and talking ab! out the same things I saw. I don&#39;t know what these lights are, or what it means, but at least I know that other people saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/4/13 21:00|Hampton/Rye|NH|Fireball|2 hours|Multiple sets of two objects appear on the horizon over land (Hampton, NH) and precede to move off into the sky off the coast of Rye NH|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99682.html|864|ndxe201307| Multiple sets of two objects appear on the horizon over land (Hampton, NH) and precede to move off into the sky off the coast of Rye NH<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I are from Massachusetts, and were headed up to the New Hampshire sea coast for the Fourth of July festivities.  We were planning on spending the day at Wallis Sands state beach in Rye, NH, but due to the incredibly hot weather, traffic, and my overheating engine we decided to stop short of our destination and spend the day at the North Hampton beach.  For those of you not familiar with this area, it is on the border of Rye, and is far from the main Hampton strip which helps cut down on the crowds for a much friendlier environment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at approximately 2pm and spend the day in the water, and at the beach. As darkness and the July Fourth fireworks displays were approaching, we decided to walk North up Route 1A to find a vantage point which would allow us to watch both the Hampton Beach display, and the Rye display at Jenniss Beach.  The point we found is after a bend in the road which is 3/4ths of the way up a rock face overlooking a large majority of the New Hampshire Sea coast.  From this point the Salisbury water tower and Seabrook Nuclear facility is clearly visible.  According to Google Earth the nuclear plant is 5.72 miles at a 222.40 degree heading from the vantage point. The approach path the objects took was at approximately 210 degrees relative to our vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Private properties began setting fireworks off at 21:00 (9:00 pm EDT) to accompany the municipal displays which were going on at the time and continued past 23:00 when we left the area to return home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our attention was first drawn to the first set of objects when my girlfriend noticed that one of the fireworks over Hampton looked like it was burning frozen in the air. My initial though was that it was a flare or something that someone had shot off, but I realized this could not be the case because it was slowly rising from the horizon. We studied this object for a moment, and then to our surprise there was an additional one next to it as if they had come from the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued to rise, but they looked as if they were slowly picking up speed. They were at about a 35 degree angle relative to the horizon when they began to move forward. They looked as if they were rising with the same speed but they were slowly moving through the sky at a diagonal to us from South West, to North East over the water. After watching the objects move over the water and get further out, they began to rapidly gain velocity, and elevation. The objects became less luminous, and as they looked like they were about to leave visual range, they shot off at an increased angle of attack. As the objects left the point at which we acquired them at, the lateral distance between them increased as they approached different parts of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we turned back to the fireworks, unsure of what we had seen, we realized that two more objects were already half way to the point where the last two had just disappeared and we watched the exact same process happen again. In both cases, it was identical objects, coming from the same point of origin, moving in an identical way, with each of the two objects going towards the same two points in the sky which the previous ones had moved towards. We watched the same process happen again (for a total of 6 objects) and then the phenomenon stopped for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all cases the objects rose from approximately a 210 degree heading (between the nuclear plant, and the coast line) from where we were sitting. All objects looked like balls of red-orange fire, but as they approached, what looked like a tail from the movement became a defined triangular shape that could only be seen by the reflection of the light coming off of the leading vertex of the shape. As the objects moved, and were about to start the final acceleration, each time the visible triangular part would swing out parallel to our view point, and the faintly visible triangular body would become invisible to us. The only thing visible would be the ball of light until the object accelerated off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to lie down on the rocks we were sitting on initially and after another 45 minutes I got a feeling that I should look. So I sat up to see four of the objects following a slightly higher angle of attack and still in the same group of two pattern as they were initially. From the size of the triangles, we were able to determine that the objects that were moving to the more northern part of the sky were significantly closer to us than the objects which were moving to the more southern point in the sky. I also noticed the higher angle of attack, and realized that over the past hour and a half or so they sky had shifted. The objects were going to the exact same points relative to the Milky Way as they were beforehand except they angle of attack was steeper to compensate for the rotation of the earth. I’m no astronomer so I have no idea what constellations can be used to pin-point the area where we lost line of sight, but it was about 2 to 3 hand widths away from a clust! er of four very dim stars on the lower half of the northern part of the Milky Way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event repeated itself one last time before we decided to leave around 23:00 (11pm EDT). In all encounters the objects were identical, moved to the same place, in the same way through the same means. All objects were silent, made no noise, were of red-orange color, and flickered like a candle, or pulsating light in a storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to the beach from our vantage point to get the truck, we realized that because of the angle of vision that the bulk of the population had, it is unlikely that many other people were able to witness the event. The view was obscured by the fireworks and by a fog off the water at the beach. By the time the object would have been in unobstructed view, they would have been at a high enough angle and altitude that they could easily be written off as stars, or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, as a foot note, I was a 24 hour, three day per week manager at a local hotel last season. I have been around for a military air show at Peas AFB, and am familiar with the normal local air traffic. I have flown on many planes both commercial and recreational due to family circumstances, and I have never seen a civilian or military craft that would fit the description of what I saw tonight. I also have a passion for the Space Program, so I know this doesn&#39;t fit any man made vehicle that we currently operate.<n>

Unlike jet aircraft, the orbs did not make a sound.  The first one took off and accelerated to over 30 to 40 thousand feet or more in a matter of a few seconds until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later five or six more followed in the same path, at semi-equal distance from one another, and again (one after the other) ascended to 30 to 40 thousand feet in the same direction - until no longer visible.  The last one appeared a few minutes later, separate from the cluster of 5 or 6, and again was traveling in a south east direction.  But about Parallel to our observation point the orb shot straight up at an accent that made it disa! ppear from view in a matter of seconds, perhaps close to a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that the orbs were 20 to 30 feet in diameter and that they first appeared at about 1,000 feet in altitude.  They were a bright orange with a fiery like appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being the 4th of July celebration, many people were on the beach at Whidbey’s Mutiny Bay during the orb display and must have also seen the phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the sighting, and directly east,  someone set off a chain of luminaries with candles under paper sacks; which floated in an easterly direction and ended flight several hundred yards from their launch site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This should not be confused with the orb sightings and the visuals and distances traveled are not remotely close to one another.<n>

I live in an airplane flight  zone and close to a small airport, so lights in the sky is something I am used to. The reason this object or objects caught my eye was that it was July 4th and people were starting to light  off fireworks so I was looking around to which neighbors were lighting them off. The 3 lights were exactly the same distance apart the whole time I was watching them. They were about the same distance up in the sky as  the smaller airplanes are right before they land at the Kenosha Airport, just south of my house(about 5 miles away). They were not making a sound and then the left light(on the east side) slowly went out. It was not like a light switch being turned off, though. It almost seemed to fade out. The other 2 lights kept moving at the same rate of speed, the ! same distance apart for another 30 seconds and then the back right light(on the west side) went out the same way as the first. The front orange light was still on and moving at the same speed, same height for another 20 seconds and then that light disappeared. My friend and I  looked at each other and said what the heck was that. About 20 seconds after that, I saw a black triangular shaped object behind my friends head, about the same height, moving the same speed, making not a single sound moving north. I asked him if he could see it, but at the picnic table he was facing west and by the time he turned around and tried to look for it, he said he saw nothing. I got up from the table and ran across the street to my house to follow it, but after it went behind the trees in my neighbors yard to the east, I could not see it anymore. I am a very skeptical person, but I saw something I have never seen before in my life. The reason I thought it was more than one object was because! when I saw it at first, it looked like 3 objects moving toget! her in f ormation, but I could not see a separation of any material or a specific form that would have definitely made me think it was one object. When I saw it behind my friends head, all I saw was 1 triangular object which made me think I had seen 3 lights on the corners of 1 vehicle before they went out. The fact that there was no noise at all, even though it was July 4th, was really eerie.<n>

We arrived at the field around 8:30pm.  It was still light out and there were already hundreds of people gathered in the field.  We were there for maybe about 15-20 minutes watching the kids run around catching fireflies and I was setting up my camera getting ready for the show.  I have a Cannon Rebel T3i with a 55mm-250mm telephoto lens and was playing with the settings to get the best fireworks shots I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My youngest son who is 5 years old saw something in the sky and told us all to turn and look at it.  He thought it was a balloon.  When I turned to look at it I knew right away that it was no balloon.  It appeared to be some sort of glowing orb.  It was so bright at the center that it appeared bright white and had an orange glow around that.  As an avid photographer I had taken many photographs of balloons and knew right away this was different.  It was traveling horizontally across the sky about the speed of a commercial passenger plane. It moved very smoothly and silently.  It was probably flying around 15000 to 20000 feet based off where most planes fly.  It maintained its speed and altitude as it crossed the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after my son pointed it out to us I began to hear others around the field taking notice and asking what it was as well.  Everyone was looking and pointing at the object as it hovered across the sky.  It traveled about three quarter of the way across the sky before it! disappeared. In that time I managed to take two photos of the object.  I was so interested in watching it that I didn’t take any more.  Shortly after the object disappeared from the sky a plane fly overhead seeming to follow the exact path the object took minutes before.  It moved at a very similar speed only there was apparent noise generated by the planes engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane also seemed to fly further across the sky than the object did getting smaller until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the photos I took had apparent distortion to the object from shaking the camera. The other was very clear.  Once I got home I was able to crop the photo and get a better look at the object. It appeared to have some sort of structure inside the “glow”.  As far as what it was I couldn’t make that out.  No one in the field that night seemed to talk about it after it disappeared.  I kept a close eye on the news papers and news websites following the event to see if anyone else reported it or if there was any mention of what it was.  There were hundreds of witnesses that night but I have yet to hear anything from anybody as far as what they thought it was.<n>

It was bright white at the center, yellow around the center and orange on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling from southwest to northeast.  It wasn&#39;t falling thru the sky, it appeared to be gaining in altitude.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least a couple hundred people there waiting for the fireworks to begin.

He thought it was a hot air balloon.  When we turned to look at it there was no balloon or basket.  What we saw was a glowing orb.  It was bright white at the center, yellow around the center and orange on the outside.  It was traveling from southwest to northeast. It wasn&#39;t falling thru the sky, it appeared to be gaining in altitude.  It made no noise.  There were at least a couple hundred people there waiting for the fireworks to begin.  You could hear other people saying &amp;quot;look at that&amp;quot; so I know we weren&#39;t the only ones who seen it.  As an avid photographer I had my camera ready to photograph the fireworks and was able to get 2 pictures of the object. I have a Canon T3i rebel camera with a 55mm-250mm zoom lens and was able to get a fairly clear photo of the object.  My girlfriend had been frightened b! y what we saw when we were observing it.  It traveled in a fairly straight path across the sky appearing to slighty gain altitude as it crossed overhead.  It traveled about three quarters across the sky above before it just disappeared.  About 15-20 minutes later a comercial plane passed over the field seemingly in the exact same path and at the same speed as the glowing object.  The plane had the traditional noise associated with a plane and flew until it was so small you couldn&#39;t see it anymore, farther than the object that passed before it but it was visably much less bright.  Once I was home and examined the photos I took, one had obvious shaking distortion to the object.  The other was clear and you could make out a longer cylindrical solid object in the center of the glow.  Clearly nothing like any othe flying craft I had witnessed or anyone I&#39;ve shown the photo too.  I&#39;m positive that others there that night witnessed the same object.<n>

We live in Tinley Park Il. and was watching in the direction of Frankfort Il which is South of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had an un-obstructed view of the fireworks over a small lake when all of a sudden I observes three bright red glowing circular shaped objects on the South horizon.  The objects rose up and proceeded in a steady speed in a North East direction.  The objects continued to glow from red to yellow and sometimes green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next three hours we saw numerous objects, sometime in formations of three or four and one time in a &#34;V&#34; formation of three and one following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the objects originated from the South and continued in a N/E direction.  At one point, as one of the objects were about to travel directly over us, the object lost its glow and I was able to see the object in a stelth type mode as it went over us.  The object appeared to by fairly l! arge and  looked triangular with rounded edges.  I saw three large circulat shapes in the center of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound and the object continued overhead Northbound. We saw at least 20 to 30 of the same objects during the corse of the night and at another point I observed and videoed what appeared to be one of the objects blow up and split in two. This caused a large bright &#34;explosion&#34; and sparks.<n>

On the evening of July 4th at sunset the wife and I went into the back yard to watch the fireworks and immediately spotted a reddish orange sphere in the sky moving very slowly.  The wife said it was a touring helo giving rides for the fireworks which is common but it was glowing and had no strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After dismissing it, 10 to 15 minutes later,another one appeared taking roughly the same flight path, then another.  They traveled together and seemed to be circling the greater Tulsa city limits on the east side at about the same altitude as a traffic helo or the small Cessna that fly over head most days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any given time until we retired for the evening at least one of these orbs could be seen.  In total I spotted the first one northeast of my location at sunset, then the two in about the same local a bit later, then after dark one to the south, then ten or twenty minutes later one northwest that appeared to be over midtown and lastly before we retired at 2300 hours one or two over the greater Bixby area to the west/southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of them made any sound.  With a small air strip nearby and living near the landing path from the Tulsa International Airport we see lot of air traffic and it ALL makes noise.  Several balls flew fairly close to us, as close as some of the Cessna, so if it was making noise we would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had just taken Astronomy class I had been monitoring the night sky often and I never observed objects like these before or since.<n>

At approximately 17:00:00 we observed what appeared to be a triangular formation of orange lights appearing from the south (S) and heading north (N).  The lights had a orange, flame-like glow and were low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, we found this very disconcerting as we watched this formation slowly drift off to the N.  As the lights vanished out of sight another appeared from the S, this time lower in the sky, and we were able to observe that it was in fact a paper lantern.  I was able to zoom my camera (Nikon Coolpix P510, 42x optical zoom) on the object to confirm it was indeed a paper lantern.  However, I was not able to get a clear photograph of the object due to the difficulty of using autofocus on a moving target.  Approximately 3 - 4 more lanterns were observed moving from the S to N before the 17:30:00 fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home, at approximatel! y 18:00:00, we observed another paper lantern over Greenbrook Ave. in Hanover Park, Il heading from the S to the N.  This was again low enough that we could clearly discern it as a paper lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this because the structure of these objects is hard to discern from a distance, and the initial triangle formation will no doubt be reported several times as a UFO.<n>

At first we thought it was an airplane but as it approached we noticed it had no lights (green and red on the wings).  As it flew over our house we it emitted four points of light out of the front.  The lights extended out in front of the object and came to a distinct end at which point the light became very focused.  These were on for approximately 3-5 seconds.  They turned off as the object continued heading north.  The object was a bright orange and had very fuzzy edges.  Object was much brighter than the ISS and other orbiting objects and was easily the same brightness of Venus in the winter sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Father is 42 - Son is 8.

No sounds were heard that would indicate lightening.  There were no fingerlike arcs seen that would indicate lightening.   Today we leaned that two teenagers in nearby town of San Anselmo told their parents they witnessed similar flashes in sky around 10:30 p.m.  also on July 3rd.   Tomorrow I will call the Mt.

We did not hear any noise emitting from this large sized craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was coming from the South and headed kind of North.  As we watched for about one minute, it appeared to turn to the East towards the BGSU Stadium where the fireworks were being dispatched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it turned we no longer could see the other two lights to the left but only the one which had been on the right of the triangle viewing head on.

As we were talking she said to look up at the shooting star. As I looked up the object did infact look like a shooting star but then it started to glow even brighter and looked like the back end of the object had caught on fire. I quickly got out of my car because the first thought I had was that it was a plane that had caught on fire since we live pretty close to the airport. As I started to pay more attention to the object I realized it was moving at an unbelievable speed. It crossed the sky almost in the blink of an eye. I hurried up and took my phone out and began to video tape it. The way the object cut through the sky was unlike anything Id ever seen before. Then as it began to slow down another bright white object came into view as! well as 3 others. The original object shot up in the sky higher than the others did and just hovered there. Then my eyes shifted to the remaining 4 objects. They started to make a Y formation. One at each end and one at the intersecting point. They stayed in this formation as the other just hovered above them. I believe they were in it for no more than 5 to 8 minutes. As this was happening one of her neighbors stopped on their way home and observed it with us. As we were watching the formation it seemed to come together but my attention was drawn to the top object as it started to drift down towards the ground. We watched it for as long as we could till the tree line covered it. I have never seen anything like this. Not the speed, movements, formation, or the brightness of these objects ever in my life. About 10 minutes after we noticed several airplanes and helicopters in sky in that area as if they were looking for something. I also watched the way those planes and helic! opters moved and their speed. It was not even comparable to ho! w fast a nd smooth those objects moved around the sky. Myself and my friend are both females in our early 20s and have college degrees. We both have serious professionals careers and take what we do serious.  The other observer was probably early 50s and male. He saw most of what we saw too and agreed that it was something that he had never seen before.<n>

I am 43 years old and of sound mind. This was the very first time I witnessed an unidentified flying object.  No idea what it was for certain but I am assuming it was likely a scout vehicle, it was not large enough to be a main ufo craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No idea what was piloting this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my backyard keeping my husband company while he cleaned up his tools after working on our back deck when I saw the object.  My husband did not notice the object as it passed above because he was bent down picking up tools.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought what an odd firecracker flying way to low down, but I quickly realized this object was Not fireworks of any type.  It caught my eye when this bright yellowish-white flying Sphere ball of light with what appeared to be a tail or trail coming out the back of the object, the tail or trail coming from behind this object was not as uniform in shape as the sphere but appeared to be part of it, as it passed right over my house,  It was completely silent and unusually slowly moving (coasting) at a low just above my rooftop level but just below the height of the tallest evergreen tree it flew by heading SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size comparison to a known object for comparison purposes only, this object appeared to be the same size as a large sized Pilates exercise ball, a moving ball of light, the object definitely illuminated the space which surrounded this object.  One of my sons friends local to my area, also witnessed either the same or similar object right around the same time.  She saw it stop flash and pulse several times then leave her sight.<n>

The lights were uniform in color and brightness. Strange movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting Report  On July 3rd, 2013 at approximately 10:30 PM, I was gathered with 4 other family members in Hixson, Tennessee after viewing the fireworks display provided by Camp Columbus.  It was an overcast evening and the display was inspiring.  The flying objects that we could not identify were southwest from our vantage point on the tent camping site 93 of Chester Frost Park. Two were on the same plain of approximately 40 degrees up from the horizon and one was higher at approximately 45 degrees.  The sun had gone down about an hour earlier so it is possible that the objects were reflecting the twilight.  The first thing that appeared odd to me was the uniform brightness.  Their color was also a uniform glowing orange.  There was no reference for distance but it appeared that the higher orb was at a greater distance.  It was stationary but the lower two were closer together and moved erratically as if re-positioning very easily.  I was watching very closely and my son in law was wor! king on getting his phone to take a video.  He could not see the objects on his phone display but he did record video where they might be found on a computer monitor.  I believe that the smoke from the display passed between the lower objects and our perspective but others in our party say that they instantly disappeared.  We all agreed that it seemed that the objects were admiring the fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw 3 bright fireballs in an almost vertical column.  My first thought was this was a firework of some sort, because the orbs were bright and flickering, but then I realized that they were much too high in the sky.  I noticed a normal airplane far off to the right and could compare the difference in movement and lights. I quickly realized I did not understand what I was seeing.  I called my wife over to look.  She too was could not explain what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were viewing in a westerly direction and seeing 3 bright fiery orbs orange/red color in a vertical column moving together, but not 100% synchronized, meaning I could see the distance between the orbs change (but not too drastically).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared much brighter/larger then other lighted objects in the sky.  Also the column was not 100% perfect (at least from my vantage point).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife to take some video with her phone (she did). After about 20 secs, the lights started to dim, but they were still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top 2 appeared to move higher and move very quickly in a north easterly direction.

It looked like it was on fire, but totally contained in a sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear nite with a few low hanging clouds  I was shocked and stood there to witness this object moving across the sky relatively slowly, with absolutly no sound.   There were airplanes in sky at same time with their flashing lights and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I would squint my eyes, the apparent sphere had geometrics to it.  I could literally see the sacred geomety that formed this &#34;craft&#34;  When it would move through the low hanging clouds, it was like a light show was happening.  Red strobe lights moving through clouds.    When not in cloud, there were no strobe lights, just contained orange/red sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across the entire sky, I watched until I couldn&#39;t see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another neighbor came out at same time, asked me if I was seeing this.

It seemed to be quite small, maybe a few feet in diameter.  It stood out because it was much too big to be a planet or a star and did not move like a plane or a helicopter would.  When it when away, it faded very slowly and appeared to ascend further up into the sky.<n>

I live in Crestline, Ohio. As I watched the fireworks display at the local High School from my yard I noticed what I thought was even more fireworks out of the corner of my eye, through the tree limbs and leaves to my right. As the Glow of these extra fire works became more noticeable for some reason, I began to watch them or as it turned out to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a large glowing object with a fluctuating orange semi structured, moving orb like craft. I call it a craft because it was definitely under intelligent control. The object left the obscured view from the trees and leaves and showed itself to be moving slightly slower than a small private plane and as the object entered clear sky after a short light misty rain, an orange spherical like object with a fluctuating tail, resembling a rocket engine exhaust flame, slowly navigated from the eastern sky at maybe 3000 ft about the lower altitude of a small private plane. I estimate the size to be similar to the size of  a small Cessna at that altitude coming from the direction of  north Mansfield, Ohio; as this orange slow comet like object,  with a flickering orange tail approached the center of the village of Crestline the craft made a gentle course correction to due north towards Cleveland from the east to west trajectory the craft had been on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft was directly overhead there was no sound from any jet engine or a prop. In fact there was no sound at all. It seemed to me only a helicopter could go that slowly and not fall out of the sky but there was no pressure wave from any rotors. And helicopters don&#39;t usually glow orange and have a flickering definitely orange tail. This all happened with in the space/time of about 5-7 minutes and the craft gradually and gently increased it&#39;s altitude, disappeared into the northern night sky seemingly on its way to Cleveland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was so unusual it drew my attention to it, I have never seen anything like it in the night sky other than a very distant meteor but meteors do not change course and usually have a bluish cast and remain in one trajectory. I have no idea what this object was. I do think this observation merits reporting because of the uniqueness of the circumstances. Make of it, what you will, perhaps more sightings of this object will come to light near the same date and time and geographical location. For me it will remain a UFO for the time being.

I just didn&#39;t know and still have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around to see if anyone else was out and of course there was no one but me and my little Shit-zu, who could care less and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and as the bright orange/red ball of light traveled it got higher and dimmer until you could finally tell that it was a boomerang shape and the intensity of the color diminished to an amber sort of glow until finally they turned black, but you could still see them flying across the sky, just like you can see a bat in the sky at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3 of them end up flying side by side and I ran to get my camera but by the time I got back outside they were so high and almost gone that they look almost like nothing but a joke, but believe me it&#39;s not a joke and these things were something!<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can only see 2 of them from the picture I was able to get and you can see one is more brighter in color than the other because this is how they went in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I so wish that I would have had my camera on me and been able to take the picture when they first started out because believe me that had my complete and full attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At dusk, we decided to go out onto the lake to watch the annual fireworks display.  There were multiple adults and several children on our boat.  We travelled from the east side of the lake south approximately a few minutes to where the lake intersected with Route 109.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While making our way south, one of the adults noticed 2 lights travelling from the west to east direction across the lake.  These lights took approximately one minute to travel from the west to the east side of the lake.  As we continued to watch these two lights, they seemed to disappear.  We thought there might have been some cloud cover there.  We discussed that the lights seemed a bit strange and that they didn&#39;t make any noise, but chalked them up to released Japanese lanterns.  We continued to head south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing approximately south west, we watched the fireworks display until the sun went down.  We then decided to to head north up the lake and enjoy the smaller fireworks displays.  At this time we witnessed the same lights, traveling in the same direction.  Again, we thought they were odd, but convinced ourselves they must have been two more japanaes lanterns in parallel.  Although as I followed them this time, they disappeared in the same fashion as the other pair, but this time there was what appeared to be a shooting star right in that area.<n>

I have never seen anything like this.  It was very surprising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking east from Tumwater, WA, west of I-5 looking towards the Olympia airport about 25 degrees up from the horizon, I saw a bright flash followed immediately by another bright flash and then nothing.  If it was a meteor it was extremely bright, as I was watching this through my regular vision, without the binoculars or the NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As there was no streak, it would have had to been directly at me if it were a meteor, and based on the brightness, I would assume it would have lasted longer than the second that it took to make two flashes that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately afterward, I grabbed! my NV and there was nothing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with this flash, and no sound following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say I saw anything beyond just the flash, but it was definitely interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very skeptical by nature, I would not have written this report unless it was something that I felt I couldn&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a report last night, and after I reported it, I learned about satellite iridium flaring.

Traveled toward us along highway 62.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it left the field of view in our windshield, we immediately pulled over and it should have been directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With a full view of the sky, the craft was no longer in sight.<n>

I figured it was a plane, but all of sudden it changed size from pencil eraser to like a dime, and changed colors to red on top, and blue on bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound to be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something like a red/white light or flair shone out of the bottom toward the ground.  Almost instantly, it did a weird s-type turn to the upper right and the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking at the sky, and in about 15 to 30 seconds it reappeared to the right of where I originally saw it, about dime size, red on top, blue on bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to get some friends in the house to come out to see it, but by the time we all looked back at the sky, it was gone.  We watched watched the area in the sky for about 15/20 minutes but never saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next hour, off and on, I looked at the sky, but it never re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what it was, but it was not like anything I&#39;ve seen.  Its movements were very fast and strange.<n>

It was about the speed of a passing comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came into view overhead and flew at a 30 degree trajectory coming from the Atlantic Ocean and continued between Port Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a mild to moderate overcast at that time which did make it difficult to see the object clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself illuminated the overcast clouds as it passed, you could see that the object was glowing white (almost with a welding light&#39;s intensity) with a bluish aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no tail of light or streaking as is common with comets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the light was egg-like with more defined indentions.  I know that Patrick AFB is close by and since this was a vacationing trip my knowledge about the area is limited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing on Cocoa Beach in front of the Royal Mansions hotel facing port Canaveral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes after we saw the object we saw a commercial flight passing by heading towards the Atlantic ocean.<n>

The object stopped and then descended into a grove of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later I had just started my radio show when my son in-law called me out to the patio. The patio faced north.  We saw an object, red in color (no other colors), a solid red that traveled about a third of the distance of the east/west plane then it blinked out for about two seconds and then resumed its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued until it had traversed about half of the east/west plane and it disappeared (blinked out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son in-law informed me that these sightings are quite common in Abu Gosh.<n>

You could see that it was an equilateral object.  It made a noise but not like a hum and not like a plane that would fly overhead on it&#39;s way to Sea-Tac Airport.  It was flying above the trees and my big dog and I watched it fly behind my neighbors trees going North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Holding my thumb out at a 45 degree angle, the object was bigger than my thumb.  It is currently 59 degrees out, clear, warm and it was light out.  I did take pictures of the shy afterwards when I went back in to get my phone<n>

There is no building there nor tower.  It is also unlikely to be a star(s) because of their luminosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights that were visible remained stationary and I believe blinked occasionally for 12 minutes starting at 23:40 and ending at 23:52, roughly.

The time was approximately 23:35 and the sky was dark. Wind speed was below five miles per hour and the temperature was approximately 56 degrees Fahrenheit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was witnessed north of town for approximately one minute before fading and disappearing.  The second was witnessed southeast of town, and it traveled in a northwest direction and faded out of sight to the northwest of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were silent and traveled at a speed consistent with an aircraft flying at a medium altitude.  They appeared to be disk-shaped with orange flames on the topside of these disks.  When these objects flew directly over our location, the flames were no longer visible from the bottom portion, but the glow could be seen through these disks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other lights or objects were noted.<n>

It was lower and closer but got further away and then came back towards me disappearing again…<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did catch this one on my camera, but it was wierd cause this one was more to the right of me over the hill and as I was recording it my husband points out another one at the top of our trailer court..

7/1/13 22:00|Arabi|GA|Chevron|2 minutes|Pair of very low flying objects for the third time|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99559.html|965|ndxe201307| Pair of very low flying objects for the third time<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 10 and 10:30 pm. on 7/01/13 I went outside to see why my dogs were barking. They had  a cat cornered in the yard.  So, I put them in the house and went back out to check on the cat.  I heard a noise coming from over towards the west side of the house (I live out in the country and the neighbors on that side are out of site from the front of the house).  I stepped away from the house and looked over there just in time to see the first object before it went behind my house  and behind my tree line.  It was a dull dark color and I didn&#39;t see any lights on that one, but it had a slight illumination.  A couple of seconds later another one comes by following the same path.  It was also dark colored but it had one red light and one blue light on the back.  One on top the other on the bottom, I think. Then it was out of site, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went over to the other side of the house to see if I could see them but all I could see were the lights from the second one through the trees. They were very, very low.  I half expected to hear a big crash.  It sounded like only one combined sound. It sounded like a very muted jet engine, kinda like a whine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen jets (not this low!), crop dusters, helicopters and even military copters around here over the years and this isn&#39;t any of those.  However, this is the third time I&#39;ve had something fly over really low, always in pairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time was April 27, 2011, again it was late.  It was getting ready to storm and I was on my porch talking on the phone with my sister, (Bad storms scare us and I&#39;m the family alert system if there may be tornadoes).  I was facing west when I heard something and turned towards the east.  It was right there over my side yard heading right over my porch. It was maybe 30-40 ft. away when I heard it.  I said the impolite version of &#34;OH, SHOOT!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister thought something was happening weather wise and shes trying to ask me whats going on.  She said it sounded like heavy wind and rain to her. It was the same sound as those last night, a kind of whine, like a very muted jet engine.  It was just a few seconds and it was over me.  It was so low that I think if I were standing on top of the house I could&#39;ve about touched it.  I really thought it was going to crash into my house.  I didn&#39;t see any lights but it was slightly illuminated.  Then a second one was flying! over my barn in the field in front of my house.  Again it only seemed like one sound but I don&#39;t know if only one was making noise or if it just seemed to run together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one I saw pretty clear, if very quickly.  It was maybe 30 ft. wide and  rounded on the front. There was a slight dome on top.  I would&#39;ve said it looked like the movie type flying saucer if I had only seen the front, but then the sides kinda rounded to a point in the back. As it was going over me is when I noticed the second one over the barn, so that took my attention for a second.  When I looked back towards the west (they were flying east to west) it was about to the tree line on the other side of that neighbors yard.  I saw the back for just a second.  I think the first one had a single, wide white light coming out the back but it seemed more like it was from an engine than a light.  I can&#39;t say much about the second one, the first one took most of my attention.  They were flying really close together and extremely low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day (28th) the capacitor went out on our well and the following night (29th) the capacitor went out on our central heat and air unit.  Also, about a month later my husband went to turn on the window unit in the tack room of the barn and it wouldn&#39;t work either.  So, if it&#39;s some kind of government thing I wish they&#39;d refund me the $400 plus it cost us! And that they would quit flying so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time was in late April 2012. I&#39;m not sure of the date and I didn&#39;t really get a look at them.  I was in the house and I heard them go over the back side of the house.  Again roughly east to west and very low, right over the tree line.  I ran out the front and just caught a glimpse of the back lights or whatever they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what they are.<n>

It looked brighter than anything I normally see in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I called my two neighbors over and we all examined it through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 minutes it started sliding away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call and report this to your company on the same night (July 1), and was told to call back the next night but did not observe the bright light the following night because of dark clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also an incident near here in 1948, where two pilots were sent to check out a UFO but they never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I noted this to my friend but I was confused as they did not track on the water and suddenly went in two directions, in fact they crossed land and appeared to be about 50-100 feet in the air.  They light was like a glowing orange fireball.  There was no notice as we listened for a helicopter or plane sound.  One light appeared to descend the suddenly in a flat way head to the northwest of the bay were are in and disappear out of view to the NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 2 we discussed what we saw and a friend of mine posted on Facebook an image she took the night of July 1 and it was exactly what we saw.  She is located in Orilia Ontario.  A fellow boater stopped at our boat and asked we saw the strange light, he describe he saw 3 with similar activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.

From atop our building&#39;s roof deck we observed this sphere move south above Puget Sound at a relatively low speed and at various heights.  At the time of evening aviation lights would have been easily seen, but we saw none from this object. It did not flash, glow, or display any light or give off any sound.  We are very familiar with aircraft as Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is located nearby, Boeing is local, and sea planes and other small craft are a fixture in our skies as they come and go from our many bodies of water.  We observed commercial and light aircraft with appropriate aviation lighting at the same time as the event, all clearly identifiable.  When we attempted to photograph the sphere, our cameras would not focus on the object, thus a black blur is all that is observable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The 2 half orbs would then rotate around one another in a clockwise motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to rotate into the sky for over an hour.  The object continued into the sky until it was a tiny black dot.

7/1/13 00:00|Pullman|WA||unk|No cognitive memory of abduction, but physical signs of abduction.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102062.html|979|ndxe201307| No cognitive memory of abduction, but physical signs of abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had sightings, strange happenings, extremely bad relationships, and various other abnormal occurrences in the past. I am 59 years old, of Irish descent with assorted physical ailments. I come from a military family, with my maternal grandfather having possible ties to CIA and other extraordinary facts about him. Since the beginning of July 2013, we have had more obvious signs that something is going on while we sleep. My boyfriend is adamantly against any of the theories I have about what is going on, but that could be his mind control. My mind control (for lack of a better term) seems to be fracturing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of July 1, 2013 I woke up feeling more exhausted than usual. While going to the restroom, I noticed a triangular shaped (series of dots) bruise on my thigh, just above the right knee. Thinking that it was curious to have that shape there, I took pictures of my leg. I will email those to you along with other pictures referenced later. About a week later, I had one on my other leg, same shape and same size, and was more toward the inside of my thigh, but I didn’t take pictures of that one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wake up with various bruising and that sort of thing, but never think that much about it. These things are coming to be more frequent and definitely more blatant. On the morning of August 18, 2013, I woke up to having a very bloodshot (left) eye. I am emailing pictures of that as well. It feels like I have something in my eye, even after it has appeared to heal. I also had small bruises and a strange series of puncture holes in a crescent shape on the top of my left thigh (adding pictures).  Last year, I can’t give you a date, but sometime before September 2012, I woke up to a feeling like there was something in my left ear. My boyfriend has looked in the ear, but doesn’t see anything.It still bothers me sometimes. I find it more than coincidental that this is my left thigh (crescent shaped puncture wound), left ear and left eye. I have not been to a doctor for several reasons. I don’t have insurance, I don’t like doctors, and I am afraid of what they might think and what ! they will do to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, August 31, 2013, one of our American Bulldogs who sleeps in our bedroom woke us up at about 4 am in a panic. She is 110 lbs. and was attempting to hide behind the nightstand, and panting. We took her to the emergency vet, and they have found nothing wrong with her. We are in the process of running more tests to rule out physical problems. That is when I decided to do more research, look for investigators, support groups, etc. Whatever has been happening, is now affecting my animals, and that is not okay. They cannot speak for themselves and I have no memories of anything, so I need to find out. I am very determined to do so, I am finding it difficult to find anyone locally… If you can help, I would so appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
