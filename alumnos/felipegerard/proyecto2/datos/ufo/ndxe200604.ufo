4/30/06 23:30|Dana|IN|Triangle|3 Seconds|Triangular shaped object with 3 lights.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50397.html|1|ndxe200604| Triangular shaped object with 3 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of 043006 at around 11:30 PM I was setting in my back yard in my hot tub with my girl friend watching the stars. We do this a lot as we love to look at the stars. On this evening the sky was very cloudy and the cloud cover was low. I was somewhat windy as well. I noticed in the eastern sky three lights that look as though they were in a triangular pattern. The colors of the lights were, red, green and yellow. What caught my eye was that as this shape moved through the cloud you could see the cloud being displaced and the cloud sort of shimmering over the haul of the object. The angle from my position to the objects was approximately 60 degree&#39;s. The object looked to approximately 250 to 300&#34; feet above the surface. I observed that the object was moving slow and banked up and right. There was no sound. It seemed to me that as this object entered the cloud it became somehow visible, I must say that I know this all sounds fantastic, but this is how it seemed. The object was very large for any air craft I have seen. I would say possibly 100 yards across and 45&#34; thick. That is a guess. It moved very gracefully, almost like a fish would move in the water. After it passed through the cloud it was no longer visible. My girlfriend unfortunately did not see it, but supports my sighting. When it was visible in the cloud you could see the cloud shimmering over the haul. I know this sounds crazy, but I swear I seen this. I would like to discuss this with someone who might know what this object was. I am not after publicity or notoriety. I have always been skeptical of these sort of sightings until now. I will say now this was the most awesome sight I have ever seen in my life. I hope to hear from you on this. Thank-you Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

It was really moving...mach 20 minimum.  Just flew over very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching the sky for 30 years to see something like this.  It was awesome, no sound, perfect formation, simply unreal.  I hope someone else in the Sacamento area saw this as I want some verification.

I belive the star I sometimes watch is more to the Southwest, so it caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly after thinking this, I observed the object to move extreamly rapid for the distance it appeared to be from our position (I am an air traffic controller, so I am aware of &#34;normal&#34;, or fighter jet aircraft movment.).  I closed my eyes, and shook my head a little to focus on the object to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me, and it continued to move rapidly, change directions instantly, and stop in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my soldier over to confirm if it was acually moving, and he confirmed. As we watched;  another couple of minutes past, and over the tower radio frequency (Our facility monitors the control towers radios.)  I heard a broken transmission from what sounded like a pilot that said &#34;...yea, it&#39;s a triangle...&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tower came over the frequency, and told the transmitter to &#34;check freq.&#34;, which means your transmitting over our frequency, and your not supposed to.  If anyone who&#39;s reading this knows anything about aviation radio language, there is nothing anywhere about any triangle that would need to be transmitted to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the object, using a fixed object placed in my line of sight just below it to ensure myself my eyes weren&#39;t tricking me after starring at this thing for a while. It contiued moving irratically, and moving in the same area in the sky for about 30 minutes, and then seemingly dissapeared. It was to far away to make out a shape, but it appeared that depending on the direction of movement, it was emitting different colors (Perhaps different colors on different sides of the object, and depending on what side was facing me; it would show the other colors?) I KNOW, this was not a star.<n>

It started to make very large turns to the East and West, hovered a few times a then shot across the sky and out of sight almost instantanious. I was watching the object and my three year old son noticed it on his own. There was a military transport flying East to West at the time, leaving a contrail at ~10-15,000 ft.

This last April while out field testing  equipment  I noticed a commercial jet liner go overhead. This wasn’t unusual  for this area because Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is only 40 miles away. This is a well known flight path for jets on approach to Sky Harbor. A short time after seeing the jetliner go by I happen to glance up.  I noticed a black object had appeared between the contrails of the jetliner a was following it. It followed the jetliner for a short period of time and disappeared. I happened to have Kodak  Z740 Camera handy, which has a pretty  good zoom and was able to get one photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out my living room window that faces East. From this window I can see a bit N, NE, E, and SE. As I turned my gaze to look in the SE direction, I saw something quite bright, large, and moving very fast suddenly appear. It came from the SW direction heading East from my window view. It was at a 35 to 45 degree angle from where I was, and flying LOWER than what the helicopters or small planes do in this area. This object moved much too fast and silent to be man-made. When it first came into my view, I thought &#34;Wow! A shooting star!&#34; But as I watched it, I realized it was too big, and too low in the sky and flying horizontally - this was not a comet or star. Also it had a defined “shape” to it. There were NO flames, contrails, or light streaks coming from behind this object. It had an intense yellow-white glow around the diamond shaped object. I could also see something faint and darker, in the middle of the object as shown in drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did report this immediately to another web site along with a drawing of it here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2006/pdxor04302006/pdxor04302006.htm  I just found out from reading NUFORC&#39;s web site that others may have seen this same object as well. So I thought I should also submit my report to NUFORC for this reason.<n>

I could not tell the altitude, but would guess it to be no more than 10,000 AGL.  Thought they might be planes or helicopters but there was no noise and no blinking.  They moved with such percision.  They moved in formation for a while and then took off to the West one by one at an unbelievable speed.  I could not tell what the shapes of the objects were but they put off enough light so we could see them.  We thought they had left and then suddenly they reappered in the same general location 10 minutes later.  This time only 2 were seen.  Both of the objects were  stationary while one of them suddenly flew away from the other at an incredible speed and then suddenly stopped all in the matter of seconds.  Then the object that distanced itself from the other flew very slowly to the north and then began dropping stuff.  It made a slight popping noise, almost looking like and sounding like a firecracker.  The stuff that it dropped seemed to disappear with in seconds after it released it. After this it hoverred for about 30 seconds then suddenly took off back to the West.  I lost sight of the stationary object also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have never seen anything like it, and it gave us all the chills.  Didn&#39;t believe in such a thing till now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date to Sunday morning, April 30, 2006, at 00:15 hrs.  PD))<n>

I was looking up and noticed what I thought may have been an owl at first flying low and close to street lights.  The reason I thought that was because the light given off was a golden or light orange color.  Then I realized the figure was up higher and moving faster.  I thought it was a plane but it had no blinking red or green lights.  By this time my friend was looking on.  We both notice how fast it was moving though it was not streaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My freind said it looked like it had a bar of lights on the underneath side of the craft.  I would resemble it to a flying wing that was completely illuminated on the underside with its lights having partioning lines between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared so large at first that I thought it could have been an owl perhaps 50 yards away illuminated by street lights.  This thing just kept on going and was out of site much more quickly than a plane that stared out looking that big. The direction it was flying in was southwest.  It disappeared within a span of 15 seconds. Again, it appeared to have the shape of a flying wing or just a bank of lights like a somewhat rectangular thing flying with the wide side forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a wedge of migratory birds would first have to be ruled out, before it could be concluded that the witnesses observed a genuine UFO.

Venus was up in the southern sky and there were no sighting opportunities for the international space station. I could not see any military jets, commercial planes, or helicopters (they would have the flashing or strobe lights in the night sky). Conditions were light hazy skies to the horizons with views of constellations above. I saw four red lights moving north to south at a slow speed. The lights traveled in pairs of two. In each pair, one red light angled higher than the other spaced by a degree or two, followed by a larger space (up to 5 degrees), and then followed by the other pair of two. These two pairs of lights did not break their formation and continued south until they vanished from sight. They were as bright as Venus and seem to be around 10 thousand feet. As I was viewing these four objects come and go another pair of two red lights were slowing moving north to south above in or around downtown Portland. These two did seem to slow down couple times or at least move to the west. I viewed this pair for a couple minutes before vanishing in the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no objects or lights emitted, no sound, no vapor trail, did not change colors.

They kept moving and then seemed to stop (still over south downtown) and did not move until their lights just seemed to go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these objects for at least ten minutes outside of my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports of apparently the same event.

Everyday I look out the window and try to figure out where exactly this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, here&#39;s what you have asked me for:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  my home address is ((address deleted)).  The rear of my apartment faces southwest.  I have a clear view of downtown Portland from this direction.  I am also to see the West Hills from my windows.  I only saw two lights and I have narrowed the vicinity of downtown to above the Brewery blocks (between N.W. 11th and N.W.  13th and N.W.  Burnside and N.W.  Davis streets).  It traveled very slowly, gliding almost, east past the USBancorp tower (between 5th and 6th avenue and Burnside) just passing it (but higher than the building, which is 470 feet approximately).  About three blocks after the tower it slowly turned south.  It continued for I would say a mile to a mile and a half.  The lights were still very clear, just a little faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The angle of the lights was about 60 degrees.  These lights lasted about ten minutes or so in duration, without breaking or flashing.  These lights were amber in hue, but as I really studied them, I noticed that one of the lights might have been more red (I believe that there were three lights in a very small cluster).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was with me at the time, and he will be filing an individual report this week.  We both stood there and watched these and discussed what it might be.  I guess we were trying to rationalize what we were seeing above a major metropolitan area.  Nothing made sense, nor does now.  They could have very easily been attached in some way though, for moving that slow, with absolutely no sound.  It is very quiet where I live, so we can hear anything flying in the sky.  There is a helipad five blocks away and we can hear them for a good ten to twelve blocks.  Especially that night, it was late in the evening and our building was silent.

4/29/06 23:50|Portland|OR|Changing|15-20 minutes|I saw at least six bright glowing, orange in color objects in the sky over the city of Portland on Saturday night, 4-29-06.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50381.html|18|ndxe200604| I saw at least six bright glowing, orange in color objects in the sky over the city of Portland on Saturday night, 4-29-06.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my car and coming into Downtown Portland from the 405 Freeway. I was heading to take the Couch St./Burnside St. Exit. Just before I approached the exit, I noticed to my left in the sky at about a forty five degree angle two very bright, orange in color objects. One was at a complete standstill. There was another object, closely approaching very slowly as if to meet up with the object standing still. It came from the south. When it reached the first object it then was at a standstill with the first object. Then coming from the North, a little farther left from the two objects that were at a stand still, was another object which looked exactly the same as the first two. As it neared the first two objects, the first two objects started to move away very, very slowly to the south as the third object was heading closer to them from the north. I noticed an airplane, which came from the north and heading south near the now, three objects. I couldn&#39;t tell if the airplane was going to fly under the objects or just near them.  I also wasn&#39;t sure if the airplane was flying towards them to check them out or if it was just there coincidentally at the time.  The airplane was smaller than a passenger airplane and looked to be flying considerably low. I could see the lights and the shape of this craft and it definitely was an airplane. The other objects were not like this airplane at all. The objects looked like they were a little higher than the airplane. I really can&#39;t say how high the plane or objects were. The plane flew past the objects that were heading south.  Then I noticed a fourth object coming from the north just behind the third object as I took the Couch St Exit and turned left onto Couch St. heading east. I followed the four objects as they were heading in a S/SE direction. I was still heading east on Couch St. The four objects were flying very, very slowly now to my right at about a forty five degree angle.  I came to a stop sign on Couch and I looked directly up from my front windshield at about a 90 degree angle and noticed two more objects directly above my car. They were bright, orange in color objects that appeared to be fiery, or on fire. I really tried to get a focus on them, but could only notice the glow and haze which seemed to be in motion, almost like a candle’s flickering. The two objects were at a stand still. I know this because I was at a complete stop, too.  About one minute later the two objects proceeded very, very slowly to the S/SE. They also started to change in size of glow. They got smaller and then bigger again as they headed S/SE.   When they got smaller they looked more like stars.  The other four objects had  just left my view as I noticed the two objects that were directly above me.   A few blocks down I came to another stop.  I kept waving to cars on my right to continue after their stop as I was at a four way stop.  Me and my two friends were watching the four earlier objects as they moved slowly, S/SE above a  white building that had  some  radar like items and other things on top of the building.  The objects looked like they were much higher than the building as their glow got smaller as they moved S/SE.  We were at this stop sign watching for about three minutes or so.  Then we proceeded down Couch street to NW Broadway and along the way would still notice the objects as they headed S/SE.  I turned right at NW Broadway and headed into a parking lot that used to be a Burger King and my friend called 911.  They gave her the phone number to the UFO Center.  I called the UFO Center in Washington State and gave my report.  As I gave my report I was watching the last two objects  that at one point was right above my car, fly off in the distance heading S/SE.  They looked like two stars flying away in the distance with one on top of the other.  They looked to be about an inch apart as they drifted still very, very slowly and then eventually fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.

4/29/06 23:50|Portland|OR|Changing|15/20 minutes|First time ever seeing these types of glowing objects!!|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50432.html|19|ndxe200604| First time ever seeing these types of glowing objects!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the backseat of my friends car when I witnessed two of the glowing objects. My friend was exiting Couch Street and that was when she called my attention and another friends attention to the out if the ordinary view outside. When she called my attention, I could see the objects but now there were four of them. The objects were orange and glowing at the same time and they were at a complete stop. But then they all started to move S/SE. They were moving very slowly. As my friend turned left on NW Couch street, she slowed down to get a better look at them. She kept on going straight and on about 14th and Couch Street, she came to a complete stop. All three of us that were in the car were able to get a better view of the glowing objects. They were two more directly above the car. I noticed two of them. They were at a complete stop for about a minute or so. Then the objects started moving S/SE following the previous four objects. They were moving very slowly as if drifting. They were glowing orange, but it was hard to see any definite shape. The glow was in slow motion. One of the objects got smaller and then bigger again. After they started to move S/SE, we proceeded E on Couch to 10th street. On 10th street, we were at a three way stop. Four of the objects were above a white building. We watched them for at least three minutes. We proceeded E to NW Broadway were we turned right into an abandoned building&#39;s parking lot. My friend in the passenger seat called 911. They told her to call the UFO center in Wa State. The driver of the car called the UFO center and made a report. I watched the objects at this point, but they faded away as they were headed S/SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.  PD))<n>
4/29/06 23:50|Portland|OR|Changing|20 minutes|Six fiery, glowing objects, some at a standstill, then all six of them moved very slowly over the city of Portand, Oregon.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50356.html|20|ndxe200604| Six fiery, glowing objects, some at a standstill, then all six of them moved very slowly over the city of Portand, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First there were two of them. One of them was at a complete standstill as the other approached. When the one caught up with the first one, another appeared from the left and headed toward the two which were now both at a standstill.  As the third one neared the first two, all three objects started and maintained a very, very slow flight pattern. The first two were now going the same way they had come before the third one finally caught up. We followed all three and then noticed a fourth one appear from the left and it finally caught up with the other three objects which appeared to be heading south. They all looked like bright orange glowing objects. They almost appeared to be on fire. They looked like big stars. They got smaller, then bigger, and then smaller again.  As we followed the four objects we had to stop at a stop sign. We looked up and directly above our car there were two more of them. We could still see the first four to our right as they were still flying very slowly.  The two above our car were at a complete standstill.  About one minute later, they then started towards the direction of the first four and moved very, very slowly. We followed them as they appeared to be heading in a SE direction like the first four. At first they were glowing like big stars and then got smaller.  One looked like it was above the other as they left slowly in the distance. We first started seeing at least two of the objects as we were going to take the Couch St/Burnside exit from the 405. We took the exit and went left.  This took us to Couch St. We followed the objects all the way down Couch St to Broadway. We then took a right and parked in a lot to see the final two as they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.  PD))<n>
4/29/06 23:45|La Center|WA|Formation|2 minutes|Pairs of bright amber lights over Portland moving in formation|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52463.html|21|ndxe200604| Pairs of bright amber lights over Portland moving in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before midnight I went outside into my backyard.  It was a clear night, and I was looking to the South, when I noticed an unusual amount of what I first thought was aircraft activity over Portland lining up for approach at PDX.  Then I realized that I&#39;ve never quite seen so many aircraft in the air at once, and that if it was part of practice for an airshow or military maneuvers, it was a bit too late at night.  Even if they were conventional aircraft, they were spaced much to closely together to be on any sort of landing approach to Portland International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were amber in color, about twice as bright as the stars, and numbered in 6 or 7 pairs.  From my perspective, they were about 10 degrees off the horizon, and each pair of lights were coupled at a 45 degree angle from each other.  Each pair was separated from the next by about an inch at arm&#39;s length.  The entire assembly of lights seemed to be in formation, keeping the same spacial relationship from the others the entire time.  The group of lights formed a slight arc that was lower in elevation at the east end.  The group of lights moved in unison to the southeast, losing elevation until out of sight below the treeline that makes up the horizon from my vantage point.  At times the lights seemed to shimmer a bit, but that very well have been due atmospheric distortion due to their proximity to the horizon and the (apparent) distance involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my wife and son to come take a look.  My wife scoffs at any mention of UFOs, so I wouldn&#39;t alert her to it unless it was very clearly odd.  My son (7 years old) made it out first, and viewed the lights with me.  My wife didn&#39;t make it out for several minutes, and by the time she arrived outside the lights had dropped below the trees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often can see lights from aircraft taking off and landing at PDX and Vancouver airstrips - in fact they appear at the very same spot on the horizon where the lights in question were.  Planes always appear as a white and red flashing light, and these were simply glowing amber lights, much different and brighter than the normal aircraft lights.  In fact, at the time of the sighting, a plane with &#34;normal&#34; plane lights passed amidst the lights from my line of sight, and stood out clearly as it moved through the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just now submitting this because I just visited this site and noticed the request for reports to be submitted on this subject.  I originally dismissed the event because, after looking for it on the news sites the next day, I didn&#39;t see any report of it, and thought perhaps I was overreacting to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be happy to take a picture from my vantage point and edit in the lights with Photoshop to send to you, if you wish.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From SW direction appeared 4 &#34;fireballs,&#34; or circular/spherical shaped lights of orange/ gold. They were all the same size(about 4 times the size of large visible planet) and moving at the same speed (slower than low airplane) in a loosely formed line. They were about 1/2 to 3/4 less bright than an airplane headlight, but soft and diffused, almost fuzzy at edges. They were not flashing but barely pulsating with no pattern, and there was no sound. We really had no sense of how far away they were or how big, it was impossible to distinguish. They were heading NE then took a wide turn towards SE. They appeared to be directly over downtown area. After their turn they slowed to a stop, and stayed without moving for a few minutes, then they slowly began to get smaller/ fade. They still were not moving, unless exactly away from us (I lined them up with a building to check for motion. One dissapeared quicker then the others, and before the others did also, two more lights, exactly the same size, color shape, speed, appeared from the SE in the exact spot as the first group, and continued along the same &#34;path&#34; and dissapeared where the others had. Other people on the street saw them too, but only one other person stopped to watch them with our group of three. The entire sighting lasted about 8- 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports from residents of Portland.  PD))<n>

We then saw it stop.  After a few minutes it developed a ring and started to change shape.  A few minutes later it changed shape and smaller objects with blinking lights began to emerge.  It seemed to change shape at least three times, not unlike a jellyfish.  Near the end of the sighting it seemed to disappear and reappear a few times.  We watched this object for between 20 to 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We sat down, and were looking at the stars. My husband was teasing me, saying &#34;Hey, remember that time you thought you saw aliens?&#34; and as I was defending what I had seen months earlier, and  he said &#34;Holy shit, look at that!&#34; I looked up and there was a disk, that was illuminated very slightly green, though there were no lights visible. It took about 15 seconds to pass over us and disappear out of our sight. A few minutes later, there was a second disk, exactly like the first. About half an hour later, another formation flew over head. It looked almost like a small grouping, flying in a formation. There were maybe 6 or so, flying closely together in a wavy line. Less than a minute later, there was another small grouping, this time flying in the shape of a triangle. These last two were dark in color, not illuminated at all. We could only see them because they were darker than the sky. The last one came at about 11:15pm, it was another disk like the first two. All 5 of the UFOs that we saw came from the same direction (S, SW), and headed the exact same direction (N, NE). It was a clear night, and it seems like just before or just after they flew overhead, the sky flashed with lightening, though there were no lightening bolts. All of the &#39;lightening&#39; was coming from about the same direction as the UFOs were heading. This experience is one of the most incredible. Even my husband, who is a skeptic of all things supernatural couldn&#39;t believe it. This is the first experience of its kind for both of us. We plan to spend much more time on our deck during the night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other sighting reports for this time and date from Portland, OR.  PD))<n>

The light was much brighter than any other stars.  Upon further inspection we noticed that the light was actually emitting several different colors (gold, blue, green red etc).  The craft was set fairly low in the sky.  It was stationary for approximately ten minutes.  After that the craft dropped down below the treeline across the street.  We followed the light to Lewis Bay to further observe the light.  The light continued to move very slowly accross the sky towards the open ocean.  We reported this event to the local police (non-emergency) number.  The police responded and by their own account, the officer that responded to the call saw another strange light in the sky.  After that we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At 1st I thought is was a seagul but it never flapped it&#39;s wings. No sounds or air stream. 5 minutes later I saw a plane flying the same path also with no sound or stream and I must say that it almost looked like the 1st 3 objects I saw. So now I&#39;m not sure about what I saw but will post this anyway just in case someone else saw what I discribed at the same time. Thank you<n>

His sighting appear to be the same as mines being that they saw 3 object heading east with two crafts flying together while the 3rd was a bit apart (in my case 2 ships apart and trailing 10 seconds behind. What I would like to know is if the crafts that Vancouver saw was traveling horizontal to earth or at an angle as most pitures and drawings that we see of triangle crafts. Because I originaly reported it as a cigar shape but what if what I saw was a side profile of the triangle, like seeing the rim of a book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ****  note **** The skies were still blue at 19:30 about 1/2 hour away from sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vancouver, WA to Brooklyn, NY is 3000 miles apart. WA reported it at 13:55 (PDT) that&#39;s 15:55 (EST). I made my report at 19:30 (EST).  If it is possible that we seen the same 3 craft then it must have travled at the speed of 1000 MPH to reach my area in 3 hours +.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object came in from the horizon at 260 deg SW flew at the closest point over my house I ran from the back yard to the front ( 60&#39; ) just to see it come out from over my house and head NE at 80 deg toward Long Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated in a previous post, after the sightings, I veiwed a commericial jet plane ( close enough where you know it&#39;s a plane but can&#39;t tell what airline and about the same size as the crafts) flew over the same path at about the same speed it took the crafts to reach and pass over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if a plane cruises about the speed of 500 MPH and the craft travels at 1000 MPh and they both took about the same time to cross over my house then is it possible that that crafts were twice the size of a jumbo and were flying twice as high giving the illusion that it was the sze of a jumbo and needed to travel more distace then a plane to cross over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But there were two tiny dots in the sky about anywhere from 5.000 to 20.000 feet. But the two little dots I saw in the sky were moving. I was looking to the northwest and saw these little dots in the sky then they went under a cloud and I lost sight of them. I kept looking and couldn&#39;t see them no more.

Time 13:55-14:05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overview:  Shortly after finishing an outdoor lunch with my wife and son, my son noticed something in the sky and asked me what they were.  I looked up to the sky in the direction he was pointing.  What I saw were three triangle shaped black objects moving very slowly across the sky in a easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my wife, who had taken a few dishes into the house, to hurry outside and take a look at these things.  My wife came outside, looked up to where my son and I were looking and also observed the three flying objects.  My son ran into the house and brought out our digital camera but said that he could not find the objects in the view-finder of the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran into the house to get our binoculars but could not find them so I returned outside, and together we observed the black triangles drift across the the sky untill they entered the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facts:   We observed the objects for about ten minutes from 13:55 to 14:05 local time (PDT).  The objects were triangle in shape, and black in color with no lights observed.  They were moving in a kind of formation (two close together and the other one by itself).  We did not hear any sound coming from the at all.  Sky cover was completly overcast with a cumulo-stratus cloud layer at about 3000 to 3500 feet above ground level.

The contrail, formed by unevenly-spaced pulses, quickly dissipated. Could not see the eastbound aircraft itself with the naked eye. Estimate that it was flying higher than crosscountry jetliners, which appear to move slowly across the sky at cruising altitude. Initially saw the contrail of this object as it moved directly overhead. It disappeared in the distance with amazing speed. Viewing location was somewhat noisy so cannot report any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He came outside with me and witnessed these two objects hovering in the north sky. After about 30 seconds of staring at these objects one disappeared from the sky. As we watched the other object in the sky, we saw what looked like bright flashes underneath the object. It appeared as if it was being shot at by something because of the loud explotion noise we heard. After about 30 seconds, the object slowly faded away as if it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Even though very bright it did not hurt to look at it. there was a tear drop shape about20ft.x20ft.x10ft. in the middle of the bottom. After about 40 minutes it slowly left heading south.

Maybe 2-3 degrees above true horizon. I moved my head back and forth to try to catch a better glimpse through the trees. The light remained constantly bright, was stationary and seemed to be very far away, however was quite large, if I were to measure it with my thumb at arms length,  about the tip of the thumb to the first joint. It disappeared behind the trees. It was definitely not an airplane. The lights were the same color as red lights on top buildings, but it was not flashing at all, and no buildings exist in that direction tall enough to be seen.

I could see an outline of grayish color around its black colored form, I don&#39;t know if this was a haze / aura thing or just where it could be seen apart from the background of space. There were only two actual planets which could be seen that night which were clearly planets and were far to the right, the exact opposite direction of this object (I was pointed out this by my stepfather). My stepfather went and got his telescope on my brother&#39;s request and one of his hobbies is astrology and even he didn&#39;t know what it was. We all looked at it, me with my binoculars and a few times with the telescope, my brother and stepfather mostly the telescope. My stepfather suggested it might be debris in space relfecting light or something but also said he really didn&#39;t know but my brother and me sort of thought it was something manufactured as my brother said once or twice it was &#34;...weird because the lights are perfectly and evenly spaced out.&#34; That and it had changed it&#39;s position. I have seen similar objects in the night sky in the same position times before but no one has listened to me or bothered to look with me until last night. The object we saw the night I described was a rectangular black object with round edges and a light gray outline with three evenly spaced lights in the middle which turned on and off from right to left continuously and the object was some distance off in space as to see the details better a pair of binoculars and a telescope were needed. I drew an image that closely resembles what we saw in windows paint.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During the first part of the observation the group of lights passed through a portion of the sky that was brightly illuminated vertically by the exterior lights of a nearby large hotel and resulted in causing the lights to appear to shimmer (similar to atmospheric distortion) as they crossed the cone of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects observed for a duration of approximately 45 seconds (from 90 degrees to approximately 45 degrees above the horizon)  Group intensity faded uniformly as objects moved in a Northerly direction until no longer visible  Approximately 3-4 minutes later a solo object (similar point of light but intensity 2-3 orders of magnitude lower) followed same track as first group but at a somewhat higher speed.  Object disappeared within approximately 10-15 seconds  Observer (author) has Masters degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering with experience in orbital vehicles and orbital mechanics and is a sworn peace officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very strange..it looked better in person.  However in the video I have attached ...The light from the sun setting is being altered at the bottom of the Triangle.  You can see a very solid horizontal line parallel to the water above the sun setting.  It also looked as if something was cloaking (cloud)in the top right of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slow it down...speed it up...the video does show what i saw.  A huge opaque triangle over LAX.

We both agreed that it apperared to be changing shape. It looked like an x or a cross with the top cross member slowly rotating. There also seemed to be a space between the two parts.

They were aligned, with little or no space in between. The two peripheral lights were extremely bright and white, and the center light was red. They were not flickering. The white lights were much larger than the center. This object was stationary the entire time, was very big, and extremely vivid. After three or four minutes, I  briefly (for a couple seconds)  looked down at the road and when I looked up again, it was gone. The sky was open and I tried to look for it again, but I couldn&#39;t find it. I have no idea where it went.  After arriving home five minutes later, I received a phone call and the service was interrrupted. No dial tone. Using my cell phone, I called the telephone company. They normally can tell you if your service needs repair from inside the house or out. They could not with mine. I then tried calling our security gate (we live in a secured development) and their phones were also out of order.  I called our phone company again and they said that our security gate uses a different telephone provider and that it was a &#34;coincidence&#34; that their phones were out, too. I then drove up to our gate. Their phones were indeed out, as well as other residents&#39; in our neighborhood who had reported. The security also told me that their communication radios in their vehicles were not functioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was large, about the size of a jet.  There were many red blinking lights on the front side of the rectangle that formed an arch, and one red light on the back.  It made irratic movements from side to side, descended, then moved in a circle.  It then suddenly disappeared.  There were no other lights on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was aprox. 30-50 feet diameter, from side to side, by my estimate to the downtown Burnside bridge area it was hovering over. It was a single object, and it did not move while I observed it except for a slight unjulation which gave it the &#34;imperfect&#34; circular shape that I just mentioned. My astute girlfriend also observed this strange object, at the same instance as myself, as well as earlier that morning, by herself, around 10:30 A.M . This is certainly not the first &#34;UFO&#34; that I have seen here in my 1 year in Portland, Oregon. I have seen 1 black triangle near the Mall 205 exit off of the 205 freeway, as well as several other pasty light ball objects hovering over downtown Portland in clear blue mid day last fall, October 2005, 1 orange/metalic orb august 2005, and 1 diamond shaped black, brown, and grey object weaving eratically in and out of the clouds and then zipping off, early april 2006! Well, that&#39;s more than enough for now, but yes, Portland is a HOT SPOT for UFOs as far as I can tell!  S.E.

They were in what appeared to be the &#34;Missing Man Formation&#34;..which would seem to be an obvious explanation to the sighting, however, this occured about an hour before sunrise on a moonless, for the most part cloudless, morning.  The &#34;lights&#34; were also oval in shape, and absolutely no sound could be heard of any type of jet engine.  I observed them moving across the sky for about 10 seconds, before they disappeared into a cloud bank to the far north of where I was standing.  A few seconds later, the cloudbank lit up from what I would normally assume was lightning...but...after after seeing those lights, I&#39;m not so sure.  I have a novice interest in astronomy, and observe the nighttime sky regularily...so to see this really caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went from west to east in the northern sky, it was a blue/white light.  Once it got to the almost due east part of the sky, it no longer kept the linear path.  It started going side to side, and I thought it must be a plane on a confused path.  When it was going east it was blue/white, when it was going west it was red/white.  When it was red, my dog would look up at it and whine, when it was blue again he would stop.  This went on for a while (I had no watch) then it turned east again after going back and forth, turned very red and disappeared.  It was quite odd.  I checked the iridium paths tonight and saw none for this area of the sky at this time.  While is was going east originally, when it was almost to the spot where it started back and forth, a jet was coming from the south east to the west north west.  The jet was accompanied by a jet sound as it came across, this light did not.  I had no optics to look closer at the light.

Then another humming sound was heard and it was a much lower pitch and dominent. I usually dismiss sounds but this persisted and increased.  As I looked out I saw a yellowish white light with a silver blue light above it and a red one below.  They moved as if all one object but the two smaller lights (blue and red) were some distance above and below. I think I saw connecting arms from each small light to the middle light but cannot be sure.  It traveled from W to E and took about an hour or more to disappear in the E.  I thought it might be some sort of mapping satelite as it seemed very low and crept slowly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While I was outside looking at the night sky my attention was drawn to an object just NE of my zenith near the head of Ursa Major.  The object was very faint, nearly transparent but certainly had some form.  It was difficuly for me to judge it&#39;s size but I estimate that it was approximately 1 degree of arc.  It&#39;s shape was either rectangular or oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object being very faint, it was my impression that it was purposely difficult to see.  Without it&#39;s movement, I may not have seen it at all.  But once &#34;locked on&#34;  I was able to follow it.  The object was mostly black either because it was transparent against the dark sky or made of a dark material.  I&#39;m not sure which.  But it did have a very subtle green and red glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in a straight line from Ursa Major due east past the &#34;guardians&#34; made a quick jog to the north and resumed an easterly course.  I lost it soon after this course correction in the murkiness of the city lights and did not see it again.  I estimate that the object covered about 50 degrees of sky in about the 4 seconds that I tracked it in front of me.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t really explain what I saw.  I googled &#34;ufo reporting&#34; in hopes of finding something out and was pleased to see that the Portland area was at the top of your site although my event was a few nights earlier.   I hope this information helps and I&#39;ll be checking back to see if any conclusions are made.  I&#39;d love to know what the heck it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept thinking I was seeing a reflection of light in the fog on the left hand side of my front windshield.  I asked my passenger if he saw that light up ahead and if he could see where it was coming from.  At first we both thought it was one of those giant spotlights that business&#39; shine into the sky to attract customers.  But then as we kept watching it we realized it wasn&#39;t moving around at all.  It was like a cylinder of light coming from nowhere.  It didn&#39;t shine all the way to the ground, and it didn&#39;t go all the way up high into the sky.  We pulled over and turned off all the lights in the car and just watched it for about 10minutes.  It stayed right where it was, this perfect up &amp; down cylinder of light, that was so bright....there were a lot of dark clouds up there and tons of fog...we could not figure out where that light was coming from.  Maybe a plane??  Well, it hasn&#39;t moved in 15minutes, it&#39;s not going forward &amp; back /in &amp; out either in the cloud cover.  It was just THERE, UP AND DOWN.  So we decided to try to follow towards it and see if we could find where it was coming from, we drove about 8 miles towards it and it slowly just began to fade away.  It was like, &#34;there it is!! Wait! It&#39;s fading away...I can barely see it...it&#39;s gone.&#34;  I don&#39;t know what it was but it was crazy and nothing like the two of us had EVER seen before.  After we turned back around to drive home we saw a plane in the sky straight up and ahead of us, we looked immediately for any similarities to what we had just seen and there were NONE.  Just as we both agreed on that, the plane was gone from our sight, not even two minutes after we first saw it.  There was no way the cylinder of up/down light that we saw could&#39;ve been an airplane, we studied it in the same spot for almost 40minutes, and it wasn’t like it faded or disappeared into the clouds, the light just slowly faded.  In your characteristics of objects section I checked that there was an aura or haze around the object, this does refer to the reflection of the light onto the clouds and fog, we did not see any specific &#34;object&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But just before it got halfway across the sky it slowly began to turn N.E. and continued going N.E. and slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it reached about 10 degrees above the horizon and went out!  Satellites do not change course!!!!  It did not have the same feeling as a jetliner has traveling across the sky using jet propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Drove a little out of town so i could see the stars better... no city lights. Stopped on the crest of a hill and pulled of onto the dirt from paving. right away a bright red star caught my attention. thought maybe a planet. suddenly, it started moving in a straight line to the south east at a steady quick pace. it seemed to align with another constellation, stop, hover, and then disapeared. I got scared and decided to go back in town and watch from there. drove down by the saskatchewan river, stopped the car, and played some music, and watched another reddish light seemingly apear out of nowhere, and move in a straight line to the north. it moved like the first only this one disapeared without realigning with other stars. My wife then called me on my cell and asked where i was. I told her i was down by the river watching strange lights. She asked me to pick her up, and so i did. We decided to go out of town again because i felt a little braver with my wife with me. We stopped in almost the same place as i had been before, and watched a total of 5 lights appear, manuever across the sky at fast paces, and seemingly change course quickly, zig zag, half circle, usually crossing about 1/3 of the night sky. One in particular began very dim, and at a point in its travel, flared very bright for a count of 1 second or less, then became dim again. My wife exclaimed &#34;holy shit, did you see that?&#34; and yes i had, and my reaction was quite similar but i did not express the words. These sightings of these seven lights, lasted 2 hours nearly as we continued to watch the night sky intensly and would exclaim to each other &#34;Ive Got One&#34;. really quite the eye opener for me, and my wife. We both concluded they were not jets as they moved too fast, appeared from nowhere, hovered in star formations, zigzagged on their flight paths, change light from dim to flaring bright, and disapeared as fast as they appeared. take this for what you will. I will be watching the skys for a while now, and will never trust that a star is in fact a star again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a very clear night, and I saw multiple white lights moving across the sky at high altitudes independently of each other. I don&#39;t think they were satellites because they did not move in a steady line across the sky, instead they zig-zagged from east to west. As I was standing outside watching the lights, a large red ball of light appeared above the tree line in the southern sky. I was so frightened that I got in my car and drove 4 miles down the road to get my neighbor so he could see what i was seeing. He wasn&#39;t there so I went back home, hoping they would be gone. It was there again (or still) and then seemed to split or multiply. The second ball of light emerged in front of the first one, the third emerged from the second one, and by the time there was four lights I had gotten in my car and was speeding to another neighbor&#39;s house. By the time we got back it was gone, but the white lights were still in the southern and western sky. My neighbor thought that they might be military aircraft watching the American/Canadian border. I had no idea who to contact, so it wasn&#39;t documented at all. I&#39;ve never witnessed any type of activity like this before, so it really makes me curious as to what I may have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was on the NW horizon above a 3400 foot range of mountains and very high in the sky and far away. I looked again with binoculars and was amazed to see the object was actually egg-shaped its surface was covered with flashing lights.  I saw the colors amber, blue-green, and red all flashing independently of each other. As the object very slowly moved east its shape seemed to change to cigar--almost as though it had tipped on its side or turned. It continued to flash, the colors so bright it looked like a carnival ride in the sky.  It then flashed only one color in different places on its surface--all amber, all bluish-green, all red. At one point it began to climb higher in a zig-zag pattern--slowly, almost meandering, then continued east again.  I watched it until it began to disappear and reappear because a stand of tall fir trees in a nearby yard was making observation difficult.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the years I&#39;ve seen dozen&#39;s of satellites and &#34;falling stars&#34;, etc..  About 3 months ago, I decided to start looking for &#34;black&#34; or non-bright objects in the night sky.  Well, last Sunday night at the stated time I saw a bomerang shaped object moving do West.  The object looked like it was crudely cloaked (could only make it out because it distorted the stars behind it).  The object made no discernible noise.  It gave off almost no light (maybe just a little gray light).  At first I thought it was a Carnival or search light, but this object KEPT a constant course across the sky (I watched it cross the sky to the western horizon).  Assuming this object was at typical jet altitude, I would say it was 3 to 4 times larger than a jetliner and traveling around 3500MPH (it traversed the sky in approx. 12 seconds, etc..).  If I was looking for bright objects in the night sky (as I&#39;ve done until recently), I probably would have missed this event.  I wonder if this object was extraterrestial, or an experimental government stealth aircraft. Did anyone else see this object?<n>

It was moving slowly, and seemed to be approaching us.  At one point, we asked each other if it was falling from directly above us, down toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very large (looked like the fire that comes out of a hot air balloon but bigger) and slowly floated above us, in the same west-east direction.  It looked like it could have been only 100 meters above ground at the closest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then gradually moved away from us, getting smaller and smaller, as if it was moving further from the Earth as it moved eastward.  This continued until it turned into a small red light and disappeared.  The red light at the very end looked like a small red star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the end we were not looking as easterly as we were looking up at the sky.  From our vantage point it seemed to move very slowly while it approached us (like a hot air balloon) and very quickly as it moved away from us (like a jet or rocket).  Nothing we could imagine could seem to be so close, and in just a matter of seconds be so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode lasted 3-4 minutes, most of which was time it spent approaching and floating above us, always moving in the west-east direction.<n>

This was on a Sunday morning where the ruins are not overrun by too many tourists.  Most visitors were locals enjoying the free entrance, sights and beautiful beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My oldest child and I took pictures of the ruins up and down.  We ended in the afternoon swimming at the beach and otherwise enjoyed an interesting day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day at the hotel I overheard several of the local workers talk about sightings of UFO&#39;s up/down the coast line near Tulum but never gave it a second thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to the U.S., I uploaded the pictures from the digital camera to our PC.  We started looking at the photos when I noticed a speck in the corner of one shot.  Upon maximizing it I first thought it resembled a helicopter but we all remembered how quiet and peaceful the day was and did not hear any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further review the bottom of the craft seems to have some sort of glow and seems to be almost oscillating.  My oldest has been bugging me ever since to either submit this picture to a UFO site or have a professional photographer look into it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a bit of a skeptic but I cannot seem to explain that object or the coincidence that people saw UFO&#39;S the same day the shot was taken<n>

Suddenly we both noticed an extremely bright object in the sky. We could not make out the shape because it was so bright...almost as if it was a large mirror. It was stationary and then it moved forward very quickly and disappeared. There were large full clouds scattered throughout the sky in between large areas of clear blue sky. In the location of the UFO it was very clear and there were no clouds close by for it to disappear into.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked liked it was gaining altitude during the time that it was visible. yellow lights flashed annoyingly, and it was extremely distracting. In the middle was a red light that just shined almost like a lazer. within two minutes it had been gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing north when we saw the light coming towards us. My sister said &#34;hey here comes a low flying helicopter&#34; because she saw the light coming towards us.  However, there was no engine sound and we did not see any blue, red or white flashing lights on this object.  The orange light was heading in our direction about 200 feet off of the ground at a slow pace.  The light moved from side to side but not extremely far.  Once all of us noticed this orange light coming towards us, it stopped, hovered for about 30 seconds and then just simply started to rise into the air.  No sound, no burst from any engines, nothing.  It just started to rise at a fast speed until the light dissapeared.  About two minutes later, the same light was noticed behind us, or to our south.  It was traveling north about 200 feet off of the ground.  It was traveling fast and then the light dissapeared.  It did not rise, it just dimmed out.  After that all of us talked for a while trying to determine what we saw.  I think we all knew what we saw, some of us couldn&#39;t beleive it, but I know none of us will ever forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching off to the West because there was an amazing lightning show going on.  Then, from the same area I spotted a bright light that looked like a star only it was brighter than any star or planet I had seen before and it was actually lower than even a small airplane would normally fly.  We were walking, so I stopped to look at it better and thats when I realized it was moving.  I pointed at it and my husband seen it also.  It was coming towards us from the West. It did not dim or brighten any and it did not make a sound.  We watched it as went right over the top of us and it was moving slowly.  Slower than an airplane but not as slow as a blimp.  I would say it was flying a little lower than you would see a small plane fly.  We watched it until it got just to the East of us and were just getting ready to walk again when the light stopped.  It just stopped in mid air.  It never dimmed, it was still very bright.  Then it shot straight up and traveled about 2 seconds, then stopped again.  Then we watched it as it very very slowly dimmed out and disapeared. I never seen a shape because the light was so bright.  It definately was not something on fire or something falling. It had amazing control.  Also there was absolutely no sound. Thank you<n>

So i go get my son who is 10, because we both like to watch the sky at night, and i show him what i see and he sees it, and we stood there watching it for about 15 min, it also besides making a figure&#34;8&#34; it seem to be circling around making controlled movements. This is the first time he has seen what i would describe as a &#34;UFO&#34; we have seen lights that to me are too fast for a satellite while living in Oregon but never made these type of movements, they would just be hooking across the sky in a strait line, but this was the best sighting &#34;I&#34; have ever had..Anyhow it speeds off twords Louisville as soon as the fireworks stopped and it stops and starts making the same movements over the city, well then it speeds off again and we watch till it fades out of sight..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving at a slow but steady pace south to north. It had no lights nor was there any sound coming from it. Estimated to have been about 5 to 8 K feet in altitude. The delta wing shape was the only part of the craft visible, no specific body or tail. It seemed to resinate against the black sky backround. Totally clear sky away from bright city lights. I am a science teacher and the co-observer is also a teacher. I have had one other sighting in my life which I cannot explain. I tend not to believe in the UFO / aliens from outer space genre, but I do believe in what my eyes see! I was not drinking alcohol at the time of this sighting, in fact we were watching for shooting stars staring at one fixed point in the night sky. This craft flew directly over us with no sound or lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was pretty clear considering we had thunderstorms earlier that day. I spotted what I took at first to be a star because It was a bright yellowish white colour, solid throughout and very high in the sky. However, I then noticed it was moving. I stopped walking and watched it. It was flying in a strait pattern but going rather too fast and smooth for an airplane. I took off my headphones to listen for sound, to make sure it wasn&#39;t a plane or for some bizaree reason a helicopper (though it seemed too high up for this) I couldn&#39;t hear anything but the normal car noises ect. It didnt have any light changes and I didn&#39;t see any red lights or pulsating lights like on a plane. I walked forwards to watch it until it disapeared behind a tress near by. I continued on my walk, shortly afterward, maybe three minutes later, a plan flew over head. It looked nothing like what I saw minutes before and was at the normal height in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is strange to me because its the second sighting I&#39;ve had in the last week. I can&#39;t remember the exact day, I think It was Tuesday or Wednesday. It was about 1:30-2:00pm I was driving to see a friend at work when I noticed a a silvery object really high in the sky, higher then I had ever seen a plane go. It&#39;s shape was somewhat circular and I couldn&#39;t make out any wings. I observed it until I turned a corner and it was gone from my view. Both sighting I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to watch it for about 5 minutes and it did not move. I went into the house and got my daughter.  We went into the backyard and continued to observe it for about 15 minutes. She called her grandparents and I called my sister to see if they could see it.  We watched a bright, red light that was stationery in sky for about 10 minutes.  Occasionally,it would brighten then dim out.  We noticed after about 10 minutes that it was moving slowly.  The only way we could see that it was moving was it had changed positions in the sky. (relative to the telephone wires) We contined to watch until it dimmed and finally disappeared. My daughters grandmother, father and two cousins also confirmed that had witnessed this. My sister who lives in a town about 14 miles away also saw it.  It was very strange and none of us had been drinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 50 year old female who works in a hospital.

Daylight: I was sitting on my south facing patio deck taking a break after doing some yard work.  Looked up and noticed an object that was the size of a small star (possibly reflecting sun light?).  The object appeared to be at commercial aircraft altitude (30k feet), but actual size of object and altitude is a guess.   Object was at eleven o-clock position in the sky and moved very slowly west (approximately two inches at arms length, would stop, then slowly continue path west, pause and then headed south in a gentle arc, to approximately two o-clock position. Movement was intentional and did not appear to drift.  No sudden accelerations, or wobbling, just even paced, then pauses.  This was not a commercial aircraft at 30k, both because of movement, speed and size.  Maybe a weather balloon, if they still use them, but the pauses (hovering) in movement seemed to last way too long.  It was very difficult to keep my eye on it because it was so small and daylight.  I simply lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Still somewhat in a sleep mode and as i was becoming more alert to the noise. I sat up and looked in the direction of my back windows where i was hearing the noise, and saying to myself, &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; by now I was somewhat fully awake to notice that this is not a normal noise and as I got up to go check it out, my two cats were both under the drapes looking out the window, One hissed and the other one ran to the sliding door to the deck. As I got closure to the window the  noise start to fade and then it stopped by the time I got to the window. I looked out and saw nothing, went out to the deck and looked around for anything odd, looked up in the sky for an aircraft and saw nothing. I own a house in a suburb and the sky was clear and I didn&#39;t see any &#34;blinking light&#34; from an aircraft/helicopter/ that they would have, the noise was so different from any type of noice that I ever heard from any aircraft. So at that time I decided to go back to bed.

It flew from west to east and emitted a relativly quiet jet engine noise.  It is huge, which is what initially caught my son&#39;s attention.  It had running lights, blue on the three points of the triangle and two red and a blue along the edge facing us.  It is obviously a military and or experimental aircraft.<n>

Then 6 of us, including him, went to the field in the back of our house and looked up and saw many flashing lights.  They looked like stars, but were flashing red and blue lights.  There was one bright one and then some smaller ones in a V shaped line. They seemed to be in groups of three except the bright one was alone.  They were in sight for a few hours until one by one they all slowly disappeared.  The next night we didn&#39;t see them, but they were back 2 days after the sighting, in roughly the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were light grey colored, had no flasshing lights or lights of anykind. They kind of lit up themselves but in a light grey color. It was completely silent movement and they crossed the sky in abuot two seconds or less, shooting up and disappearing into the sky and clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just talking when suddenly out of nowhere this huge cylinder shaped light appeared in the sky it was huge considering how far away it was and it moved across the sky diagonally southwest (FAST) then just as quickly as it appeared it was gone.  The front of it was green and then it tapered into orange, there was much more orange than green.  It wasn&#39;t a green object with an orange tail because the whole thing moved together as one object.  There was no noise.  The way it appeared it reminded me of shooting a bottle rocket.  Only it was huge.  And going down not up.  And it never exploded like a bottle rocket.  We both were silent for a few minutes and then we looked at each other.  I asked what that was, she said she didn&#39;t know.  I asked if she thought it was a plane.  She said no.  I said maybe fireworks.  She said no.  Then she said sort of quietly do you think it was a ufo?  I said no one would believe us.  We quickly put out our cigarettes and went back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then suddenly I saw another object flying almost on the same path flying (south to North) but this object was bright and then very faint and then bright and and very faint continuing until it was out of range.  Then seconds after that object passed I saw another object in which had a very bright red light and it appeared out of the Northwest sky and slowly headed towards that object that just had passed at a different angle and it then blinked it&#39;s red light several times at another object headed in the opposite direction ( as if it was comunicating with the last object coming in from the east. The last object had a bright red light and it moved swiftly through the sky towards the third object until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I know the first object was a satelight, but I&#39;m not sure about the other three objects. I have never seen lights of this nature and I&#39;m 99.99999% sure that it was not a aircraft of our nature. Plus the objects were silent...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object appreared to be stationary at first, but was actually moving in a swaying circular style random patterns. At one point the lights dimmed and disappeared and seemed to streak at an angle toward the ground (similar to a shooting star). Object reappeared just seconds later in the same area (all this at an estimated 2-3 mile range). My wife and I observed this for about 10 minutes. I came back out on a few occasions over the next hour or so and object was still there, althought in not the same spot. Also it appeared that possibly there were 2 more of these objects further off in the distance, but were too far away to to tell for sure. On a few occasions I heard what were jets in the distance, and also seen the blinking lights of a couple different airplaines in the immediate area. This object was in the area for so long that I totally expected to hear other reports (news/people) that they had seen the same thing. This however was spotted in a very rural area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were almost directly over the road (or, if further out than they appeared, over the Sonoran Desert Natl. Monument), though how far in the distance and at what altitude I don’t know.  Twilight had almost completely faded.  They were not there more than ten seconds before all the orbs disappeared at the exact same time as though someone had quickly turned down a dimmer switch to ‘off’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than ten minutes later another set of lights - same color but elongated in shape and more tightly grouped/farther off - appeared in succession to the Southwest of 347 and quickly disappeared in the same order.  Each would come on and soon fade out as its neighbor within the cluster followed suite.  We followed 347 and then 84 west to the I8 and headed South then East, seeing them further away to the SW yet again on two more occasions for no more than 6 seconds at a time, probably over the Barry M. Goldwater Range at this point.  We turned south down Stanfield Rd., eventually heading into Tohono Indian Reservation (and seeing another quick, stationary-yet fade-in/fade-out series of amber lights directly in front of us, to the south) before turning around.  As we headed back north, the series appeared again (around 8:30pm), this time to our South West, perhaps back over the Goldwater Range.  These were even further out, and as they faded, they seemed to become flickering white lights, far in the distance, apparently unmoving, coming and going from sight.  We had stopped the car, and could hear no jet noises at all, close or in the distance, and the air was calm.  When nothing more happened we headed back North to the 8 and East to the I10 for Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the last sets of flicking white lights may or may not have been flares, I cannot be certain either way, as they were so far off.  However the first set of equidistant orbs were like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and the succeeding groups were almost equally large and strange, instantly striking my wife and I each time as odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twice, 20 minutes apart, we saw what appeared to be shootings stars cross through the general vicinity of where the lights had just been.  In any case, the events were fascinating, strange, and unmistakably ‘different.’<n>

One craft flew above us and there were red lights and white lights and a strange, foreign humming and whizzing sound. It did not have wings and could not have been a plane.

At the time of the sighting I was facing east. Through the windshield, I saw four or five greenish lights that appeared to be fairly low to the ground, maybe two-hundred to three-hundred feet high. The encounter lasted only maybe 2 seconds, if that. However, from what I saw it appeared that the lights were in a stright line as if attached to some larger object. As I saw them, it appeared that the object on which the lights were mounted was spinning as it moved. I only derive this conclusion from the way the lights moved across the sky. Soon the lights were on the north side of the seemingly triangular shaped object, and they all merged (on a two dimensional plane). After this the lights disappeared and after watching for another few seconds or so, the lights never reappeared. I drove quickly one more block to my house and quickly got out and looked in the direction that the craft was moving, but I didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, who was in the car with me, also saw the object. I think she may have seen it a little longer than I did. All I said to her was, &#34;Woah.&#34; I didn&#39;t describe what I had seen to her, to make sure she had seen the same thing that I did. She also described seeing the lights in the same way that I did. Although my sister did see the object, she did not have her glasses on and her sighting might not be trusted. I, on the other hand, have had a vision screening within the last month or so and got a result of perfect vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a very bright yellowish/orange light in the sky about 1-2 miles away over a cornfield. There was alot of farm land and some trees in the area. I thought it was odd because it was so low, bright and huge. I have never seen an airplane that size and especially not that bright and still in the daytime hours. You would need about 75-100 airplanes to make up the size of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for a few minutes and it wasn&#39;t moving, but just hovering over the cornfield. I told my friend, who was driving, to look out her window and she saw it also. We both were in pure amazement because I have never seen anything at all like this except for in the movies. Then the light became a bright whiteish color and we could see a silver lining underneath, like the bottom of a disk or bowl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. It continued to just hover over this area. A few minutes later, the bright light started to dim. Within a split second, the lights totally disappeared and I saw a flash zip across the sky really fast and totally disappear into the sky. We continued looking all over the place and it was just gone, totally gone. We then noticed approximately 10 jet streams in the sky going towards the direction of the object that we saw. We didn&#39;t see any airplanes or helicopters in the area at all while we were witnessing this except for after it disappeared, we saw those jet streams going towards that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing in this particular area was the cornfield/farm land and some trees. There were no street lights, tower lights, buildings or anything at all. We were in such amazement and didn&#39;t even think to take a picture of this until afterwards. This lasted approximately 5-8 minutes I would say. I wonder if anyone else saw this or anything odd in the sky tonight?<n>

I was driving and she was in the passanger seat. We were on OLD US 35, leaving W.C.H. and about a mile from the Fayette/Ross Co line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend says to me &#34;Look, What is that?&#34; I glance out my window and about a mile or so away is this incredibly bright object just hovering in the sky above the farming fields. (We where out there in the country.)  I&#39;ve seen plenty of things like airplanes and helicopters in this area and I know one when I see one. This WAS NOT one. I&#39;d like to add here that it was not yet dark at all outside, the sun was still hanging in there and the sky was still blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see vaugely a bowl shaped bottom on it that appeared to be a silver color, but emmiting from it was the most blinding white light I&#39;ve ever seen. Imagine if you will what a normal airplane looks like AT NIGHT, imagine the lights. It was like the lights times 100. The lights where so bright that it seemed beamy almost, the sun but a crisp, white color. (The sun was on the other side of my car, BTW. LOL)  So I&#39;m attempting to drive and watch this object that&#39;s not moving by my estimations and all the sudden, it&#39;s like the lights on the craft dimmed by 50% and I said to my friend &#34;Did it just dim it&#39;s lights?&#34; and she said &#34;Yes.&#34; No more then five seconds later she says &#34;OMG It&#39;s just gone!&#34;  So I looked agian and sure enoungh, it had totally vanished. I saw nothing. The car behind me started driving really, really fast and they took off around me like a bat out of hell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we drive down 35, cross the Fayette/Ross Co. border and turn around and come back. I look up and I see a bunch of jet stream or contrails in the sky, all going in the same direction where we had seen the craft. My friend counted ten of them in all. We didn&#39;t see them untill after the UFO had disappeared. It was amazing!<n>

I looked up and saw this cone shaped light with a tail of light on each side Extremely bright Falling fast straight down I lost sight for just about a minute and when I topped the hill and had a clear view I was afraid it might already be down but there it was stopped in the sky I couldn&#39;t see any movement at all I sat at the stop sign for about 4 more minutes and it did not move. Cars came up behind me and I had to leave without seeing the departure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The van was travelling at approximately 45 mph. I was sitting in the front seat and my view was through a clear windshield. The other passengers did not see the object.  I did not alert them to my sighting because there were family members who would have been skeptical or fearful.  I have extensive knowledge of aviation (general, commercial and military). I am able to recognize any airbreathing craft at great distances  My vision is 20/20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear morning with unlimited ceiling and visibilty in excess of 20 miles.  The temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit with high pressure moving into Eastern North Carolina.  I saw what appeared to be a spherical, metallic object that reflected sunlight.  The object was to the West/Southwest of my moving position.  No sound or apparent movement was noticed during my observation. There was a row of pine trees along the roadside but the object was unobstructed for nearly ten seconds.  The object was approximately at an azimuth of 35 degrees. It would have been relatively smaller than the size of my thumb with full arm extension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the van proceeded my view became obstructed by the pine trees.  When the van emerged from the tree line, the object was not visible.  The amount of time that elapsed between the tree line obstruction and our emergence was less than 10 seconds.  We would have travelled less than a quarter of a mile but still would have seen the object if it were relatively stationary to my viewpoint (i.e. a celestial body or high altitude aircraft.  I tried to look back through the side window on the driver&#39;s side but did not see the object.  I looked directly overhead and then looked out the passenger&#39;s side window.  The object was not visible in any direction. The van&#39;s roof was the most significant obstruction at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove on towards Route 64 and Interstate 95 for our ride back to Massachusetts.  I did not see the obect again after the intitial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The third time I awoke was due to someone holding my left hand. I tried to pull away and when I could not, I really woke up. I don&#39;t want to believe what I saw. There were four short grayish aliens with large black eyes and no mouth. One held my left hand by my fingers, one had my right arm pinned down, and two were holding my ankles. I tried to yell but it was as if my own mouth was gone: I could not open it. I raised my head and tried to get away. Then I saw an image on the wall that caused me to pause: it looked like a microscopic image of blood cells and amoebas moving. I looked at it briefly then continued to struggle. Then I felt as if one of them pushed my head down, and all went dark for a few seconds. When I felt them release me, I saw them move to the outer wall as a bright light shown through the window. I jumped up to look out but the aliens and the light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We started walking faster and upon coming to a clearing in the sky, noticed no lights.  We slowed down and all of a sudden above us in the cloud was the green circling light.  We were so afraid that we almost ran home about 6 blocks.  The circling green light appeared to jump from cloud to cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it was very late, we picked the closest one to where we were at and settled in. Our site was far from the road in case people might drive by and try to bother us. We decided to forego the tent and sleep in the car as it was so late. I was preparing my sleeping bag which he smoked a cigar and went to the restroom. While laying in my bag, I was looking at all the stars through the sunroof. He was standing outside the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, I looked into the woods in the direction toward the restrooms. I saw lights that twinkled and appeared to be moving slowly. The best description to give would be that they were similar to when a group of people have flashlights and walk, the lights stay somewhat level, but move back and forth, up and down a bit. The lights also would go off completely and come back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I wasn&#39;t scared. I asked my boyfriend what the lights were since he had walked over to the restroom a minute ago. He said he didn&#39;t know and that we should just leave. That scared me since he is typically not scared of anything. So he jumped in the car and started driving while I was climbing from the back into the front seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we drove, I looked into the woods. The lights went off and did not come back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The easy explanation is that these were hunters, or people who lived nearby. But there were no houses around for several miles, and no cars parked at the side of the road. There were no other campers in the area and many camps were closed down due to the season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My natural feeling what that we should go and explore what the light was, and that scares me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say that this was a UFO. But I can say it was not human, not a building, not a campfire. This area of the woods was very small and there was no way it could have been anything easily explanable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Once the bright light disappeared, many small apparent strobe lights became prominent.  The apparent strobe lights were not noticed until the bright light disappeared and at that time the apparent strobe lights departed the visible sky in all directions until no longer visible.  We are unsure if the strobe lights were visible during the observance of the larger light as we were concentrating on the brighter flashing light until it disappeared.  Once the brighter flashing light disappeared, we noted that the movement of the strobe lights was consistent with the general direction of the movement of the brighter flashing light until they departed the area.  No noise from the skies was heard during this observance; however, the frogs in the lake were making an unusual amount of noise prior to the siting.  The noise from the frogs was disputed among the persons hearing the noise to be an abnormal noise made by the indigenous frogs of this lake.  This siting was reported from a private lake approximately 4 miles West of DeLeon, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of habit I always stand up and watch them.  As I heard them coming I looked up into the sky facing southwest (they are approaching from the S. West heading N. East) when I saw a cloud that seemed in the shape of a horseshoe. It disappated, the US Military planes flew over - watched them - then looked back from where they came and found a triangle in the sky not moving.  I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  Then, fast as ever it headed directly towards the North, stopped on a dime, stayed still for about 30 seconds.  Then moved back to it&#39;s first position just as fast.  Then in a blink of an eye it went South West super fast and a small white round sphere came from it and darted with it out of sight.  A plane was coming from the east then (commercial airliner) and as I watched it another triangle was in the Western sky not moving. It followed the aircraft for a moment then went fast as lighting towards the south and out of sight.  It was amazing and terrifying all in one.  The triangle shaped objects appreared to be black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a bright, sunny day with some high cumulus clouds.  As the mall sits on top of a hill, the view is wide open.  I was looking out the bus window when I saw what appeared to be a charcoal-gray metallic sphere floating in the air maybe 1,000 feet up. There were no apparent window, or lights, nor any sound.  I thought at first it was a balloon--but soon realized that it had neither a basket underneath, nor was it moving at all...It was absolutely motionless.  I was able to observe it as the bus traveled down the road until it took an exit.  At that point we moved down hill and the view was hidden behind trees and buildings.  I am curious if others in the Alexandria, Virginia area observed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was completely clear except for a couple very smeall, very thin, barely visible clouds and there was not even a hint of a breeze out. At first I thought it was a bird - the kind that can flap their wings fast enough to just remain relatively motionless, which I have observed on several other occasions - but then I saw a crow fly directly in front of it and it just remained totally motionless although it did seem to be quite a distance off behind the crow but still I didn&#39;t notice any kind of movement whatsoever from the object for quite some time, probably a good 2 to 3 minutes or so. Then I thought it was a kite but then rejected that thought immediately since there was absolutely no wind or even so much as a hint of a breeze. Then I thought that it was a baloon of some sort but couldn&#39;t justify why it would just sit there completely motionless for such a long time - at least 2 to 3 minutes. I went in to get my digital camera and it was still there when I got back but unfortunately the batteries in the camera needed recharging so I wasn&#39;t able to get any footage of it. The object slowly &amp; deliberately moved down and to the south behind some trees &amp; out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to moving in an eastbound direction at an altitude of approximately 12,000 feet. As a pilot, &#34;single engine VFR&#34;, I am certain this was neither an airplane nor helicopter. No lights appeared on the object although the entire surface structure appeared to glow a pale blue. Trailing behind the object was a hazy contrail which did not drift despite a strong northerly wind. The object appeared above the &#34;meadows&#34; for approximately two minutes. Inquiries to both Bradley Air Traffic Control and Brainard Air Traffice Control confirmed that there was no air traffic in the sky at that time to account for this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The luminescence was not intense but very obvious. The brightness remained fairly constant.  No windows, blinking lights, no hard solid edges or surfaces were apparent.  Clear sky/no clouds … good visibility.  The two objects were first seen when directly overhead.  Visually appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  Visually appeared to be traveling at a very fast speed towards the east and in a straight path.  There was absolutely no audible sound generated by the objects during the entire time. The objects traveled in &#34;formation&#34; keeping maybe one to two widths apart from one another.  One of the objects traveled slightly ahead of the other. The objects maintained one rounded end of the oval shape pointed in the direction of travel.  There were no trails behind them and no apparent lights shining out from any part of the objects.  One of the incredible aspects of these objects is that on one, maybe two brief instances, they smoothly and quickly changed/switched positions in the &#34;formation&#34; so that now the other object was slightly in the &#34;lead.) I was already amazed by this sighting, when I saw the relative movement of the two objects to one another I was in awe!  I am a geologist. I view any natural phenomenon in a very critical light. I have always been extremely critical and skeptical of other reported sightings.   I have never seen/reported objects ever before.  I don’t know what these objects were, but I’ve gone through any logical list of things and nothing makes sense.  Quite often there are aircraft flying in this vicinity heading towards Houston Intercontinental, but these were something quite different.  I don’t know what to think now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Every nite we went on the balcony,3rd floor of the 3 storey building, to look at the moonrise and nite sky. My husband was on the balcony and as soon as I joined him, I looked out and saw a flashing lite off to my left coming off the point at Cape Canaveral which was about 10:00 with due East being 12:00 and about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I of course assumed it was a plane but immediately noticed that the light was flashing more like a strobe lite. I was amazed at its speed, faster than any aircraft but slower than if it had been a meteorite; it also had a red flashing strobe light appearance simultaneously with the bright white strobe flashing.I ran downstairs to watch it at ground level. From the time I spotted the light, ran downstairs, and saw it again, it had moved across the horizon to where the moonrise had been the previous nite, approx at 2:30 with 12:00 being due East, and then was out of site. My husband had stayed on the 3rd floor and saw what I had seen and I rejoined him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted another lite, identical to the first and starting in the same location. There were 2 more following behind it for a total of 4 including the first one. The subsequent three followed the exact path across the horizon with the same incredible speed and flashing bright white, red and occasional green strobe-like lights.  Then there appeared in the south east of the horizon an orange glowing orb  and the 3 rapidly moving flashing objects disappeared into the glowing orb. The orb then faded and an object of numerous colors came from this area and sped off at a high speed in a westerly projectory over the coastline and disappeared. My hushband pointed out that the lights seen resembled a frequency of brightness and color as seen from gaseous ionization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Satellite Beach is maybe 15 miles South of Cape Canaveral; I first saw the flashing objects off of the Cape. Three days later, on April 20th at 4:27pm, NASA launched an Atlas rocket, which we also saw from our condo location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were very small, and there wer no other shapes visible.  They were travelling in a straight line, and the lights were flashing 5-6 times in a second, then they would have two seconds off or so, and then blink again.  The five lights wer not timed together.  They somewhat changed colors--mostly white, but every third or fourth blink it would be red or blue. They travelled out of sight in ENE direction.  There were no sounds, and it is a very clear night.  I would think they were quite a distance away.  I would guess that they were helicopters, but I have never seen lights behave thay way before.  The blinks of light were different time lengths--not all five blinks were on the same amount of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had finished lunch and reclined my seat all the way back for a short rest before returning to work..I was praying (in my head) as I usually do and noticed a bunch of birds just acting screwy, flying in circles as if they were playing Tag. As I continued with my prayers, the birds flew off but one went way up high in the sky then turned left and disappeared. At that time, I noticed something even higher and assumed it was another bird...I thought &#34;how could it be flying so high?&#34; Well I focused on it a little more and realized it wasn&#39;t a bird but an object. It looked like a white ping pong ball though I could see some reddish tint above it and almost what looked like a band of black around the center..The object was traveling normally from left to right in the sky, just like a plane would but then it stopped..The thing stopped then went backwards, then up, down and stayed there for another few seconds. The wind was blowing pretty good so the clouds started coming together where I was looking at this thing. I fumbled in my purse for my disposable camera that I always carry with me but I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off the sky. I finally had to because I couldn&#39;t find the darn thing in my purse. Well when I looked back, the object was gone and the clouds had now settled in. What&#39;s even more weird is the way the clouds came in. Two big masses were combining but when it got to that spot, it became a donut and the hole got smaller and smaller..Then to make things even more weird, I turned on my car to look at the time and the CD player started up okay but my clock started going haywire..It was going berserk, then it just stopped at 4:19 and re-set itself to the correct time which was 2:07pm....I&#39;ve only had this car for about 2 months and nothing has ever happened with the clock or the radio/cd player...I have seen UFO&#39;s before and just submitted a story last week about a 1977 experience I had as a child. This was very weird and I almost feel as if it were there &#34;for my eyes only&#34;..Everything just seemed to play out as if I were watching my own TV screen at home...Now I truly wonder what the significance of the number &#34;419&#34; means which is what the clock settled on before returning to normal..Thanks for listening...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I started to get up out of bed to investigate what the source could be since my window was open and there was no sound whatsoever. As I began to rose, one of the loudest BOOM sounds I have ever heard occured. My husband flew out of bed, as did I, and went to the window expecting to see a stormy sky. Instead, we saw crystal clear skies. I immediately panicked that this had maybe been an explosion or bomb of some kind-- that was the magnitude of the sound. Our dogs, accustomed to thunder and lightning, went crazy and pawed at our front door. People in our neighborhood were outside staring at the sky. My husband called the local police department-- they were flooded by calls. This morning, he called again for an explanation. The dispatcher told him that althought they had gotten multiple reports, nothing had been found as a source.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This second sighting compelled me to report it.  My last sighting was two years ago in 2004 in New Jersey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured in Washington, D.C. in April of 2006.  I was at a friend&#39;s house and the three of us decided to go outside on the apartment balcony and smoke a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were out there I saw small flying aircrafts that were flashing red lights.  It reminded me of my sighting two years ago and brought back memories.  I realized it was the same objects.  I recognized the speed of the red flashing objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, my friends being very skeptical just assumed they were airplanes but not me.  No way, this is the second time that these objects came around.  This time in Washington, D.C.  They moved the same way in all types of directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying objects disappared after a short time, maybe 10 minutes.  Then after that I saw other aircrafts which looked like helicopters with spot lights just like my first sighting flying around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t stick around to see the helicopters fly around but they were gone after 30 minutes.  Again I  assume it is a UFO or something government related.  Especially since it happened in Washington, D.C.   You never really know with the government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if they were any other outside witnesses but I have done some research online and have seen some forums with other witnesses of the same event.  I just decided to report this stuff since it was my second sighting of the same thing but in different states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I observed it for a moment but I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, so I told my mom to take a look at it. She said that she could see it too. It was to the west of 1-15 and since it was about 8:45 pm, the sky was getting darker and darker, but there was still faint light so we could see the shadow of it in the sky. I would say it was about 100-200 feet of the ground and it flew at a constant speed until it seemed to disappear among the background of the mountains, but after a few minutes it reappeared again. I only saw one of them, and it was just big and black, and it was a diamond-shaped object. It emitted no lights whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a reddish pinkish glow.  At first I thought maybe it was a helicopter because it seemed to be flying horizontally (unlike a falling star), but it was too pinkish to be a helicopter light, and a little too big.  I kept watching, hoping my husband would get to see it.  It seemed to come towards us, but yet that it was far away and then it just was gone.  Is there an explanation for this?<n>
4/16/06 20:00|Perth (Australia)||Triangle|7 seconds|Anomalous image photographed over Perth city Western Australia invites questions.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50205.html|153|ndxe200604| Anomalous image photographed over Perth city Western Australia invites questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Easter Sunday April 16  (2006) I took 40 photos of the moon directly over St Georges terrace (a major street) in Perth city, Western Australia. Pics werew taken from the western end of the city looking east. Of particular interest was the last frame shot at about 8 pm. I did not see this image at the time. I discovered it only when downloading the photos. It is about 3/4 up from the horizon, This frame (heavily cropped here) almost separately depicts the foreground and buildings, the moon, an elliptical image of apparently regular dimensions, containing a delta, or cone shaped object (image) concentrically disposed to the elliptical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lens flare and lens dirt are eliminated by comparing this frame with others showing the ellipse, but not the inscribed delta image. The sky was clear and the evening cool and dry. The 8 megapixel camera was tripod mounted and triggered by IR remote. Exposure time of about 7 seconds was automatic, tungsten white balance, natural colour, 100 ASA, focal length about 50mm. Extra fine JPEG recording format.  2560 x 1920 pixels. (Web pics are low resolution 72 dpi)  In this photo the moon has a blurred image due to earth rotation during the camera exposure time. This may be explained as follows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [To observers rotating with the Earth, the moon appears to move along the Ecliptic at ~15 arc seconds per second. That amounts to 1/120th a moon diameter per second, or a full moon width (0.5°) every 2 minutes. The apparent direction of the moon&#39;s motion depends on which hemisphere you&#39;re in. The moon&#39;s apparent motion is real enough to smear its shape and blur its surface features when telescopes or long exposures enter the picture. Courtesy http://dpfwiw.com/moon.htm#motion] Therefore, during 7 seconds camera exposure, the moon has moved 7/120ths its diameter  nearly 6%. Small wonder the moon is blurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The buildings did not move. Neither did the cone/delta shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This raises a question. An object at 30,000 feet or less is within earth’s atmosphere and will fall due to gravity unless it is held aloft by some means that overcomes the force of gravity, such as wings on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo shows that the delta/cone did not move in 6-8 seconds while the moon did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It follows that if the delta/cone image is about distant from earth as a jumbo jet and did not move relative to earth, it must have had some means to hold it stationary. Anti gravity technology is evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conversely, if the (image) object is so far distant that it may be in geo-stationary orbit (like some satellites that from earth appear as stars), then it is HUGE!<n>

I was facing south, it was still light outside, blue skies, minimal clouds - I observed 3 orange/ember colored objects in the sky all moving east to west, seem to be following the same path, all seemed to be going the same speed - as if moving as one.  They moved behind the trees and I could no longer see them.  Then another group of 5 came into view, same color, all going east to west, moving as if one again.  I noticed no sound (although I was inside looking out a dining room window at the time).  I went outside to see if I could hear or see anything else and there was no noise and I did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a perfect day to fly kites having semi-clear skies and a steady wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting the first of three kites into the air when I spotted a reflection in the sky.  It seemed to look like a jet at 45,000 feet and thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later the kite swung across the object again, but had not moved in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I saw the object again, I was helping my daughter with her kite.  I pointed the object out to her and she noted that the object was moving side-to-side trying to hover in one position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us watched to object for an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the object to be hovering at an altitude of 23,000 ft, 9 mile away and a diameter of 75 to 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness implies a date of April 16, 2006.

Didn&#39;t look like anything I have seen before. I started to slow down on the interstate to get a better look and it was getting closer. As it passed over head around 500 feet above I pulled over the car. I couldn&#39;t really see the shape of the object other than the light formations underneath. The lights were in a plus formation with 7 white lights total. The light were a dome shape (kinda like one of those battery dome push lights.) Being around 500 feet above me I would say that each dome was as least 6 feet in diameter. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and it was dead silent. The ship was moving probably around 5 miles an hour. Maybe even slower. Saying I could have ran across the interstate about the same speed as it was traveling. The ship was heading toward Bessemer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later I was in hueytown and for about 5 sec saw another ship that was a diamond shape color bright blue under the diamond there was a U cut out shape. Was moving east to west very fast and very straight. Was almost like the U shape underneath the ship was traveling on an invisible rail. The color of the ship was changing from red, yellow only on the bottom U part. The rest of the ship was bright blue. Had 5 people see this ship. One was a church lady and just could not believe her eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like when the in Star Trek when the ship went into warp speed because it sort of a tail behind it. It was a super white light the UFO was emitting, in which I can only describe as a white colored light I never seen before. It was so bright but yet it did not hurt my eyes while I was looking at it.  Then all of a sudden it shot back into space in less than a second. Then I could see it moving around like I saw it doing before it shot to the mountain top. The UFO hovered in an area called Patee creek recreation area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2011, living in Waipahu, Hawaii (Oahu), we (my best friend) saw a very large aqua colored blimp-like shaped craft flying around the Ewa Beach &amp; Waipahu area for 20 minutes or so.  It made no sound and the big thing that caught my attention was it was flying in restricted air space where all incoming jets fly to land at the Honolulu International Airport.  No one, including the military are not to fly in that airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One month later at the same place in Hawaii, my roommate and I seen three crafts flashing in all different colors, round shape, and again these flying objects where right in front of the flight path of incoming jet liners in a restricted air space.  They were moving around like someone would juggle 3 balls. After 5 minutes or so, they all disappeared into the water never to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept this to myself long enough and I thought reporting them to you would add more information for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Chief Warrant Officer in the Navy (Seabees) so I can distinguish between what a plane and UFO are, and after what I’ve seen, I am now a full believer in other life outside our world..<n>

Next we thought it was fireworks from one of the many nearby beach bars when my friend pointed out that the lights were moving far too quick to be fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time went on the lights changed into fireballs with the one at the front flashing/burning brightly which made me think that maybe it&#39;s an aeroplane on fire and about to crash, leaving trail of burning fireballs behind it, some smaller, some bigger, in different colours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the entire port was looking at the sky (1000&#39;s of people).  There was no sound coming off these objects.  The phenomenon carried on going right across the nightsky and the fireballs only started fading and disappearing when they were almost out of sight to the far East (they had appeard in the west).   I have seen meteor showers before but never have they been anything like this in terms of quantity, intensity and how close they seemed above the Earth&#39;s surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange indeed.  I don&#39;t think they could have been more than 15-20kms above us, however they must have travelled 100&#39;s of kms in the space of 60-90 seconds.  Has anyone got any explanation for this phenomenon?<n>

I stepped outside to take a leak. I noticed a bright light moving across the sky. It was brighter than Venus and I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane because there were no strobes. I told my ex to get my binoculers. When I looked thru them I saw 3 different lights in a triangle shape. I don&#39;t know if it was one object with 3 lights or 3 objects flying close together. But it was one light on top and two on bottom. We watched this thing move across the sky at a steady rate of speed and it made absolutly no noise. It was going pretty fast. I can&#39;t tell you what direction it was going because if the sun isn&#39;t out, I don&#39;t have a clue. We saw this and was wondering if anyone else did too. I&#39;m really not sure about the time because I didn&#39;t think to look. I know it was around midnight, give or take.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We decided to go a longer way then usual.  As we stopped at a stop sign, we both fell silent as we saw a bight white object moving quite quikly across the sky.  It literally came out of nowhere, like someone turned on a light.  It was falling away from us diagonally.  The object was VERY bright and white.  It was a full moon that night and yet this object was just as bright or brighter then the moon and even as it moved away from us it didnt lose ant light.  And it was obvious to both of us that the object was moving AWAY from the car, meaning that it couldn&#39;t have been a plane or helicopter light shining directly at us (it was much too bright anyway).  From our view point the object was the size of an eraser head of a pencil.  It was heading towards the highway and when I stepped out of the car to continue watching it over the line of trees, I saw it quickly go straight up and disappear just as quickly as it appeared.  I have been interested in astronomy much of my life and I know the difference between a comet/meteor/shooting star and this was without a doubt none of the above.  Both of us were completely amazed by the speed and how bright the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Behind the property there is only scrubland leading up to the mountain range.At about 10.30 on a clear night apart from some patchy cloud I was in the backyard looking at the stars, my family were inside watching TV. I witnessed six or seven large bright lights that appeared to be flying in formation at about 5 thousand feet up. They were flying horizontaly. The &#34;head&#34; of each object was round with a blue and red luminous colouring. Their &#34;tail&#34; was remarkable and brilliantly gold coloured like a beautiful sunset. There was no noise. They headed west to east and &#34;blinked&#34; out simultaneously over the mountains.I have seen many firework displays and shooting stars but these could not be mistaken for either.I am not sure what they were. At the time I even considered that they were missiles. If someone could convince me that a meteor shower could fly horizontaly and appear so large and brilliant I might consider that an explanation but I am open minded and feel privilleged to have seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They also went over so fast without a sound. Anything of this world would of had a sonic boom.Well faster then the speed of sound, but no sound.

What seemed like incredible speed, the light came down and became an elongated craft with visible lights or portholes all down the side I could see as it passed me in a split second.  Being a warm night, I had rolled down my window to watch it when I realized it was dropping down to level off in the field paralleling the Highway on my left.  I was trying to find a place to pull over wide enough to safely get off the Highway.  All the while I was attempting to keep the craft in sight as it passed me, went back into the sky quickly and again became a very bright star visible and hanging over the area of Cedarville about 4 or 5 miles behind me.  Within a minute I found a wide spot and pulled over, got out and noticed across the road and east there was farm with lots of cars parked along the highway and in their driveways as if there was some kind of gathering or meeting.  I would think if anyone was looking out the widow they would have witnessed this same event.  I have been through that area hundreds of times since and think about the incident nearly every time.  The OH ANG base and Wright Pat are not that far distant from this location.  In addition I would add there was absolutely no sound.

It came from the southwestern sky and went right over us. There was a airplane (flashing red &amp; blue lights, which was west bound) that appeared to be higher than the object. The object seemed to be moving slower than the airplane. It was heading to the northeast and it seemed to accelerate and then slow down. During the acceration, the object wobbled. We watched it for about 5 mins. Then, it faded out. It left no trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then saw a triangle shaped object, with three bright lights coming out of the bottom, fly extremely fast over the gas station. It was very very low and heading west. I thought for a second it was going to crash. It was completely silent, no sound at all. We both said at the same time, &#34;Did you see that?!&#34; and we jumped out of the car. It was about a mile and a half away within a few seconds. We were both pointing when it started flashing red, white, and blue lights extremely fast. It looked like fireworks. It reminded us of cameras going off all at once, over and over. It then disappeared in the distance. No one, as far as I know, saw it but us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying too low to be a plane, too quiet to be a helicopter, and too fast to be a blimp. What else is left?

We stopped for a traffic light in order to go Soutg on US-202.  As we waited for the light, both our eyes were caught by the gleam of an object that was about the size of a pea held at arms length, and at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  The object was at least several miles up in the atmosphere, as it was blocked out momentarily by clouds.  We were stopped, and we had the chimney of a house across the street as a point of reference.  The brilliant orb was suspended motionless, and then began to drift slowly in a south-westerly direction.  After about a minute, it took offlike a bullet in the same direction, disappearing from sight.  An amazing sighting!<n>

I was at Como Park on top of a very large mound that the kids sled off of in the winter, and ride bikes down in the spring, and locals sunbathe on top of it.  Anyway, my family and I decided to take a walk at the park that day, and I noticed how things seemed to be illuminated.  I don&#39;t know expactly how to explain it but I&#39;ll try...Flowers seemed brighter, more vivid, I told my boyfriend how absolutely beautiful it was and how great I was feeling, which is unusual, I usually hurt when I&#39;ve been walking for a while.  Anyway, towards the end of the walk, on our way out of the park, we stopped to relax and fly a kite on the mound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid down on the grass, at the top of the mound, wearing my sun glasses, and started looking around, just taking it all in (again this day was different somehow illuminated), and noticed kind of an aura above the trees that line the park.  I&#39;m commenting to my boyfriend all the beauty that I am taking special notice of, and laying on my back I look straight ahead and a little to the left and I notice what at first glance I thought to be birds darting back and forth at each other.  I did&#39;nt think much of it for a few seconds, until a hawk or some kind of bird flew in between my sight of the other whiteish objects.  So I know what I was looking at was very very far away, and thought that birds don&#39;t usually, that Im aware of dart aggressively towards one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon focusing on the objects, I noticed one central one towards the top of the almost formation.  There may have been five or six others, I could&#39;nt count them, they were moving too quickly, almost like in training, the top one did&#39;nt do much, but the ones underneath seemed to be following orders or something. They changed from looking white, to opaque when they sped up. I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could&#39;nt see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time I&#39;m witnessing this, I&#39;m yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I&#39;m seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.  Finally I got my son to lay down and he got to see just as they started to disappear.  I told my boyfriend that if I saw them then someone else had to see them too.  I told him I bet the government knows their there, and I told him that I bet a jet or some type of aircraft will go to that area, and I pointed the area out to him, and maybe within a few minutes, a jet went right past that very area I pointed out.  I believe, that is the other reason my boyfriend believes me, because the jet was probably sent by the government, and he know&#39;s I would never make up a story like that, and he knows I don&#39;t lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

4/15/06 10:45|Mays Landing|NJ|Cigar|3 seconds|Silent, 1000 foot long, silvery white UFO spotted|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79034.html|174|ndxe200604| Silent, 1000 foot long, silvery white UFO spotted<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a slightly windy April morning, and at least half the sky was filled with beautiful cotton ball like rain clouds in all sizes.  All were bright white on top from the sun light.  They didn’t appear to be real high in the atmosphere, maybe only a mile high, and were moving in a North Eastern direction at about 20 to 30 miles an hour.  I was sitting on the ground in my backyard watching my children play.  I was also admiring how beautiful the sky looked.  Then, I saw these two very large clouds moving along at the same speed as the rest of the clouds.  They both appeared to look very similar in size and shape.  The one was a little behind the other and further away in the distance.  All of the sudden a silvery white, cigar shaped object, from my perspective because it could have also been the side shot of a saucer shaped UFO, accelerated out of the front of the large cloud closest to me.  It came out of the cloud about the same distance as it was long. ! My estimate was that it must have been around 1000 feet long.  It slowed down very quickly, and then it moved back into the cloud in reverse at the same speed that it came out of the cloud.  This process lasted about a few seconds.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but it had windows with sunlight glimmering of them above and below the middle axis, and it didn’t have a cockpit on the bottom, nor did it have fins in the back to steer it.  Then, I looked at it front, and it didn’t appear to look any different from the back.  There were no tails fins or wings or anything that resembled engines anywhere on the object.  By the size and distance of it from me, I should have also heard the sound of an engine, but it was silent.  I waited to see if it would come back out of the cloud, but I didn’t.  Then, it occurred to me that the other cloud may have had a UFO in it as well because it looked very much like the one that the UFO came out of and it seemed to be riding along side ! of it.  Even today I always keep my eye out in that direction ! of my ya rd on semi-cloudy days to hopefully spot another UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I immediatly sat up in my bed and the first thing I recalled was a giant pure gun metal black triangle ship leaving at a slow speed to the north, it went behind a cloud then became visible again then disappeared into the clouds. I have a relaxation cd that I listen to(1 hr. long) when I go to bed, it&#39;s waves going out and crashing into a peer. I sat up in bed, and my headphones were wrapped around my lamp(I always turn the cd off when it finishes) and the volume was all the way up( I listen to it a below 1/2 the volume to relax. I turned the radio off and went into my kitchen and was so thursty it was like I had not drank for a long time, I gulped down a quart of orange juice. While in my kitchen I noticed dry grass all over the floor, I suffer from OCD and my home is always spotless; I walked around and went into my bedroom and looked in the bed and where my feet lay all the way up to around where my waist would be was dry grass.This morning I feel totally drained and tired, like I have been up all night and didn&#39;t sleep at all. I don&#39;t think this was just a dream, there are too many things not right all over the house, that seems to me I was outside during the night and something happened that I can&#39;t totally recall, all that is in my memory is the huge triangle that I saw and disappeared in the clouds. From my memory there were no lights or sounds, I recall 2 long diamond shaped indentions on the bottom, and then 3 or 4 lines across and at the points of the triangle were circles. What I remember about the triangle is very clear, it was very low and I saw the bottom very clearly.I know I&#39;m not crazy and the evidence around my house proves to me something happened last night, but I can only recall seeing the triangle leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not tell you how far out into the Pacific it went, but this thing was enormoius, about half the size of a full moon, three other smaller objects appeared to be drawn to it, and then it disappeared, this was no plane approaching Boeing Field for landing, it was traveling in the opposite direction, it had no lights, and the speed was nothing that I have ever witnessed before in my life. I called a few local t.v stations to inquire if anyone else reported this.  I would love to hear back from anyone witnessing these objects in the April sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/14/06 19:22|El Paso|TX|Other|less than 10 minutes|Crescent shaped objects over missle test range.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50130.html|184|ndxe200604| Crescent shaped objects over missle test range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking towards McGregor range, a missle range north of El Paso.    There I saw what I thought was a large plane flying rather high over that airspace.  It was extremely bright in the pre-twilight evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a flight area for planes landing at the internation airport in El Paso so I really did not think much about it.  I saw another jet fly below it.  The second jet was definitely coming towards the airport and even though it was approaching twilight, I could not see the landing lights. It was still too light outside.   I could see the form of the plane as a shadow. The second jet left a vapor trail.  This caused me to ponder and wonder how the plane flying higher did not leave any trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the  first craft and its glistening shape changed slightly to crescent as if it had turned to reveal its profile.  It seemed to have pivoted at the spot it was at.  It made no motion in relation to objects on the ground.  From my observation point - several miles from McGregor range - and having seen a commerial aircraft look like fly specks below this craft, I suddenly was aware I was looking at something extraordinary.  This thing seemed to be about 1/4 inch wide now from my front yard - but if it were higher than commerical airliners and further away, it had to simply be huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A speck of light sudden flew up from the ground east of the crescent and appeared slammed into the crescent at an extremely high rate of speed. I&#39;ve been involve in missles and I&#39;ve never seen one as fast as this one.  The crescent seemed to absorb the speck.  I thought at first that it might have been a missle from McGreor, but having just seen a commerical plane in that airspace, that did not make any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> McGreor would have closed off its airspace before any test firings.  Commerical traffic was still using this airspace.  There did not appear to be any materials falling away from the crescent shaped object as one might expect if it were hit with a missle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my point of view, it appeared another speck of light came from just below the crescent and also slammed into the crescent. It was not as fast as the first, but still far beyond convential craft speeds.  I realized there was no vapor trail from the smaller speck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that time, on the horizon appeared three vapor trails in formation that were rapidly approaching the area. I suspect they were from the near by airforce base, but that is nearly 100 miles from here.  They might have been from White Sands - a little closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cresent turned from sunlight white to a brighter blue white light and in just a few milli-seconds was too small to see. I assume it was traveling away at an extraordinarily high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three vapor trails that were approaching the area sharply did a 180 degree turn.<n>

There was an intense thunderstorm going on approximately 10 miles away, producing tornados, and the clouds were very eye catching. The clouds I estimate to be 75,000+ ft in height.    Upon walking back up to the house, I glanced in the west to take one last photo of more thunderstorm heads.   While getting ready to click the button to take the picture, out of nowhere instantly appeared, a semi bright glowing orange sphere, in direct sight, approximatley the same height as the thunderstorms peak clouds.   I successfully took two photographs of the object with a 3.2 megapixel sony cybershot digital camera.  It was only set at 640x480 at the time and the photos are full zoom(3x optical + 3x digital), But a picture is a picture high resolution or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There, about 200ft up was a glowing orb i wondered what it was and for a second i thought it was just a very bright moon but then i noticed it move slightly. i thought it was just a trick of the mind but then it started zig-zaging everywere at tramendous speed. then it would stop and hover in a different place and then a few seconds later begin another set of zig-zags. i also found that when it moved the whiseling soind got louder and more high pitched. it kept doing this so i dashed for the camera and just started taking pictures non stop. unfortunataly i was in so mutch shock i was too busy staring at the object than taking pictures of it so on allot of the pictures i didnt catch the object at all and due to the immense speed it was traveling at, it was hard to catch it while it was moving so allot of the half decent images are when its hovering, although i cought a few with it doing its manuvors. you can see the speed on the pictues because it leaves a streak were it has been traveling and the camera wasnt on a long shutter speed or anything like that. it did this for about 5 minutes, maybe less and then shot off towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i stayed at the window for a few minites after to see if it would return but it didnt. after i leaft the window i kept lisening out for a whisle and although i didnt hear it again i did hear what sounded like a fighter jet going over a verry high speed about 10 minutes after the incident. im not saying it was going after the object but im no were near a military air field and i dont think ive ever heard them in the area before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw this light, I would estimate at least 2-3 km above the city that kept my attention as I eliminated what it could be. It moved back and forth (very small changes) but in a fashion that is unknown to be done by human aviation (e.g. left and suddenly up) so I knew it was not a star either but it otherwise looked mostly like a star. When it moved it seems to change color (e.g. red flashing and different shades of white)<n>
4/14/06 00:18|Howell|NJ|Disk|5-10 min|My husband and I both witnessed a low flying aircraft which seemed to hover in one spot with bright flashing lights.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50121.html|189|ndxe200604| My husband and I both witnessed a low flying aircraft which seemed to hover in one spot with bright flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Howell NJ, and I  was at home watching T.V. around midnight in my family room when some flashing lights caught my eye out of the window facing a local farm off of Faifield Rd. The area in my view, was a local sod farm and as such, it is slightly wooded around the edges of the property, but mostly a large clear field along both sides of Fairfield Rd, near the junction of Rt. 33 and Brickyard road. The night was bright due to a full moon, and clear. The flashing lights caught my eye a second time, because unlike the many airplanes that pass overhead in the area, they hovered in one spot as they moved from left to right in sequence. I got up off the couch for a closer look, and began to realize that this craft was flying very low and hovering just above the tree line. It hadn&#39;t moved like a plane would have out of my view; in fact, it didn&#39;t follow any of the many flight patterns I have come accustomed to seeing with aircraft. The lights were very bright and flashing in sequence, beginning with white or yellowish lights, a bright red light in the center and again towards the other end the same white or yellowish lights. As the lights appeared and disappeared in sequence,they seemed to be rectangular in shape(almost like a row of teeth). Realizing this was not a typical aircraft, I frantically ran to get my husband out of the basement, and he came upstairs quickly! At this time we both stared at the object in amazement, not really sure what we were seeing. He ran outside to get a better view fom our deck. Noticing that it was definately a different type of object, he grabbed the car keys and took off in the direction of Rt.9. I stayed home with the children (alseep in their beds), continuing to look out the window at the object. The object hovered a bit longer, and then began to disappear under the tree line out of my view within a few minutes. I checked the time starting to panic a bit- it was 12:18 am. Before my husband returned,another interesting phenomenon occured. I had been watching a pre-recorded DVR event at the time of the sighting and it seems that for some reason- when I tried to switch to live tv mode, thinking the news may be picking up on the sighting ,it stopped working temporarily (the DVR function was on and it stopped responding). In fact, I had to shut it off and re-start the system to acquire a new satellite signal. My husband returned a little after 12:30. He said, he traveled east towards Rt. 9 in the vicinity of T.G. I. Friday&#39;s, but lost sight of it. Having been curious to see if anyone else reported this sighting, I googled  Howell NJ and UFO sightings this morning and was shocked that there were two sightings described on NUFORC.com that detalied to the letter, the same exact vicinity we had seen the aircraft!!! I then was convinced I needed to report our sighting. My husband and I both having seen it, and being educated rational adults, we concluded that we can&#39;t say for certain what it is we saw, but whatever it was, we agreed that it was : a low flying craft, the lights were many more and quite larger than on a regular airplane or helicopter, and amazingly it hovered (seeming to float) in one spot much like a helicopter would but silently!! Intestingly enough, speaking to my aunt this morning  (on an unrelated topic), who lives a few towns over in Monroe NJ, she commented that last evening the whole area lost cable t.v. power and it had not yet been restored today.  After she told me about the outage, I looked online for a connection between sightings and power outages, and found quite a few interesting instances. There was also an interesting connection between sightings and military installations and or nulear weapons satations. I didn&#39;t mention what we saw to her or to anyone else, because it is difficult to describe such an event to people since most are skeptics (including myself, until last night and more so after reading those other two entries describing the same spot!!!). It was definately an interesting experience, one I will never forget! I know now, that I will no longer hold the skeptics viewpoint, but can with confidence believe that something other than what is known to us publically, can hover over an area silently and more or less fly without a known flight path. Perhaps our technology is evolving. We live near a few military installations and this could be an aircraft that is under the classified testing phase and has yet to be revealed! Who knows- however, as I mentioned earlier, my husband and I both witnessed the event and we can state with confidence that the object followed no known flight pattern, and was hovering, or moving slowly and much lower than any other known aircraft, and what we saw- we had never seen before!<n>

Two star looking dots, lined up along a North/South axis, seemed to move slowly towards the south. They were actually so slow that at first, I thought they were stars and I was just experiencing a perspective illusion. However, the gap between these two objects and the closest constellation was constantly increasing. I thought of satellites maybe. They were not travelling as fast as satellites. Then, what are the odds of two satellites travelling on the same elipse, at apparently the same speed? There was neither any jet sound, even high altitude ones, nor any port, starboard or tail lights. I rusehd inside to get binoculars, which literally took me 20 seconds, but by the time I returned, I could not locate the objects anymore. Had they been static, I could never have told them from regular stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched them for a miniute or 2 when I watched one of the lights fade out. It was in the shape of a triangle before the light faded out. I ran inside and got the camera when I returned I followed the 2 lights in the sky across the sky and behind a street light infront of my house. It went to the other side of the street light and I watched it for maybe about a miniute until the lights just dissapeared into the sky and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We captured on our digital camera an object moving at a VERY high rate of speed.  We took 4 pictures in a matter of 10 seconds or so. First picture dictates the craft being Miles and Miles and Miles away Beyond the city lights across the lake. Second photograph dictates the object being within 1 mile of our residence and on an axis as if it were turning.  The Third photo dictates the object level again, headed south. Fourth photo shows no object in site. The object was shaped almost like an airplane however the speed it was moving was much too fast, so fast that we didnt notice that we actually had seen anything until we looked at the photos- and NO noise was heard. These photographs were captured over Lake Marston, in Denver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not hear or see this object. We only captured it in photos. Weird experience!<n>

There is a large window in my room with vertical blinds.  I walked past the window to the stairs, and on the wall reflecting from outside I saw 5 lights.  I brushed it off for the time being and said to myself that it was just light reflecting off of my car headlights, even though my car was parked away from the house that night leaving space infront of my house, and the front window.  I used the restroom, and went back downstairs.  Outside of my window I could still see lights.  They were low to the ground, much lower then that on a car, and much brighter.  I got an overwhelming kind of feeling inside of me, but I was tired and continued on to my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beside my bed there is window that comes just a few inches above my bed.  After laying in bed with my eyes closed and still aware of the lights, I felt a presence and I felt like I was being watched.  I opened my eyes and I saw outside of the window there was something standing there.  I was filled with overwhelming fright and I could not breathe.  That is all that I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning I was out of thoughts and did not think of the night before until my mother who has a room upstairs, mentioned this.  She asked me if someone had stopped by last night.  She said that very bright lights shined in her room, but only minutes later they were gone.  She said that this happened shortly before I went upstairs last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had such an experience.  My mother has had experiences more frightening then what happened to me.  She told me what had happened to her years ago after I told her what had happened to me that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Worth Metroplex at approx. 10:15pm central time.  The lights looked as though they were perimeter-like lights although I did not see any solide structure between them.  The lights were not flashing, amber in color, and absolutely no sound to the event.  I am positive it was not an airplane.  If you didn&#39;t catch it moving across your line of sight (e.g. star-gazing or in my case talking on the phone sitting in a lounge chair outside on my backyard deck) you probably would have missed it.

One was triangle shaped and the other cyllinder. I only glimpsed these a moment before the lights faded out. The second time I saw them was less than a minute later, not far up the road, the same to sets of lights. They lasted about 30 seconds and then also faded out. I picked my fiance up and we headed home. about 1 1/2 miles from my fiance&#39;s work on the same road the same set of lights again appeared behind us and I pointed them out to my fiance. My 2 children also in the car turned around and also saw them. This time they were over a baseball field and lasted about 45-55 seconds before fading out. We all agreed they couldn&#39;t be flares or fire, the shape was too perfect and didn&#39;t shift at all while we watched. (This happened in Pensacola, FL on 9 mile rd. the road was fairly busy and others had to have seen the lights as well.)<n>

It would only flash light.... at intervals. The object was very high in the sky above the pacific ocean. The object hovered, from a long distance away, flashing light. It was certainly unidentified to our point of view, for it didn&#39;t conform to the any known technology such as a helicopter, airplane, or any other form of aircraft. It was a lighting object, in one place for a very long time flashing powerful, light flashes in a perhaps purposeful or random sequence from a long distance away. There were no sounds. It was like someone had a flashlight hovering over the pacific ocean 1000s of feet above the air and was turning it on and off quickly in a strange order. It had some kind of purpose.... it didn&#39;t appear to be any kind of aircraft or satelite of any sort. It was definitely well below the earth&#39;s atmosphere and it carried on, hovering a flashing, for at least 20 minutes. After the lights disappeared, jet airplanes, perhaps airforce jets flew by ahead in the sky very high up, no sound, assuming a Mach speed rate at least. This was all in the night time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my location, the objects were southwest from me. I noticed a co-worker staring in the same location, when I asked if she was seeing what I was looking at, and she confirmed that there was something there. The objects did not move, and after @ 30 seconds, the first object simply faded away, followed by the second object.

I&#39;m always testing the limits of my camera. I took a few shots of this same area and saw nothing but clouds and showers during the shoot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I transferred the photos to the computer and looked at them that I saw a thin dark line in one shot. I cropped the image to 100% and cleaned up the image noise almost entirely but couldn&#39;t identify the object. I posted the photo and crops of the photo to the astronomy forum I&#39;m registered with online (Cloudynights.com)but no one there has identified it yet. I figured someone would recognize it as a plane or something but it still remains un-named.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am approx 12 miles NW of FLL airport and planes on final approach usually fly west right over my house or a few miles to the south prior to circling south and finally east towards the airport. I see what might be a hint of front landing gear to the lower right of the object but it could be remaining image noise. It&#39;s possible that this is a plane heading west prior to circling south for final. It&#39;s odd that theres no hint of a tail but it could be hidden by the clouds. The entire bottom of the object is dark but it could be a plane painted dark blue on the bottom and viewed directly from the side. I do take photos of passing jets sometimes and there are a few with dark painted bottoms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way...I can&#39;t identify it for certain or get any more detail from the image. In all probability it is a plane. I&#39;m sure your organization has access to flight plans and approximate location of planes at certain times...and the exact time of the photo is embedded in my EXIF data. Image was taken with a SONY DSC-H1 at 5mp (also in EXIF DATA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please advise whatever you find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for you time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

They looked like they were not moving, except for the fact that they were &#34;blinking&#34; in and out of view.  A comparison that I could make is that of the scene in the movie Superman when the bad guys were floating in space in aa flat glass that was spinning --only in this case when they looked like they would start to spin or flutter they would disapear in thin air-all of them at once.  Then they reappeared in the exact same formation, looking exactly the same and would flicker for about 10 seconds-until they disapeared again.  This flickering in and out happened about 4 or 5 times--then I didnt see them again. It was a clear day-only a few clouds in the sky--and they were so clear and so precise in its repeating formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background-is Im a 29 year old female. Im in college studying Sociology and Physics, and I have two young kids.  At the time it was happening --I called my boyfriend Marcus and was explaining to him what I was seeing.  There were other drivers on the road that seemed oblivious to what I was seeing--but I KNOW IT WAS REAL.  I dont know what on this planet would do that and act like it did--I have never seen anything like it in my life!!<n>

Then the vapour trail behind it ! And I know that Jumbo Jets vapour trail stays in the air for a while , so I know it wasn&#39;t a jumbo jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are there any aircraft that vapour trails vanish from ??? It seemed to be disturbing the atmoshpere around it , like a certain kind of force was being given off by the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The person driving a pick-up in front of me saw it too, they almost came to a stop when it crossed right over us.  It was shaped like a triangle and had just a pink glow underneath.  Now, I am not a crazy person and never saw anything like this before.  I am curious to see if anybody else saw it.  I am not good with directions but the direction it was going and that would have taken it Southeast headed towards Perrysburg/Bowling Green?  I called my husband, I wanted him to go outside and see what he could see because it was headed that way and when it passed over the phone was losing it&#39;s connection and it doesn&#39;t lose it in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know what it is about blimps that always make people want to look up and watch them, but i looked.  I didnt really see a blimp though.  It looked like one, but there was no tail thing, no pilot area, and especially no ad on the side. Before i actually thought it could be something other than a blimp, it spun around horozontaly, and disapeared.  It was pretty freaky, and i think we were the only two to see it.

4/9/06 13:30|Dallas|TX|Changing|5-6 minutes|My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52820.html|220|ndxe200604| My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all in the Immigration Rally in Dallas Texas on April 9th 2006 at around 13:30. Me and one of the people i was marching with saw this strange object changing shapes in the sky. We didnt know what the object was. We just saw it as a ballon or something. I jokingly said, &#34;look, bro , a ufo!&#34; we had a little laugh, not thinking anything of it. But the reason I am bringing it up now is because i was just curiusly looking at ufo pictures on the net (10/06/2006), and it was a ufo that looked exactly like what we saw on that day. I was overwhelmed when I saw the picture, and I immediately thought that some research area might want to know. It was a white cigarrette-like shape, except it moved around, and it seemed to make movements as if it was weightless (thats why we thought it was a balloon at first). It seemed to move like if it had no weight, like if the air was making it move. It was pretty high in the air, probably the elevation that a airplane would fly. The object didnt really seem to move location, it was just like standing still, like if it was just observing how the 300 thousand+ people were marching. At times the object would look like a horizontal cigarrette, and at times it looked like a bomerang like shape. It didnt seem like if it was changing elevation, just the movement of the object. Like I said before, I&#39;ve held this in for about 6 months because i just thought of it as a balloon. The pictures I&#39;m going to send are not from the Immigration Rally, but they&#39;re from some couple in Los Angeles. But the pictures are not of something that somewhat looks like what I saw, but they ARE OF WHAT I SAW, the SAME EXACT THING. In the pictures you can clearly see what im talking about when I said that the object changed shapes. Again these pictures are not mine, they were taken by a couple in Los Angeles. If ya&#39;ll have any question to ask me, please feel free to contact me by e-mail only at a_zenon08@yahoo.com . thanks for taking time to read my report. I hope it is to some help to! you guy s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s.- has anyone else from Dallas reported you about this similar object?<n>

4/9/06 02:00|Schererville|IN|Unknown|Several nights|Blue, green, red and white flashing lights sitting in the sky in NW Indiana sky for past two weeks.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD))|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50081.html|223|ndxe200604| Blue, green, red and white flashing lights sitting in the sky in northwest Indiana sky for past two weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know but I have been watching these things in the sky for the past two weeks.  First I thought they were helicopters flying around at night, but I couldn&#39;t hear any helicopters or see any spotlights.  Then I kept noticing them out every night.  There are sometimes 3 or 4 at a time in the sky and they just hang there.  They are blue, red, green and white flashing and pretty high in the sky, but if you even take a minute to look around you can see they are there.  I usually stay up most nights and like to look out at the sky and last night we came home late from a weather seminar and when I looked out the window I showed one to my husband.  He kept saying that what I am watching is airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to go to airports.  I kept telling him no way.  Saturday night I got the telecope out and tried to focus on this one &#34;thing&#34; in the sky and it took me a good 40 minutes to figure out how to use this telecope.  I finally got it in view and I&#39;m telling you I couldn&#39;t keep a focus on this thing to get a clear definite description.  I could see the lights of blue, green, red and white. It seemed like they were rotating in a circle or something.  Finally after 45 minutes this thing just moved behind a house roof in my view and then never appeared again.  My husband, after the 45 minutes, said yeah, that was strange, for it to be just sitting there for 45 minutes.  He is a big skeptic and a big logical chemical engineer.  He has an explanation for everything and he really was short for words.  Last night (Sunday night), we came home from a quick errand and when we got out of the car I started to point out to him at least five different spots in the sky where the same types of blinking lights were just sitting.  I am not insane.  He started to look around and I could tell he was a little uneasy about how many were just up there.  I said, well, I don&#39;t care if the aliens are going to present themselves to us, I just hope they aren&#39;t violent.  One other thing is one day last week when I was just watching the sky in my sunroom I noticed one that was sitting there.  When a plane (which I did know was a plane) came flying through the sky, this thing flew over rather quickly to where the plane was, stopped for a few seconds while the plane passed, and then just flew off. It was like it was checking out the plane or something. It is true though that if you take the time to look at the sky, you will start to notice things.  I have been taking pictures of chemtrails lately because they are really happening a lot lately over my town.  When I was coming back I heard a rebroadcast on coast-to-coast mentioning this site, so I decided to track it down and let you know that something is up there every night and it&#39;s not stars, and it&#39;s not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

I finally decided to file this in the hopes some else around here is seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking up from approx a 45 deg angle from my truck, I saw a round object at a very, very high altitude.  It was by chance I saw this; it was directly right of the cloud formation I was looking at and was quite high; I doubt I would have seen while even looking up at birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I tried to reason that it was a high flying aircraft or a maybe a passing satellite.  But after a very brief arch like movement in the sky, I viewed this object in one spot for at least 20-25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I grabbed my Carson binoculars out of my truck to get a better view which made a bit of a difference.  It was just motionless in the air (jumping around in my binoculars since you cant keep your hands perfectly still) and then I saw a blue, what appeared to be arrow-tipped shaped object rotate around the original round object that I was viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes the &#34;arrow&#34; seemed to be gone and the object seemed to emit a red and white (alternating) light. This could have been the sun/light anomaly but I was observing the lights in timed intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at this for another 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a third time I took the binoculars away to see where the object was in relation to the tree in front of me, but this time when I looked up I couldn’t locate it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to view this at appox. 3:40 pm PST on 08APR06.<n>

All of the objects were identical in size and shape and very near each other, in patterns not unlike that of birds.  The objects were white, and in the course of their movements tilted from side to side.  It was a clear day, and when the objects tilted toward the sun, they flashed silver glints.  They remained in the same patch of sky for the entire 10 min. + period, moving up and down slightly.  One group of objects, on the right hand side of the cluster, swirled around each other.  As far as I could tell, none of them ever bumped into each other or crossed paths, and there was always the same amount of space between them no matter which direction they moved.  I got to look at them twice, but the third time I checked, they were gone.  I didn&#39;t see what direction they moved off, or at what speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The answers come in 2 words: National Security   Maybe the reason why the sightings are so visible and frequent, is because some info on these aircraft will be released to the public over the next decade.

It was my first time flying on an airplane, and so I insisted on a window seat so that I could look out the window for the entire trip.  So as I am in the air (I am not exactly sure over what state and at what altitude), I am looking down, and I saw a perfectly-spherical object, it was much smaller then the 737 I was on, but probably twice as big as a car, and it was moving in the opposite direction of the plane.  It was moving very fast.  It was like it was made out of steel.  I was staring in disbelief at this object, trying to figure out what it could possibly be.  Then, as the sphere was almost out of my field of vision (I was sitting on the left-side of the aisle in the airplane), another object came into my field of vision.  This object was moving at exactly the same speed as the sphere and it looked to be made out of the same shiny metal.  But this object was not a sphere, it was a triangle or a pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was far in the distance and was faster than a plane, and much more silent, no noises. It looked like shiny dark silver, was hovering in high altitude and was completely silent, it was flying at a high speed, as if it was flying faster than a plane in the same hight above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was more sharp looking than a plain one, kind of like it had another part to it rather than a disk as whole. It flashed a sun like light once and another after a few seconds again, then when my friend caught my attention, I looked back but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The school yard had more than 100 people on it, there was 2 basketball courts on the left side where people played, there was trees on the left side around the corner of the school, there were houses infront of my followed by a forest like area, and the sky was mostly sunny and clear with only a few light, thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was a disk, kind of like a cigar, but looked more like a disk, and like there was some type of other parts to it sticking from the sides, it was silver, and shiny. It flashed lights 2 times. It hovered over in the distance, from right to left, and then disappeared. There was only 1 of them. It didn&#39;t make any sound, and was silent the whole time. It was going at a faster speed than an airplane, and smoother, plus there wasn&#39;t any type of trace of fuel coming out the back, such as the while gas/line an airplane leaves in the sky, but this object didn&#39;t leave a trail such as that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Some where in the Sierra&#39;s on interstate 80 there was a bright light, about 2000ft AGL. Looked to large, bright and still to be an Aircraft(Aircraft lights this close usaully show some transmited vibration). The light projected a flat and fanned-out beam into a cloud. Unlike a head light beam. I thought the cloud was causing this affect. After studying it for about a minute trying to justify it in my mind it then moved to the right and stopped. It dimmed and brightened then disappeared. As it disappeared there was a faint round fog or cloud like that which is generated by a high altitude jet engine but very faint. It formed a ball around where the light  pushing out then rushed slightly into where the light was. The light going out and the cloud forming took about a second. I continued to watch the round cloud and noticed the other could was gone. As I watched the round cloud still trying to rationalize what I saw the round cloud disipated in about 5-7 seconds. It was a clear sky and only some of the brightest stars were still visible. Being a novice pilot and watching stars as a pass-time I can only say this is something I can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be gone when all of the sudden to the west something was in the sky and all I could see was a huge bright spotlight illuminating from it. I could not see the shape of the ufo as the light was too bright.  It seem to be still or moving very slowly and I stood mesmerized watching it for about one minute.  All of the sudden it was simply gone, no noise.  I looked around frantically and did see a light shooting off in the distance to the South upward.  I could then see a purple haze or vapor against the morning sky trailing off in the distance to the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed in the sky as I continued my walk just southeast, some angular shaped white vapor trails like those an airplane would normally leave.  But since they were angular and zig zagging everywhere..I assume they also came from this ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/7/06 06:05|El Dorado Hills (Sacramento)|CA|Unknown|1 minute|Plane/Comet looking craft in Sacramento area.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50004.html|246|ndxe200604| Plane/Comet looking craft in Sacramento area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just about to enter the building where I work and I happened to look West and I noticed what appeared to be an airplane (very slow moving). The craft was only visible as a orangeish reddish light about the size of two large stars. I watched it for about ten seconds or so and looked down for about 5 seconds. When I glanced back up the craft had covered a pretty good amount of distance, became twice as bright, three times as large, and appeared to be shining a broad flood light just south of my location, which I found very odd. As I continued to watch I noticed low hanging, wispy clouds which accounted for the distinct appearance of the &#34;beam&#34; of light, but now the light spread was facing the rear of the craft. The object now looked like a comet without the long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it now had my complete undivided attention, which is good because the next event made me cast all doubts as to weather or not this was a publicly known craft. In a odd way the craft had now either exploded or accelerated in  a completley different direction, the best I can describe is NNW (45* difference in original path) and about 10* higher. When it did this, a very distinct shockwave caused the surrounding clouds to curl on themselves, similar to a plane breaking the sound barrier but in a much larger fashion (no noise at all for the entire duration of sighting). When this happened, the appearance of the craft slowly faded out. From the time I looked back up at the craft to the time it was no longer visible was about 50 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many many meteors, 1 meteorite and a couple of balzacks (the term I believe is given to a meteor exploding in the atmosphere, occasionaly audible) and as far as my experience has taught me, this was niether a rock nor known plane. Perhaps it was a satillite re-entering but I was under the impression that those are brighter and not nearly as slow moving. This craft did not at any time leave a debris trail as such other objects tend to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, it looked like a very slow moving plane at first with no blinking lights, then it looked like a police helecopter with a searchlight (but MUCH broader) and then a comet without its charachteristic long tail and finally, *pow*, gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The beam was very strong.  As it moved towards my direction I felt like I would have been in the headlights of an approaching vehicle, but it suddenly disappeared...no bang or explosion, no noise.  It left in it&#39;s place a kind of haze or foggy cloud.  This was in the southwest area of the sky and I&#39;m sure it was not an airplane or helicopter...it didn&#39;t move in the same way.  Very freaky!<n>

They were two discs flying side by side, very close to each other. They entered our atmosphere fast heading towards the ground, then they do a massive U turn and disappear into the night. Basically they did a giant U turn (entering and then leaving our planet). At there lowest point they were maybe 1 km from the ground. The sighting only lasted about 10 seconds. As they got closer to the ground, they got much bigger. Its hard to tell how big they were because the light they were emitting was so bright, but I would say they were at least 50 metres across........<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im so happy I saw it as I was literally turning around to go back inside as I saw it. If they had have come 2 seconds later I would have missed them completely.......<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the size of what a helicopter taking troops into vietnam looked like. It had a bright red light on it. My boyfriend turned around and looked out the side and it quickly turned around the car and flew over the pottstown area. We tried to follow it and we saw it hoovering over an area. Whatever way we went it keep feeling like it was the other way. It was a huge shape. When it passed us it was approx. 50 ft. above us but if it was a helicopter the trees did not move and we didn&#39;t hear a sound. It was silent. And it moved very fast. It wasn&#39;t a plane it was too big to be a small biplane(there&#39;s an airfield nearby) and it hoovered. I&#39;m not sure what it was but we have exhausted all our imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/7/06 00:05|Nevada City|CA|Light|midnight to dawn|Night sky lit up like daytime.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50096.html|250|ndxe200604| Night sky lit up like daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up suddenly and it appeared to be daylight. I looked at my clock which said 12:05 which startled me because I thought it was noon and was supposed to have met my daughter in town at 7:45 a.m. A closer look at clock made me realize it was midnight, not noon, since the display did not say &#34;p.m.&#34;. I ran around house and looked out windows. It was so light that I could see distant neighbors houses. I live on top of a mountain near a river in a very rural area and there are no street lights. Usually, night time is pitch black unless there&#39;s a full moon.  But even full moons don&#39;t light up the night like this &#34;light&#34; was. I looked up in sky and could see the moon which didn&#39;t even appear to be a quarter of a moon. The sky appeared cloudy. I knew light wasn&#39;t coming from moon but was too scared to go outside to try to determine what was lighting up the sky so brightly.  There were no flashes or bright objects that I could see by looking out all the windows. The light had a strange cast to it, not quite like normal daylight but just as bright as day time. The trees and plants were sparkling. I was very scared and locked myself in bedroom with my dog who acted strangely also. Since it was midnight I didn&#39;t call anyone but just layed in bed as the strange light came in windows.  I felt strange and subdued and frozen to my bed. I felt like I was sedated and the time seemed to be passing by faster than normal. These sensations could have been caused by my extreme fright though, and not be an outside force. It crossed my mind that the lit-up night was due to a huge craft hoovering over the house. I heard no sounds. I never slept but finally the real sunlight came with dawn and the strange light was gone. I have a friend who works nights as a security guard. I called her up later in the morning and asked her if she had noticed anything strange the night before without telling her about my experience. She said that she was driving home some time after 11:00 p.m. on 4/6/06 and as she approached Nevada City that the night sky seemed to be like day time. She said she had the feeling of a huge space craft hoovering above her car as she drove but she never saw one. I then told her what I had experienced just an hour after she had seen it.

There was also a slight drift towards the east on both of them. No sounds were heard and this was definatly not a plane as it would have had to be half a mile away for the lights to be this far apart.

So i decided to keep watching, as this aircraft got closer i could make out a bright orange light underneath it was also moving alot slower than a normal airliner i would say at least a quater of the speed not fast at all, as it went by towards east to my right as i am facing north. i could see it turn , now the wierd thing is that i saw the lights underneth as it turned and started coming back west! i watched as it got far into the wests distance then about 2 minites later i saw in the wests distance the lights coming back, as before it flew towards east turned and started coming back, now i could see it was going to be flying back directly over my house and right above my head. At this point my mouth went dry and i started to shake i guess due to the adrenilne as it got closer i stood on a chair so i was right out my window a looked right up at this thing. its hard to say how high up it was in the sky i would guess at about half the hieght an airliners would be at. I saw four orange lights type things undernieth that were always on.. there was also very small flashing white lights with a red one at the end.  now i could make out the shape of this thing and it was sort of triangler in shape but as i looked even further i could make out  very faint wings that were a semi circular shape , now with these wings this thing was huge! about the size of maybe 20 big jumbos side to side! but it was quite hard to make out the wings you had to realy look closely but thay were there. still making no noise what soever it moved west and turned and headed east and then went. I stayed looking for about another 10 mins but it didnt come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light also had a less bright, blinking red light occasionally. As I turned north onto Road 24 it was to my left and appeared to be moving parallel to me. I slowed to approximately 5 mph and noticed the considerable brightness compared to the village lights and the stars. I proceeded north and noticed it was tracking along with me somewhat. I looked away briefly and when I looked to my left again it was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky is absolutely clear (it just happened about an hour ago). It was perfectly silent. I could not tell whether it was a small object close to me, or a large object far away. I was in a parking lot of apartments, so only the sky above me was in view. It was heading Northwest, in a perfectly straight line, at a slow to medium pace. The lights never blinked, and were not very bright. First time I have seen anything unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both have an interest for all thing abnormal and interesting so we kept our eyes on them hoping. One of the objects did turn out to be a plane and veered off from the location while the other two orange lights remained, hovering in the air. We stopped on a very slow overpass to watch further because they had been hovering in the same place for well over a minute. We watched as one of the lights began to get brighter and brighter and slowly drifted around in mostly the same place, it just sort of floated. The second object began to slowly fade out until it was no longer visible. Just as we were fixing to start the car and leave (she had to be home by 22:30) the one still hovering seemed to have a new seperate ship drop from its side. The first ship then began to lower until it was no longer visible over the city lights and trees. After it was gone the new ship began to glow brighter and brighter just as the first did. We watched this ship hover in place for around 2 minutes until it finally began to lower and dissapeared just as the first had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three ships were orange/yellow in color similiar to the color of a street light. They were circular and generally had very little movement probably only travelling back and forth within a miles radius. They did have some horizontal movement but like i said they always stayed within a mile of where we first sighted them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occured in Oklahoma city, OK. I have contacted the news to see if anyone else noticed them last nite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing that i can possibly think of to debunk what i saw is that the location i saw them is about 45 miles west of tinker air force base which has been known to test new planes, but even still i highly doubt they would of been testing anything like what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had white lights on all three corners and a single red light near the rear.  I made no sound and was flying rather low and slow.  It was also moving with the FLAT SIDE of the triangle forward V so the top portion of the V was leading, not the point.  I just stopped dead in the parking lot and watched it disappear over the horizon going south.  Two other people were in the parking lot, but didn&#39;t acknowledge that anything unusual was in the sky.  I know this wasn&#39;t a plan because one flew by a few moments later and the light configuration was different, it made a sound, and followed a normal (for this area) flight pattern across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We then looked at it with binoculars, and noticed that it was a saucer. It had the rainbow affect to it, as if you were to hold an etched crystal to the sun. Further looking, we saw green lights on the side, spinning so fast the lights looked like they stood still. It faded in and out several times, then proceeded to radiate multi colored lights from the bottom (hence the rainbow affect) Pink, green, blue, purple, red, yellow, orange, and white. When, a plane flew under it, red was the promenint color. It was going from horizontal and tilting up enough to see the back, to almost vertical. After about fifteen minutes of the dancing, it moved quickly in a western direction. While none of the stars have shifted!<n>

I saw a Ball shaped object just below the clouds right above me a little to the right. I noticed it right away because the clouds were moving and it was not and the clouds were very low so it seemed very close to me. I would say that it was a little bigger around then a stop sign. It was a dull silver color almost like a grey. It was very slick with no type of lines or anything. it was Very smooth and round. I looked at it for a few seconds then it shot straight up into the clouds extremely fast.<n>

They paused over some areas and had some dim but far shining lights.  There were other lights too, about 10.  After about 45 seconds to a minute the objects started going really fast until we couldn&#39;t see them any more.  It was really strange.  As it went over the dog started barking, but when the object was gone the dog stopped.  Maybe really high frequencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The gas station had only one other patron who was inside.  As we left we saw three disk-like objects fly over head, hovering occasionally over certain areas.  We saw them for about a minute or minute and a half before they took off at a very fast speed.  There were only a few lights, maybe 5 to 10.  Occasional &#34;spotlight&#34; beams came from the craft, they were not very bright but they were visible for a long distance.  No beings were sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were standing on the back porch looking at the stars.  A few small planes were flying in the distance, we could see and hear them clearly.  Also, routine commercial flights were flying to the north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, over the trees, coming from the north, flying in a southernly direction was an object.  I put it between 2000 and 3000 feet in altitude.  It looked like a Motorola Slvr phone.  It was black, blacker then the night.  It also had two orbs of light, one on it front underside, and back underside. the front light was white, the back blue.  The lights were odd, more orbs than the bright points normally seen on aircraft.  The also did not blink.  They did not turn off or blink.  It moved very slow, maybe 30 knots.  It took a long time for it to travel over us and down its flight path.  It also wasn&#39;t oriented in a direction a normal plane would be in.  It flew with it&#39;s smaller sides oriented to the front and back (meaning, it had no wings).  There was also no sound from it, even though it was directly above us.  It was big.  It&#39;s length was like a C-5 Galaxy or B-1B. It&#39;s width little less than half its length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large Aircraft Very Low No Sound  At the speed and alt. it was flying at, only a helicopter could mimic it. If a helicopter was flying that low, we would have heard it, and felt it. It also would have been the world&#39;s biggest helicopter, too. If it was a regular aircraft, it would have had to have been flying at a great altitude for it to appear to move slowly to us. And if it was flying at 50,000 feet, its actually size would have been like a mile long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know a lot about planes. I know what all (known) modern American Air Force planes look like and can easily identify them. This was bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see it in a box down there, but I wouldn&#39;t mind an email back with information regarding other sigthings similar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was smoking outside of my house looking up the sky to check out the beautiful sky. I saw an (triangular) object with 3 dim lights travel at a rather high speed from east to west. I live rather close to the airport so I can tell what kind of normal airplane speed looks like up in the sky. What I saw was a high speed UFO with three dim lights travelling at a high speed without any audiable sound. I waited for at least for another 10 secs to see if sound can be heard. There was absolutely no sound. I couldn&#39;t really see the shape of the object because the it was dark but I certainly saw three dim lights with identical intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A star is trying to shine through the snow clouds, it fades in and out. I find that strange, because the cloud cover appears to be thick, and the snowfall is substantial, and it is just one light and it is quite bright. I go back to bed and the snorer starts up again. Now it is 2:00 a.m. and I go back to the kitchen, grab a glass of water, sit on the sofa bench and look out the window, it is still snowing substantially. In the same spot, as the bright light, in the western night sky, I see a cluster of stars, no particular pattern. I think maybe there is a break in the clouds. It is a captivating sight with the snow fall. After about a minute, the whole cluster of stars tilts upwards, and I can clearly see it is a circle, because I can see the outline of what appears to be something reflective, maybe metal? encircling the entire cluster of stars. It is definitely a ship, circular, dark black on the bottom with lights that when angled correctly, looks like a regular group of stars. The titled object remains in this position for several seconds before going over our roof silently towards the east. The object started high, flew lower, aprox. 25ft above the pine trees, from that distance it appeared to be the size of a two car garage, that’s my best technical description. I make no judgment as to what I saw, and the following is just an observation: I had the worst stomach ache I have ever had since giving birth. I couldn’t stay in bed as I was going pee every few minutes for two solid hours, and I had a raised mark, circular, about an inch in diameter, on my left hip. Our son woke up late that night, his pillow drenched in blood from one of the worst bloody noses I have ever heard of. It probably doesn’t mean anything; I am just noting it for the record and comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was too slow to be a falling star and it had control, like maneuvers. It wasn&#39;t free falling, it had steady control of itself what ever it was. it went behind some trees and I never saw it again. It got me a bit worked up and I had to pull over my car to get myself back together. Before I was no longer able to see this object, it seemed to be heading in the direction of Bold Springs, a little community north of Loganville, GA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They then circled each other once an were then joined by another light making three in total. They danced around each other at a vast speed and then became a  diagonal formation and sped off at great speed. They were orange in colour but their shape was undefinable, more of the like when someone has a torch and waves it around. There was alot of light pollution from street lamps. The moon was half and these objects appeared on the lit side of the moon suggesting a reflective surface. there was no background except for the stars, no mountains, houses or anything else. The aprroximate location in the sky was in and around the constellation of Taurus in a NW direction. They sped off in a Northly direction. These were not planes,jets,birds insects. I have seen things in the sky before and have always identied them as either planes,birds ,insects , satelites or space junk. What i witnessed was none of these, they moved to fast and at such acute angles.i have exeptional vision and my imagination is in check.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When the sky lit up from these blasts, there was an aurora around the light.  Random &#34;sparks&#34; from the blasts reached the vacinity of our house.  It was similar to seeing the sparks from a professional fireworks display showering down, although it came from a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point in the eastern sky we witnessed two crafts, again, traveling at a very high speed.

We are both 18 years old, and I am also a Member of my High Schools NJROTC and an avid aviation buff. We were walking home and were traveling North Northwest. I noticed 5 extreamely bright metallic objects in a steep bank to their port sides all in a column with equal spacing between each craft. They then vanished into the clouds, when they reappeard about 2-3 sec later they were in a steep vertical climb. They then leveled out and performed in tandem a bank to their starboard side, once again disappearing into the clouds it was very overcast the sky was so dark it almost looked and bluish gray this also made the crafts more visible. The crafts reappeared 2-3sec later again but this time considerably lower in altitude and were abreast of each other equally spaced and were in a port bank, after leveling out they broke off into a group of two and three with the two intrail and about 1 mile behind the other three. the crafts re-entered the clouds and when they reappeared they were lined up vertically one on top of the other equally spaced and hovered in this for about 15-20 sec. The higher craft then dropped down vertically ( No Gradual Descent ) and spaced out equally next to what would have been the &#34;base&#34; craft for the vertical formation and were now all horizontal. the craft regrouped into the &#34;two&#34; and &#34;three&#34; formation heading northwest they &#34;three&#34; formation was intrail this time with the &#34;two&#34; leading they were abreast of each other one from the outer right side slid up under the starboard side of the outer most craft of the &#34;two&#34; formation. the two craft in the rear now climbed slightly above the leading &#34;three&#34; but kept their vertical and Horizontal separation the craft were all spaced at equal distance. I observed no &#34;nav &#34;, beacon , or strobe lights on these Aircraft, nor was there any sound accompanying them. The shape of the crafts&#39; could be compared to that of a stingray except the nose and leading edges were smoothly arched and melded into one with pointed tips going to the rear of the craft along the leading edges of the &#34;wings&#34;. and from the rear of the craft protrouded a long narrow tail which was thick starting and the base of the craft and thinned out the further back it went making a smooth narrow tip at the end, the undersides of the fuselage were a dark gray almost black color. The flight patterns exhibited by these craft are like none I have witnessed. I only get Commerical and General Aviation traffic over my area and the crafts flight pattern does not resemble that of hulking airliners and small private aircraft. A general aviation flew over our heads about 4 minutes later and my friend who knows nothing on the subject of aviation looked up and said &#34; Now thats an Airplane.&#34; I went back to try and take some pictures but when I returned they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in hamilton ontario canada. I have witnessed 3 UFO sittings, over the past couple of months over Lake Ontario. In hamilton there is a street called burlington street which goes straight towards the lake, so you can see a full view of lake ontario while you are driving, i drive this was every morning around 7:30 - 7:45ish. My first sighting happened about 3 months ago, when me and my friend were driving down burlington street at 7:45, there was clouds covering the lower part of the lake, but it was a bright sky above the clouds, now all these sightings have happen while i was driving, so we only caught glimplses of them. all of a sudden we saw something shot through the clouds and into the sky, leaving behind a straight line in the clouds. we thought it was really weird.. the second sighting happen at the same time 7:45 while were driving on burlington street again, it was a clear sky, and we saw just a little swiggle in the sky, and it was not moving just sitting there, and i have seen video of the exact same sighting before, it was very weird. But todays sighting topped everything, as we were again driving down burlington street, looking at the view of the lake.. i thought i saw a bird glidding into the wind, but then i relized, it wasnt moving, me and my buddy started to take a closer look, it was a craft!! hovering over the lake, in a disk shaped form!! just sitting there watching all the cars going by on the highway. i know what i saw and it was for sure a disk. I know that there is alot of sighting over lake ontario, know i know why. Ive witnessed 3 of them. If you have any questions please get back to me.<n>

4/2/06 21:00|Hamden|CT|Oval|90 minutes|Three hundred fifty objects in the sky with different color lights moving, one disc shaped with on bottom yellow, green, red lights.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49936.html|301|ndxe200604| Three hundred fifty objects in the sky with different color lights moving, one disc shaped with on bottom yellow, green, red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At nine o&#39;clock at night we were outside and saw many objects flying, one, two, three, and even four at a time that was forming patterns in the sky. They were making triangles, lines, circles or just coming together and then apart. The night was clear, there was no noise, they were moving fast and coming together and then apart.  Three lights stayed in a line for about one hour and did not move.  One of the objects appeared disc shaped and was overhead close enough to see the bottom which had two green lights, two red lights, and two yellow lights underneath it.  It appeared as some of them were stars in the sky and then started moving.  Some of them seemed to have a red light down the middle.  There were blue, and green lights.  All together in a ninety minute period there was approximately three-hundred fifty objects in the sky together.  Some moving and some staying still.  We called the Police Department and the officer saw them and had no explanation but did not seem concerned.  He thought they were airplanes.  Airplanes make noise, these didn&#39;t, airplanes are not in the air  six moving at the same time.  There were eight witnesses to this, and nobody seemed to have any idea what this was.  We will go out again tonight and see if there is anything there.  These looked very suspicious and not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

AT FIRST IT LOOKED JUST LIKE VENUS (1/2 LIT)....WE TRACKED IT....IT SEEMED TO GET FASTER AS IT WENT BUT DIDNT HAVE A STEADY FLOW.  THE LINE IT TRAVELED WAS STRAIGHT WHICH LEAD ME TO BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE A SATELITE. IT SLOWED AND FLASHED, THEN ON EACH SIDE FLEW OUT TWO SMALLER BRIGHT LIGHTS.....STRAIGHT OUT. ONE TO EACH SIDE...SO IN MY SCOPE THERE WAS A SMALL LIGHT A LARGE LIGHT AND THEN ANOTHER EACH SMALLER GOING STARIGHT OUT. TOTALY AMAZING....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I though it was toy ballon that initially appeared over a tree but instead of rising upwards it kept a steady straight line flight from north to south as I watched it crosss over the local YMCA in Elizabeth New Jersey. It was not a balloon but a deep orange colored orb that was moving slowly until it dissappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is the second time I have seen this orb in almost the same setting in elizabeth, as I saw it last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My theory is that it may be a weather instrument launched out of Newark Airport which is close by and I am contacting the FAA offices at Newark Liberty International to see if this might not be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday the Sunday the 3rd was a day of heavy chemtrail spraying over Union County which I have documented on film.  Unfortunately I did not take any photos of the orb since I was too engrossed in watching the object move slowly across the sky as I was documenting the cloud anomalies from the chemtrails. The orb passed out of view and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to just vanish in its journey south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other time I saw this orange orb-like object last year the same thing occurred as it was there and then seemed to vanish out of sight, although it was floating much higher in the sky then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that &#34;chemtrails&#34; are, in fact, just normal contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.

It appeared like a reverse light projection.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some would even move straight upwards. No plane can move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and some friends were sitting outside on my balcony when we witnessed odd lights flashing and moving quicky across the sky. Some would even move straight upwards, as if levitating directly above them.  Sometimes one light would flash for a second then five more lights would appear in a line on the sides of it, all flashing. Then they would all go out at the same time. The lights were all white or had a blueish tint to them. Not too out of the ordinary. But their movements and stationary positions then disappearing is unlike any other aircraft I have ever been familiar with. They were probably about 3-4 miles away and about 1000 feet off the ground I suppose. I live on the third story and my balcony is pointed towards the South of Carrollton, TX<n>

It had two wings a light on each wing. The wings were on the side. it was circulating in the air and i tried to follow it but i lost it because it went over the mountains toward Jamacha Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/1/06 23:00|Hanford Nuclear Reservation|WA|Light|30 minutes|Unusual activity at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,WA|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76886.html|309|ndxe200604| Unusual activity at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this evening I was working at Hanford Nuclear Reservation as a Security Officer.  I was a fence line detail and paused for a few minutes to stretch my legs and was watching the flight corridor to SEATAC.  I noticed an airliner coming into view and then noticed a very fast approaching aircraft approaching the corridor from the southeast at about the same altitude.   I at first thought it could have been a private jet just coming into the corridor to line up for approach to SEATAC.  As this situation progressed I figured the fast approaching aircraft would bleed off speed and fall in line. But as I watched I noticed no active beacon or navs and thought it a little weird that this thing would already have his approach lights on.  The craft entered the corridor and at this point continuing his northwest heading at a very high rate of speed and what appeared to be the same altitude and as the situation progressed appeared to be on a collision course with the airli! ner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching a pit began to grow in my stomach thinking “oh no this might be a bad deal.”   The craft continued its heading and it appeared they were going to make physical contact.  The craft narrowly missed the airliner’s tail section (I am estimating because of regulation altitude per FAA standards) was about a 1/8th of a mile.  The thought crossed my mind that this may be an intercept mission by the Air Force and was engaging the airliner.  The craft then banked hard left, same rate of speed coming along side then accelerated banking hard left again this time at an impossible angle of attack cutting in front of the airliner then moved to left wing of the airliner then came to an absolute dead stop off the left wing of the airliner.  I watched in amazement as the airliner continued its flight path all the while keeping my eyes locked on the other craft.  Once the airliner was past the other craft dimmed itself to match surrounding stars.  I stood for another 20 minut! es transfixed on the craft. I then began to notice other airli! ners div erting in a northwest arc the first aircraft coming on the scene banking hard right as I believe enroute control diverted them because of the situation.  As this aircraft diverted I tried to keep an eye on the stationary craft.  I waited about 2 minutes then turned to see the location of the airliner which by my estimate was at about the same northwest vector as when the craft  approached the first airliner at.  I then turned to look and the craft lit back up and accelerated at a blinding speed to intercept the diverted airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It impressed me that this craft had a curiosity factor to it and it seemed that it was almost playful in its demeanor.<n>

After I reported this, I went back outside with my husband.  At9:45 p.m., there was a small plane that had passed in the eastern sky, going south to north.  About 10 seconds after this small plane passed, we saw a red triangle shaped craft in the southern sky, going east to west.  It made no noise, the sky was clear, and the object wobbled back and forth.  If measuerd in car speed, it was going approximately 50 miles per hour.  There were no other planes in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The tail got shorter in three distinct movements, and then the whole thing disappeared.  The sky was clear and the object was too high up in the sky to have been hidden by any trees.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but the angle of the arc was too slight for it to have crashed down at the time it vanished.  I have been unable to find any report of meteors in the area that night, and it was too big not to have been noted.  (Due to the distance/altitude, I&#39;m not sure what the size of it was, but I&#39;d compare it to holding a penny up at arm&#39;s length.)<n>

I was driving home, I made a turn onto my street to my apt and I saw this light reflecting on the street pole and the ground as I approached I stopped the car, I grabbed my camera. The UFO NEXT to the light pole hovering over the car I never saw in real life but I saw its LIGHTS and those you can see on the video. The one in the sky &#34;middle of screen&#34; flew across the street and went around the neighbors house and it was going their back yard. I got got this clip on film thru my cars back window &#34;sorry I was paniced&#34; I was getting scared after I parked my car. I was so freaked out, this thing at one point slows up and looked at me from behind the house, this is not the best quality and I didn&#39;t have a lot of memory left and I was really in shock, so I tried to get everything but there was a moment where it actually peeped around the corner of the neighbors house looking at me after I got out of my car, thats when I got scared, all things combined I started to panic so I went inside but this is what I caught on tape. For what it&#39;s worth. And no it wasn&#39;t a airplane, it was in my neighbors back yard and had lights like a airplane but different u can see the one hovering and lighting up the street light pole and ground, it was not visable but the lights ARE, these things were small and WIERD looking, almost like it was trying to be disguised like a airplane but it looked like a footbal or something with bright colorful lights. Too many colors for a airplane though, I was scared, but at first I thought I was seeing things. Please just watch the video. I want to say one thing, this thing gave me the CREEPS! Thats all I gotta say the creepers man, like it was going to get me if it found me. Part 1 of 3 Sorry it took me so long to redo this so everything appeared in proper sequence. The other motivator was people telling me it was a car, it was a helicopter ayda yada. This Original UFO footage of! the UFO that stalked me when I came home at 1am on april 07.

It was the about 1/4 size of the full moon streaking across (arching) the sky.  It seemed to break up, and get smaller the closer it got to the horizon, it also appeared first as a fiery ball and then broke down (got smaller and smaller with a tail.)  I have seen shooting stars before, but,never this large or bright.  I posted this on a photography website, asking if anyone else saw this--no one did.  I was told it was probably a shooting star or meteror...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
