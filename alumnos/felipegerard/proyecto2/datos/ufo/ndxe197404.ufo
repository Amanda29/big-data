While checking the perimiter fence on the east side, I turned off the golf cart, When I observed a greenish large light approaching from the west, the rate of speed , decent, angle indicated that this was an airliner on final approach.  The ceiling was  approx six to seven thousand feet w/very scatterd clouds, yet the light seemed to be hazy as if in a fog, when it came over the intercoastal waterway, appox 1/4 mile from my location, it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the south accelerated faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen, I viewed it for approx  5/10 seconds until it vanished. No engine noise was heard, If this was seen by me, it had to have been seen by the control tower as it was no more than 600ft agl.  I looked for any reports on the radio, newspapers, tv nothing was mentioned.. brief background, college grad/ aa/bs, military vet (us army).<n>
4/25/74 20:30|Brooksville|ME|Disk|5 minutes|Hovering saucer with blinking lights interacts with signals from flashlights. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91250.html|2|ndxe197404| Hovering saucer with blinking lights interacts with signals from flashlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place in the spring, around 1974, near Brooksville, Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were going smelt fishing around 8 or 9 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked through the woods to Walker&#39;s Pond and the inlet where we were going to fish. I carried a large cell flashlight, like an electric linesman would use. It was dark enough to need the light to watch your step along the path. There were other fishermen were positioned around the pond, we could faintly hear them talking and occasionally see their flashlights, but we were the only people fishing on the other end of the pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the waters edge, I noticed flashing, colored lights off to my right. I said out loud, &amp;quot;What the hell is that?&amp;quot;, my friend said &amp;quot;I don&#39;t know.&amp;quot; The other fishermen were too far away and from their angle could not see into the small cove where the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about a minute when I decided to blink the flashlight at it. Suddenly the lights began moving silently toward us, hovering just above the water. I could plainly see it was a saucer shaped craft, approx. 70 to 100 ft. wide, there was a dome-like bubble on top. The lights were going around the edge under the craft, yellow, red and white. I thought I could see shadows in the dome part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was freaked out and said to my friend let&#39;s get out of here! He agreed, we were standing right beside each other as we turned to run. I took about 3-4 steps and fell down. I immediately got back on my feet and called to my friend, silence. He didn&#39;t answer, which I found very odd since he had been within 5 ft. of me not 30 secs. before. I called again and he answered me from about 100 yds. away. He made his way back and asked what happened. I was confused and didn&#39;t know what had taken place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we regrouped to make our way out of the woods, we suddenly realized all the fishermen on the pond were gone. There was no one fishing, they had all left.Normally fishermen would be there until 2 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I cannot account for the time that we lost that evening. We don&#39;t know if we were abducted, but somehow a period of time is unaccounted for from that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 59 yrs old male, ex-Marine, not given to hallucinations or visions. This experience has stayed with me my entire life and have wanted to be hypnotized or regressed to find out about that night but haven&#39;t actually done it. My friend who also witnessed this, died about 15 yrs. later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will tell you this, after my experience, I KNOW Ufo&#39;s are real and I believe others who tell their stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently learned about the Allagash Abductions and was very interested because that group of abductees also flashed their light to attract the saucer. Their event also took place in the 70&#39;s. We both signaled the saucer with a blinking light! Weird!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/23/74 21:00|Houston|TX|Light|5-7 seconds|Satellite that behaved very unsatellitish.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from aviation mechanic.  PD))|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94666.html|3|ndxe197404| A satellite that behaved very unsatellitish<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born and raised in Houston, Texas I am 57 and the first 7 years of my life we lived off the approach to Hobby airport and also Ellington was a very active Air Force base in those days.  We moved to the north side of the city just about 5 to 6 miles south of what became Houston Intercontinental Airport now named Bush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about 18 or 19, I can’t remember the exact date but I believe the summer of 1973 or 74 a high school buddy and myself were out in the drive way at my next door neighbor looking up at the stars it was a clear night.  It was about an hour or maybe two after sundown.  We took note of a bright light about the size of a star.  Noting that there were no strobes, we figure it to be a satellite.  The house we were at is north of downtown Houston off US 59 at E. Mt Houston east about 2 miles from the 59.  We at first thought it to be Skylab, but noting it was moving from the south heading north and the news media said Skylab would be in a east west travel we figured it a weather satellite.  That worked for us up until it speeded up greatly.  It then went into about 4 or 5 loops then back and forth through the loops it just made and straight up and disappeared into the blackness of space. Total time of sighting was about 5 to 7 seconds from first sighting until it left our sight.  It streaked so fast there was the impression of a light trail.  As it was doing its maneuvers it would go bright to dim giving me the impression of a shape like a coin flashing in the bright sun light.  If it was a disk then at that altitude it had to be huge and it had to have travel hundreds of miles in a matter of seconds.  That date was over 40 years ago but I can still see it, it shook my buddy and my self up.  The first person we tried to tell was my Uncle who snickered at us.  We both decided not to tell anyone.  I have through my life but to a select few.  I have included it in a book I wrote on the subject.  I am by trade a Aircraft mechanic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Not disputed are three eerie green chevron shaped bow shockwaves|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32339.html|4|ndxe197404| UFO seen near Rosalia, WA in the early 1970s.  Shape of UFO disputed.  Not disputed are three eerie green chevron shaped bow shockwaves<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading home to Moscow, Idaho from Spokane, WA on Highway #195 when I noticed something.  I was sitting in the back of our car and looked to the west and saw what I thought was a satellite heading our direction and after a few seconds mentioned it to the rest of the occupants in our car.  After about 20 or so seconds I noticed that this object in the sky was creating a triple shook barrier in front of the craft.  These shock barriers looked like extended sergeant stripes, but were colored an eerie Halloween green color.  These shock waves or whatever they were, did not touch the prow of the object (unlike a boat cutting through the water), but there was a clear gap between the last stripe and the object.   The object seemed to me to be flying high and at a good rate of speed.  I thought it might be a SR71.  There was a orange glow behind it too!  The four of us agreed that we saw: 1)  The perfect triangular stripes that were ahead of the craft--- they seemed like they  were breaking up the atmosphere in front of it and that they extended well beyond the craft itself; 2) There was an orange glow behind the craft.  We did disagree on what the craft looked like.  My dad said it was low and he could see engines.  I say it was high and fast and my brother agreed with me.  My mom sided more towards me and my brother&#39;s version.  My dad pulled the car over, but I could not get around my Grandmother to get out and I did not want to get out on the traffic side because I did not want to get hit by a passing car.  So all in all I did not see the craft at its best when it passed in front of our car up in the sky.  I still disagree with my dad to this day on about how high up and how fast it was going and what it looked like.  However I must give this to my dad and that he is somewhat far-sighted.  He saw buzz-bombs and Me 262s flying during WW11.  I have talked to several physics professors at both the University of Idaho and Washington State University and none of them could explain the affe! cts of the apparent shockwave.  I talked to the then Idaho professor Edson Peck  (he wrote the the standardized textbook for electomagnetic waves for college students---no one could write anything better than it for at least 10 years) and he said that the atmosphere is considered a liquid, but any wave effect would not be visible to the naked eye.  Later I read a Smithsonian Air and Space magazine and it said the same thing , but they included a photograph of a supersonic jet with similar sockwaves in front of it.  The big difference was that the waves were coming directly off the prow of the aircraft and not well before it.  Also the article said that only a high speed camera like the one they used could capture the shock-waves that were apparent in the photograph.  Also I can remember after we got home to Moscow we read in the next day&#39;s paper that many people reported an orange glowing object to the Sheriffs Dept. that services the Rosalia, WA area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

4/20/74 02:15|Galesburg|MI|Disk|5 minutes|Huge circle of rectangular light beams shoot into the night sky on highway 94|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40778.html|5|ndxe197404| Huge circle of rectangular light beams shoot into the night sky on highway 94<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entering this report as it may have some bearing for researchers.  My three companions and I were traveling from Battle Creek to Galesburg at around 2:15 am on highyway 94.  The night was damp and foggy.  Ahead, we noticed bright beams of blue white light streaming into the sky in random, puslsating fashion, and an angle of about 60 degrees, right up from the ground.  The beams lit the cloud base, and from a distance, they created a wedge shape of beams.  As we got closer, these beams were observed to be very large, as large or larger than a searchlight beam.  They formed a circular pattern on the cloud base.  We slowed down and stopped the van opposite the lights on the berm of the highway.  We sat there for a minute, watching the rectanglar beams pulse upward in random patterns.  We figured there was a car lot or welding shop down there, as they came from below the highway and behind trees.  The number of them, however, and the late hour, convinced us that this could not be search lights.  The area they eminated from was about the size of a ranch home.  I decided to cross the freeway and take a look, and we all opened the doors and got out.  When I closed the door, the lights went out!  We stood there in total darkness for a second and then piled back into the van an got out of there in a hurry. The next day, remembering a mile marker that was close, we returned and found a pond below the trees where the lights had been.  A week later, a Cleveland Plain Dealer artist drew a sketch of a UFO she had seen hovering above her back yard.  She claimed it had thrown bright, blue white beams of light through rectangular windows around its edge.  Her drawing would have corresponded to what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WE WERE ABOUT 2 BLOCKS FROM MY HOME AND STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I LOOKED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW OF THE CAR (I WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND MY FRIEND WAS DRIVING), I SAW A DISC SHAPED CRAFT WITH A DOME ON TOP. THE CRAFT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET IN THE AIR HOVERING OVER A TREE TOP AND MAYBE 100 FEET FROM US. THE DOME HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RED BLUE YELLOW GREEN AND WHITE FLASHING AROUND AND AROUND THE DOME. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE SILVER METALLIC. I TOLD MY FRIEND TO LOOK AND SHE SAW IT TOO.  I OPENED THE CAR DOOR AND SO DID SHE, SO WE WERE BOTH STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR WATCHING IT. THERE WERE OTHER CARS ON THE STREET THAT WE HAD TO STOP FOR, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE NO ONE ELSE NOTICED IT BUT US. BUT IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND COLORFUL, LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE LIT UP AT NIGHT. THE CRAFT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL. IT FINALLY JUST ROSE UP HIGHER AND DRIFTED SIDEWAYS TILL WE COULDN&#39;T SEE IT ANYMORE.THE ODD THING IS THAT WE DIDN&#39;T TALK ABOUT IT AND I TOLD NO ONE AND I DON&#39;T THINK SHE DID EITHER. IN 1976 I SAW THIS FRIEND AGAIN AND I SAID &#34;DID WE SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WE DID?&#34; SHE SAID &#34;YES, WE DID&#34; AND THAT IS ALL WE SAID ABOUT IT. I DIDN&#39;T EVEN HAVE TO MENTION THAT IT WAS A UFO TO HER, SHE AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE MORE SIGHTINGS IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN YEARS APART AND ALL THE CRAFT ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO CALL IF YOU DO SEE ONE AND THERE ARE NO MILITARY BASES ANYWHERE NEAR THERE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.<n>

On this particular evening I witnessed a red ball hovering above the ground off to the east.  It was slowly moving around, drifting to the south and then to the north.  I was wondering how I could get it to come closer.  Believe it or not, I decided to go in the house and get my shotgun, thinking that the bright flash and loud noise of a shotgun discharging at night might attract it attention.  Well, I shot off a round, and the object started drifting closer!  It kept coming closer until I lost sight of it behind some trees in the cow pasture behind our house (we lived in a rural area north of Wooster).  Trying to locate the object, I stepped over the electric fence that bordered our propery and stood in the pasture looking around.  The object then drifted out from behind the trees and past by me, no more than 20 yards away from me and only about 10 feet off the ground.  It is hard to explain what it looked like, and it was 26 years ago, but I&#39;ll do the best that I can.  It was about 12 feet in diameter, a perfect sphere.  It&#39;s surface was completely covered with &#39;half-spheres&#39;, or domes.  Kind of a popcorn ball effect. The domes were different colors, red, blue, and green.  What I remember the most is how perfect those colors were.  They were just so pure.  The sphere did not make a sound.  It drifted by me, and then angled up to go over the telephone and electric lines that ran down the road to the west of our propery.  It slowly disappered as it drifted to the west.   I&#39;ve always wondered if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.<n>

We looked up and at about 45 degrees up there was a single large red/orange light that sort of pulsed slowly. It appeared to be quite large and moved very slowly across the sky. We ran in to get my stepfather since we were a bit scared and as we came back out, the light was just beginning to move where we couldn&#39;t see it because of the house awning and we ran around to the side of the house where we all saw it for another few seconds before it disappeared. One one of the pulses it just stayed dark. My stepfather called to report it to the police and their response at the time was that it was probably just a weather balloon but we were unconvinced having seen it with our own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The doc and all the left over guest was daparting the house and we were standing in his driveway. Some type of mental energy directed us to look up to the sky just above us. We all looked up and this object that was miles and miles above us was standing still and when it had all our attention it speed off through the air like a nasa rocket with ferrocious speed. It was still and then it speed off to let us know that it was there to protect the DOC or to confirm that we were in sync with the truth. I was stunned myself becouse I witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all confirmed that it was a UFO that evening.

I was ten years old and was outside at the end of our driveway waiting for the school bus to pick me up.  My only sibling, an older sister, was ill that day so I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That morning was notable because it was the first school day after the &#34;Spring Forward&#34; adjustment of the clocks and it was therefore darker than I was accustomed to.  Although it was &#34;twilight&#34; there was still enough light to see the barn, the cars and the fields around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was oriented to the east and was facing the road.  I was watching the sunrise as I waited.  I then had a feeling that &#34;I was not alone&#34; and looked over my shoulder to the north.  Hovering maybe fifteen to twenty feet off the ground was a sphere with a number of lights on it.  It was bigger than a basketball but smaller than a beachball.  It seemed metalic and orange, white and lavender lights seemed to eminate from it although there didn&#39;t seem to be any bulbs or lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it it was still and maybe twenty five yards away.  It began, slowly, to move toward me until it was only ten feet away and ten feet off the ground.  I was not afraid.  I don&#39;t remember feeling anything, not even curiosity.  It stopped moving but seemed to turn or roll but not on an axis.  It seems that I looked at it for ten or fifteen minutes but I have no recollection of its departure, nor do I have any recollection of getting on the bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next memory that I have is of sitting on the bus and being several miles from my house.  Over the years I have thought about this incident many times.  The facts that I have given here are directly from my memories.  There are other &#34;memories&#34; that include me being aware of a larger ship hovering in the distance beyond our barn, but I can&#39;t be sure that this isn&#39;t embellishment that occured over time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did tell my family about this but it was received with a &#34;Oh, okay.&#34; reaction.  I didn&#39;t tell my friends or anyone else until I was in my twenties.  The first time I talked of it, probably fifteen years after it happened, I experienced a strangely powerful emotional reaction that had me shaking and close to tears.  I have never had such a reaction since when either thinking of or talking about that day.  I submit this account to you now for the benefit of statistical compilation and because I&#39;m curious if others have submitted similar events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Petaluma California. My older brother and I were headed for the school bus just up the road while on our walk we spotted two small red brightly glowing spheres around the size of small basket balls. The red balls came out of some bushes across the road then danced around each other as they hovered in front of my brother and my faces. Both of us were stunned and starred as these hovering balls of light moved around us then proceeded up the middle of the road as they sped off. When the reached the top of the hill they headed straight up then disappeared.  My brother and I just looked at each other without saying a word. My brother shrugged his shoulders and shook it off as if he’d just seen something that didn’t exist. The other kids showed up at the bus stop and I asked if any of them saw the lights when one of the kids said, “They were car lights you saw you moron.” I dismissed the incident and really didn’t think any more about it till later in life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One summer night in 1977 my older brother, two girls and myself were in the Sonoma Mountains in Sonoma County California drinking a few beers like a lot of teens did at the time when my first incident occurred.  It was late night, around midnight, my brother and I were standing outside the vehicle while the two girls were inside when my brother pointed to some bushes around a football field away and said, “What the f---- is that?” I looked to where he was pointing and I saw a rather large glowing orange dome just on the other side of the trees. Not knowing what it was I replied, “I don’t know.” I became entranced with the object as it began growing in size getting bigger and bigger. My brother ordered me back in the car and said, “Let’s get out of here.”  I said, “No, wait, let’s check it out.” He once again ordered, “Get the f---- in the car little brother or I’m leaving you here.” I jumped in, we took off down the mountains and nothing more was said about it until a few days later when my brother asked, “Do you know what that was we saw in the mountains?” I replied, “I don’t have a clue.” My brother continued and said, “Little brother, that was God!”  Thinking he was kind of nuts for saying it I dismissed the conversation. This concluded this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on that same year, sometime in the winter evening, I was once again parked close to the same spot in the mountains with a different friend this time. It was around 10:00 pm. And we were talking about things we wondered about. I was saying I wonder why this and this happens when my friend said, “What I wonder is what the hell is that?” He was pointing to an orange harvest moon across town just above the other mountain range. I laughed and replied, “It’s the moon you idiot.” My friend looked dead serious to me then pointed up into the sky then said, “Oh yeah, then what’s that.” He was now pointing at what appeared to be another moon. Being rather shocked I replied, “I don’t know.”  We watched as another harvest moon appeared next to the first one in the mountains, soon a third one appeared.  “We’ve got to check these things out,“ Said my friend as he started the car and sped across town to the other set of mountains. We weren’t sure exactly where they were so we guessed and headed out Two Rock Road in Petaluma California. When we reached the coast guard base we drove up to the guard tower and asked if they saw three glowing harvest moons in the mountains. Needless to say they treated us as if we were nuts and sent us on our way. That night we never did find the objects or see them anywhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1984, Seven years later, I was around 24  years old working in Healdsburg California. I had to commute from Petaluma California to Healdsburg which was around a 45 minute drive everyday which I had to be at work by 6:00 AM. Needless to say I had to get up pretty early in the morning to make it there. I’ve always been a very anal person always making it to work at least 20 minutes early so I could have enough time to relax, drink some coffee and back in those days, smoke some cigarettes. This incident is a weird one as I didn’t remember most of what I’m writing about until much later in life. Anyway, I left to work one day at the same time that I always left then headed up Highway 101 north to Healdsburg. I remember leaving the town of Santa Rosa Heading North and driving through what used to be the usual desolate area of Windsor. As I was driving suddenly I started feeling very tired when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed two very bright lights, speeding up on me. I thought to myself who’s this idiot going this fast? As the lights approached the rear of my vehicle my car slowed down to a stop. I remember trying to give it gas but it wouldn’t move. Suddenly the car went completely dead and all I could see were very bright lights behind me. I remember wondering what was going on. The lights moved from the rear of my vehicle rising above my car, when suddenly I hear a loud bumping noise much like a tow truck would make as it lifts up a car. I felt my car being lifted off the ground. I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I remember jumping into the back seat and trying the rear door but it was locked. I remember white light all around me and being totally petrified. The next thing I remember was sitting in the driver seat with my engine running but parked off on the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief and wondered what happened if anything.  I stepped on the gas an my car took off up highway 101 as I headed to Healdsburg. I seriously didn’t know what happened and wondered if an! ything d id happen at all. I arrived to work, went in and poured a cup of coffee like I usually did. I lit up a smoke when and noticed one of my co-workers working. I asked, “Hey D--, why are you here so early?” D-- looked at me, laughed and replied, “Why are you so late?” I asked, “Late, what do you mean? I’m not late.” He laughed again and said, “You idiot, you’re 20 minutes late.” Being a little bewildered I put out my smoke then headed to the time clock where I realized he was right, I wasn’t only 20 minutes late but, rather 40 as I usually arrived 20 minutes early every day. When I got home both my wife and I checked our clocks and none of them were off. There were 40 minutes missing from my day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1987 Three years later I was around 27 years old living in a cottage on a hill in rural Petaluma California. It was sometime in spring around 2:00 am. I woke to the sound of a humming noise and looked at the walls above my bed noticing bright lights going around them. I tried to wake up my wife but couldn’t so I hopped out of bed. I went to my daughters room next to ours and checked in on her and she was sound asleep also. I walked in the living room which had windows overlooking the hillside. I looked out the window past the grove of trees and saw bright lights. There was nothing on the hill and the lights made no sense at all being there. The lights resembled the brightness of lights used by freeway crews while working on the roads at night.  I turned and noticed the lights bouncing off the wall mirrors so wanting to get a better look a headed out the front door, closing it behind then out off the porch into the yard. In my underwear I exited the gate which opened in to the field then looked up on the hill. About 200’ in front of me was a large glowing sphere hovering a few feet off the ground. The sphere resembled a small harvest moon and I remembered wondering if I made a mistake going out to investigate. I looked back at the house and seeing the front door closed I wanted to go back in. I couldn’t move as I seemed to be paralyzed. Being very frightened I looked back at the sphere when suddenly three images appeared standing in the field. The images were men which looked just like us except very tall. They were somewhere around 8’ tall, well built and had bald heads. They were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore side arms. The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed around 8:00 am on a Saturday Morning. I remember opening my eyes wondering if I dreamed the who thing. It almost seemed like hours were missing from my night and I had a small hole or mark right in the center of my forehead which wasn’t there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later the entire incident started coming back to me and I began remembering  what happened. It was around 2000 when it became very vivid. There were not only the three beings looking like us but also others resembling the typical aliens with big eyes and grey skin. The beings looking like us seemed to be in charge and the other’s worked with them. The mark in my forehead, which is still there today was made by a long needle type instrument which was inserted into my skull. This instrument was used for something I’m not sure of. They communicated with me telepathically and seemed to download and upload information into and out of me. In summary, the visit was a religious experience in which they told me God and Jesus are real and do exist. I wasn’t a religious man before these incidents but afterwards they changed my life. What we communicated about back and forth was very in-depth and there’s not enough paper or time to cove the topics but, I’ll reiterate in saying they convinced me Jesus is still alive and went on to say that they are us and we are them. We come from them as they are our past.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I still did not believe, thought from Huntsville, Alabama/NASA, but they convinced me otherwise at that thought, by one of the smaller craft disappearing &amp; immediately reappearing on the other side of the larger craft, next to the other smaller craft, this &#34;dance&#34; of disappearing &amp; reappearing continued by the two smaller craft for about four repetitions, then all left at top speed, disappearing before reaching the horizon of their slightly upward trajectory, at the end of the Gordon Lightfoot song on the radio.<n>

I later concluded that it changed speed and I was unable to see it any longer, and yet it was probably still there!   I went outside and looked up in the sky and all around, yet could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that it was definately from out of this World, and able to somehow change its physical structure.  It was as if it was alive, the object!   We lived in a new development in east Aurora, with open fields around our development.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I have told only a few individuals this story, and am now 50 years old and decided to share it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is definately real, no joke, and I am sure that other life forms must exist!  Peace,<n>
