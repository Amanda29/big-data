Light reappeared|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04322.html|1|ndxe199807| Saw a light in sky.  It did a strange turn.  Heard a slow hum, not like airplane.  Hum lasted for over half an hour.  Light reappeared about half an hour after first sighting and was traveling with a fast speed at a slanted angle towards the ground, and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of July 31, 1998, at approximately 4.00 am, I saw a faint light in the sky, that appeared to be a star.  I was alone outside, with the only other person a few feet away, sleeping in a tent.  He did not observe the occurance.  The light was moving, and suddenly it shifted, turning to reveal a brighttness.  It then shrunk back into the smaller light, and dissapeared.  I believe that the object was turning.  At first, I thougth this was an airplane.  I made this conclusion because there was a hum in the air, like an engine.  I figured that the plane would be moving away quickly, and the hum would dissapear.  However, this did not happen.  The hum continued for over twenty minutes to half an hour, when the light reappear, further out towards the hills surrounding the area.  However, this time the light was traveling downwards, at an inclined angel, and traveling at a quick speed.  It moved downwards, and dissapeared.  The hum still remained, but I feel asleep under the night sky before I could make another sighting.<n>
7/31/98 03:30|Las Vegas|NV|Triangle|3-4 minutes|Triangular object travelling slow, and low to the ground|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05792.html|2|ndxe199807| Triangular object travelling slow, and low to the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on my way outside of Las Vegas when I stopped to check my back tire. I got out my car, and three bright lights caught my eye.  I looked up and saw this triangular shaped object travelling only about 200-300 feet off the ground.  The three lights were at each corner, and it made absolutely NO sound.  It was going South East at about 35-55 km/m.  Very slow, (not fast enough for an aiplane with wings to fly properly).  It seemed to defiy the laws of Physics AND gravity. Completely soundless, it just seemed to travel nice and calmly away from me until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It had to be some kind of aircraft whether it be alien or American.  I was amazed. I could only hope that someone else saw this thing or anything similar.<n>
7/31/98 00:00|San Diego|CA|Other|non-stop|Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row.|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04323.html|3|ndxe199807| Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one&#39;s lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn&#39;t know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn&#39;t show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don&#39;t believe it was alien, but then again I don&#39;t have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you.<n>
7/30/98 23:45|Auanga|CA|Circle|2hrs|I was abducted and have video proof|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26218.html|4|ndxe199807| I was abducted and have video proof<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were watching 100&#39;s of them in the sky , this was not the 1&#39;st time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night after watching them for about an hour and 45 min. , we decided to (crash the ufo party) where we saw 5 of them land aprox. 1 mile away. It was very dark and was in the middle of nowhere. We drove across a dry riverbed way down this dirt road and then we came to this hill with an unused road and drove up it. It was very difficult getting up this road becase it was full of deep wash ruts. When we got to the top we sat and waited, I called my wife and told her what we were doing and laughed and I stated (ahh. there ain&#39;t no UFO&#39;s ). At that time we started driving down the large hill and it happened, We were lit up by what appeared to be two large lights (A large rectangle of light about the size of a car seperated by a thin black line, thats why it appeared to be 2 lights). I screamed to my wife who was still on the cell phone &#34;Oh my god I guess there are UFO,s if we dont come home we&#39;ve been abducted&#34;. I took off really fast and the truck was bouncing up and down from the ruts . My friend said stop but I did&#39;nt. At first the UFO was about 100yds away, within a second it was half as far away, one more second and it was passing over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we drove back to the house we were fixing up (a triple wide mobil home with no power or water). I was really tripping out, what was that? I lit a fire to keep us warm, it was really cold! my friend was tired and went to sleep on the wood floor with no blankets, so I keept the fire going. Every half hour I had to collect wood to keep the fire going. At 400am I had just put the wood on the fire and I looked at my watch and it was 400am, within a second I looked back at my watch and it was 600am, two hours disappered! What happened? My friend woke up about 700am and I told him what happened about the time, and asked hin to check my body fpor marks. To my suprise i had 5 needle holes, barely starting to scab on my sternem on my chest. We talked for a while an I laid down inside the mobil looking up out the window. this is when I saw it, what appeared to be a spec of dust went past the window very fast, I jumped up and looked out the window and saw a round translucent grayish bubble accelerating at an unbelivable speed. I estimated its speed to be from about 200mi per hr. to 10,000mph within about 4-5 seconds (My view was from directly behind it) It went across the valley ,up over a mountain and punched the sky and disappeared into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw another that day aprox 1200noon egg shaped and extreamly silver. We couldnt tell if it was solid or liquid. this was in Awanga also. The next day I was on the Ortega hwy. with another friend and he said whats that? It was a silver egg the same as the day before 100mi to the south, and I said I dont know but its following me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to the place we first encountered the lights, It was hard to find, but we found it. We couldnt belive it but there were these strange pictures of ailens on the rocks all over the place. the paint was a very strange green and kinda fuzzy. Ive been back several times since and all the rocks have been bulldosed, which is weard because it was in a place that there would be no reason to do any bulldosing. I have videos of the five ships landing that night from a distance and includes a vehical driving down to meet them,. I know a place (a aprox. 100 acre ranch ) where someone in a truck or car met them on a landing sight I have proof on a video. I belive in the video that aliens are visible in thier ships. Everyone ive have shown trips out Ive only shown about 8 people. I know these events are true and i havent worked since this happened to me Its changed my life!<n>

I knew this wasn&#39;t a plane because the craft didn&#39;t flash or blink.  It did not go strait across the sky, it kept on going back and forth and circleing around until it finally went across the sky and out of sight about 15 minutes after I spotted it.  When this object went passed stars the stars would disappear for about 10-15 seconds, this was the most mysterious event about the sighting.<n>

But the object stayed in almost the same place for over 50 minutes moving only slightly.  It was white with a beautiful red center.  The red was a steady light just like the white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:15am I was in the house putting a fan in a window. I saw what I thought was a plane just turning on it&#39;s landing lights.  We have an airport nearby that supports planes up to executive jets.  As I finished putting the fan in the window, I looked up again and the object was still in the same place.  I thought that was strange so I continued to watch it and it stayed in the same place.  I then went outside to get a better look.  It continued to stay in approximately the same place.  As I kept looking, I thought I saw red as well as white.  The only binoculars I have are a small folding pair, but I got them out.  I saw an irregular bright, white light.  In the center was the most beautiful red I have ever seen in my life--like deep crimson crushed velvet.  I don&#39;t know why but I couln&#39;t take my eyes off that red.  I was just totally fascinated by it.  The red was an irregular shape too.  I watched it for about 50 minutes.  After a while, I realized that it was moving at about the same rate that the stars were moving.  But it was not a star.  It was at least 10 times brighter than any star I have seen and bigger.  It was a larger than Hale-Bopp looked with the naked eye.  Also, I have checked every night since and there is nothing in that area of the sky that even resembles what I saw.  It was at about a 45 degree angle.  I stopped watching when it went behind the trees in back of my house. I understand that sometimes you can see satellites with the naked eye.  I have never seen one.  I suppose this could be one, but I have never heard anyone say they could see a satellite from inside their house with all the lights on.  And I have never heard anyone mistaking a satellite for a plane preparing to land.<n>

The|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04314.html|7|ndxe199807| We were driving north on Interstate 5, around Tulare,CA. We saw something flying in the sky with three big lights, like spotlights. The craft was rectagle shaped. It did not appear to have a tail or a front, though it did have 2 small red lights on the side. It swerved in the sky,going up(not too high) and dipping almost to the ground over the empty fields then it flew over the interstate low to the traffic. Turning around and doing the same thing on the other side of the interstate, again crossing over low to the traffic. It did this 4 times then we drove past it. After about 5 minutes we saw the craft again in the field to the left of us, again swerving up and down toward the ground then it crossed in front of us, turned in the field and headed towards the car flying just over the length of the van. We did not hear any noise coming from the craft. The color of the craft seemed dark other than the lights showing. We saw only the one craft at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full description is the same as the short description. Witnesses were a mother and 13 year old daughter who were quite mesmerized by the experience and kept trying to follow it. We did not stop, nor did other vehicles around us.  The second time when we saw the craft, when it came towards us we were the only vehicle on this section of the Interstate.<n>

The craft was very bright|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05757.html|11|ndxe199807| My wife and I were on our way home from San Diego late at night when I noticed an aircraft flying over head.  The craft was very bright and when we got closer it was actually hoovering over the desert with a very bright light illuminating the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were on our way home, Phoenix, from San Diego.  We were approximately 1/2 hour east of Yuma, Arizona.  She was sleeping, and I noticed this bright light flying above the desert off in the distance.  I didn&#39;t think much about it, not being familiar with the area, I just assumed that it was probably a crop duster or something of that sort. As we got a little closer to the object, I noticed that the lights were much brighter than that of a crop duster! The entire desert was being illuminated by this craft.  I woke my wife up, asking her if she believed in UFO&#39;s!  She was upset at being woken, and smarted off to me &#34;Why?&#34;  I simply told her that I was not a big believer, but that what ever I was seeing off in the distance was certainly making me believe.  When she looked, she too was shocked. We were getting real close to the object which was black in color.  We noticed that it was not one bright light, but a series of bright lights shining down.  The craft had one in each corner, one in the middle, and several others red, possibly amber, surrounding it.  A semi driver that had been in front of me this entire time pulled off to the side of the road, as did we.  The craft was actually hoovering over the desert with the middle light shining down bright on the ground.  It was as though it were looking for something.  The craft would then move very slowly twoards us, and as it got to where the highway was, all the lights, except the amber lights, would go off until it crossed over the highway.  Once on the other side all lights would return.  The craft was not moving incredibly fast while over the desert but, as it crossed the road it would do so in a hurry.  It concentrated most of its time on the south side of the highway and it passed directly over us severaal times.  It was a very warm Arizona night and we had our windows down, yet heard nothing.  We did not realize this until we were driving away.  My wife was very scared while we were parked there and she begged me to continue driving.  We co! uld see this object for a few miles as we drove away, then it just vanished.  Both of us agreed to tell no one what we had just seen, for fear of being laughed at.  I had to tell someone so I told my parents the next morning.  Yesterday, February 28, 1999, I was golfing with my cousin who was talking about the Phoenix sightings and explaining what the craft looked like.  I told him what my wife and I had encountered so he sent me via email your web address, as well as some pictures that he pulled off the internet.  The pictures that he sent me are very similar to what my wife and I seen, the craft was not huge, but not small either.  The lights were very bright yet, not blinding.  The whole experience was kinda nerve racking to say the least.  Yet, I have no doubt what I seen over that portion of the Arizona desert.  I now believe in UFO&#39;s, but I believe that it was a millitary craft given our location.  Yuma has a large millitary presence.  Anyway, thats our story.<n>
7/27/98 21:13|Castle Creek|NY|Circle|10 sec|Driving home from work on a clear night, I saw in the middle of the sky four bright lights grouped together in the shape of a square.|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04024.html|12|ndxe199807| Driving home from work on a clear night, I saw in the middle of the sky four bright lights grouped together in the shape of a square.  They didn&#39;t appear to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was the last tuesday of the month of July.  I had just gotten done with work, and it was about 9:13 pm.  I wasn&#39;t looking for anything, I was just driving home, like I did every other night.  (currently I am enrolled in college)  I live on a big hill, with a nice view, so when I got half of the way up there I saw some lights in the sky.  It was freaky, all I could do is stare.  Then I got to a patch of trees where I couldn&#39;t see anything anymore.  The sight scared me so much that as soon as I got home, I told my dad about it and I took my younger brother down to the exact spot to see it again.  When we got down there, it was nowhere to be seen.  I waited a bit, but nothing happened so we drove back home.  As I recall, there were four bright objects, floating directly in the center of the sky.  There is no way they could have been attached to anything on the ground.  Since then I put it in the back of my mind, saying that it was just my imagination, that I wanted to see a ufo so much, that I wanted to believe so much, that I created the image in my head.  I discredited the fact that it could have been a reflection in my mirror or window because there were no other lights around, and no one had been following me that night.  So I forgot about the whole incident, until today.  I just read the November 1998 issue of UFO magazine, and on page 9 it shows a picture exactly of what I saw that night.  I am now, totally convinced that what I saw that night can be classified as a UFO.  The sighting that was pictured in the magazine was taken in Texas, in 1996 and I had never seen the magazine before in my life.  I don&#39;t think that I could have made something like that up on my own.<n>

It didn&#39;t look like an airplane and didn&#39;t seem to be moving. I ran inside to get my video camera to get a better look. when I came back outside I zoomed in on the saucer like object and got a decent look at it. It was round maybe 10 feet in height and about 20 feet in diameter. I only got to look at it for about 2-3 seconds before my video camera shut off. The weird thing was that when my video camera is about to die it lets you know by flashing a low battery symbol right in the middle of the picture. I also went back inside to grab the spare battery that was on the charger, the light was on, on the charger indicating that the battery was fully charged, it also didn&#39;t work when I put it in the camera. After the ufo disappeared in a flash we tried the video camera again and both batteries were working fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve saw hundreds of shooting stars and this was nothing like anything i have ever saw.  I hope i didnt leave off any important information.  This was the most unbelieveable thing i&#39;ve ever saw in the night sky.  :)<n>

In about 25 sec.I came back with the videocamera and the binoculars.When we first saw the object at (90 degrees), it was round  like a ball,and the color was white.My brother looked through the binoculars(20*50) and saw the object a little bigger but the shape did not change too much.When I started videotapping,the object was at 45 degrees flying SE,I zoomed in 72 times with a 8 mm videocamera and the object looked totaly different.It looked like a cylinder,the front and the back were black and the midlle was white like a neon light.The light seemed to be comming from inside of the object.There was no sound at all.The object was probably flying 3000 miles per hour.I videotaped the object for 30 sec. and then  it disappeared in the clouds.The  witnesses were: Me,my wife,my doughter,my brother and his wife.I attach 2 photos of the object.<n>

We were looking west when appeared what seemed to be an airplane. It flew at very high altitude and was going in a southeast direction. My buddy pointed it out and shortly after I had the aircraft in my veiw, it flashed a light that was about the size of a flash bulb in a camera. Then it proceded to almost make a complete change of direction in mid-air and took off in a northwest direction, climing rapidly until it disappeared.<n>

It struck me as particularly unusual because their brightness and color belied the usual stars or planets that might be seen there. Their position was so low, the city&#39;s glare mkes it all but impossible that they could have been stars. And besides, their positions were drifting. &gt;From my vantage point, they appeared to be at least 10-15 miles away from me, but certainly it could have been much further than that. I was too far away to see a whole lot more than what I told you, but I certainly would be happy to confirm any other possible, more close up viewings of what was seen. These were NOT flares. From my vantage point, one of the lights was clearly moving upwards, and often times appeared to draw very close to the most upper of the three lights. Also, the lights did not blink and they&#39;re movements were not the movements of any conventional aircraft. i.e. helicoptor or plane. I wish I had been closer, and I&#39;ll be interested to see what the papers say I was looking at in the morning. I was returning home from work when I saw the lights, so I have no idea how long they may have been there before I saw them, or where they may have been. I only know I first picked them up at about 9:50, and lost sight of them at about 10:10. From where I was, they appeared to be drifting off further to the N/W, and I lost them below the tree line at that point.<n>

Me and some friends of mine were walking to my house when we saw a bright flashing white light coming from behind some trees.  We thought someone was taking pictures.  We stood there confused. Then this long bright neon green object with a flashing light was coming toward us.  It was about 40 feet above us and going about 3 miles an hour.  The guys I was with were not freaking out as bad as us girls. We were crying we were so scared.  The objects light was so bright it lite up the area like it was day light.  I was to scared to watch it for to long.  My friend and I ran to my house that was 100 feet away. I told my parents I dont remember what they said.  The next day my friends mom said she saw it to. She said it took off so fast and was gone. None of us ever talked about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The porch faces North-East, toward the Taryall Mountains and an expansive valley in between.  I was outside enjoying the view, when i noticed something above the ground about a Half-mile in front of me.  It was a black, oval-shaped object, hovering about 50 feet off the ground.  The object seemed solid, and i couldn&#39;t see any details, it was just shiny and black.  It sat there for about a minute or so then started to move East, accoss the valley, and it gained altitude to about 300 feet, as it did so.  The thing that really caught my attention about it was that it made no sound that I could hear.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of low-flying airplanes in the area and know that the sound they make echos through the valley, no matter how far away they are.  But the object didn&#39;t make a noise.  It glided slowly accross the valley and continued to gain altitude until it was above one of the mountain peaks in the distance, my best guess is that the mountain is about 10 miles away from my cabin.  The object then seemed to momentarily stop above the mountain and then shot away at a great speed to the North and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Many reports of seemingly unusual fireballs were reported to NUFORC and MUFON during the summer of 1998, we seem to recall.  PD))<n>

A jetliner passed near by the object.  Then a second object  passed near the first, travelling at a speed similar to the jetliner with an apparent heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late afternoon with clear skys and bright sunlight. I was taking a rest after chores on a hammock under a wooden sun shade on an otherwise open air deck. As I layed back, I saw a shiny metallic spot in the sky directly overhead.  It was maintaining a constant position in the sky.  In an attempt to determine what it was, I got my binocculars and returned.  The object had not moved while I was gone. With the binoccular I was able to determine an oval shape.  It was not a convetional aircraft, it could have been a balloon based on it&#39;s shape.  I could discern no further details of the object itself. While viewing the object a jetliner passed in the same viewing area directly overhead flying south to north. From my perspective, it seemed the jetliner had to also see the object.  The jetliner appeared to be 16-20 times larger than the object. A short time later, another object of similar size and shape flew across my viewing area directly overhead. It had a heading of NE to SE.  It approached the first object, and went past.  Speed was similar to the rate the jetliner passed. A startling observation for me was the very limited viewing field where I could see the stationary object.  If I left the cover area to an open area of the same deck, I could not find the object in the sky.  If I returned to the hammock and looked straight up I could see the object solidly.  The difference of shade and light surrounding me could be the cause of this effect.  I repeated this several times, until I was convinced near the hammock was the only place I could see this object. I then went to get my video camera.  Laying on the hammock, the object was too small to show up in the view finder.  That discuraged me from shooting tape. I figured that if the viewfinder couldn&#39;t see it, I would probably have nothing special on tape. All of this ocurred over about 30 minutes.  In that time the stationary object had drifted only a couple inches south relative to my deck shade. Finally, I just quit looking and went back to my other activities.<n>

While in front of the capitol  building I asked the kids to turn and face me.  The daughter grinned at me and I told them that I am going to take the picture again, thats when I shot the second picture.  However the object is not in the picture, but everything else is, the clouds are the same, the people in the background were there, however slightly moved.  The time between the two pictures was about two seconds.  Since our son moved his arm in the second picture, I told them to forget it, and we moved on.  The interesting thing about this and why I remember the date, is that we happened to have been in the Air and Space Museum during the shooting at the Capitol building.   We are interested in knowing what this.  Sun was to my daughters left side<n>

Soon thereafter, it was if one of the stars picked  up and travelled southward and then pulled a &#39;J&#39; hook towards the East.  The object was as tiny and appeared reddish in color.  The object moved at a steady pace across the sky.  It did not make a sound, nor leave any trail like a shooting star.  It travelled slower than a shooting star, and faster than a plane or helicopter, without any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening began with me discussing certain unexplained philosphical phenomena with two other people.  I took the angle of the scientific observer.  I wanted proof of the &#39;religious&#39; nature of the universe as the people I was talking to exclaimed to exist.  I have always had a week spot in me for the unexplained, but yet, I have never really experienced anything that strayed me from the scientific and the provable.  Yet tonight, as I came home, parked my car in the driveway, I looked up to a remarkably clear sky.  I focused on a constellation, I&#39;m not sure which, and, all of a sudden, a star like object began to move across the sky, starting in this constellation.  I watched it travel in my direction, although it was completely at a great distance.  It was if one of the stars just picked up and decided to move.  I watched it move across the sky at a fairly rapic pace without changing course.  Then it pulled a &#39;J&#39; manoever in the sky.  It began moving to the southeast and then the east and then partially toward the north.  It did not leave a trail in the evening sky nor did it make a sound as it travelled.  It did not blink like an airplane wing light.  It did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star, of which I&#39;ve seen thousands.  It was very deliberate yet quick across the sky.  I&#39;ve seen satellites which moved slower and continued on a straight line.  This object curved in a &#39;J&#39; motion.  I was cradled in my driveway by trees towards the southern end and it eventually disappeared behind the trees.  I wish I could say that I was under the influence but I wasn&#39;t.  The thing appeared and travelled like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky in Maine, where you receive more than the fair share of night time entertainment.  This wasn&#39;t what is ordinarily in my sky.<n>

We had somehow lost all of the fuel out of our left tank so we landed at Ft Smith to get some more fuel.When we left we were talking to Razorback approach control. We saw five lights lined up at about our one o&#39;clock position and they appeared to be headed right at us. I though that they were military hellicopters because the lights were very bright and we could not see any Nav lights. So I inquired about the traffic with razorback approach and they told me that the only aircraft within 20 miles was a B727 at FL200. I told him that I didn&#39;t know what it was but there were 5 aircraft that were in formation headed right at us. Immediately after I had said this the aircraft either made a sharp turn or turned off their lights because the lights just faded out and were gone. Well me and my instructor just looked at each other hummed a verse of the Twilight Zone and kind of laughed it off. I didn&#39;t think anything of it untill the tape of the Art Bell show was passed around our specialty at work. You see I am an Air Traffic Controller on the same specialty with Joe and Mike, the ones who were on the show and the controller working the position when the airline pilot reported 3 lights that he thought were at FL500 or higher. The difference was that I was in a PA28-181 at about 6000 ft when I saw five of these objects. I thought that my report might help to substantiate their report and I was amazed at how similiar the details were even though the altitudes are very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to fit it all in the summary.

It stayed stationary for seven minutes and then branched out from the front and seemed to &#34;grow&#34;. Five smaller craft were seen circling the main craft as if to protect it. The large craft seemed to dissolve and disappear.For several minutes later The small craft still circled.<n>

About fifteen minutes later a sationary white light appeared, slightly farther away but in the same initial vicinity of the first.

We were on our way to San Antonio and pulled over on the side of the road to check one of the tires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught a strong cinnamon smell that brought back dormant memories of an experience I had back in El Salvador in 1969.  I was eight years old and El Salvador was at war with Honduras which was a neighboring country.  There was a nightly curfew and my older brother (10) and I used to sneak out of the house and go across the street to an open field to watch the lightning from the bombs in the far distance.  My brother went back to the house for a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt something grab my ankles and lift me up to the sky.  As I looked up, I saw what looked like a huge bubble with a bright blue light inside.  I still remembered as the blood rushed to my head.  It felt like a long time that I was hanging upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I found myself inside this bubble sitting in a chair and looking down.  I felt someone&#39;s hands on my shoulders but could not see anyone.  Someone sort of holding me down.  I also heard what sounded like dolphins chirping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bubble moved around the neighborhood for a while.  I could see my brother was outside again with my grandfather looking for me. They called for me and I could hear them.  They could not hear me.  I must have been about a hundred feet above them.  Finally the bubble came down near the same field and I &#34;fell out&#34; on my stomach.  My brother and grandfather heard me crying and eventually found me.  I have never told them this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I knew it wasn&#39;t a satilite because it was to bright and it wasn&#39;t a plane  becuase there was no noise and was slow blinking and would not blink at times. We watched it for a 2 minutes and then it just vanished . I&#39;ve seen satilites before and they were much smaller,les fast and they never blinked and they disapeared when they lost contact with the sun.

No sound; moving slowly.  All 3 lights extinguished simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my house for work in summer 1998.  I stepped from house into driveway and noticed three bright lights approaching at just above treetop level from the south.  I first thought they might be helicopters with search lights.  But then I realised that the lights were beaming forward and not down.  Straight line formation...some distance between lights but I am unable to estimate how much distance.  I listened for engine sound, but heard nothing except crickets and distant creek sounds.  The formation moved slowly from south to north.  I was dumbfounded because this is a rural area and nearest airport is about 15 miles south of here.  Just as I was wondering why three aircraft would be flying so low, in formation, and with landing lights on, all three lights extinguished suddenly and simultaneously.  I then observed no strobe lights or wing/tail markers.  And of course, still no sound.  I strained my eyes trying to see anything in the darkness that followed the lights being extinguished, but could see nothing on this otherwise clear night.  End of incident.  I regret not filing this report sooner, but I have been fascinated by recent similar sightings reported on the Art Bell show.  Except my sighting was NOT in triangle formation, but was instead in straight line formation.  But it was 3 lights for sure.  And the sudden, simultaneous extinguishing of the lights was certainly most peculiar.  For three seperate aircraft to do this would require military-like precision.  I hope you don&#39;t mind receiving this report since it is 1.5 years old, but I thought I should finally tell somebody what I saw in early morning hours of June/July 98.<n>

We then went outside to see what he was talking about and we saw a light flying in the sky from south-east to north-east, and then another follwing it. After watching this finally go out of site, my Dad then looked way into space to look at the stars and then noticed 2 more light flying REALLY high up and traveling VERY fast for being how high they were. They were following each other perfectly and were headed in the same direction the other object had gone to. The next day I heard that the spaceship challenger had been conecting with a russian sattelite. We heard that the same exact place in the sky we saw the first two were exaclty were the news had said it was seen that night. We then knew what the first lights were, but what really got us was the other two which were way out in the atmosphere, and it was impossible for the ship and the satelite to get that high and to go that fast. We also heard of the same report from other people. I still think about it and cant see an explanation other than it being two UFO&#39;s chasing it, and they were quickly catching up with it.<n>

I looked up towards the north and observed what looked like a low flying plane traveling at a very high rate of speed.  But after looking at it for a while I noticed it didn&#39;t look like a plane at all, it was actually two lights on the botom of some craft that bliked at the exact same time, about 3 second intervals.  What was so srtange is that there weren&#39;t any other lights on the craft.  Also  it was going really fast. It was out of sight within 3 min. It traveled along I 80 for about a min. and then took a sharp turn to the north and flew out of sight.  It went towards lake Michigan not towards the airports. It just didn&#39;t look like any plane I have ever seen flying around here, with the two airports (Ohare and Midway) I see planes all the time and what they look like at night, this just didn&#39;t have the normal plane or jet lights.  There was also a Pasenger jet off in the distance and we compared the two and they looked nothing alike.<n>

Every star in the sky was visible. I was on my garage roof stargazing as I often did on nights like this. I was looking north towards Polaris when suddenly everything went dead quite. Every frog, every bird, every creature in the bush simply stopped. The silence was deafening and incredibly noticeable. I felt a terrible feeling. Just then, to my left, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a flattish, rectangular object break out over the tree line. (I was in a fairly rural location about 3 miles outside Fort Frances) This object was metallic with a red glow emanating from the underside. It was fairly low flying, maybe 100 feet in the air although it was difficult to tell because I don&#39;t know how big it was. It cleared the trees, but not by much and some of those poplars are 60 or 70 feet tall. I could see definition in the object, a kind of hood and a grill on the underside. It seemed fairly flat although it was pitching to its left so I couldn&#39;t see much of its side. The object made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I instinctively crouched down on the roof the second I saw it but I go the terrible feeling that it saw me and knew that I saw it. It flew quickly across the sky at that altitude and disappeared behind the peak of the house. As soon as it was gone, I ran down the length of my garage roof and dove through my open window. I slid of my bed and onto the floor, turning to look back out my window. I guess I expected it to come back but it didn&#39;t. I was only inside for less than a minute in a panic, but somehow i got the nerve to get up and go back outside. I just had to see it again to know that I really saw it. I went back out my window onto my garage roof and climbed up onto the highest peak of my roof. I surveyed the entire sky, 360 degrees. It was completely gone. No plane or helicopter or anything I know of could have disappeared like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was glowing gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying on my back looking at the stars peacefully. I do this often as I am interested in cosmology, astrology, ufology etc... I then saw a triangle come into my vision in the east centre of the sky. It was glowing gold all over. The object, while essentially triangular had a back edge that came into the craft, Concave, with the back edge actually being two sides that came into a point about one sixth of the way from the furthest back edge to the front point. The object then flew silenty and very fast right across the sky in a straight line as if it were travelling past earth and this seemed more likely as when the object went west it stopped moving across the sky but rather started to just get more distant. The light got fainter and then it disappeared into space.<n>

Saw Ufo above trees on our right about 3,000 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing Ogden exit at 1:00am or so my husband saw a disc shaped object hovering above trees in the sky about 3,000 yrds. away from Highway 82. He commented &#34;There are no blinking lights from this object which is unusual for a flying object at night.&#34; I stopped our van off the side of the highway. We saw a disc with lights all around it glowing from inside. We saw the shape of it very well; maybe from city lights or moonlight. The left and right side of the disc shape was not a pointed shape as in most photos. The shape of the disc had sharp corners more like rectangles, yet it looked like a disc. It hovered above trees for a few minutes and moved toward the right behind trees. So then I moved the van a few feet and saw it hovering again. The disc was close to the trees, did this once more, and we followed again to be able to see it. And then it went behind trees one last time and it disapeared from our vision. It did not spin or glow, it just hovered in one place for a few minutes at a time and slowly went behind trees toward our right. I had never seen a Ufo before. My husband saw one in 1978 while on duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, 04:30am with 250-300 hundred other soldiers. As for this recent sighting this July 98&#39;, the oddest aspect to him was that there were no blinking lights, no apparent motion at times, and that the shape was large and seemed cigar shaped to him. We drew pictures of what we both saw. And what we saw was very similar. The best and frankly the only way to describe it was to draw a picture of it. And on a side note we noticed that there were many military bases nearby. We are from Wa. and we were driving to Pa.<n>

At the time of the sighting there was a severe wind storm in the city of Calgary and a tornado touched down to the norhteast of Calgary. Also, the international airport was shut down temporarily.  No small aircraft would have been cleared to fly at that time. The observers have never seen a ufo and were very skeptical before this event.<n>

It covered an arc from my chair to when it went out of about 125 degrees if you were to follow with your arm in about 7 seconds, not like a falling star as there usually much quicker and don&#39;t waver like this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As above three witnesses, all wondering what we saw I didn&#39;t count my characters above so I hope you got it all.<n>

I was not drinking, i was 14, i just love to look at the stars.  the lights moved in a way that no earthly thing could possibly move, they were much to agile and FAST.<n>

I thought it could be a sattelite.  It was a clear night and all the stars were visible.  Then the light stopped dead high altitude at least 38,000 probably more.  No cloud obscuration.  As I wondered where it had gone (as the sky was so clear it was now camoflaged by the millions of other stars)   Suddenly, two smaller (in magnitude and size) lights/star shot out from behind my vertical position (overhead) and criss-crossed their paths almost at right angles, in the dark sky, strangely or coincidently they crossed just at the position where the previous star/satt/light had stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion was that it was a large Satt, which coincidently crossed the paths of two smaller satts which coincidently cross each others paths at right angles.  Not surprising considering the number of satts in  orbit.  The smaller satts though were really, really fast and I saw them positively but only for two seconds.  No trailers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No engine sounds. I am a pilot.<n>
7/18/98 10:07|Longmont|CO|Triangle|3 to 5 minutes|Traingle craft about 60+ feet in diameter was sighted flying west of Longmont CO.|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04262.html|66|ndxe199807| Traingle craft about 60+ feet in diameter was sighted flying west of Longmont CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large dark triangle craft spotted. On 7-18-98 at  about 10:02 PM Mountain Time (04:02 Universal Time) as my family and I drove west away from the Wal-Mart store in Longmont Colorado we spotted a craft flying from the southwest of our area and moving northward across our field of view.  It was moving slowing and in a slightly jerky manner and this caught my attention.  It seemed to have a great many red pulsating lights with some white lights in the central area.  At the time I wondered if it were a helicopter.  It descended toward the Longmont Airport, but it did not follow the usual flight path and was actually going down toward the farm fields just south of the airport.   We lost sight of it behind trees as we drove and I forgot about it.  About 5 minutes later (about 10:07 PM) we were driving north toward the west end of the airport when we spotted a craft that looked like the first one.  We assumed it was the same one.  The craft looked like a very large plane ascending from the west end of the airport.  It was moving slowly and was large enough that as it crossed the road ahead of us the lights on the front passed over the farm fence west of the road as the rear lights were still well toward the east of the road.  The length appeared to be 50 to 60 feet.  As we drove up toward this seen we assumed that this was merely a very large plane.  The airport normally handles small twin engine and single engine aircraft.  Thus, we eyed the craft as it slowly flew over the road about 50 feet above the ground. I commented that it was lit funny because it seemed to be box shaped in that the rear had at least two red lights one above the other, and the front of the craft had two or more red lights in a vertical column.  In the middle area were other red lights and some white.  All four of the four people in the car continued to stare at the craft  on the West side of the Airport as the car was greatly slowed.  The craft ascended slowly toward the west to about 120 feet above the ground and about 1300 feet west of the road.  Then it appeared to stop! and hover.  At no time did the lights change direction and the craft at no time banked or turned around.  Because the lights did not change their orientation we continued to assume that the craft was still going west even though the craft was now growing larger.  Suddenly we realized it was headed back towards us, it having never executed a turn, and it was ascending as it moved back toward the airport in a slight northeast direction.  It came very near the rear of our car (from 160 to 200 feet).  No airplane motor noise was heard - at other times we have heard the engines of smaller craft passing over the road.  It passed over the road at about 170 feet above the ground.  As it neared the road three people in the car saw that the craft was shaped like a triangle with three equal sides.  The leading point was facing the northeast in the direction of its movement.  Many new lights were seen on its bottom hull.  Along each of the two side angles there ran long tube like lights, like neon tubes, that were a yellowish-white.  These tubes curved inward near the west end of the craft and came to sharp points. Just east of each was a large round red light and toward the west two more red lights.  Near the apex of the triangle, the east tip, was a large round recessed hole in which was a bright light-blue light.  While the red lights had been pulsating earlier as the craft was moving west, now all the lights were continually on with no blinking or pulsation.  The lights provided enough illumination to allow the viewers to see that the craft had a dark triangle hull.  We quickly tried to pull over onto another side road to we could get out.  We saw the craft move silently toward the middle section of the airport area, just north of the runway at about 350 feet above the ground.  Then the craft changed course and moved northward until it was hidden by trees near us.  We drove to another location where we could see the surrounding area but the craft was no where in sight.  AT this point it was about 10:12 PM Mountai! n Time. It appears that as the craft lifted off from the airport grounds toward the west it was moving with the flat side of the triangle toward the direction of its movement.  It then stopped and hovered a moment as it lifted the east tip of the triangle and reversed course in a slight climb back over the airport grounds.<n>

The object was moving back and forth, remaining over my home and backyard tree.  It was as though there was a giant lightbulb in the air.  From my point of view, the light was as big as a large tire.  It was so bright that it lit up every inch of the tree that it was near. The air was just so still and unmoving, there was no wind.  There was no sound, it was an uncanny silence.  Something wasn&#39;t right. There was also a vibration that seemed to be shooting down upon my house with such a force that the cement floor beneath me vibrated.  The area was suddenly cast with a red glow and then it was gone.  Everything was back to normal.  What I had thought had only been a few minutes, turned out to be almost a half hour.  That spooked me.  The next day when I awoke, I thought it was just a vivid dream.  I walked outside and was throwing out birdseed for the birds, I noticed little droplets of metallics in the backyard.  Not one or two droplets but 5-6.  Stuff like that would never be in our backyard, and no one knew where they had came from.  But the really strange thing was; was that the droplets must of been melted/hot when they fell in my backyard, because some had dried attached to something.  I heard once from an UFO report that people have seen UFO dripping metal, like the ships were melting. What I really remember is... I wasn&#39;t scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit samples to NUFORC, and we will report on our attempts at obtaining the evidence.  PD))<n>

To the east, high atop a hill, we saw four circular bright lights.  The lights were situated in a circle, and seemed to be stark or platinum white.  They were very bright.  We were not aware of any towers, construction, airplanes, etc. that could be located on the hill.  We parked in our car, along the road and watched for about 2-3 minutes.  We then, went to an intersection where we could see straight down the road, and had even a more clear view of the lights.  They did not blink, they remained perfectly still.  We left.  We returned to the same location the following evening- July 18th, at approximately 2200 p.m. to see the lights.  They were gone.<n>

It was a misty night, the three streams of light were shining from above a house not really low, but quite low enough to see a ship if you were upstairs and looking out your window. The lights were definatly not coming from a house but through cloudy misty sky above the house. The lights were moving across the floor as if it was scanning for something, i then ran home very scared and told my dad, we walked back to the scence which was about 60 yards from my house and there was no sight of anything. Please could you inform me if this is a regualr report as it has been on my mind for 2 years now.<n>

As I was driving I just looked up and was also watching the car in front of me on I-90 and suddenly I saw  this object that appeared in the clouds and it was very shiney and bright and it looked like a giant bell. It was only in the clouds for a matter of 30 seconds maybe a little longer and then when I went to make sure I was not getting too close to the car in front of me, it vanished. I saw no trails and I know that it was not the blimp nor was it an aircraft as it was stationary.I picked up my children and we looked again in the clouds on the way home but the clouds were starting to clear and we didn&#39;t see anything.<n>

It was about 50 Feet tall and had about 10 beams of white light comming out of the bottom of the lower half of the triangle (Like a skirt)  They were about 20  feet long in length and glowed like Florescent Lights.  The beams were straight but they came out of the ship at a slight angle.  The object moved away and the beams of light disapated as they blew away in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the beams of light were generated by some sort of Ionization from the vehicle.  The beams were of almost equal lenghts even though they  were from farther up on the ship.  The light from the moon on the left of us distracted our vision from the right where the diamond was heading. At that time we pulled over next to an off ramp and tried to see where the diamond went to but it was too late.  There were other vehicles on the off ramp backed up.  I don&#39;t know it they was what I saw!  But it was unusual for a off ramp to be backed up at 2:15 in the morning.<n>

Me and my wife observed for about 2 minutes, the object was well above the clouds. The rotated so that the arch was now lined up and it looked like a saucer with a bump down the center.  The oject began to move east ward at first slow and then picked up speed.  It was out of sight in about 5-6 Seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object glowed when it picked up speed because I noticed when it went past the clouds about 10 miles ahead of us I saw the light flicker through the clouds giving away its position.  I would say the object was well over 70-80 Thousand feet due to the amount of flutter of light that was seen.  It wasn&#39;t easy getting the exact shape due to this affect but me and my wife keep trying to catch the exact objects shape.  The amount of speed and distance it traveled was amazing.<n>

This object followed a straight line.  I had the cruse control on at 70mph and the cloud was infront of us but by the time we got to the spot where the object crossed the object was not  disapearing over the trees.  I kept on driving and about 10 seconds later we came to a clearing where we should have been able to see the cloud on our right but it was gone.<n>

The craft was above me and moving from my right to my left and away from me at an angle. It was grey in colour and although the sky was a leaden grey and so were all the buildings around owing to their windows reflecting the sky and each other to a large extent,it was still clearly visible to me. There was little or no wind. It looked a frail structure to me and reminded me of an old air ship type structure though this could obviously be a subjective interpretation and totally incorrect. It was entirely unlit and in spite of it being a quiet night there was no sound that I could hear. Just as I thought it would fly on out of sight it stopped dead and without any movement either forward , backward, up or down, it began to rotate slowly around within its own length to finally face back the way it had come - a 180 degree turn as if on a mechanically fixed position turn table in the sky! It then immediately began to retrace its flight back along what seemed to me the exact path it had just taken- unlike an aircraft which obviously would have to bank and fly in a wide circle in order to maintain lift and stay airborne when turning back during flight. An inflatable air ship would not have performed such a mechanically precise manouvre. Only a helicopter could get near to this performance and a helicopter aint this shape and dont fly at night without lights.... To continue - again it surprised me by stopping dead and slowly turning left ! through 45 to 90 degrees and heading off at the same fixed speed behind the Natwest Tower. I did not see it again but it left me in no doubt that I had just witnessed something quite extraordinary. I had the distinct impression that it was robotic in nature and was performing to some preset co-ordinates. No humanoid would want to fly like that as it would not be much fun apart from any other consideration. But a change of plan seemed to occur as its return path seemed to be a waste of time and very laborious. It initially flew above the tallest structure in the City- The Natwest Tower- and having turned back finally angled off behind it; which some person may be able to determine its size from perhaps? I seem to dimly recall a similar report in the English paper The Sun which I think reported &#39; A flying banana &#39;in its usual sensationalist way.<n>

There are some fields across the street from where we were.  The area is rural.  We saw a lot of them maybe 15 or so, some of them could have been the same one.  We saw about 4 or 5 of them at a time that were for sure separate crafts.  They had orange white and red lights on them and some green when we looked through binoculars.  Some would just disappear right out of the sky and then reappear on the opposite part of the sky.  They didnt get that close to the earth, they stayed up in the sky aways.

However, we receive many reports of objects that turn out to be &#34;twinkling&#34; stars and planets, and we feel, therefore, that we are able to identify such reports fairly readily.  We apologize to the parties who submitted the report if we are wrong, which is possible.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> while night fishing we watched a silent craft slowly hover over a large pond over a 4-6 hour period making its way across the body of water. It looked very much like a star in the night sky but was very close cause we were able to see its reflection in the water proving it was in the imediate sky. we also witnessed it avoid detection from any planes flying higher above. so to us that also proved intelligence and with the reflection in the still water we were convinced something was several hundred feet in the sky, able to fly for hours silently, and directly over the pond. again it looked almost exactly like a star in the sky but was obviously not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object we witnessed for several hours was silver and the size of a star at night in the sky so much smaller than a plane more like the size of a car. The reason i believe it was defintely a ufo is because of two undeniable concrete observations: 1. it reflected in the water very obviously and the stars did not because of their distance. It would be hard or close to impossible to detect with the naked eye because of its size and likness to the stars. but we watch it slowly move over a 4-8 hour period across the water from one side of the pond to the other. we continued fishing all night while we monitored its location. when the sun began rising we decided to leave and go home approximately 5 miles away. 2. we continued discussing what it could have been besides a ufo but we were having trouble with anything man made that could fly without sound and didn&#39;t need to refuel for that long. so at the house when we got there we decided to have a beer and go out on the back porch and finish our fish stories and the talk of what it might have been. by now the sun had rose and it was daylight i was the first out on the porch and i started to search the sky for the ufo cause i was still trying to be skeptical when i saw it in the sky above the lowest set of clouds above the house. so it was above the lowest clouds but not as high as airplanes. i called my friend out and we both witnessed the shiny star like object in the sky. now we were both convinced as there were no more stars visible due to the daylight and this object was clear as day and stationary as clouds occasionally passed in front of it. So it was now complete daylight and i saw it clear as anything a silver shiny object still looking like a star even in daylight hovering in the sky all alone. it wasn&#39;t shiny like eye wincing or flashy but rather like a star just shiny enought that we couldn&#39;t make out any detail. I wish i had a camera or proof cause i have no doubt that this object was sokme type of flying craft and displayed intelligence by the fact that it travelled with awareness to its surroundings. I formulated a weak but possible theory that it might have been studying the pond and eventually maybe us because we were fishing and did catch some. And that we noticed it and when we were leaving it i believe moved from across the pond to directly above us cause i asked my friend while we walked back to the car &#34;hey wasn&#39;t it across from us cause now its directly above us&#34; but with it being night i was still skeptical and with the way the moon seems to follow you in a car i thought it was just my perception. but after seeing it in the daylight and at my friend&#39;s house i have no doubt this object followed us for what reason i have no idea casue it did nothing unusual besides be in the sky. I saw something very clear from 12:30 pm at night until 8:00 am or so in the daylight and it was very clear to be a craft but shiny enough that i can&#39;t give any more detail. i tried very hard to see something distinguisable something to add to its desciption but it was a perfect replica of a star impossible to further describe which to me is the perfect camouflage and a mastery of craft. we watched it for maybe an hour in the daylight then my friend drove me home and we just came to the conclusion that between us we know we saw an ufo and all these crazy descriptions that people describe are not acurate to what we saw. i have to say that i know i saw a ufo for at least 10 hours and it never moved eratically or made any noices but the shininess did dull to almost it being invisible during the night when a plane passed over it then it slowly reglimmered to its star like shininess. again showing it having intelligence. I believe it either watch us catch the fish or knew we could see it  and from either one of those reasons followed us to my friends house which without it interacting with us tells me that this object was very confident in itself and in an observation mode where it feels no threat or fear of being exposed. i have never noticed anything like this since but without the water to use as a marker so to speak i! don&#39;t s ee how i could notice such a well hidden craft. this is what i believe people should look for decoy stars not what they see in the movies. please let me know if you have any other credible stories very similar to this cause this is the truest your likely to find cause this is what we honestly saw and i can&#39;t embellish it more cause this is all i saw but seeing it in the daylight has made me a concrete convinced believer!<n>

Lights flashing this BADBOY (if you &#39;ve never seen one in action you dont know what your missing...) raked the ground with its spotlight and did a search of the area ...usually this does not get any attenton ... cause these guys are allways flying in formation and playing with the public ( shining lights on everything and everyone...) but it certanly seems interesthing in light of what i saw..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is where i debunk myself and offer some Possible explanations...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1). The light was really a jet ..since the air field ONLY supports CARGO airplanes...then this would mean that what i saw was more then likely a &#34;Covert&#34; Aircraft that was not supposed to be here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2). Training Manuevers with the idiot pilot not following safety regs. And had his lights off... but then this would bring me to the first anwser and since this craft is not currently under support in this trainign<n> <n><n> enviromment the question remains what exactly were they (the military) doing endangerering the public..as every one knows that it&#39;s agaisnt FAA Regs. to fly ANY type of AIRCRAFT without running lights!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3). What i saw was really something unknown ..(wouldnt hold my breath any time soon!!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> as a small note ... i called the operations NCOIC and he informed me that he was not aware of anything being out of the ordinary....but concidering what i was describing no running lights, my familiarity with diffrent aircrafts etc, he informed me that he would notify the tower and see<n> <n><n> what was hoing on…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/98 22:30|Chapel Hill|TN|Formation|4-5 seconds|I never knew there was a way of reporting this without being exposed or ridiculed.  On the approximate date at roughly the time indicat|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13213.html|85|ndxe199807| I never knew there was a way of reporting this without being exposed or ridiculed.  On the approximate date at roughly the time indicated.  I was sitting on my back porch with my witness.  The night was very clear and we could see all the stars.  I often watch the skies and plans transporting people from Nashville (I think) to Florida.  I know that they usually are somewhere around 25,000 to 30,000 feet high.  I also fly R/C aircraft, and have flown small aircraft (as a student pilot). We were looking to the east when suddenly two lights appeared on the horizon, apparently side-by-side. We both saw them at the same time, and they were on a westerly path.. right over my home.  They were coming VERY FAST at (I estimated about 10,000 feet).  As they went over our heads, we tried to see the shape of the objects, but it was simply too dark to determine anything.  There was a trail behind them, like fire (guessing), and they were only in view (because of my house roof) for about 3-4 seconds.  At that altitude, I expected to hear something (it was a quiet night) but neither of us heard any sound whatsoever.  I don&#39;t know of any military aircraft that can travel (estimated) from horizon to horizon in less than 8 seconds.  The speed would be much faster than anything I know of at that altitude.  I do know that we have helicopters with silent running features, but certainly they are not nearly capable of speeds like that. My witness and I thought maybe they could have been two meteorites, although they did not appear to be losing altitude to either of us.  In any case, I watched the newspapers and television news for several days to see if a couple meteors may have hit somewhere far west of us.. but no reports. It really bothered both of us that we didn&#39;t hear anything, not even a sonic boom (which I thought was not posssible for an object traveling at speeds far above speed of sound at that altitude).  We waited patiently to hear it, but nothing at all! I&#39;m not a physicist, and could be wrong what it takes to create a sonic boom. Wish I had more to share with you, but that&#39;s all there was to it. In a nutshell, they were very very fast, about (maybe) 300 feet apart going the same speed, with no sound at all, and far exceeding the speed of sound.  My best guess is that they were at about 10,000 feet (much lower than commercial aircraft, and far higher than small aircraft fly).<n>

It had lights placed in a sporadic fashion on the bottom and made no sound as it moved toward us. It banked to the right and was gone in a few seconds going toward the Olympic Mountain Range over the Puget Sound. We spoke to the Police Officers that witnessed it shortly after at the Police Station. We were advised by the Police Department to report the sighting to the Natl. UFO Hotline which we did. It began when we heard the Officer on a Police Scanner call in about a very bright light in the sky above his car in a area that was at the time being developed. We left and went into tne vicinity and witnessed it from about a mile from his locatin. He was joined by another officer. I am writing in response to hearing other sightings recently that seem to be very close to what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AROUND July 1978 WE WERE AT MY PARENTS HOUSE AND HAPPENED TO HEAR ON A POLICE SCANNER THAT A POLICE OFFICE IN LYNNWOOD WA. WAS REPORTING SEEING A VERY, VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. HE WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM DOWNTOWN LYNNWOOD WHEN HE SAW A LIGHT THAT BEGAN TO DESCEND FROM THE SKY. HE CALLED TO REPORT IT AND THEN REQUESTED ANOTHER OFFICER JOIN HIM. AT THE TIME WE WERE IN EDMONDS AND LEFT TO GO TO THE VICINITY THEY WERE. DRIVING INTO DOWNTOWN WE DECIDED TO GO UP ON A HILL THAT IS ACROSS TOWN (MAYBE A MILE) FROM WHERE THE OFFICERS WERE. WE SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY AND WATCHED IT UNTIL IT BEGAN TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY TOWARD THE DIRECTION WE WERE OBSERVING FROM. THE LIGHT THEN BECAME A VERY LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ALMOST SOMEWHAT ROUNDED SIDES TO IT. IT CONTINUED OUR DIRECTION, IT APPEARED TO BE AT LEAST AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD. IT MADE NO NOISE AND HAD LIGHTS THAT WERE POSITIONED IN AN ODD WAY.  DO NOT RECALL THE LIGHTS AS HAVING COLOR. IT QUICKLY BANKED TO THE RIGHT AND WITHIN A FEW 2-3 SECONDS IT DISSAPEARED OUT OVER THE PUGET SOUND TOWARD THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAIN RANGE. WE SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH THE OFFICERS THE THE LYNNWODD POLICE STATION AFTERWARD AND THEN WE WERE ADVISED TO CALL THE UFO HOTLINE AND MAKE A REPORT WHICH WE DID. I AM WRITING TO YOU TONIGHT AFTER HEARING YOUR SHOW TODAY ON KIRO RADIO AND HEARING WHAT WAS SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET. YOU MAY EMAIL ME IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS.<n>

One evening, I believe the 15th of July, we were sitting outside. It was about 10:00 p.m. I was getting back from the horse stable right outside the fenced property of the house with the man who owned the summer home, a family friend. As we were getting back and approaching the house, I noticed my mom was holding our camera and recording something. Her, the family friend, and I were the only ones outside at the time. I asked my mom what she was recording. She then pointed I believe Southward right over the treeline of the nearby woods. As the family friend and I proceeded to look in that direction, i suddenly noticed a diamond shaped white light. It was completely silent. It was positioned in one location, without moving even the slightest bit in any direction. I only saw the light, and no other structure around it, making it impossible to be a helicopter or any other type or air vehicle or structure. We proceeded to watch the light for about 3 minutes. It remained unchanged. Then, it became a little brighter, and I noticed the color of the object was changing to a sort of bluish light. It then proceeded to move downword toward the treeline at an unusually slow, but constant speed. It seemed to move straight down without any other movement. Then, it disappeared below the treeline. After that, we went our ways, but I kept looking in that direction every few minutes. Unfortunaltely, nothing else happened that I noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My friend took my back that night to get my car.  We were traveling on a dirt road that we had both traveled a lot over the last few years, it was a dirt road that went up to Rucker Lake.  I can&#39;t remember the exact name of the road at the time.  There was a right hand turn that we had to make or the road would take us all the way to Douglas, and since we lived in Elfrida we didn&#39;t want to go that way.  We had never missed the turn in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving back, I was in the lead in my car and my friend was following behind me.  I remember passing the ranch HQ of the &#34;OK&#34; ranch.  The next thing I remember we are about 5 miles past the turn we should have made.  I remember stopping and we talked about it for a minute and then we turned around and went back.  We found the turn with no problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after we hit the pavement I noticed a large cirular object in the sky, it was like it was the moon, it cast a glow, it was bright enought to cast a dull shadow.  I was watching it as I drove and realized that it was way to close to earth to be the moon, it was like it was hovering.  I am not sure of the distance, the object didn&#39;t move it just sat there, stationary, and even as I drove at it, it seemed to stay at the same distance.  I stopped my car and asked my friend &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;   He said he had no idea and that we just better &#34;Get the *$^% out of the there.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove on, as we hit the &#34;S&#34; curve  in the road I took my eyes of the object and focused on the road for a minute.  When I looked back up the object was gone.  We drove home and spent some time on the internet, the moon that night was not full and was not even scheduled to rise until about 4 or 5 in the morning.  We do not know what we saw, but it spooked us, and it definatly was not natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The place I was watching from is out in the country, totally dark, and one of the highest spots in Illinois, Wisconsin &amp; Iowa. It is quite easy to tell the difference between satellites and aircraft from this vantage point. It is very dark, very little noise (birds and crickets), and quite secluded.  As I watched three satellites move through the sky, I was astounded to see them converge from distant points, and form a triangle, after which they flew off into a different direction.  I know satellites are on a specific trajectory, and seeing them leave that trajectory was very surprising.  I’m just a nurse, not an astronomer, and didn’t know about this website, so told a few friends about it, but didn‘t know where to go from there. Several weeks later, the person whose deck I was watching from (and who laughed at me when I told him about this) was out watching for satellites with me, and we saw the same thing happen, but in a slightly different location in the sky. These sightings looked just like the drawing from Rolla, MO 20:50 hours on April 16, 2007. I’m going to say it was in approximately July and August of 1998 or 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a huge circular white light above me to the left, not too high above the treetops which lined the side of the freeway.  It appeared to be the round, flat, glowing white bottom of an object, and I could not see the shape of it above the bottom surface.  It was just sitting in the sky, unmoving, unblinking.  I estimated it to be the size of a football field, large enough to hold a neighborhood of houses.  There weren&#39;t many cars on the freeway, and they, like I, were continuing down the freeway, unable to stop.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it, and because of my rate of speed, it disappeared out of my view quickly.  It certainly could have been there longer than 30 seconds, but I could not look back because of traveling on the freeway, and could not stop because there is no shoulder on the overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was perticularly focused on the big dipper when I noticed the top star (on the right) started moveing. It moved in a straight pattern to the right. It moved very slowly as though it was a very high flying plane but it couldn&#39;t be because it was just to high up. I have perfect vision and I know what I saw. After about 4 to 5 seconds it vanished. After it vanished I couldn&#39;t see the star that was supposed to be there. It struck me as being very unusual but I wrote it off to maybe I was seeing things. It started to bother me after a while and caused me to reflect on myself. After a long time I deceided that I am not crazy , I don&#39;t see things that are not there and what I saw was true.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A friend and I were walking up a street near the water tower in sterling and spotted a craft about 200-400 yards N/E. We watched as (at first) a grouping of strange lights moved towards us at a slow rate of speed. About 5 min after watching the lights we were able to make out a shape. Typical 1950&#39;s shape flying saucer. We just stood there watching this craft get closer and closer to us. Eventually we could make out what looked like actual back lit windows, nothing visible inside. It stopped about 25 yards away from us and just sat there for a couple minutes until I made the strange observation that it was not making sound. We then ran away. (Both of us think we have about 1.5 hrs missing time) I noticed 2 postings from same time frame in same area, with a familiar description. I was hoping to contact other witnesses.

We noted it had no wings or discernible features other than a thin dark line around the edge. It made no sound,and left no contrail. We noted it kept going straight in the direction of the long axis of the oval, and made no turns. Guessing, we estimated 10,000 ft. high, speed 200mph.

The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my apartment complex at Starrett City, located in Brooklyn, New York, on my way home to my apartment. The date was approximately summer 1998. The time was approximately 2pm. As I was walking to my building I glanced up at the sky for no particular reason other then to view the sky. That is when I saw the UFO.  What I saw was what looked like A torroidial  (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. The object was not a continuous torroidial  shape but was instead waning and waxing in the following manner. The object would start out as a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object and slowly morph into a complete torroidial shaped brightly glowing object. It would then revert from its torroidial shaped glowing golden like brilliance to a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object, again. It continued doing this continuously during the entire time I witnessed this object. I would estimate this object to be approximately 100 yards in diameter and 1 mile directly away from me. The direction of the object from me was approximately dead east. The object was traveling at a relatively slow but steady southern direction, AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE CLOUDS.  I would guess I witnessed the object for a total of 20 minutes. After looking at it for 5 minutes I decided to run up to my apartment to get my binoculars to see it closer. By the time I got the binoculars and made it back downstairs, approximately 10 minutes had passed. The object had traveled so far south by that time that by looking in my binoculars the object looked the same size as when I had first saw it. I witnessed the object through binoculars for an additional 5 minutes and then I simply left off looking at it. I would like to express my feelings as to what I feel I was seeing. Although I can not say for a certainty what this anomalous object was, what I can say, and I feel very strongly about this, is the following. This object gave me a very strong i! mpressio n that there was an engine of sorts powering it and that it was either malfunctioning or was experimental in nature and not functioning within expected parameters. Try and try as &#34;They&#34; might they could not get this &#34;Thing&#34; to stabilize at full power. Not unlike a cars engine that simply will not an maintain idle speed. Start it up, runs rough but idles for a while, and then stalls. I want to tell you that when this object was fully aglow as a complete torroidial shaped object its beauty was aw inspiring!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

I&#39;m not positive about the exact date or year. But it was the summer of 97 or 98. I was driving northbound to my office in Columbus, Ohio and stopped at my usual fast food place for breakfast. I pulled around the back of the building to the service window. As I stopped at the window I looked up and noticed straight in front of me but maybe a block or two away, a giant (30-40 feet tall)Teddy Bear floating in the sky right above the trees. I thought I was seeing things for a second then realized it must be a hot air balloon although where the basket would be was below the tree tops. It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn&#39;t see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it&#39;s speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it&#39;s air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned. As nutty as this sounds it really happened just as I wrote.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Moved too fast for a STOL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5:00 a.m. July 15 1998, I was walking my babbysiter home to her condo( we live in the same complex ), I noticed that there were two bright stars out, and recognised them as planets ( witch ones they were, I don&#39;t know, but am sure one was venus! ), also a half to almost three quarter moon. I showed them to my sitter, and we awed at how bright they all were even though the sun was starting to come up behind them. We were about three houses from the sitters when I looked up and saw another bright light that looked like another star, I told my sitter to look up, and immediatly she said &#34; hey look another big star! &#34; , I asked her if she noticed that it was moving in a jerking motion, and she said something silly about how ofcourse it was because everything is moving and orbiting.( ? whatever ) I told her to stop walking so we could get a closer look because even though there are two airports within a 10 mile radius, March A.B., and ofcourse Edwards not too far away that have aircraft flying over our community many times a day, and myself being an Air Force vetran who has worked on several types of aircraft, and familliar with many forigne ones to as part of that then profession, I could not recognize what I was seeing. At first I thought it was a civillian 747 type coming in for a landing with its landing gear lights on because it was so low, but it was going too fast to make a safe landing anywhere. Then I considerd it may be a jet fighter from one of the nearby bases with its lantern on, but yet the light was too bright, and other things came to mind why it couldn&#39;t be that. When it got just about over us I asked my sitter to look for any blinking lights, and to listen for the engine. As it quickly flew over us we did not detect any form of navigational, anticolision, beacon, or strobe light on it, and no noise came from it either. As it passed us  overhead we also looked for any kind of structure ( wings, tail etc. )it had none, just a big ball of light. Also when it got over us we could only se! e light, and at every position it was only light, for when a aircraft flys over you with any kind of light on, eventualy when it passes, the light is no longer that visable and you will see the back of the aircraft, this never happened. It maintained a complete light source at all angles. Well we didn&#39;t dottle around to see where it went because my sitter began to panic and wanted to go home quickly. I got her home, she went inside her house, and as I turned to leave for home it came back over, only this time it was much higher and faster. I considered that I was misstaken, that what I saw was realy just an airliner, and the second sighting was a sattelite, but it still seems way too odd. I mean the way it moved, the speed and alltitude were way off from the norm of any man made aircraft. I replay it in my mind, and talk to my sitter to confirm what had happened. I also find myself watching the ussual parade of aircraft flying over at different times of day trying to reenact what I saw, and still nothing comes close to it. I&#39;m sure there is probably an explaination for it, but I doubt I&#39;ll ever know what exactly it was. I just thought it was real weird, and it went against my years of knowledge in aircraft flight. It may just have been experimental goings on. Who knows? I&#39;ve never realy been a big believer in E.T UFOs in any case.<n>

We had one car at the time, so she was picking me up, although I was driving. On the way we were enjoying the cool air with the windows down. The interstate we were on was essentially empty, only a few cars going by at that time of night ( this was about 1:30 in the morning). As we were driving she was looking out the window, and said “What the (expletive) is that?” When she said that, I looked out the passenger side window also. Because the road was so empty, I slowed the car down considerably so I could see what she was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming directly up from the ground was a ball of green light. It looked somewhat like a roman candle, but this was far too big to be anything like that. It flew straight from a spot we could not see near the ground, straight up in the air before vanishing. It was very large and moving extremely fast. We were maybe 1000 to 1500 yards from it. The only thing in the vicinity is pueblo tribal land with some small livestock. Our first thought was, “shooting star”, except that it was an intensely bright green, and obviously meteors don’t move upwards from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw it very clearly, and it never changed colors or faded. It simply went up and disappeared, without ever making a sound. Since then, we recently saw another object just like this. This one was a little over a week ago now (4/23/06), and was moving downwards this time. However this time it went through a color change from dull yellow to bright green, then disappeared before it touched the ground. Between us we have seen a number of objects over the years, but this one was very odd. I have never seen anything this intensely green or bright before. I wanted to submit this report because these “green light” objects don’t seem too common, and it was a bit unnerving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was in Minneapolis in July 1998 visiting my cousins with my parents. They live in suburbs of Minneapolis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night around 1am i couldn&#39;t sleep because i was too hot, being from Scotland im not used to the heat! I got up to open a window but the problem was there was a mesh on the inside to stop mosquitos. I coludn&#39;t work out how to open it so was at the window for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that i noticed a light in the corner of my eye. Looking out the window across the suburbs i could see a disk shaped craft hovering above a small clump of trees in the middle of the suburbs. It was about 500 yards away. It was clear to see because the house i was in was on a hill and the suburbs sloped away from it so there was nothing obstructing my view. I was almost looking slightly down on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was dark in colour, about 100 feet wide and thin from top to bottom, maybe only 10 or 15 feet. There were also small lights in the middle of the craft around its circumfrance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a green beam of light shinning from the middle of the underside of the craft down into the trees below. It was about 15-20 feet wide and panned out fractionaly futher from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 10seconds or so then the light shut off. Without any noise the craft disappeared in a streak of orange light leading up to the right into the night sky. It was as if it had almost instantly accelerated to a speed hundreds of times faster than any plane, simply too fast to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

July 14TH 1998 I was watching T.V. after working in the yard all day. I started hearing a humming noise didn&#39;t know at first where it was coming from so I lowered the volume thinking maybe something&#39;s wrong with the T.V. The odd noise was still there. After about 5 mins the inside of my home started shaking, vibrating kinda like a small earthquake. I walked to our room where my wife was folding clothes and asked her if she hears anything strange, She told me she was fixing to come ask me the same question. That&#39;s when I asked her if she wanted to come with me outside. When we opened the back door to the north we looked up and saw a triangler shaped object. If I had to guess it was moving about 3 miles per hour from an east to west direction. The object was only about as high as the trees on the property. The size from tip to the two rear ends covered a good acre and maybe more. We could not begin to explain let alone compare it to any man made plane, craft, ect. It had four lights one in the very front, one in the middle, and two at each corner at the rear. It was so low we tried to see if maybe there might have been some kind of markings that would explain what the hell we were looking at. Maybe something from nearby Andrews air force base or something we could maybe make sense out of. No such luck. My wife ran over to my moms house and sisters house woke them up to tell them what was going on. My mom, sister, Brother in law, their two kids, My self and my wife witnessed this. It was so strange my sisters two kids were crying it scared them so much. Not to say the rest of us were not affected. Whatever it was, It didn&#39;t show any aggression kept moving west till we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. We did later in the week after we got a camcorder, got some footage of another what looked like a round ball that would move at will and change colors from white, red, orange and blue, looking from a distance about the size of the moon.

I soon realized something was out of the ordinary after viewing the objects for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was letting my dog outside just before I was going to go to bed. It was just after 11:00 PM and I opened the back door and looked up at the big dipper thinking to myself how clear a night it was.  I then something moving that caught my eye.  About 35 degrees up from the horizon I noticed 2 triangular objects in close proximity of each other with dull white circular lights close to the point of each object. As soon as I realized what I was seeing, one object moved off to my right and faded into the backgound of the sky.  I quickly focused on the other object and tracked it as it moved to my left.  While trying to keep track of where it was in the sky I called out to a family member to quickly come and look at the object.  We both stood in the door way looking at it for a few seconds.  The white circular lights on each of the points then independently converged in toward the center while the object was still, as a whole, moving to the right.  It then faded out of sight. There was no sound and I estimate that they were a couple miles southwest of Idaho Falls.  The triangular shape of the objects stood out since the bodies of the objects were darker than the background sky which was partially illuminated by city&#39;s lights.<n>

It was a silverish metallic color, I don&#39;t remember if this one had lights or not.  There was no noise or humming, it just sat in air, I do not remember it leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not wish for my name to be used, my husband would never believe me.  My grandfather, a minister in Chocowinity, suggessted that I contact you about this.  This incident is not the first one I have encountered, I remember at least four more.  However this one was different in the fact that it was much larger, it made no noise, and most of all, this time I was not afraid.  I felt a since of familiarity with them or it.  I remember reaching up to touch it ( I think I did touch it, but I could not bet my life on it), and thinking it was bigger than the last, and actually admiring it.  I am a very stable and sane person, I have never really believed in them, even after the first encounter, I just kind of blocked it out.  The first one came when I was about 11 years old, my brother was about five.  We were standing at the edge of our field playing when a small saucer shaped object flew down and hoovered above our heads only about two to three feet from us.  It made a hypnotizing humming noise.  We stood frozen with fear and awe,(I don&#39;t know how long we stood there) then we started running as it chased us about a hundred yards then dissappeared.  The strangest thing was we hardly ever talked about it.  You would think as kids, we would of tried to tell the whole world.  We just did not have much to say about it to anyone, not even each other.  It was very small though, I don&#39;t think any &#34;being&#34; could ride in it.  It was about the size of a a teachers desk.  The one I saw on Monday was much larger though, about the size of a car.  I know that someone out there knows what these things are, and I want to know.  I am not afraid anymore, in fact, I actually now look forward to the next time.  Can anyone tell me why it would pick me?  Oh, and I don&#39;t know if this will help, but every incedent has occurred between June and September.  I do not wish to go public with this, I know people would think I am crazy, but I think anyone that does not believe it is possible is crazy and ignorant.  How can people even thin! k that out of all the stars and space that we would be the only planet with life on it?  I do not think these &#34;things&#34; or beings mean us any harm; I got more of a &#34;motherly&#34; feeling from this &#34;ship&#34; the other night.  I felt protected and loved.  I know this all sounds crazy, even as I write this I know I would probably think someone was crazy if I heard them saying it.  Please read this with an open mind.  I am also open to any other explanations. One other thing, my husband and I saw fighter aircraft in the air a few hours before this.  Though at the time, there were none in sight, that I remember.<n>

I looked outside into the yard to see a gigantic shadow with a curved leading edge race across the ground outside in the backyard. I ran outside to see if I could see anything but there was nothing visible (our yard is partly covered by trees). We heard no sounds out of the ordinary, felt no motion, and do not live in a flight path (in fact, the shadow moved the wrong direction for our local aiport&#39;s typical takeoff or landing routes). The shadow moved an an incredible speed. As it passed over the whole yard became dark. Please contact me if &amp; only if this corroborates other reports. Thank you for your time.<n>

If there were more than one craft or objects and they were flying in perfect formation. I tried to listen past my telivision, which was easy because it wasn&#39;t up very loud, but I didn&#39;t hear anything. The object, or objects, flew over the lake behind my house and were coming towards me. As they got closer I noticed they couldn&#39;t have been much higher than three miles into the sky. Pretty soon they were gone from sight as they flew over my house and out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood from my bed and ran down to the second floor as fast as I could until I came into my front yard. Running past my garage I didn&#39;t stop until I was in the middle of the driveway, but when I looked up and scanned the sky, the lights were gone. I recently watched a UFO video where in Ecuador, on May 15th 1996, or 97, there was five white lights that reminded me of the ones I has seen. The objects were exactly to me in appearance, except for the fifth light found on the tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

7/12/98 23:00|La Motte D'Aveillans (France)||Other|2 minutes|Strange satelites in the french sky|5/2/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28646.html|114|ndxe199807| Strange satelites in the french sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night of july in The Motte d&#39;Aveillans, a little village near Grenoble in France. I was staring at the sky for satelites with my Girlfriend and her brother, lying in the grass. It is common to see non-geostationary satelites in the sky at night when the sun reflects on their panels and they move rather quickly in the sky as little dots. We saw some 10 satelites that night but one of them is to remain in our memories. We don&#39;t know how or why nor whether it was an optical illusion, but all of a sudden, looking at one of these satelites, it changed direction from a 90 degrees angle and drew a square and several other polygones before changing direction for a last time and moving towards the horizon to dissapear in the light of the nearby city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never told anyone about this strange satelite until a few days ago when I heard a similar story from a friend of mine living in Vendee (France) and who is a professional astronomer. I thought he would have an answer to that phenomenon, since he is the kind of guy who can point randomly to a star and name it and since he knows a lot about astrophysics and space exploration, but he couldn&#39;t say what it was exactly. We are quiet sure it wasn&#39;t a plane since it was moving to quickly into the sky and was too high to be one. The only possible explanation we have found is that some satelites we never heard of can very quickly modify their trajectory through the sky. If this is not the case, then it is still an Unidentified Flying Object to us and, without being a strong believer of extra terrestrial phenomenon, I have some doubt whether this object in the sky was human made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light did not blink and traveled at a high speed.  A second high speed light followed but on a little different direction.  Both lights made no sound.  I believe these lights could&#39;ve been seen from other states due to the height of the moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 7/12/98 at around 10:25pm I went out back to enjoy the clear night sky and watch an occasional aircraft fly overhead.  This is something I often do.  I&#39;m 39 years old and paraylized from a recreational accident 9 years ago.  I use a Permobil wheel chair that allows me to do weight shifts by reclinging and tilting the seat back to about a 60 degree angle, perfect for watching the night sky.  This particular night was great just after dark.  The sky was clear.  I turned off all back of the house lights including the kitchen light that casted a light onto the patio.  I was in the recline/tilt position for about 10 minutes and was watching two commercial jets pass through the nite sky.  Then I noticed a small non-blinking light (10x smaller than the jet lights)traveling at a high rate of speed from overhead north to south.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I was coonvinced I saw something unusual and wished it lasted longer.  Then another non-blinking light appeared after the otherone disappeared.  It&#39;s path was a little different than the first light but very similar.  Both lights made no noise.  If the jets were flying at 30,000 feet (5-6 miles high) the lights I saw appeared to be 100 mile high or higher.  I&#39;ve never reported anything or have seen anything like this.  Please let me know if anyone else saw what I saw.<n>

It went up towards the NW around a tree in the yard suddenly changed directions and headed S. That is when I ran around the tree and out into the road to see where it went, Mom yelled out that it was coming at her and I went back over to where she sat (on the steps) it reappeared only once more a brief second later when it just seemed to be on the other side of the tree but still somehow in the clouds.It looked like a glowing sphere then, where at first it looked more like a meteor. The weather conditions were as follows; warm,humid,hazy low cloud cover almost foggy.Yet there were several stars visible( I remember the three stars in the big dipper and Actarus being visible) I have been an amateur astronomer for 20+ years and you can rule out any kind of meteor or bolide. But I still got a wierd feeling like it was real close at first, and not up in the air. It appeared white/yellow<n>

When it flashed back I nearly fell on my back.  My family all watched and witnessed the mimicry of my flashes by this bright light.  This continued for about six mins and then suddenly the light moved direction as follows: Up/down/up/down then stopped. The movement was over a relatively short distance. This continued for about another 10 mins and suddenly the light grew bigger and brighter and then smaller and switched off completely.  There were no clouds that night and the other normal sky lights(stars etc) did not dissapear.  To this day I ask myself why I had that urge to flash my torch at the sky and why at that particular light in the sky when the african sky (in July) is absolutely filled with millions of stars.  Once again, there is nowhere in S.A to contact re UFO sightings.<n>

We then noticed that a light ( like a cop siren light) was flashing throught the window.  We looked outside saw no cop car, or even an ambulance.  What we did see however was a circular light in an orangish color pulsing.  It was like several strong and bright orange colored flashlights being directed at the ground.  I have no idea how large the circle was because I didn&#39;t go outside to see it.  As abruptly as it had started it was gone.  The total duration of the light from the time we first noticed it to the time it vanished was approximatly 1:30, to 2 minutes.  Also my friend says that the light was also blueish to her.  I would have to agree with this, but due to my fright I am not going to say for sure.<n>

Looking up to identify  aircraft I saw a sphere shaped object above the 737.  The 737 traveled under it.  The object was metallic as sunlight glimmered off it.

I was alone thought a bicyclist and a woman with a two small children walked by just after witnessing the event.  I heard a jet engine and thought an Air Force transport might be arriving at Hanscom.  There are no military aircraft assigned to Hanscom A.F.B. but various aircraft do fly in and out in conjunction with the Electronic Systems Center at the base.  It was only a 737 making a downleg approach to Logan Airport in Boston.  As I looked up to identify the aircraft I saw a sphere shaped object above the 737.  The object was stationary because the 737 passed under it.  There were broken cumulus clouds at 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The object appeared metallic as it reflected sunlight.  The bottom of the sphere appeared darker.  It may have been the reflection of the moisture laden clouds.  I thought I might have been a Mylar party balloon but the wind was approximately 8 to 10 knots from the Southwest and it would blown a 2 foot diameter balloon rather briskly.  A Mylar balloon would also shimmer as it bounced along.  This object retained a constant reflective shine from the sunlight.  I watch it for approximately three minutes when it began to move without any contrail or sound from 300 degrees to 120 degrees.  The object was at 80 declination and moved in a 5 degree arc from the Northwest to the Southeast.  It disappeared from the range of the naked eye after witnessing it for 5 minutes<n>

Jet was right on planes tail a plane was twisting back and forth in an evasive manner. Plane fuselage was skinney almost non-existant. Both vanished in clear blue sky in 10-15 seconds getting smaller as thay went off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife,2 children and I were on our way to visit relatives in Lancaster, PA. heading west on Route 30(Coatsville-Downington By-pass)about 7-10 miles east of Octorara Trail (Hwy 10)when I saw a very dark black jet chasing what at first appeared to be a propeller powered plane with an extremely long wing span. Both planes were heading almost due north from the south side of Hwy 30. I first caught sight of them when they were slightly off to the left and about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were about 1000-2000 feet away(and maybe at an altitude of 800-1200 feet) and moving extremely fast( I would guess at between 1000-1500 mph. My guess is based on seeing passenger jets go over at about 3000 feet and knowing their speed to be about 650 mph. However I am not too confident of my air speed estimates, but they were moving much faster than what I&#39;m used to seeing. The black jet was right on the tail of the other craft( if my previous guess of their distance from us was correct at 1000-2000 feet then these craft were no more than 100-200 feet apart and maintained that distance thruout the sighting. The jet appeared to be chasing the plane. The plane&#39;s wings were rocking back and forth(twisting)giving me the impression that the plane was trying to evade the jet, however the twisting seemed not to effect the direction that the plane was heading. The twisting motion was as though its very thin fuselage was rotating on its axis which caused the wings to pivot up and down.Howver, that this did not effect its flight path! In fact the entire apparent pursuit was virtually a straight line from left(south) to right(north)where the 2 craft quickly receded into the distance. From the time I first saw them until thay disappeared 10-15 seconds had elapsed. They disappeared from sight to the right of my first sight of them and they had traversed about 45 degrees of arc(based on 360 degrees)during the 10-15 seconds.As soon as I saw the craft I called them to the attention of my family, my wife(43), daughter(11), and son (! 7). My wife and daughter saw it within a few seconds but my son didn&#39;t(he wasn&#39;t wearing his glasses and didn&#39;t immediately start looking when I called out to them.)I was driving and had to look forward several times during the sighting to make sure we were still on the road. Therefore I did not get to take in as much detail as I would have liked. My daughter watched from the time I called out until the craft disappeared. She atarted watching about 3-4 seconds after I did. I called out almost immediately after I saw the craft because they looked so odd. In fact when I first saw them I thought they might be models- but their speed and the distance they were covering ruled that out right away. Halfway through the sighting I started to doubt that the plane was a plane with extra long wings and a very thin fuselage but might be a long flat rectangle flying sideways! That seemed almost as absurd as a prop plane being chased at high speed by a jet! My wife had little to say about the event when we later were discussing the sightings later that afternoon. Her main comment was that the black jet was a shadow of the first craft. My daughter and I took her to task over that as planes don&#39;t cast shadows on the sky! I am a construction Project Manager with both feet firmly on the ground. I do have an avid interest in things scientific and paranormal-including UFO&#39;s. My wife does not share my interests even a little bit and the sighting left  a little desperate for an answer-thus the shadow. The plane that was in the front had a metallic quality to it-more gray than shiney.<n>

Every 2-5 sec entire back end of object emitted bright red glow which varied in brightness. Object was high in sky and appeared to be smaller than pencil eraser held at arm&#39;s length<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and a friend were standing in my backyard when my friend pointed out the object. I saw it as well. It was high in the sky and very dark in color and moved about the speed of an airplane or slower. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but then it emitted a bright reddish glow that lit up the entire craft. My friend had seen it &#34;flare up&#34; a moment before. The light was not like that of an airplane&#39;s because it gradually brightened and slowly faded, and lit up the entire craft and some of the sky around it. We both ruled out reflection of sunlight because the reddish glow would have been constant. My friend saw the first flash and both of us witnessed 3 more (total of 4 flashes seen). The first flash was a very bright one, seen by my friend. It was followed by 2 less intense flashes. The final one was very bright and dark reddish color. The object then disappeared behind the distant treeline. Note that the flashes were slow, gradual, and varied in intensity and length. Each flash occurred at non-consistent time and remained lit for about 1-2 (long) seconds. The lighting was totally unlike that of an airplane. The object remained in view for around 15-20 seconds. We hope these facts may help you in theorizing explanations about what the object may have been: -The sky was completely cloudless -It was just beginning to get dark(8:30) -Other airplanes were in our view so we could compare their appearance to that of the object we were watching Note that both of us have contributed to and agreed with this report. We are writing this only about 10 minutes after viewing the object so it is very fresh in our minds.<n>

It moved slow|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04269.html|131|ndxe199807| On the evening of July 10, 1998, I was walking near my home in Brick, NJ when I spotted an object approaching in the sky. It moved slowly, and never changed speed or direction. It seemed to be about 1000 feet in altitude and moved over me traveling toward the South East around 8PM. I watched for more than a minute and it appeared larger than a traffic red light but smaller than a golf ball at arms length.  It had no wings or fins.  It was saucer shaped and somewhat rounded or spherical.  One side was very dark, perhaps black.  The other side was brightly lit.  The sun had set but it was still very light out.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  There was nothing hazy or fuzzy about the sighting.  The ship was very plain to see and it looked like a solid object just like a house or car or any other object. It might have been as large as a house. I am not sure of the size.  The UFO rotated so the bright side and the dark side became visible during each rotation.  Each rotation was about 2 seconds.  It did not rotate on any axis you might normally think of.  It just tumbled along.  The light it gave off was very bright but not as bright as looking at a 75 watt light bulb.  The light was white but as it rotated, sometimes I could see a bit of red. I was alone.  I called the local police and the Asbury Park Press to see if anyone else reported it and the answers were negative. This was a very unusual object.  I called the small local airports, nothing. Last summer, I and a neighbor, saw a blinking object go from horizon to horizon in 3 to 5 seconds.  Since then, he said he saw it 3 more times.  I thought the blinking might be a strobe, at that time.  The blinks were elongated into streaks.  Now I am wondering if these sightings were of the same object.  The July object if traveling fast could have appeared to streak because the light was rotating and sometimes faced me and sometimes did not, like a rotating beacon.  As I watched the July object, I became aware of many many little spots in my vision dancing around. I looked away and saw from the object into the clear sky and little spots were dancing all over my eyes.  I continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  A short time later, I realized that the little spots were all gone.  I had never seen spots or little dots before or since. I am a 55 year old Electrical Engineer and I work for the Government.  This object just defied gravity as it floated along, slowly rotating.  I wonder who it belongs to and what it is doing.  Our Government knows a lot more than me and I know what I saw so I am wondering what the Government knows. I am wondering why they are so quite on this subject. I am inclined to think what I saw was not part of a black project.  I just want to know what the Government knows about this.  I want to know if our Government has any knowledge of these objects or if ETs are working with us.  I got a good look at this thing and it was a solid object.  I don&#39;t mind talking about this but I don&#39;t want to receive any spam/e-mail as a result of this report.  But, please feel free to contact me if you want further information.  I have had to change my ISP because of spam that probably had roots in my postings to newsgroups on other subjects.  Since I have changed ISP several months ago, I don&#39;t get any spam and I want to keep it that way.  Just don&#39;t cause me to get any spam and I&#39;ll be happy.

We were driving our car north/west-bound on Miller Road on our way to dinner.  It was 5:30-6:00 on a sunny day.  There were cars ahead of and behind us, but not what I&#39;d call heavy traffic.  Miller Road is very hilly, and you find yourself either staring into the sky or at the ground as you go up and down the hills.  We were getting some glare on the windshield from the late afternoon sun as we crested the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we reached the top of one hill, a brilliant ball of light appeared for a second or two in front of us and off to the left.  It seemed to hover breifly, and then was gone.  I muttered &#34;What the hell was that?&#34; to no one in particular - my wife and two older children heard this.  I turned to my older daughter (11 at the time) who was sitting in the front passenger seat, and as if on cue she said &#34;I don&#39;t know Dad&#34;.   Iasked her what she saw, and she again said she didn&#39;t know - but added &#34;It looked like a big ball of light&#34;.  My wife, 8 y.o. son and 3 y.o. daughter were all in the back seat,  and didn&#39;t see anything - at least they didn&#39;t make any comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, a car had caught up with us, and honked at me to go.  I had come to a complete stop in the middle of the road!  None of the other cars I could see gave any indication that they had seen anything - they all just kept driving.  I blew this incident off at the time, and my daughter and I never talked bout it afterwards.  However it never seemed right, and it still bothers me.  I am an engineer by vocation, and can rationalize almost everything.  However this is something I have never been able to explain to myself.  I&#39;d be the first to admit it was glare off the windshield, except what I saw was off to the east side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

You state that you were driving to the northwest, approximately, and that the flash of light was to your left, would that ot have been in the western sky.  I believe you state that the object would have to have been east of the road.  I am confused by that apparent contradiction.  Is there something I don&#39;t understand about the event?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, again, for the interesting report!  Do you think that you might be able to pin down the precise date of the incident, if you were to think about it for a while?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, may I pass your report along to some skilled UFO investigators in Missouri?

When I got to the area where this craft was hovering I had asked some people if they had saw this plane like craft in the air but there was just Mexicans around that counldn&#39;t speak or understand english.  My observation and description of this particular craft was like a shuttle like version aircraft that was just hovering overhead stationary observering its surroundings before vanishing.  This craft was in almost the exact same area as the first sighting I had when I was 11 years old when a UFO flew right over my head less than a 100 yards above me traveling less than 5 miles an hour as I was able to observe for 1 full minute in 1974.<n>

July 10, I was upstairs opening the skylight, facing an Eastern direction, and I noticed a luminated object almost the size of the full moon moving slowly toward the West. I immediatly ran downstairs and out the back door to the patio. There, I saw the object directly above me still moving in a Westerly direction. All of the sudden it made a sharp turn towards the South-S.E. and then shot straight up and disappeared from sight. I noticed, as this object turned towards the South-S.E., I could hear the loud thunder of jets comming. This object was rounded on one part, from where I was I suppose you could say the back end, and taperd to a blunt almost squared off part in the front. As far as I could tell, it was virtually silent. The illumination was somewhat the color of flourescent lighting. This is a first for me. I have never actually seen anything like this before first hand. I&#39;m located in South Prairie, which is 35 miles or so East of Tacoma close to Mt. Rainier.<n>

My wife noticed what she first thought to be Mars and we both looked at it. I noticed a second object and this one had a moon above it. All of a sudden, the moon started to move around what we thought was a planet, and darted off southeast at great speed and  upward towards 11&#39;O CLOCK. Then the craft it was orbiting took off after. Still the first object remains in the same position. About 15 to 20 seconds later it shot off going straght back, also at a fantistic speed. As we continue to look in this direction, the third craft returns traveling back to the same position wtih another one following or chaseing it. We had a tele-scope out at this time. My wife manage to get these two ships in view and we both saw as they departed the one following had a row of three lights across it, this one flew off again to the southeast as the other shot back in the direction it came from. The objects were redish-orange in color and round in shape. In the telescope the one viewed was cigar shaped with three white lights. This all took place in the seaside town of Sea Ranch, California. (116 Miles north of San Francisco) Looking South-West down the Pacific coast towards San Francisco.<n>

It was a black triangle craft that had a very strange yellowish haze around it that seemed to be hipmotizing.  A plane was flying overhead and the craft seemed to be approximately 3,000 feet above the plane. It moved in a very odd way. It bobbed up and down like an eagle which is what I thought it was at first. Then the craft stopped very suddenly and just hovered over a mountain. I had my other witness look at it and she could not explain it either. I watched it for the duration time possible. It hovered then I went behind a mountain and could not see it any longer.<n>

The lights flashed in sequence in shades  red blue and white. It just stayed a few minutes. I was frozen in time. I went in side and channeled them telepathicly. The leader or told me he has comunicated with me for some time. This is true. They are the same type taht went down at roswell. They have large heads and smaller bodies with large almond shaped blacl shiney eyes. long arrms and middle finger. white pastey skin and No hair . I asked mentally why they never took me up with them. H e said they  did not need to because they implanted, undetectable,  micro chips, in my head behind my ears, for communication.They are more advanced than us. I was afraid of judgement before now. I thought you would think I was crazy. I have to let you know this . They are telling me you need to know this. It is true I have channeled them most of my life, if not all of it. My back yard was wooded at the bottom and secluded. We were at the back of the subdivision. The drive was 12 feet higher than the yard. Our neihbors drive way was next to ours. They went to bed early always. The sky was clear. Strangely I had a circular patio installed with out a deck at that time. I said to someone it was a touch down pad for a U.F.O.

On this particular evening I was in the basement when I felt a low rumble, I dismissed it at first thinking it was just a passing jet, but when it continued past a minute or so, I went upstairs to investigate.  I had personally seen and heard of many strange things from the farm kids around town, but I had never seen anything like this.  It was a sort of triangular shaped craft that didn&#39;t appear to be more than 50 feet above the roof line of houses, and hovered with quite a bit of force exerted on the ground, yet with little sound (if that makes sense when written).  I watched the object for another 20-45 seconds hover, or slowly advance, and then it left extrememly quickly out of sight, not up to space, but straight along the plains towards Garden City.  As I have said, I had watched the aircraft on the flight plan since I was 7, and have never seen an aircraft behave like this, Perhaps this is an undiscovered hotspot?  It makes sense to me in the fact that Western Kansas has little population and most people are on farmers&#39; hours (early to bed, early to rise) after 10pm, life all but ceases to exist.  Also, with a large stretch of flat lands and hardly anything above a two story building, it would be easy to move low to the ground and avoid radar.  Something to check out perhaps?<n>

One night in July 1998 i was walking home around 11:30pm and was looking up at a clear night sky over in the direction of the Iris Sea.I was amazed to see a ufo which looked like a bright star move that fast i cant think of word to describe it. It stopped and it was then i new i had to keep my eyes fixed on this object so that i could be sure this was a real ufo. If i&#39;am honest, i was very freeked and shocked when it shot off into space and i could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read an article from our local news paper the Crosby Herald which dates back to 1978 exactly 20 years earlier and it describe a UFO report from a youth in exactly the same area.

Then it appeared|11/21/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04213.html|145|ndxe199807| I witnessed a reddish ball hover for about 10 minutes after witnessing it streak across the sky like a shooting star.  Then it appeared to have dropped a red light to the ground.  Then it simply was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frequenting one of my favorite hilltop locations as I very often did on evinings such as this one.  I must admit the thought of UFO&#39;s never really crossed my mind.  As a matter of fact I generally considered people who claimed to have seen a UFO to be some sort of weirdo starved for attention.  However on this night it became quite clear to me that I too was now one of those &#34;weirdo&#39;s&#34;.  As I gazed across the beautiful night sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star only it stopped &#34;on a dime&#34; at what appeared to be about three feet above the mountain top from the distance I was observing.  In all actually the object which seemed to have grown from a white streak into a stationary reddish ball was probably about a half mile above the ground.  I immediately excused the strange object as my own confusion between a shooting star that apparantly had brought my attention to  a large planet mars perhaps.  However the thought that I was witnessing something very strange quickly crept into my mind.  There was no sound and absolutely no movement from the object for about 10 minutes.  Then the reddish quarter of an inch ball seemed to blink releasing a sort of red light down to the ground.  The light fell very slowly then dissappeared behind the horizon.  I again focused on the red object only to see it dissappear as if the  light was turned off leaving nothing behind.  It did not exit in the same manner as it entered and the bright moon provided ample light to see an unlight object from where I was.  I truly hope someone believes what I am saying or even has experienced something similar because I am quite disturbed by what I have witnessed.  I dont believe any of the logical explanations I myself have come up with up to this point.  I truly hope some of you can.  The speed at which it entered, the precision of its stopping, the duration of motionless hovering, the lack of any audible sound, the lack of any recognizable aircraft-llike features( blinking lights, movement, etc. ), the strange light lowere! d from it, the strange reddish glow that seemed to make up the object and the immediate absence of its presence are all a mystery to me.  I like to believe that I am rather intelligent but this is far beyond anything I can comprehind.  Thank you for allowing me to share my experience with you.  I am too afraid of computers to give you any personal information so please understand.<n>

Even my wife is not aware.  If it ever gets out, I will be an outcast!  But I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9PM on the 7th of July, 1998 while watching TV, I heard what sounded like a distant explosion. Seemed to have come from the Southeast (toward my back-yard).  Thinking it might be some illicit fireworks left over from the 4th (fireworks are VERBOTEN in California), I stepped out into the back yard to watch.  I saw some 4 or 5 more explosions (rockets) with the traditional red-white-blue streamers coming down.  After the 4th or 5th rocket there was a long pause.  I didn&#39;t know if that was the last rocket or not so I just waited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was waiting I glanced around the sky.  It was very clear and the stars were bright.  Looking up at about a 45 degree angle to the North, I saw a particularly bright star which I glanced at for a second or two and moved on to other stars.  But before it was out of my field of view, I caught a movement and I glanced back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it might be a satellite, I continued to watch as it slowly moved toward the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, After 15 or 20 seconds it made a sharp 90 degree turn!  Then at about 30 to 45 seconds more another 90 degree turn!  As I watched, it inscribed a perfect rectangle.  It made almost 2 complete trips in this rectangular pattern while I watched.  I estimated it took about 2 minutes to complete a rectangular trip, and made approximately two of these trips while I watched.  Then there was a split second when it streaked off at about a 45 degree angle which led away from the rectangle it had been making.  In about 1/10th of a second the light just went out.  That was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was other people there as well. There was a hispanic man standing on one of the many boulders watching the sky. I looked west towards the setting sun and thought at first I was watching an airplane. But then I realized it was round and metalic and very bright. Still I thought it was just the sunlight reflecting on it. I pointed it out to my frined and her kids. At that moment it skipped across the sky at such a fast speed. It was in one spot than the next, to the point your head had to turn real quick to catch it. It was definately faster than any fighter jets and made no sound at all. We just stood there watching it skip back and forth across the sky. I started to get creeped out and said to my friend we need to go. I looked over to the Hispanic man he was rushing his family out. It was like everyone just instictually knew to leave. For some reason my friend, who was driving decided to take the scenic route or back roads back down to Denver. It was a wierd decision because the freeway was right there. As we were going down the mountain side it was still pretty light outside. The sun had not set yet. There were these light like a negative print from a picture but they were florecent green. Not bright, but almost like an olive florecent? they came at the car in waves. It looked like waves, and they made geometric shapes infront of the car. Like outlines. The kids were scared, she was scared. I wasn&#39;t susre what to think. At one point we got by this switch back dirt road and there was a man just standing there. He was in plain clothes. And he was just watching us. We drove by him. I couldn&#39;t get a good look at his eyes but, He was so very still. We got to the bottom of the road and it was night outside. We couldn&#39;t figure it because the cars time clock didn&#39;t seem to be messed with and we all seemed to be of sound mind. The car was acting up.  We got to her place just in time to discover the brakes were completely gone. Which was extremely wierd because she just had new ones installed a few days before our trip out there.  Not an hour later there was several helicopters flying over her home and they were gone. The kids still have dreams of that experiance. We kind of just laugh about it, but we don&#39;t know what really happened. Or what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in my room at the time. My mom was in her bedroom, laying down at the time. The craft had 6 lights on it, grouped together in a formation that made up a filled-in circle of sorts. much like 5 lights on the edges and a 6th one in the middle. They were white. The craft moved in a northerly direction, much too slowly for any airplane to travel. I would say maybe about 15 MPH at the most, but most likely around 5 or 4. They moved in a straight path along the sky. There&#39;s an antena about 2 miles west of here on the horizon, and it appeared to move &#34;over&#34; it. The object did not rotate. It moved north for about 5-7 minutes, and then suddenly it went straight upward into the few clouds that were in the area. There was no angle to it. It just moved upward at a 100% vertical direction. It kept moving until I nor my mother could no longer see it. We live in Massillon, Ohio, just south and west of the northeast corner of the state. If it helps, we live near the tuscarawas (sp?) river. There was no sound to the craft whatsoever.<n>

Anyway this bright light burst out of the trees around The Seven Mile Creek...We saw this honey-amber coloured egg-shaped &#34;thing&#34; fly up from the trees...it had a trail the same colour but a little brighter and the trail had little tubular-shaped rings evenly spaced around the trailIt made no noise and I would say it was about 150 feet in front of us, We just sat there speechless as we watched it ascend slowly (about15-20 mph) it just went straight up in the sky until it disappeared from veiw! about 5 minutes later his brother and his girlfriend drove up and said &#34;Did you guys see that thing come out of the trees?!&#34; from where they were coming from it was in front of  them so I would calculate this thing being about 10-15 feet high. It looked like a drop of honey held up in the sunlight. I hoped for a LONG time that I saw was a plane but I think I&#39;m jut trying to tell my brain I did&#39;nt see a ufo...Which is, exactly, what it was! Since this happened I have been obsessed with The thought of &#34;SOMETHING&#34; UNDER The Sphinx in Egypt. Strange huh?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It disappeared into the clouds and then reappeared in a different location.  It did not have blinking lights like a plane would have had.  The light was not from the sun, I do not know what I saw yet I know that I saw what I did.  The second time it appeared it disappeared just as quickly back into the clouds.  Talk about strange. I guess I can now say that I am one of those crazy people who has seen a UFO.  I would like it explained to me, if there is a good explenation.<n>

It was in a nearly cloudless sky gliding over a group of trees in the distance. At first, I mistook it for a passenger jet, ready to crash. It had no rudder and was moving far too slowly for a conventional plane. As soon as I saw it had no markings or features, the front end lifted to a 45-degree angle. It then turned slowly away and faced away from me. While it made this maneuver, the sun shone brilliantly from its polished-chrome(?) surface. No wings or engines were visible and no sound could be heard above the train&#39;s noise. It then shot out of sight faster than anything I&#39;d ever seen. This info appears online for the first time.<n>

It was like they were playing with each other. The light returned to it&#39;s exact top position, the object hovered for awhile longer and then in the blink of an eye they burst off to the right and dissapeared out of sight.

I saw two instances of a UFO. On Friday night, we were shooting bottle rockets. I was looking up and saw what looked like a star at the moment, disappear out of site. It was bright, sort of close to the brightness of a satellite, not as bright as say international space station, but was just sitting still, then vanished. Then the next night, after shooting fireworks, I asked my brother if he wanted to stay out late with me on the dock and look at the stars, mainly look for UFOs. It was getting late, it was 100am when we went out already, it was so dark that you could see all the stars, it was a great night. We didn&#39;t see anything, then decided to go in and go to sleep. I was laying there, on the floor, on what used to be a patio, but was now enclosed with windows all the way around it. There is a tree just to the north of the house, but a great clear view to the NW. I was laying there, watching the fan turn above me. I was closing my eyes trying to go to sleep, and I remember the feeling that something was telling me to look towards it, as if something was looking at me and I had the sense to look back, I can&#39;t really explain it in words, it was more like the beings in the craft told me to look through telepathy. I rolled over and sat up a bit (on my elbows with my back arched) and looked out to the NW. There was my first definite UFO. It was bright white sphere. I was told before by my mom and step father of a bright light that was behind our house in MN that was shining through the woods and went back and forth, which happened a few before this. Just as I saw it for about 5 seconds, it disappeared, into thin air, blip, gone. I remember me saying under my breath, &#34;cool&#34; I haven&#39;t experienced such a sight since then. This is my account of sighting of a UFO. My co-worker has seen a lot more the me by where he lives now. I currently live in MO, and there is weird activity h! ere too. I have lived these following places, IA, MN, AZ, and MO. All have had weird activity going on. I hope that this helps with the reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps can you e-mail me, and then you can talk to me further if you like. ummm, i forgot to add this, but my mom also saw the phoenix ufo. i have talked to dr sky about this too. I have been trying to reach art or george with no success. my mother told me that when she was leaving my aunts, which is south phoenix, ahwatukee, that she looked up and saw this huge gigantic object moving over, saying that it was at least a few football fields. she said that she could see the stars around it, but not in it. I have heard theories about the lights over the mountain ridge. I have heard that there was a big visual, ie the lights, and that it would distract most attention to what was actually going over phoenix, which would make sense, since my mother saw it over head. I don&#39;t know for sure, but she saw it over head in phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We have been to this camping site numerous times. The sky was very clear and weather was ideal. I was up late watching the fire and putting it out. I saw another group of people camping across the lake at another site. They were loud making some noise for the 4th of July. My brothers and I went to bed and they asked if I put out the fire. I comfirmed but was worried about embers. I walked outside and saw a blueish /orange football size light in the air. I looked at it for a minute and it started moving toward our island. I woke and called out my brothers. One came out side and watched the object move with me. I thought the other campsite my be shooting off some fireworks- at this time, the other campers, were quiet. The object moved closer and erraticly- not like a roman candle. The object moved toward us 100yards and my brother and I were getting scared. We were yelling look at that and asking each other what it could be. Then it moved real close and we moved inside the tent. My oldest brother called( who remained inside the tent) called us idiots who needed to go to bed. Well my other brother and I peaked out the front and the blueish/orange football size object move along the side of the island and down to the lake side. I got up and my brothers followed me. I went toward the side of the lake the object moved and saw nothing. Weird!!! In the lake ? Still do not know to date what that could have been. I am a scientist today and would not believe it unless I have saw it for myself.<n>

I knew they were not stars when I saw they were moving.  They were brighter than any of the stars but did not appear larger than any of the stars. Appearance of sky:  a perfectly clear night Movement of objects:  I watched the two &#34;lights&#34; move across the sky. It looked to me as if one was chasing the other.  The leading &#34;light&#34; would manuever and the following &#34;light&#34; would make the same manuever.  Similar to playing &#34;follow the leader&#34;.  I observed them in a zig-zag pattern.  When they were almost out of my view, the two &#34;lights&#34; parted and took slightly different directions. Time sequence:  the whole observation lasted about ten seconds Distance:  they appeared at my zenith and disappeared from my vision over houses making and arc of about 45 degrees in ten seconds. I am calculating this arc by holding my arm straight up, rotating my arm, and stopping where I lost view. Unfortunately there was no clear view of any objects, just two bright lights.  I did not hear any noises nor did I see any colors, beams, etc.  Please contact me if you think it is necessary.  Thanks!<n>

Craft was stationary or &#34;hovering&#34;.  No sound.  Craft&#39;s size was visible when it suddenly shot off a &#34;beam&#34; of white light which appeared around the craft like a halo.  Top of craft had circling green and red lights, which appeared to go on and off in random type of pattern, but were circling around the top of the craft.  Watched the craft for nearly an hour and a half, in shock for what we had seen.  White halo light around craft came again, showing the massive size of craft, and the underside of craft and the details of make of ship.  When craft suddenly &#34;beemed&#34; itself - suddenly it had moved to a spot to the right of where it had been, but without &#34;moving&#34; and went back, we paddled back to shore, and informed guests at cabin who went outside and also witnessed craft.

We had just heard the Boston Pops play from the Esplanade (a large park area that borders the Charles River on the Boston side) and had seen the fireworks display.  The show ended approximately 23:00.  I was standing with three other friends looking out over the river and noticed that there were two spotlights on the Cambridge side of the river waving across the sky.  One of them stopped moving so I was wondering who was operating them.  Students perhaps?  An old MIT prank?  Anyway, that was what made me look in that direction.  While I was observing this I also noticed all the smoke from the fireworks slowly drifting over the river toward Boston Harbor.  While I was observing the spotlights and smoke, I noticed a spherical shape floating discreetly among the clouds of smoke.  The sphere had no lights, no sound, and when one of the beams of the spotlights hit the object I noticed it was silverish metallic with a raised ridge going around its equator.  I called my friends&#39; attention to what I was seeing and we all began to discuss.  We had time because it was moving rather slowly.  We first thought, &#34;It must be a balloon&#34;.  But, judging by the distance between our location on Beacon Hill and the Sphere&#39;s position in the smoke over the river, the balloon would have been the size of two automobiles.  Also, it&#39;s movement was extremely steady and straight.  It didn&#39;t move up or down or sideways, just straight toward the ocean.  We watched it as it passed over the Museum of Science and then it just disappeared.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, and I would find it hard to believe that no one else noticed it, aside from the fact that not too many people watch the smoke after a fireworks display is over....everyone is looking to make their way home instead.  I would love to find out if anyone else saw this.  My friends and I are still puzzled to this day.<n>

I went in and viewed the object from our binoculars, which were set up in our kitchen window. The object filled the viewing from the binoculars to where I had to back off the distance. Once in focus A very bright obscure light with a trailing tail was visable. I followed it in a northerly direction, the object appeared to seperate into three different balls of light. I then went back out on my deck where mywife was still watching the object, I agin started to video the object.Approximately 15 min after first seeint the object it was no longer visable.<n>

Something caught the corner of my eye and i turned and saw three circular, blueish/white lights moving quickly through the sky approching the water, 2 or 300 yards away from me. I watched them moved very fast to the water and stop almost instanly. The floated there for around 15 minutes, staying perfectly still. Then, with no warning, a small ball, the size of a basketball maybe, it was too far away to tell. It hovered towards me at around 4-5 mph, and came to about 50 feet away from me, and then shot off towards the woods. Then as soon as the small ball dissapeared, so did the other three circles, moving extremely fast out in the same direction they came down. The next day i noticed my watch had stopped at 22:37 pm.<n>

I was looking up (well, who wouldnt be with all the fireworks?) and then i saw an orange flying saucer (aka UFO) at least im pretty sure it was orange. It had some sort of weird language on the outside i think and it was glowing. I could have sworn it was going to land because it got very close to the ground but then it went back up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time to the event.

The space ship was moving it circles,up and down and in and out, no flashing lights.  Then a huge light came out of the space ship onto the pink hawian, a hotel.  The light looked like a funel or car show light, it was large cilnder and bright.  The light stayed for about 5 min.  then the light went back up and the craft started it&#39;s weird formations again and then disappered.<n>

However, the red ball appeared to shoot white sparks that produced three white lights that formed a vertical formation under red light.  Then thought that my wife and I were seeing things and assumed the lights were a radio tower in the distance, but the formation started to move.  At that time our neighbors came out of the house and witnessed the object in the sky.  At that time the white lights disappeared and the red light moved about the sky unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.  Then the red light appeared to head straight down into the ground, but could have gone past our view of the horizon.  This sighting was about 20 minutes total. I am an engineer, wife is a dental tech and neighbors are stock brokers.<n>

There were 2 more lights side by side near the center and front within the triangle shape. It flew in northwest direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying out on my sundeck looking at the stars. It was just after midnight and the sky was mostly clear with some high cirrus. As I looked up I saw what I thought was a satellite, except it seemed to be moving almost twice as fast as the average satellite. It only took a fraction of a second for me to realize that there was more than one point of light moving across the sky (as described above). The three points of light that made up the main outline of the triangle were a dull reddish-orange colour and about the same size as most of the smaller stars that make up the night sky. The two other lights that could be seen from within the triangle were a white light but were no larger and only slightly more intense than the outer lights. These two lights were quite close together and located on either side of a central axis extending from a halfway point  at the base to the apex and closer to the front of the craft. I could not see any of the usual running lights associated with typical aircraft ie. (port and starboard lights and the bright pulsing  central light).  As it moved across the sky in a southeast to northwest direction it seemed to me that there was no substance to this shape, as if it were held together by strands of wire, with the leading light pulling the others in tow.  The colour within the triangle was exactly the colour of the night sky, and there was no dark siloette, and no reflected light.  It did make a slight sound as it passed overhead but, the sound was not far behind which seemed odd considering the speed it seemed to be travelling at. It was not as loud or delayed as even the highest jetliners that fly over.  The best way to describe the size would be to say that across the base of the triangle it would measure about the length of an average human thumb extended to arms length, with the two sides being slightly longer than the base. I was the only one in my family to see this although my wife and three children were all sleeping beside me. I tried to wake my wife but the duration of the event was so short that she never had a chance to roll over.  I am 45 years old and I have been married for ten years I have three young children and I live an otherwise normal and routine existence.   I have my own design and construction business and my wife is a recreational coordinator.  We own our house and live in a suburban neighbourhood. I would like to know if anyone else saw this object on this or any other night or if anyone can give a reasonable or scientific explanation of this sighting.<n>

My husband had mentioned that, the night before, when he went outside to smoke a cigarette, he noticed an odd lighted craft hovering over what we knew to be Ft. Hunter Liggett Army base.  I had previously been a civilian worker on that base for three years, so I knew exactly where it was.  Anyway, he decided that we should go out the next evening and see if we could see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went out first onto our property (two acres) with a pair of binoculars and scanned the sky to the north.  After about twenty minutes he called me outside and handed me the binoculars and showed me a bright light hovering above the horizon maybe 10/15 miles away.  Through the binoculars I could see that it was a silver-looking craft, what they call cigar-shaped (more like two saucers inverted onto one another), and had a row of lights around its center: red, green, yellow are the ones I distinctly remember.  The lights blinked on and off as the craft hovered.  Then it shot off to the west, looked as if it crossed 50 miles in less than a second, and stopped cold and hovered there for a while, then shot back with the same speed to its original position on the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to do strange things....turn on its side and hover, then back to upright.  Spin around and return to upright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then descended slowly back down below the horizon.  I got the distinct impression that it was landing back down on the base from where it came from.  I know from working on Hunter Liggett that it was an experimental testing base, it is exceptionally remote and in the coastal mountains, where there are few roads and fewer inhabitants, and so it seemed entirely likely to me that the origin of the craft very well might have been from this planet.  It did not come up again, and we never saw anything like that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved from that location in 2001.  But I do remember driving down the main highway that bisects the base on certain nights, and there appeared to be a sort of amphitheater in the hills hidden from view, but readily apparent at night because they had lots of lights, and sometimes when I drove by with the window down and those lights lit up, I could hear cheering of what sounded like hundreds of soldiers, but technically there wasn&#39;t supposed to be anything there.  I always wondered if the army was showing off its latest technical advance, something really awe-inspiring, which made the soldiers cheer like they do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, there was no confusion between the lights of this supposed amphitheater (if that&#39;s what it was), and what I saw in the sky that summer night around 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always thought the base was hiding things.  It&#39;s an excellent base for doing so; it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere almost like area 51 is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

All four lights appeared attached to a smaller red light. Approximately 10 seconds into the sighting, the tailing light broke formation and crossed the pattern and the then trailing light moved forward to the position vacated at that time. This formation then became a square. The formation then traveled out of sight over the horizon. The formation was traveling in a East to West direction making no noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:30 in the morning of July 1, 1998, while on vacation at my father&#39;s house in St. Cathrines, Ontario Canada, a friend and I were sitting on my father&#39;s porch. As I was looking into the sky I wittnessed a formation of 4 lights traveling through the night sky in an East to West direction. Each white light was attached to a smaller red light about 1/3 the size of the white light. There was absolutly no noise. The duration of the sighting lasted approximately 17 seconds. The formation was originally traveling in a diamond shape. After approximately 10 seconds the formation changed to a square when the tailing light moved to front left of the formation and the then tailing light moved to the right tailing left of the formation. The formation was traveling at an extremly high rate of speed. Faster than any known aircraft that I have ever wittnessed. At the time there was another aircraft in the air, that was appearantly making its approch to the local airport in a southly direction.<n>

They are now 21.  I lived in an apartment complex in Roseville, Ca.  We were swimming in a pool during July.  It was very hot and the wind was blowing from the north.  I was talking to a couple at the jacoozie when one of the twins said “What is that Dad?”  I looked and at about 500 ft. was a perfectly round ball, painted black, with a hint of green.  It was going north, against the wind, keeping the same altitude.  I suspected it might be military, as it was going the direction of Beal Air Base, up by Marysvlle, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting was 2 years later.  I had driven up to the Sierra’s for a picknick with a lady friend.  I went up almost to Borial Ski Center, then north about 20 miles to a small lake I knew about.  After lunch, while enjoying the senery, I was watching Comercial Jets going north on a Jet Way.  I am a GA Pilot and know about this.  I could easily see the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time, a silver (plane?) looking like a cigar holder came flying north, also on the J Way.  It had NO wings, propellars, tail, or Jet streem.  It was just like a cigar holder in silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think, because of using the Jet way, it must have been Military.  I don’t know about either though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
