They were flying in formation roughly 200 ft above sea level.  This struck me as odd because military aircraft rarely flew anywhere near the area, so I stopped to see what was going on.  Roughly 20 seconds later, a white, diamond-shaped craft flew overhead, roughly 100 feet above sea level -- much lower than the helicopters.  It made no sound and no colors other than white were seen.  It was fairly bright, but not so bright as to light the ground beneath.  There were also no navigational lights.  It was very large, with the sides spanning about 30 degrees of sky from my perspective.  Total viewing time was 6-8 seconds.  After it passed out of sight behind me, another 3 seconds or so passed when two F-4s (recognized by the sound) came screaming along the same path.  These passed by about the same altitude of the helicopters, roughly 200 ft.  They were moving very fast, as if they were moving to intercept.  Ten to fifteen more seconds passed before three duel rotor helicopters (Chinook?) Slowly followed behind.  I went home and told my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

So I was outside on my 2nd story apt deck at Sterling Village sitting down watching the fire and looking out due west at the beautiful bright blue sky, almost no clouds, just perfect central Texas sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then to my left I see something dark in the sky at quite a distance in the SE direction that I assumed was a flock of birds.  I turned to look directly at the &#34;flock&#34; and observed peculiar spazzy &#34;wing&#34; movement, sort of like cartoon bats, not at all bird-like.  So the &#34;flock&#34; began to get bigger, not closer, and within a few seconds it became clear that it was not birds but, LARGE crooked zig-zagging dark LINES that were gradually spreading outward from a previously small central point, like a cracked windshield, only this was moving, vibrating.  I also could not quite determine just how far away these lines were since I had never seen anything like this before, but my guess would be several miles, at least 20 or so, about as far as the eye could see fairly clear.  I guess to describe it, it looked as if a sky-blue canvas was being ripped or torn at from the opposite side from me, with darkness behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall at this time I could not really think as to what I was seeing; I mean my thoughts just stopped, like an overloaded PC &#34;freezing-up&#34;.  Now I looked around and saw nothing else in the air but a few sparsely thin wispy clouds.  No birds, no planes, balloons, blimps, helicopters, nothing but still quiet blue sky.  As I looked back at the object(s?) only moments later, it was quite larger now, having at least tripled in size and branching out in long, spider-like appendages within a few seconds time.  It was also vibrating much faster and I was just dumbfounded staring awestruck.  I quite literally went blank for lack of any frame with which to reference what I was witnessing.  NOTE: You must understand that I DO realize this description sounds incredibly absurd,  I honestly do. I am only describing what this event looked like.  Please hear me out.  This is not a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was really at a loss for even thoughts as to what this was, and by now I was getting nervous so I again glanced toward the western horizon, bright orange sun lighting up everything and as I turned to look back at the dark lines, a grayish blur INSTANTLY appeared in front of me maybe 800 to 1000 feet to my left at the lowest cloud level.  I stopped to look at it for a moment and almost instantly it changed in appearance and became a defined object, that is to say the surface and edges came into focus and the grayish blur changed  into a solid 3 dimensional object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a grey blur for only about 2 seconds but the transition from fuzzy-blur to definite solid object happened instantly.  I then remembered the &#34;dark lines&#34; in the sky and immediately after this grey object appeared solid I quickly glanced back at the sky toward the south east where the &#34;dark lines&#34; had been only to find they were completely gone.  No visible trace remained of that first anom! alous sighting at all.  As large and branching as it had become within less than half a minutes time it disappeared within a few seconds.  But I now had this other thing to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it resembled a huge ballon-like blimp from a parade float or something being that it was smooth. No parades in town today. I thought it might have been hiding behind a cloud.  A quick scan of the skies revealed no clouds even close to being large enough to have been able to conceal the object.  Within a few seconds, maybe 10 or so, I observed it did not have wings, jets, propellors, windows, lights, markings, nothing I could identify it with.  It was a glossy smooth blueish-dark brown-gray color, similar to that of the submarines I&#39;ve seen on TV.  It also did not make any movement at all; none at all, like a huge dark semi-flattened jellybean perched upon a ledge it just sat there totally silent and motionless, slightly tilted downward towards my general direction.  Finally about this time I suddenly felt anxious as I finally realized this was not like anything I have ever seen in the sky (or anywhere for that matter). I was still reeling from what I had been watching prior to this object and I was VERY uneasy now. Austin at that time had Bergstrom AFB and I had seen at another time huge military cargo carrier jets circle the city to land at the AFB.  This object could have held inside of it at least a couple of those big planes.  Cliche as it sounds, easily this object was at least as big as a football field.  Easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I called to my wife who was inside cutting up the chicken to grill. She told me to wait she was busy and I anxiously yelled for her to come outside right now!  She ran out looking down at the grill (she later said she thought I had burned myself lighting the fire, by the way I was yelling) and I bolted up out of my chair, grabbed her by the shoulders and pointed her towards the object in the sky and ranted, &#34;Do you see that?! DO YOU!?! Huh!? Answer Me! What is it?&#34; She was not excited like me.  She was calm and speechless, literally at a loss for words. I kept asking her if she could see it, what was it? and she finally whispered &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  We then heard a man yelling at us from the parking lot by our apartment. &#34;Do You See It?!&#34;, he asked me.  Yea I see it! Do you?!, I responded.. YEA! WHAT IS It?!  He yelled at me and I yelled back  I Don&#39;t know!!! (In hindsight I thought it silly that I asked if he saw it too when he obviously had since he asked me first)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this guy was behaving even more excited than I was, he was jumping around and waving his arms, really losing it.  I guess looking for other people but nobody was around close by.  We then heard some yelling in the adjacent shopping center parking lot where several people were pointing in the air towards the thing and jumping and yelling.  My wife and I just looked at it quietly.  I suggested we study it in detail. (I have a bit more to say with regards to a more detailed description of the incident, also regarding my phone call to Bergstrom AFB; they denied having any planes flying in the area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: It is the two specific moments regarding the objects arrival and departure that completely distinguish this thing from anything then or now that I can think to compare it to.  I cannot emphasize how quickly this thing simply zipped into view, then zipped away silently, instantly, no sound, no light.  As my wife describes it, &#34;Just POOF! Gone&#34;.  Sorry but i really have to use another cliche: If you had blinked your eyes you would miss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bustling city all around and had you not looked up in the sky you would not know it was there.  I saw so many cars pass by on N.Lamar blvd, totally oblivious to this huge thing hanging less than 1000 feet above them.  Approximate location was just north of 183/research, between N. Lamar &amp; Burnet Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would gladly discuss more detail in reference to this sighting since we had a perfect viewing in broad daylight. I am old enough to recall as a youngster ( when kids used to play outside ) and quite often military jets from the nearby AFB would fly low and break the sound barrier. We always looked around to find the jet.   At no time during this sighting did I hear any sound at all from either the craft which was WAY larger than any jet I&#39;ve ever seen;  nor was there any sound from the anomalous object that appeared before it.  I have seen the Goodyear blimp from at least 3 times the distance further than this object and I could still hear it&#39;s engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve said more than you wanted to hear in this text I&#39;m sure but as you might guess, this event forever changed my view on many things in this life.  Up until this 1986 sighting i had little interest in these things. I felt the Star Trek-Star Wars phenom had run its course.  Prior to this sighting and for 20 years afterwards I had virtually no interest in the ufo phenom.  My interest in UFOs has sprung up only in the last few years really after finding so much interest on the www.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I am sharing this with you for the reasons I stated earlier. I am also hoping to meet anyone who may have seen this UFO. I counted at least 5 people other than my wife and I whom I personally observed watching the object.  I would be especially surprised to find anyone else who witness the &#34;lines in the sky&#34; anomaly as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are both licensed healthcare professionals and we both have at least 15 more good years of service to mankind before retirement. I do not wish to discredit our reputations as they are in excellent standing in our respective specialty areas.  As I hope you can understand,  I do not wish to openly reveal our identities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife especially is in disagreement about discussing this event as she currently holds supervisory positions in and out of the hospital setting.  She dislikes talking about this even with me bec ause &#34;no one is going to believe it and even if they did, nothing will become of it so just give up on it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am sharing this with you all without her involvement.  I hope you understand our position.  However, I do hope to get at least one response from you soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I remember how clear the night was and no moon.  Stars were bright that night so I was looking up at them.  I noticed first a green light, then the white light and red light in the shape of an enormous triangle slowly moving across the sky with no sound.  Stars were completely blocked out of the sky within the traingle.  Since it just looked like a shadow it&#39;s difficult to tell the altitude but it seemed very low. There was nothing very unique about the lights, like any small plane, but the size of the triangle was astoundingly huge.  Like standing under a wedge shaped umbrella. I never knew my experience was somewhat common until I read a news story today about &#34;black triangles.&#34;  These have been around a while. I&#39;m glad I could finally validate what I saw back then, I never forgot it.  I don&#39;t know what it was doing in New Haven but Sikorsky Helicopter is near here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The dam has a huge cliff on one side of the river.  While fishing at the furthest part away from the dam, I saw  a large square box, I could see everything on it  as it hovered over the top of the water, it was huge, blk and gray.  I could see lots of detail.   at first I thought it was a weird aircraft that we were testing or something like that, no noise.  I would guess it was the size of a foot ball field or just a bit smaller.  It went over me and then went up over the cliff.  This is weird because after reading some of your stuff a person in Texas  saw the same type of thing.  I was wondering if it was the same one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget this.

I happened to glance out my side window, thinking I had just seen a flash of lightning off in the distance.  But what I saw was far less mundane.  About 300 yds off the hiway was a light hovering about 300ft above the ground.  The odd thing about the light was its erratic behavior.  It seemed to be darting all over the place.  It would move, stop, and shoot a pinpoint beem of bright white light to the ground, that illuminated the ground like daylight.  Having just been to the Grand Canyon that day I had my camera in the truck with me.  So I reached for the camera, and having just been to the Grand Canyon, I had used all my film earlier that day, naturally.  My wife, her sister and myself watched this fo about 15 mins before it shot off and we went on to My sister-in-laws house in Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do remember it was a warm summer night my wife and i decided to go for a ride and the usual ride was up to the mountains north of Pecos NM. As we were traveling i spotted what at first seemed like a bright star on the northern horizon, I pointed it out to my wife and as we kept traveling I noticed that it wasn&#39;t shifting as the other stars over the horizon.It appeared brighter I relayed to my wife that it looked like an airplane that was headed straight for us however that was way out of line since there are no nearby airports and besides this is rugged mountain terrain. as we drove around a couple more curves we saw what at the time looked like a giant street light approxamately 100-200 feet above peak to our left. I stopped the car as there were houses nearby and I got out. I could hear people talking however it didnt seem to be about the object on top of the mountain . at this time my wife got out of the car, we were about 1/3 mile from the light when all of a sudden the light started pulsing and large ring about half the size of football field lit around it. the light being emitted from the ring was a light bluish tint and was going around simalar to flowing lights on light ropes  I exclaimed to my wife that we shoud leave from there and that we were probably been noticed. A great fear arouse in me as I thought, what if someone took a rifle shot at it which is entirely possible in this part of the country. After the thought I was afraid, what if it could read my thoughts. I could see the object and here is my description. I haven&#39;t yet seen any description like it. it looked like a giant childs playing jack with the top and bottem flattened to one third their size. there were three other tips instead of four sides the ones with the little ball tips on a childs jack. The tips were thick and were all attached by a circular sphere, all parts being about as thick as a schhol bus the light blue lights were glowing of the circular shape and the initial light was in the center of the bottom tip of the object. It began to move and disappeared over the mpountain top to the right of us. It never made a sound at all. We tried talking to several people about it, however people looked at us as if we were crazy to this day I wonder what ever happened to us, and if any one else saw it. My wife refuses to talk about it except to acknowledge that we saw the craft. Occasionally I go there during the day because I get the feeling that so much more happened. The whole episode from start to finsh was about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My entire family agrees that the craft was very low flying and so large that they could not tell me what shape it was. My dad attempted to draw it for me but said it was difficult because he said that “looking in the craft was like looking at an airplane with no bottom. He claims that the bottom of the craft was completely clear and he could see seats. My family does not know for sure if they saw anyone but they feel like they did. A low hum or buzzing noise was heard as the craft passed over our house. My family promptly ran into the garage after they saw the craft. My mother seems to feel that the shape was triangular but the whole event is a bit fuzzy for her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a comfortable very clear night and I happened to look out the window and noticed just how clear and bright that it was. With very little light coming from this very small rural sub-division I could see the brightness of the stars very clearly. As I was looking north towards what would be Midland (on the shores of Georgian Bay I noticed this unusually bright light in the sky. I realized that there was a radio antenna in that general direction and at first thought that thats what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as I looked harder I could make out the red lights of the antenna off to the left of the bright light. the light was just sitting there and I realized that out there in the boonies that li8ght shouldn&#39;t be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to get a better look when I seen it move very slowly but hadn&#39;t travelled too far. I listened hard trying to hear if it were making any noise, thinking that I may be a helicopter. There was no noise. It looked as if it were very close, maybe a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remembering my first sighting of a UFO as I boy (which I have just reported that to you), I decided that it was something that I wanted to investigate. The light was still sitting there motionless so I took a chance and went in to get the wife so she could go with me to try and drive to where it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed out from our north location in town where I had a clear view of the object the whole time. As we approached a 90 degree turn on the road I looked over to the object on my left and watched it move again (slowly)towards the east about 500 yards. By this time I was afraid that driving and keeping my eyes on the object was getting dangerous so i pulled over on this quiet road and shut the engine off to see if I could detect any sound. By this time I was very close to the object,maybe 1/2 to 3/4 mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife got out with me and we watched and listened. There was no noise whatsoever. I could not make out any form or particular shape. Just very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved again slowly and still in an easterly direction. After about another 10 min. It shot very suddenly across some flat land and over to a high ridge which I estimated to be about 7 miles away. While it was near us I estimate that it was less than 1000 ft. When it moved toward the ridge I would estimate its speed at between 5 and 600 m.p.h. As soon as it got to the ridge it slowed and was running along the ridge at an estimated 10 m.p.h. What that made me think was that it had such pre-planned purpose. Knew exactly where it was and where it was going. The only thing that came to mind of what it could possibly be doing there was exploring for minerals. there are a few cattle farms and dairy but little else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew the entie length of the ridge and then zipped at incredible speed at about a 60 degree angle toward the north and was out of sight in a second or less. there again as an ex airforce man and a studend of physics for many years, the only way to make something move that fast and changing direction that fast would be by using what I call differential variation between bodies (stellar)and by controling the variable lines of force of these bodies would allow them to control both the altitude and position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also believe that these objects that we see are exploratory vehicles which would be preprogrammed for a mission from a distant object. I think this because I don&#39;t believe any living vehicle could withstand the &#34;G&#34;&#39;s that a body would be subjected to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

They came close together then flew away in different direntions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 13-14 years old and on the porch of my house. At that time in my life I was interested in astronomy so I looked at the sky alot. On this particular night I was looking to the south over the top of a mountain range and to my surprise I saw 2 seperate sets of 3 red lights approach each other from the East and West. The objects came very close to each other but didn&#39;t appear to touch. I was able to get a relative to come outside just in time to see the objects seperate and fly away in different directions. One object flew back to the West while the other flew North over the house. At no time was I able to discern a shape of the crafts or even any engine noise. I would guess that the crafts were approximately a 3/4-1 mile up, as they didn&#39;t appear to be much higher that the mountains. I don&#39;t believe in alien spacecraft but I have no explanation for what I saw.<n>
7/15/86 19:30|Albuquerque|NM|Chevron|5 min.|My friend and I were relaxing in a park during the summer of 1986 not far from a friends house where we had left about a half hour earl|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52537.html|11|ndxe198607| My friend and I were relaxing in a park during the summer of 1986 not far from a friends house where we had left about a half hour earlier. We weren&#39;t quite ready to go home yet or call it day. I was reclined under a nearby tree in the park while my friend sat leaning against the same tree. The park was about 2 miles north/northwest of Kirtland Air Force Base not far from a local trailer park. I looked up through the sparse tree limbs and leaves at the stars in the sky above and it was a fairly clear night with a few sparse and thin clouds above but probably 90-95% clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I began to hear a faint hum off in the distance and the sound seemed to be coming from in front of us but it was hard to determine exactly where it was coming from. The sound became a bit louder probably no more than 40 or 50 decibels. Finally as the sound seemed to be right over us it rose in level to about 60 to 70 decibels. At that time I noticed that the stars directly above me seemed to disappear one by one. My friend and I became aware that a large dark object was now passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was jet black, and appeared smooth and was shaped rather like chevron but more rounded at the edges rather than square. In appearance it was almost like balsa wood sanded smooth with a coat of jet black paint applied to it. It was approximately 100 meters (possibly more) in length from wingtip to wingtip. The width was difficult to determine but I would say about 100 ft at its widest point. The height I could not determine. It had a row of lights along the leading edge, dim and white and a similar row of lights along the back edge. On each wing tip it had one large bright white light which seemed to be almost yellow at times. Near its front, it emitted a floodlight like light which shone down in front of it onto the ground covering an area probably as large as two football fields or perhaps more. Except for the constant hum it made no other sound as it glided overhead about 1200 ft. off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to climb higher and higher as it travelled on a northwesterly course finally changing its direction to northeast and rising higher and higher as it went. The front floodlight seemed to turn off but the other lights were still visible and it finally disappeared over the Manzano mountain range after about 5 minutes. I would estimate the speed as very slow probably 80-100 mph maybe less as it passed overhead.

7/15/86 17:30|Palos Verdes Peninsula|CA|Rectangle||Strange, angular object clearly seen flying over Palos Verdes Peninsula in California.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55645.html|12|ndxe198607| Strange, angular object clearly seen flying over Palos Verdes Peninsula in California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from the Los Verdes Golf Course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula during the summer of 1986. Truthfully, it has been so long that I may be off by a year or so on the date, but it was the middle of summer. LVGC is on the west side of the peninsula, near the top of the hill above the Pacific Ocean. The time was about 5 pm or 6 pm and the sky was clear and sunny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to drive down the hill towards the ocean on Hawthorne Blvd, I noticed a strange flying object, near the cliffs on the water. It was moving slowly, no more than 20-40 mph. The position of the object was south of the Point Vicente lighthouse by about a mile or two. The object was very angular, oblong and shaped oddly which is why I believe that I noticed it at all. We were used to seeing small planes, helicopters and the Goodyear Blimp flying around the peninsula.  The thing I witnessed was not any of those. It did not appear as if it should be able to fly. No wings, no rotors, no jet engines (it was not disc shaped either). As I drove down the hill, I had a pretty good look at it, but it was probably about a mile or two away (as a crow flies). I have attempted to sketch what I saw in the &#34;1-2 miles away&#34; drawing. This first half of my sighting lasted about 15-20 seconds. Then as I was driving down the hill I lost sight of the object behind fences and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once at the bottom of the hill, I pulled my car into the Safeway parking lot and got out. I had a really good look at the thing for about another 10-15 seconds as it flew between some hills. My second sketch depicts a side view of the craft. Again, this view showed the angular construction of the object but this time it was closer. The color was dull gray. I could clearly see rectangular, opaque panels on the side of the craft. A notched cutout was visible on the bottom near the front. No lights at all were visible but again it was still very light outside. It was moving slowly at low altitude, no more than 500 ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never submitted a report of this incident. Back when it happened, I absolutely expected that I would soon be reading about it in the newspapers. Nothing was ever reported that made the news, at least not that I saw. I am still amazed that a bunch of people did not see and report this flying object. The only thing peculiar that I can think of regarding the location of the object was that it was near the old NIKE missile site up on the hill. This NIKE site was converted and now houses city government offices. During the twenty odd years that have passed since I saw this thing, I have never seen a picture of a UFO on TV or otherwise that looks like what I saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/15/86 07:30|Las Vegas|NM|Changing|around 2-3 minutes|luminous object hangs in air, disappears rapidly in the distance|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30536.html|14|ndxe198607| ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1986 is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> luminous object hangs in air, disappears rapidly in the distance<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in the small city of Las Vegas NM at the time.  I had just started my drive into Mora, NM where I was employed at the time.  I got out toward the edge of town in Las Vegas when something caught my eye in the windshield.  I saw something shiny in the sky.  My first thought was that it was the sun reflecting on the windshield, but a better look told me it was in the sky.  I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out just to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing reflection.  At that point I became somewhat alarmed because I thought I was seeing a plane crashing due to the angle of the object and its path.  If it kept on going it would hit the hills to my right.  I thought I was seeing  an unpainted plane fuselage from the side but then noticed there was no tail to the object.  I should probably note that the object seemed to be luminous and I could not determine its exact shape.  It was bright enough that it hurt my eyes to view it directly for very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as I was standing there watching this thing slowly proceed at this awkward angle toward the hills it stopped dead and hung in the sky.  At the time it stopped it had gone low enough thatI could see the hills behind it.  That is when it really got strange.  I am standing there wondering just what the hell I was looking at when I get the feeling that it is watching me back.  I can&#39;t describe this very well, but I was flooded by a feeling of being caught doing something wrong.  That thing really was looking back at me!  What I report next sounds fabulous even to me and I experienced it.  I could swear I heard a conversation in my head between 2 or 3 different people.  Voice1: We are being observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Voice2: It is not permitted to be observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Voice3: We must leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object seemed to rotate and either shot off at an incredible speed or winked out.  It was just there and then it seemed to be gone in the distance.  It left me there shaking in my sneakers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record:  I freely admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO controversy and have enjoyed science fiction since I was a young kid.  That being said I have also served in the Army&#39;s Presidential Honor Guard.  I am not making this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time I watched this thing I was fascinated by it.  I had read about abductions and contacts etc before that time.  It had been reported that some aliens communicated telepathically.  While I was watching I was also thinking &#34;please land!&#34;.  I think that the fear I felt and the conversation I heard might have been their way of saying &#34;We&#39;d like to stop, but it isn&#39;t allowed and we&#39;ll all get in trouble.  What I really wanted at that point was to have my existence acknowledged by them and I feel that they complied with my wish to the extent they felt they could get away with.  That is all.<n>

I was 16. My sister was 14. 3 orange objects were spotted off of our deck as the sun set. They were east of our location. (east of Waynesburg, Pa. ). They were near the horizon some 4-5 miles distant. They were lined up horizontally above a distant hill. I ran into house to give our male adult babysitter binoculars because he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. when I returned, the objects were gone. He said they took off in a northerly direction. Just miniutes later 2 Apache military helicopters flew right over our home in the direction of the sighting. It was very exciting. They were at a very low altitude. I will never forget the events of this evening and will forever be inclined to believe that something was out there very wierd and otherworldly. I was prompted to file this report because I was told there is the slight chance that some one else, perhaps one of my neighbors also saw what we did that evening and so I decided to write this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking out at the night sky (there were fireworks going off above the city out in front of us).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed a cluster of 5-7 lights high above us.  These were DEFINITELY NOT fireworks.  Nor were they stars.  And though I certainly could not completely rule out conventional aircraft, whatever were behind these lights moved (slow, hovering, basically in formation) unlike any conventional aircraft I&#39;m aware of.  They also seemed to be very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for a few minutes and then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling has always been that these were 5-7 separate crafts...possibly amused -- or annoyed -- by the fireworks occuring on the ground.  Ironically, my nephew also claims to have saw a UFO on a more recent 4th of July.<n>
