We continued to watch this large light for about 1 minute. It then dissappeared. It was a very clear night. I have lived in the country most of my 37 years. I was in the Military for 6 years. I am not prone to &#34;Seeing Thing&#34;. I have never seen anything like this before!<n>
11/30/07 22:30|Forsyth|GA|Unknown|3-5 minutes|Like the headlights of a car hovering over the interstate|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60894.html|2|ndxe200711| Like the headlights of a car hovering over the interstate<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night, November 30, 2007, I was driving down I-75 from Forsyth, Georgia to Macon, Georgia to work a night shift at the hospital downtown.  The time was around 10:30 p.m. and the sky was crystal clear and full of stars.  A few miles south of Forsyth, I noticed a light over the interstate approximately a mile or two ahead of me.  Because it was brighter than the stars “behind” it, I fixed my gaze on it as I made my way south.  I immediately noticed that it wasn’t moving in ANY direction like an airplane would with its blinking lights.  So, I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright front light.  It’s not unusual to see one hovering overhead day or night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However…as I approached this hovering light, I noticed that it wasn’t one light…there were actually two lights.  They were large, round, white, and spaced apart like headlights of a car.  (In fact, that was the image I described later to my co-workers that night—-like a car hovering 500 to 600 ft. over I-75.)  My heart started racing when I realized this hovering object didn’t have any blinking lights of normal aircraft, the two lights were oddly spaced far apart (maybe 20-30ft ???), and it wasn’t moving at all.  It just seemed to hang there over the interstate facing north.  I couldn’t make out a specific body shape or identify any specific dimensions.  I wondered, “Do any of these other cars see this thing, or is it just me?”  Other drivers MUST have seen it because it was so close to the ground and the lights were so prominent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove under the object, I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone…b/c that’s all I had with me, other than a stethoscope.  Unfortunately, all that captured was a dark screen (night sky) with one of the “lights” in the very bottom corner of the screen.  Apparently I am unable to photograph UFOs and drive at the same time. :)  I’ll end this by noting that I am a very conservative, analytical and typically skeptical person by nature.  However, what I saw was so unusual that I am now a believer of UFOs…even though my co-workers and my family all rolled their eyes at my story.  I’m glad I found this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I glimpsed it after I turned to check before entering another road and then looked back. A very large brown object with no lights hovered in the field to my right.  I didn&#39;t enter the other road, but stayed at the intersection, since there was no traffic and just stared at this object, but for only a second.  It hovered above large scraggly trees and to me it looked a lot like a cross between an old 1930&#39;s or 40&#39;s buick and an airplane. This doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s real, but it was.  This is something I&#39;ve only told my husband, and after I told him I wished I hadn&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t seem possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was so different from anything I have ever seen that I went onto our balcony and using binoculars observed it.  I then woke up my husband and each of us noticed that there were two strange lights in the sky, one very big and a smaller one to the right.  My husband called the police and the officer viewed the lights from our balcony.  He told me to write to you. All of us thought it was very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer left and I continued watching with wonder.  The next evening, I got up around the same time and saw the lights again.  This time I took photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was traveling in my car with my wife and daughter. The intensity of the light was that of the brightest star you&#39;ve ever seen. Probably 2 or 3 times that of Jupiter. As we continued traveling eastward the light remained the same for approximately 30 seconds. We then turned and traveled northward for approximately .25 mile. I then stopped the car and rolled the window down to more closely observe. It was then the object started traveling westward. The intensity of the light diminished to a faint light. It picked up speed as it traveled and went out of sight on the horizon in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. Things to note: There was no sound heard, there were no flashing lights like that of a normal flying aircraft, there was cloud cover with a ceiling of around 10,000 feet. No precipitation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
11/30/07 00:00|Taft|CA|Changing|5 minutes|A cluster of lights interchanging and changing color.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61090.html|8|ndxe200711| A cluster of lights interchanging and changing color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other night, I was driving home in the farm lands. I was taking a shortcut home. As I was driving, I believe I saw something. This something was hovering, about 20-30 feet above ground. It was just off the road maybe only 50 ft or so. I didn’t know what it was, due to the fact, I have never seen anything like this in my life. I didn’t know what to do, whether I should stop what I was doing and try to get a better look at this object, or if I should’ve fled away being afraid of what could possibly happen. I was somewhat scared, because it was abnormal and it was so close to me. This object was so close to me, that I could have thrown a rock at it and I would’ve definitely hit it. Being so afraid and uncertain of what I was seeing, I just kept driving, but only faster. I didn’t tell anybody because I didn’t want people to think I was hallucinating or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now to describe this object. I saw a cluster of lights. The lights were not in a row or any formation. They were not in a sequence or in any pattern to form a shape of the object. They were spread out. They changed color. All of the lights changed color at the same time. At first the lights were a whitish color. Then they changed to a blue-grean or teal color. Next they appeared in a reddish or red-orange color. They flashed or should I say switched position. One light would go out and another one would light up. They switched from light to light extremely fast and again, not in any pattern or sequence. This flashing of lights made it hard to identify its shape. I could not make out the body of the object because of the scrambling lights. When the lights changed from light to light, it was like there was a streak of light following behind it,  kind of like a tracer. This object didn’t appear to be on the ground, but very close to it. And it wasn’t moving, and if it was it was cruising very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this, I was not sure of what to do. I was so astonished, I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. I thought there was some kind of mistake or I was just seeing things. I never really put too much thought into this sighting. I never really believed in these sightings that others reported. I was just online at MSN.COM and I saw an article about a recent sighting in Texas. There was a video of the witness talking to the news crew. He was describing what he had seen. The way he described the object was a very accurate description of what I saw. I should have made this report a lot sooner. But me seeing this video of the witness and him describing the sighting, pushed me to make a report. Maybe my info could help you all out in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The night was clear and I started to admire the stars when I saw right in the middle of my field of vision a v shaped object moving steadily across the sky.  I thought to video it with my cell phone, but the glow was so dim I knew it wouldn&#39;t come through so I just stared at it as it moved out of my field of vision.  There were lights from the city (I&#39;m close to Baltimore) so as it got close to the horizon the lights overpowered the dim glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed this object out to my friend and she also thought it was a satellite.  As it reached the middle of the sky, it stopped moving.  It stayed stationary for several seconds and then began to move backward along its original path.  It then stopped after a few seconds and remained stationary.  It then moved in an extremely tight circle and moved between 9 and 12 degrees lower in the sky within less than a second. It remained stationary for several minutes before clouds moved in and it became difficult to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/29/07 18:50|Boise|ID|Light|10 minutes|A collection of flashing lights moving quickly across the sky.  Too many to be airplanes.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60096.html|11|ndxe200711| A collection of flashing lights moving quickly across the sky.  Too many to be airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was coming home with our 9-year-old daughter  from her dance class. We live right on edge of the desert, and as my wife and daughter pulled up to the driveway, my daughter said, &#34;Mommy why are those stars blinking?&#34; My wife looked and says it appeared the Little Dipper was blinking.  They then realized the stars were moving some staying.  Some moving. Some up. Some Down. They appeared to be traveling from the northwest to the southeast.   When I saw them they were at a far distance and heading in the direction of Mountain Home Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife&#39;s account- When I first saw these &#34;twinkling stars&#34; they appeared to be at about an 80 degree angle from the street on which I was driving.  I watched them for about 2 minutes.  They did not change their course.  It looked to me like the Little Dipper blinking in the sky.  By the time I got my husband outside to see what we were seeing, the &#34;Little Dipper&#34; had quit blinking, but there were still blinking lights in the not-so-far distance.  My first thought was that these were the lights of an airport tower - a signal warning airplanes about aerial lines or an upcoming runway.  But I then realized that in the more than five years that I&#39;ve lived at this house, I have never seen towers.  Another thought was that it was several airplanes in the sky.  The lights were too many and too close to be airplane lights.  About 10 minutes after the sighting I went to get the mail and noticed what appeared to be a military helicopter flying above the desert where the lights were seen flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/29/07 18:45|Granisle (Canada)|BC|Disk|15 minutes|many craft almost every night since November, 2007 including et. sightings. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61214.html|12|ndxe200711| many craft almost every night since November, 2007 including et. sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably have the strangest story to tell. I know that more and more people are going to think that my whole family has lost their mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since November, 2007 I have become obsessed with what is happening in our tiny town. I am not sure where to go with it. We have lost a lot of sleep since November of 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November... I believe 29th of 2007,  I was driving home from town. The hwy. we travel is very long and dark, with little or no traffic and no street lamps.  I had my daughter and her boyfriend with me. It was a perfectly clear night between 6:30 pm and 7pm. Suddenly there was a fog that came up around us in which we all started talking about because it was so odd. Then, a very bright bluish light lit up around us which really startled us. At that very moment a bright white light shot from the sky at low altitude and could have hit the ground in front of us, but not so that we could see. We were very startled, and nervously chatted along the drive. We drove aways and there were very bright, what appeared to be red and orange lights in front of us.  They probably could have more than stretched from one side of the highway to the other.  It looked as though I might run right into them and I began to come to a stop. As I got closer it appeared as though they zipped sideways and disappeared. When I thought I had passed the spot where this occurred I wanted to turn around and look for the lights but my passengers were too frightened so we continued home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this occurred, the whole month of December has been somewhat like a nightmare that won&#39;t end. I have made a journal of what has happened and continues to happen. My story is probably too much to believe even for your sight. I have video tape and photographs unlike anything I have seen on the internet. I have seen more things going on around our two closed down mines than anyone can believe. I have made many comments on Youtube about what has been happening simply because of some of the idiotic comments people have made about what people are reporting they have seen, and it makes me angry that people don&#39;t believe them. I also reported the first part of my journal to Brian Vike from hbcc, who was supposed to come out and watch these things with me, but turned out ill. He hasn&#39;t contacted me since and I suggest we don&#39;t just let this go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I wonder if someone hasn&#39;t picked up on this and is either checking out what is going on here, or are they actually ufo&#39;s mistaken for aircraft, or has our military been sent to this area to make people believe that is what I have been seeing because suddenly, just as of this week, we have possibly been having fighter jet type planes in our area. Now I cannot confirm this but I have been told they are being seen, which is totally unheard of in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the difference and I know what I have seen here almost nightly since November 29th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This includes a craft the size of a football field and much more. I know you are going to find what I have to tell you very crazy, but I swear on my life and on my family it is all true. I definately don&#39;t trust this in the hands of police, (even though two of them witnessed one above our mine a few years ago). Neither do I trust the military or any government official to look into this. In fact I believe they already know. I have not shown my photos or video to anyone and will not send them out over the net. Among others we have excellent clear footage of a saucer carrying below it what looks like a pod type thing or capsule. The capsule has flames. We have had orbs everywhere. I am not going to go on about everything but just when I thought they may have left us, I saw another the night before last hovering over the mine again like a strobe light of red and white. Believe it or not we have major ufo’s or George Bush is flying around in his &#34;Black Craft&#34; stealing our resources, looking like Mr. Burns of the Simpsons counting his money.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if you would like a much clearer description such as the journal I have been keeping.<n>

This is a very remote area approaching the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range.  The area is primarily cattle range land, with a sparse farm house here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 17:45 we noticed a large (bigger than a fist) bright light to the south.  It appeared to be around 1500 feet agl, and looked to be 2 or 3 miles south of our position.  My first impression was that it was a landing light on a commercial aircraft on approach to Stockton Airport, some 30 miles to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued east on Hwy 4 the light remained stationary.  Eventually we lost sight of it either due to its departure, or it may have become obscured by the foothills that we were not traversing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later I drove the same route during the day and confirmed what I already knew:  There is not a natural or man made structure anywhere near this area over 100 ft. tall.  I also timed the driving time from where we first made the sighting to where we lost sight, a total of 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two lights were at such an altitude that no shape of the UFO&#39;s could be determined by our naked eyes (they were about the size of the stars visible in the sky). What made these crafts unusual was the speed at which they were traveling and that, from what we could tell, the crafts were seperate, but traveling &#34;together&#34; (side-by-side). We only saw the lights for a quick 15 seconds or so and then they were out of sight. There was no noise from the crafts from what we could tell, but note that we were on the beach with waves crashing right at our shoes. Cocoa Beach is very close to Titusville which holds NASA&#39;s Kennedy Space Center which only adds to the story. Probably not much of a story for a critic, but it was great fun for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was also very thin compared to the width of the craft.  In front the object had four very large white lights and as It passed over my head the lights shut off and then four more lights lit up from underneath it,  the pattern of the lights were in the shape of a triangle but very centralized to the craft,  there were three points for the lights and in the center of the pattern was one larger light.  The lights on the outside of the pattern flashed between white and red, and the center light remained a solid green.  As  the craft passed over it had no sound,  totally silent,  I could see no form of forward thrust any were.  The size of the craft would be about 30 to 40 feet  wide and maybe 50  from back to front,  the craft was about one hundred or two hundred feet above me,   it was a charcole black,  and as It passed and gained some distance I noticed two very large lights in the rear of craft, they were white also,  there were no indicator lights on it like you would see on a plane .  My backdrop is that it was passing through moon light and it proceeded to pass over my head in my back yard,  there was nothing but open sky,  it left no contrail or any other  evidence of it even exsisting .<n>

The lead light was followed by the other 2 lights.  It could&#39;ve been one LARGE craft or 3 small.  I would estimate the speed in excess of 1000 mph.

There were so many plane contrails in the sky, I couldn’t believe it. There were six of them that looked to be evenly spaced apart.  I have been going outside on break here for the last 8 years and have never seen the uniform pattern I saw today. There were actually at least ten to twelve contrails all over the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in the sky above our building and to the west and I saw an object in the sky just sitting there. As I was staring at it all of a sudden to the left appeared another one and it was moving from west to east.  It passed right in front of the 1st object. They could have almost collided. It was moving at a steady pace. It was not moving too fast. It was not that high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess if I had to compare it to my building. My building is about 18 to 20 feet high. I was looking at an angle and it was probably 2 ½ to 3 times my building in height in the sky and 100 to 150 yards away maybe. I got a good look at it. It was oval shaped, it looked to be silver. I watched it go about several hundred yards and then fade out. It disappeared. I looked back to see the other one, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really cool to see. I couldn’t believe it. This is not my first sighting of a UFO, but it was definitely the most awesome to see. I started to laugh because it happened right in my plain view of sight. I didn’t have to squint or guess at what I was seeing.  I immediately called my wife and then my father after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see planes fly over all day going to Austin Bergstrom. 737’s, 747’s, cargo plane’s, jet’s, Cesena’s and helicopter’s every once in awhile. These objects were silver looking, oval and had no wings. They made no sound. Without a doubt there are objects in our skies that defy physics as we know it. They were over a neighborhood of homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I see so many strage things that I dont even tell anyone any more,  people are naturally skeptics.  I still have the videos if you will like to talk.  Last night at 2am,  I saw yet another strange sighting.  Went to smoke in my back yard,  always looking up at the sky...cause I really cant help myself anymore.  Didnt really notice anything strange..except the could were moving really fast &amp; I could tell it was going to rain(it&#39;s raining today).  When I went back into my room as soon as I hit the bed I noticed a bright red light falling straight down from the sky.  While outside i just had a feeling I would see something for some strange reason.  As soon as I saw the light I yelled to my lady to wake up and look...indeed she saw it to.  As soon as she looked a second red light came behind it like is was following it.  We watched the light as they moved and danced until we could no longer see them.  They looked like they were coming to land on the ground,  however the rooftop of the neighbors house blocked the view.  After we could no longer see them,  me and my lady just layed back down,  neither one of us could stop staring out of the window.  I&#39;ve seen many unexplained things over the last 5 months,  but this one got my heart rate pumped way up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we layed there for a minute,  my lady said did you nitice that there was no sound.  Minutes later an airplane flew overhead.  We both agreed that what we saw was no air plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looks like a star, which is the obvious answer, but when observed through high powered binoculars, the object quickly and constantly changes color from green to red to yellow to white.  It is far more vivid than a typical &#34;twinkling&#34; star, especially considering that I can see it through the light pollution of the city (Chicago).  I am 100% certain that it is NOT an airplane as it has remained in the same spot in the sky for several minutes.  I just went out and checked again and it is still there some thirty minutes after I first saw it.  It is in the eastern sky, slightly to the SE, directly below the &#34;belt&#34; of the constellation Orion.  It is perhaps one third the way up the horizon.  If it is a star, it is doing some very strange things.  A slight tail can be seen pointing to the left.  I was alerted to this by my father who lives in central Michigan.  He called to tell me about his sighting. He thought it was the comet Holmes and called me.  It is in the wrong part of the sky to be said comet and far too brilliant, as the comet is now barely visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

I thought at first it must be my imagination because it flared up out of nowhere.  Then the lights began blinking, they shut off and then on three times with a different series each time.  For example there were two lights on then four and then five or six.  I am the first person that would say this was not a believable event but I was there and I saw it.  I don’t know if it is some sort of helicopter with a light bar attached but I have never seen anything like this before.  It was very disturbing to see on a dark country road.  This event happened on highway B approximately eight miles outside of the town of Tipton, Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the (what seemed to be) east we observed by eye a very large object high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed an impressively huge ball of smoke with bits of color followed with a long tail. The object appeared to be slowly coming down from the atmosphere at an angle facing north yet moving away from us, eastward at a fast enough pace that we lost sight of it within minutes, because of its eastward movement, not because it was coming toward the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was large enough that we pulled over along the Freeway to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, we were watching this we saw a smaller, cigar shaped object come up from what appeared to be the ground, somewhere.  It directed toward the larger object   and appeared to pass (or miss) the larger mass by crossing the tail.  This object continued up and arced to the northeast until it was out of sight.  This one had a smoke tail that seemed to split then join.   This may be unrelated to the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would have heard if it was a comet or asteroid.  I e-mailed the TV station to find if there was a crash of some kind. I am surprised that more people do not look up!<n>
11/27/07 07:34|Winter Park|FL|Unknown|2-4 minutes|Strange Dark Object over Winter Park|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60054.html|43|ndxe200711| Strange Dark Object over Winter Park<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing by Lake Virginia at Dinky Dock Park this morning just after 7:30am.  This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area.  The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds.  There was no wind.  The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west.  At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake.  The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed.  As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird.  The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn&#39;t see any evidence of a person beneath the object.  It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area.  Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight.  There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away.  When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I&#39;m not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few strange things about the object:  It seemed to be flying low.  It was difficult to determine its exact shape.  It was completely silent.  It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference.  The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I&#39;d say that it wasn&#39;t big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it.  Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it&#39;s possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon.  It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending.

The silver glistened as the light bounced off it.  It was gliding very slow and very low over the trees tops.  I was so amazed that I didn’t think of the camera until it was gone from sight.  I wonder if anyone else witnessed it?<n>

Each of these lights had a yellowish-oranginsh glow. The lights seemed as if they were traveling at a downward angle from left to right at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. I would guess that they were at an altitude of 1000ft. The light to the far right began to fade but soon reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, they all disappeared. It didn&#39;t seem as if they flew away, but rather dissapeared.  At first, I believed this to be the result of cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I stopped the car to get a closer look, we noticed that there were no clouds in that particular area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this was at night, I am confident that there were no clouds in the area of the aircraft.<n>

It had two visible wings that seemed to be &#34;cloaked&#34; with the background of the absolutely clear night sky.  They were shaped like elongated circles; possibly at a span of several hundred feet.  The middle of the craft was seen as only a spec of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These wings did were not fixed in a uniform position.  One appeared to be angled at about 30 degrees to the back and the other wing was pretty much 90 degrees straight out.  As the craft moved through the sky, I could notice the wings shifting slightly but no drastic shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One strange thing was that I saw this craft only 30 minutes after the sun went completely down.

I came across the report of the light in the sky above Tacoma, Washington and wanted to inform you that I saw the same light on numerous occasions about every night from August to November.  At first I wondered what it could be, my first thought was a UFO or some other type of object.  The object would sit in the sky for about 10 - 15 minutes and then disappear for about 10 minutes, but only to reappear.  It would only reappear in the same exact spot as it did before, as if it hadn&#39;t moved at all and was slowly flashing.  I called a couple of people and from the information that I have gathered, this light is not a UFO at all.  We have two military bases up in the Tacoma area who do nighttime exercises about 20 days out of the month.  The lights in the air were possibly flares that were calculated to be shot up into the same spot each time...they are like a delayed flare that gives dark areas bright light and just enough visibility during nighttime engagements for about 10 minutes and is a slow burning flare.  This could have possibly been what the other people have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to live on a hill in Tumwater, Washington where I could see the light quite well. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t live up there any longer and the place I live now is surrounded by trees so I cannot tell if the light is still visible on dark/clear nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible aircraft lights, we wonder.

The time was approx. 8:10pm.  It was misting and was foggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I saw two very bright white lights that were sort of square/rectangled shaped.  I was mesmerized and couldn’t take my eyes off of them.  They were the brightest, white, crystal clear (like diamonds) and were sort of sparkled with blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both pulsed at the same time every 1-2 seconds.  I could “feel” the lights when they pulsed on, but I can’t explain exactly how I “felt” them.  The lights seemed to pulse outwards a little, but mainly they seemed to have more depth going inward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights didn’t dissipate like normal lights. They seemed to have very defined edges.  When the lights pulsed “on”, I could see a light colored gray area between the two lights.  The color between the lights were a light gray and looked smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Underneath the lights I could see that there was something underneath the lights (similar to the area between the lights) that became more narrow the further it went.  The lights were not moving at all.  They were a little higher than the tree lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to stop to get a better look, but I had a feeling of unexplained dread and anxiety.  My two children also saw all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I couldn’t see it anymore (because my car was moving) and the lights were out of my field of vision, I straightened my car back in my driving lane.  Then, I turned and looked back (through my back windshield) and there was nothing there.<n>

Specifically, the lights were seen hovering in the trees near a brand new condominium complex located several hundred yards East of Route 1. A swampy, marshy wetlands area lies southeast and adjacent to the condo complex where this event was spotted. The lights were seen in the trees near a vacant/unoccupied building of the new condo complex. Upon walking my dog, the lights were spotted and they remained still and bright for several moments amongst the trees. Shortly after being spotted, the lights lifted and moved out of the trees in a uniform form pattern, moving upwards and to the southwest slightly  -- all this movement taking place while the lights were still bright. But, as the &#34;craft&#34; or object moved away, the uniform pattern of lights slowly faded away as &#34;it&#34; moved from the area. There was no noise of an engine. The entire neighborhood was extremely quiet. The lights were not of a conventional airliner, as no jet noise was heard and no lights twinkled as with a conventioanl jetliner. In addition, the lights did not appear in an area of sky where jetliners normally traverse; the lights hovered amongst the trees in the dewy, swampy and wooded area. The lights were brighter and more uniform in pattern (circular or oval shape) and the lights moved and faded away uniformly, which made this event so remarkable to the observer. It was an unforgettable moment for the observer and the observer is at a loss to explain or rationalize the origin of the lights and how the lights moved together uniformly and faded away so uniformly against the uninhabited and heavily wooded wetlands adjacent to a vacant building in a newly constructed condo com! plex. Th is event was not reported until now (posting date of Jan. 16, 2007). This posting was prompted by reportings of others from the state of Texas seen on news broadcasts, and the observer contemplated the nature of the sighting in Florida and decided to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a cold night with no cloud cover.  I observed a star like object come over the horizon (thought to be an airplane) traveling in a Northerly direction, except it never had any blinking lights (navigation lights), then it just stopped in the sky, and if you had not seen it move  into position, one could easily assume it was just another star in the sky.  Now thinking it was maybe a helicopter (no sound though) it just stayed in that position for at least an hour, then it would change it&#39;s position in very straight lines, then stop at intervals of 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes covering large distances.  Using a extremely bright LED flashlight, *in a joking manner* I tried to flash it with a morse code like pattern, and to my surprise it appeared to move no longer in straight lines but curved lines at a higher rate of speed.  then stopping to hold a position.  It appeared at this time to change it&#39;s &#34;shine pattern&#34; maybe changing the color of the light and even shape.  Eventually it went back to the star appearance held position, and eventually moved off in a NW direction in a slow straight line until out of view.  this all took place between 9pm and 1am.  In my personal opinion this behaved like no aircraft that I am aware of, as to what it actually was... your guess is as good as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The lights were reddish orange, very bright, unblinking, at a tremendous height and were going up as well as northerly to southerly.  They were spaced a fair distance from each other and the leading one was higher than the other for it disappeared, fading away as it went up before the other did.  There was no noise, no blinking or strobing, and no flickering to speak of.  I look at the stars and planes and helicpters at night all the time.  I&#39;ve seen satellites and comets.  I have no idea what they were but by definition they were UFO&#39;s.

I was not able to capture a photo, but when I saw the one provided at Puget Sound, I realized that it was the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this object on several occasions for the past year, always in the early morning.  But, there are always two of the objects; one followed a moment or two after the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until this morning, they always appeared as an almost pinpoint circular object traveling at a high rate of speed, with approximately an inch-wide (from my vantage point) vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hills and mountains surround me.  The direction of the first object is from the Southern sky traveling North West.  The second object comes from a bit more South West direction, heading North West also, with the same width vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, niece, and grandson have witnessed these sightings and it was during the summer months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past few days, the dogs in our neighborhood have been howling late at night and in the early morning hours.  Late last night when they howled, I ignored the dogs as usual.  This morning their howling woke me up.  I went to the bathroom, came back and noticed the moonlight in my room.  I went to the window to look at the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 5:22 am and I saw a vapor trail traveling from the North Western sky.  I was looking out of my North West window that is facing a bright full moon.  The moon was at a 45-degree angle from the horizon.   Visibility was 3 miles.  The stars were brilliant.  Our altitude in Mountain House is 160 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed the object from my loft space, which is approximately 20 feet high. The object was traveling this time from North West heading in a Southern direction and it was only when it traveled in front of the moon that I could see that it was a RED fiery circular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left the light of the moon, it appeared as a pinpoint circular object again.  The sound that it made was high pitch and similar to a vacuum cleaner whirring, unlike commercial aircraft or jets engines.

I couldn’t hear the sound anymore because it was traveling higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As with the Pugent Sound sighting, there has been increased helicopter activity over this tiny community, often in pairs searching in the exact location where we’ve seen the UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe these objects to be unlike any aircraft that is known and I respectfully submit this sighting as being genuine in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the opportunity to share this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ============================== PUGET SOUND, WASHINGTON STATE, MONDAY, MAR 5 2007 AT 19:15 HRS The National UFO Reporting Center received three reports of a peculiar, red object, which was observed from multiple points on the western side of Puget Sound. One of the witnesses  captured the object with her digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Report  If there are other witnesses to the event, we would welcome more reports which include 1) the witness&#39;s location, 2) the direction the witness was looking, and 3) the angle of elevation (estimated) to the object, above the horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not know what the object was, but it almost certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft, and given the duration of the event, and the manner in which the object was seen to move across the sky, we doubt that the object was any type of pyrotechnic device.<n>

I looked up through the front windsheild directly in front of the car. At first glance I thought I saw a plane landing at the airport, a black plane with it&#39;s &#34;landing&#34; lights on and a flashing red light on the side opposite of the &#34;landing&#34; lights, as I could see two distinct beams of light that looks similar to a car&#39;s headlights in a light fog. The weather was clear, I just looked at the NWS website, the weather at the Airport was: Wind S 9 MPH; Visibility 9 Miles; 23 Degrees. Then I realized that the plane was ascending with the beams of lights facing the opposite direction that it was traveling (it was traveling from west to east), my second thought was, oh this must be a helicopter because of the craft&#39;s movement patterns. It slowed down and began to hover for about 10 seconds, it then turned its two beams of lights towards the south (90 degrees left) and began to slowly accelerate to about 20 MPH or so. By the time the craft was almost directly overhead (coming right towards us at about the same height you typically see news helicopters fly) it became clear to me that this was no helicopter, as I could see the crafts distinct flat perfectly triangular hull, there seems to be no way that a fixed wing aircraft could travel that slow, I saw no propellers. It immediately sent chills through me when I saw it. I could tell that both my Grandpa and I, both familiar with aircraft, were interested in the craft, after it went by my Grandpa, typically a skeptic of anything, said, &#34;What the heck was that thing? If I didn&#39;t know any better . . . I would say it was a UFO!&#34;<n>

They appeared to be stationary at first in an obtuse triangle formation - the middle one equidistant from the outer ones. They then slowly moved so that the middle one was closer to the top one. They were getting lower in the sky and eventually moved into a tight equilateral triangle formation. We were walking away from them at that point, but when we turned around a few seconds later, they were gone - either got too low to see over the houses or faded out.  They appeared to get slightly dimmer as they descended, but it may just be that the sky was not as clear down so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw them for at least 2 minutes, they moved quickly when all lights were off, as the lights came on in sequence, we would see them in a location either to the left or right of the original location. The formation was very large, the lights spread in a uniform distance from each other.

I went outside and noticed a bright light almost like airplane headlights off to the east.  I figured that it was headlights from an aircraft until I noticed it dimming and moving in ways that a aircraft couldn&#39;t do.  It was making small circles at one point and then started making more rapid movements to the left and to the right, diagonal, and while it was doing this there were surges of light that made it look like it was flashing while doing this. I continued to go back and observe it for about 30 minutes and needless to say after seeing this I was pretty freaked out.  So I went to grab a video camera to get it and when I got back I noticed that the batteries that had been charging were dead out of nowhere for the camera.  The background was all black because it was up in the sky above the tree line.  All I could make out was the faint outline of the trees and it was right above that.  and through this whole ordeal I also noticed that the lights got closer it seemed and then suddenly everything was gone and I didn&#39;t see it again.  I just thought it was kind of strange.  and I hadn&#39;t had anything to drink this night and it freaked me out enough to start praying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When I went to lie down, I kept thinking how peculiar it was for the star to be so bright.  I went back to my window and with my glasses and notice that the light looked like it was pulsing.  It would be bright, and then it would not.  So mulling it over I thought, this is really a UFO so I grabbed my camera and zoomed in.  My camera is a Sony Cybershot so picture quality is not as good of professional photographer quality.  When I zoomed into what I thought was a start, I realized I was gazing at a circular ball of light with the colors of fire (red, blue, yellow).  I took note that this light had a pattern which was, after a few minutes, easy to follow.  At the end of the red, blue, and yellow the light expanded.  When I took the picture I would get a disk in the photo, it looks like a disk of energy.  The light would move far away, then it would come back.  I think it had to be several miles away in the sky.  When I started to look around there were 5 others but not as bright, my camera could not even zoom in that far.  I actually when back to bed around 6:30 AM when the light was far away enough that I new it was leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 30 yrs old, hispanic, educated with a bachelors in business, I work a full time job, and very credible. This is my 3rd time seeing strange light in the sky, but the first time I got a picture and could verify that it was not just a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

At first I just discarded it as my eyes making things up, but then a couple of seconds later I saw it again farther south. Then, a black shape appeared in the sky. It was probably about 2,000 feet high and maybe 100 yards long. It had a series of lights that would circle around it in a pattern. They were all white. About a minute after I saw the first change in the sky, it disappeared and did not come back.<n>

I tried to get the dog to move a little faster so we could get closer to it to see what it was.  It was low and moving very slowly. But it was hard to see it because of trees in the area.   I got to a point where I could see the lights very closely and it seemed to mimic a house that had christmas lights on it.  For about 30 seconds I was able to compare the lights to a house that it was gliding over and I noticed that the crafts lights would change yellow, blue red.    It seemed to go  behind the top of a large tree and when I got to that area I looked for it, but it was gone.  A couple minutes later I saw what I thought was a small helicopter that looked like it was trying to find it.  I believe this happened the day before Thanksgiving, but in any case, within a couple days of it.

I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky.  It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn&#39;t fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am super freaked out right now and I don&#39;t know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!<n>

11/20/07 23:45|St. Marys|GA|Unknown|1hr|It was a "twinkle" in the sky, too bright to be a star, and moved ever so slightly in the distance.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD))|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59953.html|95|ndxe200711| It was a &#34;twinkle&#34; in the sky, too bright to be a star, and moved ever so slightly in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting a drink of water and looked out my kitchen window into the sky. I saw what appeared to be an airplane light. It was much brighter than the stars, at first I did not think anything of it, but then I noticed that the light was not moving across the sky like it should have been. I also noticed at that point that it seemed to be flashing an almost red/blue/white alternation, except there seemed to be no pattern. It was kind of sporattic. So I started to get a closer look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I decided to go outside into the driveway to get a clearer view. After examining the light for about 10 minutes, I noticed that it was not a stationary light. My first thought was that it may have been a helicopter. I do live near a Naval Submarine Base, so it may not be uncommon to have helicopters in the area. But this was not moving like a normal aircraft. It seemed to bob up and down fairly gently and occasionally side to side. As if it was moving toward or away, but it never moved. I called one of my roommates out to look at it, he shrugged it off, said it was probably a helicopter, and went to bed. I also called a friend of mine who lives closer to where the light was coming from, but his house is surrounded by trees, so it was hard for him to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 minutes I decided to see if I could get any closer. It looked pretty far away, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I drove south toward the St. Marys River, which separates Georgia and Florida, just across is Fernandina Beach, Florida. I could go no further, so that&#39;s where my journey ended. It looked as if I got no closer, so I drove back home. When I got back to my house, I looked at it, and while on the telephone with a friend in California, I noticed that the light had moved slightly to the right. Before, it was a bit left below Orien&#39;s Belt. If you drew a light through the three stars in the belt and took it down to nearly where the trees meet the sky from my point of view, it was to the left of the line. When I got home, it was further to the right, on the right side of that line. So apparently the light moved, however it was such a slow movement that I didn&#39;t notice as it was happening. At around 01:00 I got tired of watching, and came in to write this up. As of 01:07 the light is still there, and still is &#34;twinkling&#34; and bobbing ever so slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I write, this light can still be seen in the Eastern sky of Florida – the location is approximately 15 miles inland, but the object could likely be over the ocean. This object has been there for approximately 30 minutes or longer since we first noticed it. When looking at it through binoculars, it does not seem to be moving but because it is blinking/pulsating, it gives the impression that it’s rotating. It starts as a small white dot an then you see the colors and then back again to the dot.<n>

My only reason for this report is to document the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 20, 2007 I was traveling with four friends and a driver in Beijing, China.  We were on vacation visiting the country and enjoying the sights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the back seat of the car, if you could call it a seat, because the little suv was full with the 6 of us. I was looking out the front window past the driver when my friend says, &#34;Hey guys, whats that up in the sky by the tower?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t know what to think as we clamored to the left side of the car to get a good look. Everyone else immediately saw it, except the driver (he spoke absolutely no English)and myself, and began to throw around comments like, &#34;it&#39;s a blimp&#34; or &#34;maybe it&#39;s a ufo.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I struggled in vain to find the object, my friends took out there cameras and snapped a couple of images of the ufo and tower.  Eventually, I saw it.  The reason I had missed it was because I assumed the altitude of the supposed object to be around 3,000 - 5,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In actuality, the ufo was at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000ft (roughly. See photo).  The ufo itself appeared round and definitely had a grey/metallic color. It hovered/remained still the entire time we watched (2-3min), that is, until it vanished from view. I don&#39;t know exactly how, but when my eyes were distracted momentarily they returned to find the object gone. Vanished completely, with no sign of it in the surrounding area or contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, five of us saw the object. I forgot about the incident because it was a friend who took the photographs.  Later, remembering the incident, I got copies of it and looked at them.  I didn&#39;t see anything.  That is, until I began to zoom in and scan the area I remember seeing the object around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting piece of the puzzle was in the second photo, the object is a little more blurred but there are 4 gold/yellow disk&#39;s at approximately the same height only about a mile or two away. I did not mention these disk&#39;s earlier because I did not actually see them that day, only the one ufo. It was only upon scrutinizing the photos that I saw them. I am not sure whether or not my friends saw them in addition to the one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have four photos of the incident.  Only two of them containing anything.  The other two are after the object departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this is helpful.<n>

While on top of Dante&#39;s View, a boy near me said to his mother, &#34;Hey mom, look, a UFO.  We should call the US Army.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> His mother didn&#39;t reply and only walked away, back up the hill toward the parking lot.  The boy watched for a few seconds and then walked away as well.  I started taking pictures with my film camera and then switched to my digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was in the distance, but definitely over the valley itself.  Dante&#39;s View is almost directly across from Telescope Peak and looks directly down on Badwater Basin.  The object&#39;s distance from me was hard to gauge as the valley stretches across for miles and perspective can already be difficult.  The UFO was a black oval to my naked eye and hovered around.  It came from the south moving northward.  It made several circular motions while I took the pictures.  Before I could take more, the UFO began to descend slowly back toward the south.  I lost sight of it when a rock outcropping got in my way.  I quickly jogged around the rocks so I could see the rest of the descent (this took 10-15 seconds), but it had vanished from sight by the time I got around.  I&#39;m not sure where it went, as it appeared to be hovering roughly over the center of the valley and was not descending fast enough to have gotten out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m going to include pictures.  I took several, including some zoomed in.  In some you can see the foreground and the background.  I also have other pictures showing more of the foreground and background within ten minutes of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon review of the photos, it is clearly an oval shape.  However, in one photo the oval appears to be tilted and there is clearly a lighter color (white or gray) on a side of it (it appears to be the top to me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan on having my film developed tomorrow to see what was captured there.<n>

I would say that they were approximately 200-400ft. apart and stayed in perfect alignment with each other while moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two objects moved, one light started to become extremely bright and then the second light became equally bright.  As they continued moving south, the first light that became bright started to dim and disappeared completely, followed by the second light becoming dim and disappearing too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am constantly looking in the night sky and was a former Naval Air Crewmen and flew numerous missions while serving in the military.

For approx. 5 mins we observed a very bright light at first constant but then it began to pulsate regularly. The intensity was approx. 3 times that of Venus at it&#39;s brightest. As we came closer to it it appeared to be a black helicopter and stopped pulsating. The reason we are reporting this is that it seemed extremely odd that a helicopter would have such a blinding white pulsating light on it. Wether it was something strange or not will never be known but we report it in case there were any other observations or anomolous activity in the area that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The radio completely shut off.  My car was still running so there was no reason for the radio to have turned off.  It started back up automatically in a couple of seconds.  I continued driving down Coto de Caza Drive, forgetting completely about the radio shutting off only 30 seconds earlier, when the brightest most beautiful blue-white light, very small and round in shape came flying across the sky right in front and above me.  It was complete daylight and the sky was of light blue-ish color in the backdrop.  The moon was even out.  It reminded me of a daytime shooting star but one I could literally have reached up and touched (almost).  The other very, very unusual thing was that it was so low.  Maybe just above natural treetops.  It literally faded into nothingness and disappeared with no trace, no tail, no smoke, no nothin&#39;.  It was the most beautiful light I have ever seen.  Nothing I can compare it to on this earth.  Wish I could.  It was awesome.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted a very bright white light that was moving across the sky and pointed it out to my son and asked him if he thought it could be a satellite or an airplane. We both agreed it was far too bright and too close to be a satellite or airplane. Plus, it wasn’t making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the naked eye it appeared to be round in shape, but when I checked it out with my binoculars it looked more triangular. It continued to move across the sky from west to east. But what REALLY got our attention was when two much smaller circular lights flew right past it going the opposite direction and then appeared to circle around behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly we weren’t really scared, but more interested than anything else. Could it have been some bizarre military flight, or was it truly a UFO? I’m convinced it was, even though no one really believes us. My son is a young teenager and I&#39;m a late 40&#39;s business executive with no science background.

It then got very large, very quickly, as it apeared to move out of the open sky and through the trees off to our left.

11/18/07 16:30|Palm Springs|CA|Triangle|4-5 minutes|Three Identical Craft Sighted Over Palm Spings, California  Slowly Come Together...And Vanish.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59931.html|113|ndxe200711| Three Identical Craft Sighted Over Palm Spings, California Slowly Come Together...And Vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, November 18, 2007, my partner and I observed three UFO&#39;s flying high in the late afternoon sky over Palm Springs, California. The sightings occurred at approximately 4:30 p.m. The crafts remained visible to the naked eye for about five minutes before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the downtown area of Palm Springs when the sighting occurred. I was the first to notice something unusual. I was looking up towards the moon (which was clearly visible to me at that hour) when I spotted an elongated boomerang, or triangular shaped craft flying in a southwest direction. At first, the object appeared to be flying in a straight line like a normal aircraft. It also seemed to be at about the same altitude that a commercial aircraft normally flies while at cruising altitude, approximately 25,000-35,000 feet. From that distance, I would estimate the size of the craft to be similar in size to a small to medium sized commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the unidentified craft for a minute or so, I noticed that it started to move in ways that normal aircraft don’t. It slowly came to a stop, suspended in midair like a helicopter. That’s when I pointed it out to my partner, who saw the object as clearly as I had. The craft then moved around its location sluggishly and, in what appeared to be, a somewhat erratic fashion. All of the sudden, two other identical craft came into view in close relative proximity to the fist craft. The three objects began to slowly “wobble” towards a center point. For about four or five minutes they leisurely moved around and, on occasion, become completely stationary. Once the objects reached their center point destination, they vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the sky at that time of day was perfectly clear with exceptional visibility. Each craft was identical in size and shape to one another. Another unusual attribute of the crafts was that although they were shaped like a boomerang, they flew with the curvature to one side. In other words, the objects flew “sideways”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the witnesses: I am a 47 year-old marketing executive and creative consultant to the motion picture industry. I hold a B.A. degree in Radio, Television, and Film from a major university in southern California.  I am an FAA licensed pilot certified to fly single engine aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner is also 47 years old and has post-graduate degrees in Political Science and Art History from a prestigious and internationally recognized university.<n>

11/18/07 12:05|Brussels (Belgium)||Sphere|25 seconds|Formation of spheres over Brussels|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59922.html|115|ndxe200711| Formation of spheres over Brussels<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been interested in the ufo phenomenon, but I was always sceptical about observations of spheres during day- or nighttimes, as reflections, birds, etc. can betray the human eye so easily. That was until today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At exactly 12:05 noon time I was standing outside in the garden, looking roughly eastwards, when I observed a loose formation of 5 or 6 shining identical spheres heading from the South East towards the North West (I was so fixed on the phenomenon that I simply forgot to count the number of spheres, but I am sure there were at least five of them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was perfectly clear, blue with no clouds, and with an almost unlimited visibility, with the sun shining in the South (noontime) and a light surface wind coming from the North East. Some contrails of aircraft, as well as the aircraft themselves were clearly visible at high cruising altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres were reflecting the sunlight at their backsides (sun side) as if they were from polished aluminium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was visible during approximately 25 seconds. During that time of observation they travelled trough an arc of view of approximately 110 degrees (because of their relatively high speed, I did not have the opportunity to pick up my camera inside the house). The formation itself stayed together within a field of view of approximately 25 degrees, but their movements were very erratic, overtaking each other with brisk accelerations, and then slowing down again, and with brisk changing of directions over about 10 to 15 degrees deviation from the groups heading, before regaining the general track. During the observation the group travelled at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees above the horizon. They left no contrails behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no audible sound until the silence was disturbed by an airliner that had just departed from Brussels International Airport (about 8 km away), departing from runway 25R, turning to the North West as a standard instrument departure towards the Nikki, Costa or Koksy VOR. At that moment the group of spheres was about to disappear behind the roofs of the houses North of my location. The airliner turned towards the general direction of the spheres but never passed in front of them from my point of view, so it was impossible to have any form of reference towards their distance and dimensions. In my opinion the spheres must have been visible from the cockpit of that airliner (especially from the co-pilot&amp;#8217;s position) although they seemed a lot higher and faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, I had no reference, no cloud base, and they didn&#39;t pass under or over any contrail present, but if you allow me a rough estimate, I would say that if the diameter of the spheres were around 20 feet, I would estimate their altitude at around 15000 feet, but that is only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were certainly no balloons (too fast and against the wind direction), no birds at altitude (light reflection, far too fast, and not the same flight behaviour) and seemed clearly under intelligent control. What I found the most stunning was the brisk acceleration and deceleration when they were changing their relative positions. As they flew over a densely populated area it seems almost impossible that no other person should have made the same observation. By the way, just after the spheres disappeared behind the roofs of the neighbouring houses, I phoned my wife who was at work at that time, a couple of km North of my location (at that moment they should also still have been visible from there) but I could not make immediate contact, so I have nobody to confirm my observation. As these spheres were crossing straight trough the Brussels TMA and Control Area, I wonder if the air traffic controllers would have given a departure clearance to any airliner if they should have been visible on their radar screens!<n>

I was coming home—pulling in the driveway-- (I live on a 40-acre farm) and immediately noticed a very bright orange-haze glow in the eastern sky—when I first noticed the object it was hovering (barely moving) and it was glowing. I noticed it immediately because of the size of the fireball/light and because it was much lower in the sky than any other celestial objects. I watched closely because it APPEARED to be moving, and sure enough, it was moving. The sky was very clear and the stars were very bright and beautiful on this morning. I am a college professor, and I was 100 percent sober. I was so taken back by the object that I woke my sleeping mother out of bed so she could also witness the object with me. I’m 37 years old and am always very cognizant of my surroundings, and I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. I watched the object for approximately 1.5 hours (until about 5:00 a.m.). The object would hover for about 5 minutes at a time (sometimes more) and then it would disappear by ascending at a tremendous amount of speed. It would then reappear in a few minutes and repeat the same pattern. You could witness a zigzag hovering pattern—it changed directions very abruptly and almost zigzagged while hovering but we also witnessed (what appeared to be) either rotation of the air craft OR lights that were spinning (like a giant search light)—we could see the light going back and forth. The object we watched was orange in color and very bright—like a ball of light. Towards the very end of the sighting, we saw another object that was very different in shape with multi-colored lights (including red). The object was completely different in shape---not round but more like the shape and light configuration of a traffic light looks like. It did not look like an airplane because the rate of speed at which this 2nd object was traveling was incredible. It almost appeared as if the 2nd object ! was look ing for—or chasing the 1st object. Eventually, the orange glow ball object disappeared (as if it was being chased away). I was facing east toward Rochester and the 1st object disappeared into the south-eastern sky. The multi-colored object moved in from the north-eastern sky and disappeared in the north-eastern sky. When I first got home, I observed the object from outdoors. I did not hear any noises associated with this object. It was not a helicopter and it was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. As the object appeared to be getting closer, I ran indoors because I was scared! For the remaining time, my mother and I observed the object through the east-facing windows of our house.<n>

Several thorough searches have yielded nil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved in a straight path from my field of view, and did not change in brightness, which may have indicated a change in altitude. The object appeared to be at an incredibly high altitude, which is why we thought that it must be a satellite, since even aircraft that are visible in binoculars would be in restricted airspace for this part of the sky. The flight path for National Airport is the SSW, along the Potomac River, and does not cross this field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving to within 2° of Capella in Auriga, it ceased movement. Just. Like. That.  We had watched it move for about 6 minutes from the NNE to the center of my FOV.  The light remained motionless for another ~3 minutes.  Its appearance in the binoculars was similar to Mars, in that it was a bright pink light that did not twinkle. The light then moved slowly in a southerly direction for about 3° and disappeared.  The &#39;real&#39; Mars was visible in the next constellation over, so the light  definitely was NOT the planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No change in rate of speed or brightness occurred, no cracking or popping noises accompanied it--and it stopped moving for several minutes, so I&#39;m fairly sure that it was not a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As soon as we sat down in my car I saw a flash of light from in the sky and then an orange colored ball of light (at the time I thought maybe a plane had blown up) started falling towards the ground. When I first seen the light I was in the front yard so as it fell I ran to the side of my house looking to the south east towards the West Lake Wales Area (I live on the west side of hwy 60 near alturas. As my boyfriend and I got to the side of the house it had split into two balls and were still falling evenly towards the ground. I called to my sister and she came out just as the two balls got just over the tree line and went out. I started explaining what I seen and one light appeared at about the same place as the other two balls had faded out and hovered above the tree line, then another light appeared, and I told my sister to grab my camera or something so we could take pictures. Then within a few seconds apart 5 lights had shown up out of no where and just hovered. Then one at a time they would move like straight up and over, or one would blink out and show up in another spot, and they made out what looked to us like a L, C, and a W. At no time did they appear to be flying or falling they hovered and glided in the sky at speeds an angles I had never seen planes or anything else do. Sometime while we were watching two people that my sister knew pulled in our yard and jumped out of the car saying they had seen it too. We have video and pictures of the video blown up so you can see. Before the lights went away they dimmed out in the same area they showed up and then one ball of light flew off in the north west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we watched the bright light, it began to descend and suddenly sepparated into 2 separate lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that it was a firework of some sort but quickly realized that it was much too high in the sky. Almost immediately after the 2 descending lights were no longer visible, we spotted another light slowly growing brighter and brighter. About 10 seconds later there was another light and then another and then another. We saw a total of 6 lights maximum at one time. Then it seemd as if they were taking turns &#34;turning their lights on and off&#34; because we saw 6 of them, then 4, then 2, then 3 etc, etc. until finally approx after 3 or 4 minutes total, there was nothing.<n>

We have a pretty good view of the sky and it was very visiable.. we always see lights flying in the sky once in a while and this one was very weird. Most of the time we think they are shooting stars, but this one was GREEN!! Veryy ODD.. It went in a straight path so i dont know what it could have been. I&#39;m still spectacle until i see something that zig zags or something...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a completely straight trajectory, rigid almost, and vertical.  It did not flare out it meerly vanished.  It&#39;s coloring was bright green.  The size of the object was larger than any star or meteor I have ever seen in picture or in person.  The duration of the event as very brief. There was no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the past 2 weeks my brother and I had been trying to find a comet that is supposedly viewable in the Northeast sky. While having my smoke, I made a phone call to a friend. After only 2 to 5 seconds of saying hello, I looked up and saw the following:  One “V-Shaped” object heading due south at a slow speed. The object made no sound and had no lights. The object was brownish in color and dark. Although the object was dark, it was clearly offset from the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing over the crest of the houses roof, I quickly ran to the street to see where it went. It was then that the object’s shape became more visible due to the distant city lights. After continuing on its south direction a few more seconds, the object was no longer visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next hour, there was an increase in high and low flying &#34;identifiable flying objects&#34; in the area - Aircrafts  After much debate with another friend this morning, I decided to notify local police to report my experience. They had no information on what it could have been and no records of any other phone calls explaining the event.<n>
11/16/07 20:15|Rogers|AR|Light|1hr 45min|Big white light, then smaller red lights seen in the eastern sky that should not have been there and then vanished.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59918.html|129|ndxe200711| Big white light, then smaller red lights seen in the eastern sky that should not have been there and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was seen first as a bright white light as big around as an ink pen app. 300 yds away in the eastern sky at 20:15. Elevation was at a 40 to 45 degree angle. Height was about what one would expect of a low fling small aircraft. The skys were clear until 22:15. We observed the light not moving for app. 5 minutes. My fellow security guard and I were on patrol and lost sight of the light behind a large two story house before going on with our patrol. After doing an outer perimter check, which took about 5 to 7 minutes, we reached a place we should have been able to see the light again and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At app. 21:20 I dropped my partner off at the security office and drove the same route to see if I could see the light again. The white light was not to be seen, but I seen three red lights perfectly diagonal and spaced in the same general location. I observed the lights for a minute or two trying to think if there was any towers or  buildings in that direction tall enough for these unblinking red lights. The answer is No. I started my patrol of the south part of the proprty and returned to security office at 21:30. Upon returning to security office I spotted 2 red lights directly in front of security and pointed them out to my partner. When asked if he had ever seen them there before he said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights seemed to be about a mile or mile and a half futher east, hard to tell. They too were unblinking and unmoving. The red lights I saw before and these were smaller than the white light we had seen earlier. They were also slightly lower in the sky than the white light we had seen ealier. Also the spaceing was like the middle red light, when I saw three red lights, was missing. A third security gaurd came in at 21:45 and we pointed the lihgts out to him. At 21:50 I crossed the road in front of security station to get the lights from security and cars going down the road behind me to get a clearer look. I wanted to see if these lights were connected, because if they were this thing would have had to have been a hundred yards wide, very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From security one can see radio towers blinking red but there was a different look about hese lights and they never blinked on and off. While trying to get a closer a look a friend of mine called me on my cell phone. I told him to go outside and see if he could see what I was seeing. He could not and before he might see anything the 2 lights went out as if someone had turned the switch off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a metion here that when my partner came in that night he had a 12 sec. phone video of a simlar white light seen from his house in Springdale Ar at 4:30am the night before that he showed me when he first came to work that night. I also saw the white light the night before when I was leaveing work at 22:00 but did not take time to see. if it was a helocopter or plane. He still has it. There were planes in the area, very close, and they should have seen what ever this was plainly. I will try to get more info from local airports and radio stations to see if anyone else saw this and exactly where and how big this might have been. I called one local police station, newspaper,tv station that night to se if anyone else had seen this. Never heard back from tv or newspaper. Police said they had not reieved any reports of strange lights.<n>

The brighter one was crossing the sky from south to slightly northeast, while the lesser light moved on a  southeast to northwest heading on what appeared to be an intercept course.  I watched them move until they were both obscured by the lattice barrier on my deck.  This is only part of the events that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I have a quality IR monocular for night vision, I decided to obtained it from within my house and quickly reentered my hottub.  The events that follow occurred between 6:45 and 7:15. pm, c.s.t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While scanning the visible night sky, I having previously observed two lights moving across the night sky from south to north with the naked eye, observed not two [2], but  eight [8] moving lights in the night sky, but not all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6:45, I observed my first light using the night vision scope.  It was headed from north to southeast.  I can observe the sky from about 35 degrees above the northern horizon to about 90 degrees overhead. The lighted object was moving at a good pace to the southeast observable for about 15 to 20 seconds with my scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once out of my viewable area, I continued to scan the area of the sky I could observe for any additional moving lights. Again I was surprised to see two [2] medium intensity lights like a flashlight beam from several blocks away, moving to the north northeast in a right echelon formation at a pace much slower the that of the single light I had observed some minutes prior.  I was able to track them for a much longer period possible 2 minutes duration.  Their physical separation remained constant during my observance of their track across the sky.  Losing sight of them due to obstructions, I continued to scan the night sky for additional objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 15 to 20 minutes, I observed  four [4] additional lighted objects one [1] moving from the north to south in my viewable area and the other three [3] were observed moving from southwest to north northeast. All of the moving lights observed during this time had light intensities as noted above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitudes of all these observed lights were estimated to be out of our atmosphere, but well below the stationary star formations observed as they passed by.  I’ve never seen so many observable moving lights in all my years of star gazing in just one segment of time today, Friday the 16th of November.  If I have a dependable star chart, I could approximate their track across the night sky due to my very definable and observable viewing parameters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lighted objects, don’t appear to be any military craft and possibly could be various satellites in orbit, but that scenario is highly unlikely, too many in such a short period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else observed these moving lights during this time period?  Time will tell I guess.<n>

It was strange because it had a rapid and sharp direction change. It seemed to be originally travelling SouthWest and immediately transitioned to a straight up direction. I don&#39;t believe it was an optical illusion as far as the angle of observation is concerned. I DO HAVE PICTURES TO BACK UP MY STORY. I&#39;m not an expert on contrails, but I have never observed one with such a sharp angle before. It seems to me that the G-forces would not be too forgiving on the occupants inside of the craft. I did see the craft travelling at the upward angle, but could not make out a shape and becuase it was daylight, I could not see any lights. The pictures were taken using my Motorola V360 camera phone and so are not the best photos, but you can clearly see the sharp angle. Any info on what vehicle could complete this type of maneuver would greatly be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don’t make a practice of telling lies or wild stories; I don’t do any drugs, and have no criminal record. I’m not too worried about my privacy as I have nothing to hide, and if anyone has more questions about my sighting I would be happy to try and answer them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the thirteenth floor of the apartment building I work for in downtown Detroit.  It was a very sunny day, and something in the sky was reflecting the sun light and it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those silver looking aluminum balloons a child might have, but it seemed to be moving towards me at a high rate of speed as it was now much to large to be a child’s balloon.  I can now make out the shape of the craft as it seems to have stopped in mid-air only a few hundred feet outside the window I’m standing at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has a clover shape to it.. Three disk shapes connected in the center, with a sort of bulged center area. At this point the craft starts to rotate up on its side, so that the bottom of the craft is facing towards me. I see a blinking red light in the center of the craft and each clover has a large white circular light on it taking up most of the area of the bottom of these three disks. It’s very hard to explain the features of the craft in words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So at this point it’s been maybe 30-40 seconds that I’ve been watching this thing, and it’s now hovering at a 90 degree angle to me just a few hundred feet out my window on the thirteenth floor.  I start to get the feeling this thing knows I see it and it can see me, as it suddenly displays a light sequence of blue, green, white, and red in an extremely fast flickering pattern. I don’t know how else to describe this light array other than hypnotic in nature, it lasted only a few seconds and when the light show was over, the craft rotated back down from the right angle it was at, and floated off in a south easterly direction (basically directly over Comerica Park) until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is absolutely 100% the truth, and the strangest experience I’ve ever had in my life. I’m not the type of person who looks for these kinds of things or believes every conspiracy theory out there, more than anything else I hope maybe someone else reported the same thing and I can help confirm there story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Staring up at a beautiful isolated puffy white cloud in a northwest direction I spot something unusual. The sky was perfect blue and it was a bit windy. I stare through my polarizing glasses, which allowed me to see the clouds and sky clearly, at 8 to 10 small round shaped white objects moving in formation similar to Canadian geese forming and reforming a triangular shape. My immediate reaction was that it was a flock flying as you always see them. As I watched, I realized they were up by the clouds some 5,000 to 8,000 feet or more, and were colored white, not the usual dark color of geese, and staying very close to the cloud at that high altitude. I watched for some 15 to 20 seconds until all of a sudden they disappeared into the cloud. I kept watching for another 2 minutes or so until the powerful winds quickly swept the cloud away. I kept searching the blue sky for the objects, but saw nothing. Later I was kicking myself for not getting my camera, which was in the car about 300 feet away and taking a shot of the interesting sight, but my mind was too busy at the time trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Fortunately, I am a computer artist and illustrator and was able to recreate the event soon after the sighting in Photoshop. The more I thought about the event the more I realized I’d never seen anything like that before.<n>

So as I went down the road out of the corner of my eyes I thought I kept seeing flashes of light much like a shooting star. so I just do what I always do and walked forward while looking up for something to happen. I got to the school and it was weird that there was like a bunch of kids playing tackling each other? But I kept walking with a stern face because I felt the presence of extraterrestrials. I felt weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked past them and got to the high school track around the football field. And as I have done in the past I decided to lay down and watch the skies for  any kind of shooting stars or UFOS. Sure enough I saw a shooting star it was green and had a tail. It was awesome and only lasted a second or less in a small part of the sky but I was satisfied to continue watching convinced to make some kind of contact. Observing it was an experience that cant be put into words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few moments later I saw a big streak of white light. It was another shooting star. A few times I saw  lights out of the corner of my eye yet because I had not had a clear visual I dismissed them as irrelevant. They could have been a car a street light even those kids or the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually I had seen several shooting stars and thought to myself had I accomplished what I came here for? So still lying there I grew cold even though I was hot from previously walking as I had mentioned that 45minute walk or so kind of pissed me off. Once I got to the track I laid down for about 30 minutes then I said something to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to leave within 5 minutes. I wanted to see a UFO go over my head, directly above me. I wanted it to come from my direct right and move towards my left. Imagine how I felt when this happened exactly like I wanted it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly above my eyes as if you shot a laser from the center of the earth up through the ground through my head on the ground looking up through my eyes if that laser beam kept going perfectly straight  it would hit the thing I saw. It was straight above me as I glanced into the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only visible for 1 second but it was enough. It started of white with a tail like a shooting star then faded away then reappeared on the same path and was white with a tail again but it rotated half way this time. It rotated and I saw a disk. Yes a disk like a saucer lice a Frisbee like a plate. I am convinced it was an intelligent being and after that I have had a different life I just want to talk to someone about this. I went to this exact web site after I witnessed it to try to find if anyone else saw it and all up and down the east coast there was reports of much similar activity if not identical. I experienced lost time loss of hearing and a surge of power. Like I could control the universe. I even had a dream about the exact event years before it happened can I please get some feed back fellow earthlings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When something like this happens you never forget it, and so I will never let this paranormal event escape. I BELIVE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

However, after seeing several videos online as well as interview clips on the History Channel, it is now my belief that I was one of many that witnessed this object or type of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been outside in front of my house about five minutes when I had an urge to walk to the rear of my house. I felt like &#34;someone&#34; was back there. When I came to the backside of my house I didn&#39;t see anyone standing around, but I immediately noticed what at first appeared to be &#34;cop lights&#34; just above the horizon approximately 3-5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the &#34;cop lights&#34; flashed randomly from red to blue but then I noticed green and then yellow flashing as well. I went back inside to get a &#34;monocular&#34; to get a better look and also asked my girlfriend to come outside and take a look.  As I viewed the object through the monocular, I noticed it randomly switched colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and also shapes.  It first appeared like a diamond or two triangles with bottoms touching. Then the object &#34;went all white&#34; and became much larger momentarily. After about 15 seconds, the object appeared to get very small or possibly move away from me. When the object was all white, it appeared more like an oval or sphere.  The object randomly shifted between colors, size and shapes the entire time I watched through the monocular or without the monocular.

I myself was in the US Air Force and am certain it was not conventional aircraft of any sort that I have seen before, or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One odd note I should add is the fact that my girlfriend has had several experiences all of her life in terms of seeing strange objects and &#34;beings&#34;.  She has had &#34;geometric patterns&#34; appear on her tongue that change in shape and appeared to be cut in to her tongue, only to vanish within a few days.  Not witnessed by myself, but several of her family members.  She also has a strange &#34;bump&#34; just under the skin on her left calve. It&#39;s been checked by a doctor (now years ago) but was considered a &#34;calcium anomaly&#34;.  With reports of &#34;alien implants&#34;, I thought perhaps with everything she has experienced, perhaps there&#39;s more to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More specific details of this experience are available upon request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

When we got closer, we saw another just like proximately ten inches (in the sky) to the right.  Then we noticed three stars diagonally, in-between them.  All five “stars” were in perfect alignment, almost in the shape of a cross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *  *                        *                    *  *  We watched them for about an hour and did not see anything else.

I could see it through the bare limbs.  It looked like a giant cleary marble, but it glowed like a swimming pool does at night when the lights are on inside the pool.  It was fluid-looking, like lighted water.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be much bigger than my car.  On the bottom of the craft, were 3 red lights all in a row that appeared to be spinning left-to-right, but not really flashing. I could tell they were spinning though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had slowed my car down when I was coming out of a curve and first saw the very bright white ligh ahead and to the right of the road.  It wasn&#39;t supposed to be there.  The area was an old homesite, but the house had burned down years earlier.  At first I thought it might be that someone had decided to build another house there and had had a security (yard) light put up, but I could tell that the light was way too big to be a security light, even before I saw the object up close.  When I got parallel to the light, I stopped my car and just stared at it.  It was maybe 30 yards from the country road, Old Sandy Hook Road, I was travelling on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary, but the red lights were spinning on the bottom.  The white moon-shaped light looked exactly like swimming pool water when someone walks in the shallow part at night and the lights of the pool are reflected in the gentle waves.  It was beautiful, but I was overwhelmed.  I was afraid to get out of my car, but I just sat in my car in the road and stared at the object until I noticed a truck coming toward me.  The road is not very wide, so I put my car in gear and went forward slowly as the truck came my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this even more strange was that when I rounded another curve a few yards ahead and was headed to the left, I saw the same exact object on the right side of the road ahead of me. There is only woods and one house between where I first saw the object and the second place I saw it.  There is no road someone could have used to perhaps pull a baloon or something from where I first saw it to the second place I saw it.   I kept trying to think of something logical for the light to be, but it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It hovered over trees at the back side of a small field people use to keep a few cows in - not a  big field.  It just hovered there, just like it did earlier.  Now I was really scared, but I couldn&#39;t help myself.  I stopped my car and rolled my windows down, so I could see better. I heard nothing.   I was still afraid to get out, and I kept thinking how  people who might come down the road would think I was crazy, if they saw me stopped in the middle of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head to face ahead of me to see if another vehicle was coming, and  I don&#39;t know if I really saw this or not, but I could swear that a light was over my car and shining on the road all around me.  Now I was very frightened, but I looked back to the right where the object had been, and it was gone.  Another vehicle was meeting me at that moment, so I put my car in gear and left.  I kept looking at the sky to see if I could see the object leaving, but I didn&#39;t see anything else.  But I know what I saw.   I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my girlfriend were leaving Walmart and just a few minutes from home when we saw a bright triangle of white lights coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought maybe it was a plane but it did not look like any plane that I had ever seen.  It did not have the colored lights on the wings, or really any wings at all from what I could tell.  The white lights that we did see were on the bottom of the object and as it got closer we could see that it was in a triangular shape, with the lights going out towards each angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights reminded me of the flux capacitor in &#34;Back to the Future&#34; - but they did not flash, they were glowing constantly.  And they were extremely bright, like the lights at a night game of a baseball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second time that my girlfriend has seen this object, the first time was when our house caught on fire a little over a year ago - she said the object we saw tonight looked exactly like the one she saw at the fire.<n>

I was talking to my spouse and I looked up because I caught movement behind some rather large trees up in the sky. I do not think I would have been able to see it if the trees hadn’t broken up the shape of the object. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the movie Predator the predator creature uses some kind of stealth/cloaking technology to remain unseen, and this was very similar in the manner that it was very difficult to visually make out. I know it was not a plane because it was far to large for that, and there were very dim yet distinct lights that were just as difficult to make out on what appeared to be the outside edges of the object. The object was about the size of two football fields in width and one in length, and was shaped like a triangle. The object was rather difficult to discern, it was as though it was and was not there. The lights gave it a shape, but no distinct characteristics were evident. Because of the way it moved with the trees in my field of view in front of the object I was able to pinpoint its location and trajectory, after it passed over the trees I got a more distinct view in open clear sky. 	 At first I thought it was a hallucination or something but when it reached the clear sky I got a good look at it and I knew it was there. Our planes move through the sky and against the pressure of the gases that make up our atmosphere, as a result  you can see some difficulty in how slow they move even though you know they are moving really freaking fast. This object appeared to move effortlessly, and smoothly-like there was no resistance- and I called out to my spouse- What the hell is that- and started running toward the street to get a better look at it due to it’s movement it was going toward a blind spot to- my at that time current position. My spouse did not have an opportunity to see what I was describing because as I ran toward it, it disappeared from my field of vision- strangely enough before it entered the area that would have been the blind-spot in my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed two red and blue “Stars” twinkling rather fast and they seemed to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get the binoculars for a closer look, and as I focused on the “Stars”, they appeared to be red/blue circle-shaped objects that were moving southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have passed these off as stars had these objects moved together in the earths natural rotation; however these two red/blue twinkling objects seemed to be moving towards a third object farther in the distance and got considerably closer during the 45-50 minutes we watched this.  I compared these particular objects to the other stars in the sky, even the bright yellow planet Venus, and there were no other similar objects like the three we were watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this phenomenon for about an hour and the two objects were moving at a good pace towards the third object which moved at a slower pace in the same southwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ultimately, it appeared that the two larger objects were trying to reach the more distant third object of the same description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening my son went outside to see if he could witness the same thing and he claims he did.

It had 3 distinct and steady white lights at the tip of each corner and seemed to be at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its movement was almost like that of a glider, and it was traveling in a semi-linear path due north-east. The linear movement was characterized by a sort of zig-zag swaying from side to side. It was approximately an inch long on all sides to the naked eye. It looked to be very, very large, maybe 300 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed it for approximately 10 seconds before it was out of sight, trailing off in the same strange motion it had displayed; again, like that of a glider.  It was alarming and caught me off guard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night a friend and I witnessed what seemed to be 4 (maybe 6) orbs over the course of an hour.  They were golden-orange in color and pulsated.  They moved erratically, descending, ascending, stopping, and changing direction. They persisted for approximately 45 minutes. They pulsated, changing in brightness, even disappearing and reappearing, though this might have been due to a fog layer across Monterey Bay.<n>

We are used to seeing all different types of aircraft flying by and around our home: small private planes, jumbo jetliners, military aircraft, helicopters, etc. Never have we seen anything like we saw on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I were planning our Thanksgiving dinner, I glanced out a window facing west. I noticed a craft flying in from over the ocean and at first thought nothing of it. After taking a second look, I couldn’t help but notice the uniqueness of this craft. It displayed lights of a shade of red that I have never seen before on any craft. Also, the initial shape of this craft appeared to be rectangular, and it flew perpendicular to the ground. The more I watched this object, the more curious I became.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up a pair of binoculars to get a closer look. I thought perhaps I could discern a clearer shape. However, viewing it through the glasses did not prove any better than viewing it with the naked eye. All I could make out was that it seemed to be a flying bay of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fully engaged, I walked outside to continue following the path of this object and attempt to detect any sort of noise. At this point, the craft quietly morphed into a spherical shape. When it appeared to stop its forward progression, I called to my wife to have a look. Begrudgingly, she came outside, but within minutes, she too was enthralled with this craft. It quietly hovered for several minutes then began to move slowly toward the west and gain in altitude. After some small flashes, it continued to fade into the night sky and was gone.<n>

But just haven’t had the guts to put it into writing I guess lol.. But I guess since no one knows who I am.. I will contribute!!  On my birthday, November 14, 2007.. I left work at 5pm. It was a really foggy night. I drove down Hwy 49 towards the beach in Gulfport and about 5 or 6 blocks from the beach, I saw a large green &#34;fireball&#34; shoot down from the sky and behind the Hancock Bank building - out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I wasn’t the only one to see this. It took my breath for a second and I looked around after it was out of sight and noticed that all of the cars around me had kind of hit their brakes as I did and slowed down a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This only lasted a couple of seconds and like I said, it was pretty foggy, but I could see it clearly. The fog just made the green glow around it brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight,  December 4, 2007, my daughter just tells me that on her way home to Vancleave, she saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said she and her boyfriend were driving home on O’neal road in Vancleave and they both saw what she described as &#34;like a shooting star,&#34; but bright green.. And &#34;way too big to be a shooting star.&#34;She said it fell straight down and sort of just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was, or have any kind of explanation for it, but it was amazing!  I saw the same thing once before when we lived in Vancleave off of Jim Ramsey Rd. My daughter’s friend and I were so amazed at some lights that we saw in the sky (blinking red, green, yellow.. And moving in ways that normal aircraft don’t move) that we actually, at the risk of looking crazy, got lawn chairs and sat in the front yard and watched for hours. While we were out there, this bright green “fireball” shot down out of the sky and into the empty lot across the street and just seemed to disappear somewhere between ground level and tree level. We both grabbed onto each other and it just took our breath away! We looked at each other in disbelief.. Just like “did you see that too?” Needless to say, we didn’t sit out there very much longer.. We were both scared to death!  There were other things there at that house as well.. A light shining straight down (like a search light from a helicopter is the only way I could describe it) onto the middle of my street. Dogs were barking out of control as well. I saw this outside of my kitchen window. There were street lights there, but they went off when the light shone down on the street (like when your headlights hit the street lights and they go off sometimes). It moved around a little almost like it was looking for something. If it had been a helicopter.. THAT close to the ground.. There WOULD HAVE BEEN NOISE!! I was in shock.. And called to my daughter who was on the phone. She took one look and told her friend on the phone that it was the “creepiest thing she had EVER SEEN” and said she couldn’t look anymore!  And another night, I was sleeping and my daughter and a different friend walked outside and explained seeing something else odd.. My daughter said “have you ever seen a plane with so many lights?” and her friend responded, “have you ever seen a plane with so many lights flying so close to the ground?” and they both kind of got scared and took off for the front door. They said that by the time they reached the front door, the “thing” was directly over the house.. Moving quickly.. And not making a sound!!  I have also read some of the other sightings in the area and can say that for quite some time, I have been seeing these “things” in the sky.. Distant, but not STAR distant. And they always have the same signature “yellow, green and red lights” flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes they are in the same place, but other nights they have moved to different locations. I can usually see them outside of my house if I go out and look. A few nights ago, I watched one for about 30 minutes and then all of a sudden, it started to move like an airplane would.. Moved across the sky at a pretty fast speed, but no sound. And I can always hear the normal airplanes at even further distances here. And these things DO NOT MOVE LIKE REGULAR AIRCRAFT!!!  Every time I see anything strange, I call whoever I can get to come and look.. I told them I didn’t want them to think I was “crazy” haha  And every time, they see exactly what I see.. My daughter and my son, daughter’s boyfriend, my mother and my sister. Even an ex boyfriend whose dad is a pilot.. And he said he has seen strange things as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So.. Whatever they are.. I can just hope that one of these days I will KNOW for SURE!!  And we are the typical family. I am a single mother of 2 teenagers.. I am an administrative assistant  and my kids are good kids who make good grades in school. As a matter of fact, I told them it might be better to keep it in the immediate family so as not to seem “crazy” to people who have never experienced these kinds of things. =P  Hopefully, in my lifetime, this can all be explained to me better than “flares” or “weather balloons” or “satellites”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ Curious in Mississippi<n>

Looking up in the sky while driving east. I say maybe 700 ft. in the sky.

It looked to have some type of radiation or something and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were so amazed by what we saw.

Just saw something unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in West Los Angeles - near Pico and Overland/Westside Pavillion.  Got into bed around 10:20 with lights out, looked out my front window (I live on top of someone&#39;s detached garage) facing east.  I see in the sky these odd-shaped red lights that made me think &#34;what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 5-10 seconds before it went out of view of my window and unfortunately I don&#39;t have other windows with a good view and I even went outside but couldn&#39;t see in that direction.  It was going in a southwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see A LOT of planes out my window as a lot come into Santa Monica airport, and I see others traveling to/from LAX.  This was going in the direction of LAX so hopefully some other people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i&#39;m not saying it was an alien space craft, just unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen out my window.  It had maybe 6-8 small red blinking lights that were widespread - maybe the lenght of 5-6 airplanes that I usually see out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just now thinking maybe it was a blimp, although it seemed to be moving faster than blimps move, but about same speed to a bit faster than a 747 type plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I can really think to describe what I saw.  It was quick, but thought I&#39;d share and see if anyone else saw it or has an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t have time or equipment to take a pic/video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were definitely other planes nearby in the sky so pilots had to have seen it.<n>

The sky was really clear and we were looking at the stars. Then we noticed 3 (what we thought was stars) they started moving back and forth and 1 went down then back up. at first we thought it might be planes. But it was really different. I had my camera so I put it on night setting without flash, just tring to get pictures of the stars. We did NOT see these shapes in the sky.We did see a flash of red, and yellow. It was only when I went to print my pictures that I saw this. I was shocked!<n>

At first, I thought they might be Orion&#39;s belt, but it occured to me that they were too bright, too far apart, and in the wrong part of the sky to be those three stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the three strange lights for about 3 or 4 minutes. I got the impression that these lights were quite low to the ground and closer than I had previously thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a blink of an eye, the three lights formed a triangular pattern and began to move in perfect unison to the west towards the Prescott National Forest.  The triangle it formed blocked out the stars like a big black shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds, the lights had disappeared.  I looked around the sky and recognized several jets darting about in the area where the lights had been.<n>

I looked to the East and saw a set of yellow lights and one flashing red light.  It appeared to be circular in shape when I first witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my wife and son to look so I would have witnesses.  As they looked the craft came closer and I could see that it was triangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just above the treetops and made absolutely no noise.  It was approximately two football fields away from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time we phoned my mother and she also saw the craft.  Then as it moved it banked sharply and changed course heading back the way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the sheriffs office and asked it any one else had reported it.  We were not surprised to find out others had indeed reported it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am used to seeing air craft in the area but none that come this close with out the sounds of an engine.<n>

I saw two sets of four bright, round, evenly-spaced lights flying in front of me from left to right (I guess it’s South to North).  As soon as they reached the highway, they abruptly made a 90 degree turn and started flying eastbound over Jacksboro Highway.  I could see them start to sway from side to side, first by raising the right side of the craft and then raising the left side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued going westbound and I looked in my side mirrors and saw a very bright light in the center above the four lights.  It illuminated what appeared to be the sides of a domed top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not rationally explain what it was that I saw because it wasn’t like anything I’d ever seen before.  I did not hear any noise coming from the flying craft above me, so I eliminated the fact that it could have been a helicopter.  It was flying very low, so I didn’t think it could be an airplane.  And also, when it made the “turn” to follow Jacksboro Highway (east), the lights didn’t move.  They didn’t change their position.  I couldn’t even tell that the craft had turned until it started flying toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a domed portion on top of the saucer. As it flew over me at about 400 ft. it was a triangle wing sillouette. Low near silent rumble with 5-6 round enginge ports at the rear glowed orange that resembled the front row of the crafts brite bank of lights, and lights on each delta tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft would appear suacer shape from any direction of observation eccept directly overhead. it looked the same going away as coming towords me. very big delta shape.

I got up to the 78 split where I slammed on my breaks and almost got into an accident!  There was a LOW flying craft NOT MILITARY of any sort WAS NOT A STEALTH, as CA had their Military Air Show in October 2007; closest Air Force Base is March 45 minutes to 1 hour North on I-15, they do not house Stealths!  Triangular shaped LARGER than a Football Field!  There were about 15-20 other cars in front of me, who had all slammed on their breaks just to watch it!  As I could not move, I did relay this sighting to my mother and step-father.  The craft proceeded South bound on I-15 crossing slightly toward the West.  I pulled over once I finally got on to West bound 78 and watched it pass the valleys until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Total time watching it was about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The morning was warm and sunny and the sky was clear. When I first noticed it my thought was that it was a plane leaving a con trail (this was very near the Palm Springs airport) but I could not see any object only a large bright white plume. However, something was emitting a billowing plume behind it. The plume was not like a standard con trail- it billowed or seemed to roll behind the object almost like pulsing out-and also dissapated quite quickly - I would say it dissapated in maybe 2000 feet. Another interesting thing to note is that I could not hear it (I was about a mile from it) nor actually see an object ahead of the plume. Airplanes engines make noise and in this valley you can definitely hear them from much further away. I work around the airport and I am familiar with all the engine sounds that our air traffic makes, but this did not make any sound. Mount San Jacinto is approximately 12,000 feet high and was the background setting as this object went by, close to the mountain, heading west to east at an altitude of approximately, based on the height of the mountain, 8,000 feet. I also used the height of the mountain to estimate the length of the trail. I have to believe that tons of folks also witnessed this but found no mention of it on any of the news broadcasts. I have never seen an airplane leave a con trail at that altitude here nor seen a con trail like it. I had my binoculars in the car, unfortunately not around my neck, so I couldn&#39;t get a better look at whatever it was. But, as I said, I was working at the time and the work was time sensitive and demanding of my attention so I had to focus back on my work. When I had a chance to look for the object, about 2 minutes later, it was gone or out of sight. Has anyone seen anything similar or perhaps witnessed this same object? I have seen a few unidentified objects through the years but nothing like this. This was totally di! fferent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first glance I thought it was a typical aircraft however, it was pulsating from dim to bright very slowly and irregularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave close attention to it as it began to slow down.  It eventually went out of my line of sight and so I got out of bed and ran outside in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came to crawling stop. After 1 minute of me having seen the object initially, it had covered 90 degrees of the entire horizon, which meant that it was either ridiculously quick, or that it was ridiculously close.  However, the first thing I noticed when I went outside was that there was no noise at all. This object was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stood still in the sky for approximately 3 or so minutes. It looked much like a radio tower beacon at this point as it was not moving, and its blood red illumination continued to dim and brighten randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was considering waking my parents up, or running and getting the camera, or even jumping in my car to chase it, but I was frozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now kicking myself for not having got the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was also coming to terms with the possibility that I was probably the witness of a UFO sighting.

Noise heard like an aeroplane from really close up, nearest air path though is over three miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked out window and saw three blue lights in a triangle formation, the bottom two lights though turned to yellow/red. People in the local pub reported seeing three lights in the sky to local authoity but it was passed off as a hot air balloon (unlikely).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging frrom what i saw it was about half a mile and 100km in the air. Judging by that it must have been about 500m between the two outer lights. It was traveling at around 12mph.and lasted for 2 minutes until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a helicopter but police confirmed that no helicopters had been on that area.<n>

As me and my friend were walking to my car so I can take him home. My friend spotted the object first and told me to look. At first glance I thought it was a balloon because it was round and white, it was hovering pretty low, I told him it looks like a balloon. He disagreed, As I focused in on the object the object started to move very quickly going North west towards East Los Angeles / Monterey Park area, it had blue, white and red lights, Not extremely bright but bright enough to see once your eyes have focused in on it. As the object seemed to be weightless because of the way in was moving, it was moving side to side but still on a straight path, we observed till the object faded out. We were in the area of Whittier Blvd and Montebello Blvd @ approximately 11:00 pm<n>

The small light from right to left bounced in a specific pattern, the light moved horizontally very quickly in a straight or slightly curved path and then “bounced” a much further distance and appeared to enter the ocean although there was no splash or sound.  I was shocked as was my girlfriend and suddenly the light moved in spiral motion about 720 degree circle and then at an angle it shot up into the sky from left to right.  There was another small pause and then from left to right the light did the exact same thing that it did at the very first time but the other way and entered the ocean the same.  At this point were more shocked than ever, I have no idea how to explain it.  To give you a timeline it was about 2 minutes total: [10sec] ball bounced right to left, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball circled and shot into sky, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball bounced left to right.  Also I’d like to add this event looked to be quite far out over the ocean and took place at night.  To give you a relative distance, look out over the ocean from the Outrigger Maui Eldorado property, measure the distance between edges of the beach that you can see and about ¼ of that distance was the total distance the ball moved left to right, right to left, and left to right again.  I hope that’s enough details, I looked online a bit to see if I could find a similar experience because I’m not sure what it was, if it was a UFO or an energy source I have no way to explain the event in my head.  There isn’t any way it could be a ball being thrown or a human craft, nothing could move as fast as it did and as far as it did, I’ve compared ideas with my girlfriend as well and neither of us can think of anything that it could have been.  If anyone has a better explana! tion of what it could have been PLEASE let me know, I can’t say I know 100% that it was a UFO but I know nothing on our planet at this time can move like that did in the air, and absolutely nothing man made could move that fast.  If you would like to contact me for more info on what took place or if you have any information for me please contact me: ryan4thewin@gmail.com<n>

The best way I can describe them is a bright center with a glow in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually lost sight of them after falling behind the cloud after tracking them for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began running up a bit and searching for them again and eventually looked up to have something else catch my eye.  I was looking pretty much straight up and saw a group of quickly moving objects that held an incomplete V formation, 7 to 10 total  (Two on the short side the rest on the long side).  The objects looked like short dashes and were also white, the same brightness as stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation held the entire time they crossed the sky west to east which took around 15 seconds until I lost them over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not that much of a UFO enthusiast but the fact that I witnessed two separate phenomena within 30 seconds of each other irked me enough to decide that it needed reporting.  I assume that the falling lights could have been flares, but I know of nothing that can explain the V formation.<n>

It looked dark in colour, I’m not quite sure what colour, looked either black or dark grey/silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from a northerly direction to a south-westerly direction, therefore it did not do straight over the house, it kind of moved off to the left but overhead.  This object made absolutely no sound whatsoever, and this is why I can’t explain it as anything other than a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed it was moving at was quite fast as it was as quick as I could turn my head to watch it disappear.  I didn’t even have a chance to take a picture or call my partner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have drawn more or less what I think that it looked like. (Could be thinner or fatter, I’m not sure)  I would be eternally grateful if you could post any other sightings in this area, as it is one of the most awesome experiences I have ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kindest Regards<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I have tried writing this a couple of times but it seems to start jumping so I figured this format may be best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HOW:  I am a smoker and go outside several times a night to have a cigarette and watch the sky.  I have been doing this for years and have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was the first to notice this but did not want to say anything to me for fear I would think she is crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the first sighting I have seen this on numerous occasions for the past few months.  I have seen as many as three at one time in the sky but never very close to one another.  They do not appear in the same location in the sky every time.  And at times they are in different locations in the same night.

I immediately thought it was it was a shooting star or some kind of meteor, but it didn&#39;t appear to be moving.

It looked as though it was spinning because it was wobblig.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved up, then down, then started to move North towards the Irvine Spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, the object dropped down like it fell from the sky then shot up into the air and disappeared.

I believe in UFO&#39;s and your web-site is bad enough to turn a believer into a non-believer. On your front page you have a story of a crop circle from July 1st. In that story you have &#34;rumor&#34; of an unconfirmed resident witnessing a bright flash...You also have &#34;rumor&#34; of a person taking a photograph of an object hovering... Folks, this happened in &#34;JULY&#34;... Why have you not updated this story? Why were you not on this the day of the event? Did you check the site for radiation? When you went to this town and found the existing set of footprints on the site, why did&#39;nt you go ahead and spend an hour confirming the witness of the bright flash and check out the so called picture? Did you not think that was important? If you want people to take this seriously then you have got to do a much better job or just close shop because sites like this makes us believers look like fruitcakes. People are not dumb so why are you making it out as if they are? The crop circle looks like a simple human made job and then you back that up with unconfirmed &#34;stories&#34;... Wow!!! Great job!

There were four objects that were roughly in the same line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked one of my coworkers said &#34;Look to the right of them there are some more&#34;.

Working into the wee hours of the morning I was really tired and left my backyard office to go into the house and get some sleep. I happen to be walking into the house (roughly round 4:30 a.m.) but a light caught my attention as I stepped up on the back porch. I looked up at this light and it was very strange looking as I can’t recall seeing anything like it before. The light was just hovering off in the distance toward the East. At first I thought it to be a star or planet or something of sorts but then I noticed even further that the entire skyline in that direction was totally blacked out. No stars, planets or moons or nothing. There appeared to be a high cloud cover which prevented all the other objects you would normally see at night to be obscured from vision. Just that one light up there. So I thought to myself it’s kinda odd that one star would show thru and not any of the others. Then I happen to notice that the light I was looking at was getting brighter and then dimming again as in a pulse and it kept repeating, bright, dim, bright, dim. Then I knew something wasn’t right about this hovering object and went inside and woke up my wife. I told her about what I had seen and asked her to get the camcorder for me so I could film it. She got the camcorder for me and we both went out on the back porch to see this light. The object did not appear to move other than a slight rocking motion. But the bright, dim thing kept going. I pulled out the camcorder and shot about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of footage when I was just too tired and shaking to continue. There was no sound from the object. The only sound I recorded on video was passing cars on the hwy. I deleted the audio on my footage upload later so the file would be smaller for upload. But I went to the edge of the porch to get the best view and started video recording. My wife had seen UFO’s before and she wasn’t too thrilled about them so she wen! t back i nto the house. This was my first encounter of a hovering, illuminating light. The skyline behind the object was completely dark. Nothing else was visible in the video as a reference so I couldn’t determine size, or shape. It appeared that the clouds had all reference points blocked. I couldn’t even see the trees that were located to the left and right of the object in my line of sight. It was very dark. But I continued to record and zoomed in and out a few times to try to get a good shot of the object. I held the camera up about a 45 Deg angle to record. It appeared to be hovering over a Georgia Power Electric Sub Station which is just down the road from my residence. But it may have been farther away. I couldn’t really tell without the reference points. I have no clue what the object was. I got tired of filming and went inside to go to bed. I layed down for about 20-30 minutes but couldn’t stop thinking about it and went back to the kitchen window to check on it again. It was still there. I went to sleep and when I awoke round 12 noon on 11/12/07 it was gone.

It was between 3:00 and 4:30 AM.  Don’t recall exactly the time or date (late November or early December).  I looked up in the sky and noticed a lot of activity.  This was what prompted me to look in the first place.  When I looked up I saw a couple of oval shapes with flashing lights; don’t recall the color except that I know there were red and green lights.  These lights were flashing like crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got up and looked out the window, I saw at least 10 oval shapes.  About 3 to the south and at least 7 scattered around to the north.  Scattered, but closely.  No particular formation either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I excitedly woke my daughter and told her what I saw.  She looked up and said, &#34;Those are satellites, Mom!&#34;  I looked for a few minutes, thought she might be right, and went back to bed.  For the time period that I watched, nothing moved except the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything out of the ordinary and am not inclined to seeing odd things but this was quite a sight.  I really do not believe that these were satellites.  I certainly have never seen anything like this and, as I said, my blinds point up so I have a great view of the moon at night.  I would say they were fairly large since I could make out their shape and they did not seem to be terribly high in the sky although not really close either.  I have wanted to share this with someone and now have found your website so there you go!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a dark evening with no moonlight.  We were talking and an auto siren from somewhere in the distance went off.  My daughter asked what the sound was and I turned.  When I did, I immediately saw 2 extremely fast flashing objects in the sky.  The flashing lights on the objects were nothing like I had seen before on any airplane.  The primary light was white but there was also a red light.  We both were shocked as we never had seen anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the objects, at first they were close together and seemed stationary and then started to move.  One object seemed to move diagonally very quickly and then to the northwest passing over our home.  The other went in to opposite direction and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter ran into the house to get a camera.  The object was lower in altitude and when it passed over the house, I tried to get a good look.  It seemed to not make any noise at all.  It looked to be sphere shaped.  The lights were now not flashing as fast, but there was a pattern of white, red, and green lights that continued to flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter couldn&#39;t find the camera so she came running back out and tried to get a picture with a cell phone camera, which didn&#39;t work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were over the shock, we kept looking into the sky and realized that we counted over 6 airplanes in different courses.  They were very recognizable as we could recognize the airplane lights.  We live near the Atlanta airport and apparently there was numerous planes flying at the time, even though I’ve never seen that many at one time where I live.  However, the 2 objects we witnessed were not like these airplanes.  The lights were very different.  The only way I can describe the quickness of the lights is that it was like Christmas Tree Flashing lights turned up to the highest speed.  Extremely Fast Flashing.  Then when the one did a diagonal zig zag, we both almost panicked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my daughter nor I have ever experienced anything &#34;paranormal&#34;.  She is a college student and mother herself.  I am a 38 year old Real Estate Professional.  We have a family of 5 and live a quite simple life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that night, I’ve been out each evening trying to see something similar, however I just see airplanes.  This is just reinforcing that the 2 objects we saw, were not airplanes.<n>

I thought the objects were parts of a meteor or satellite that had reentered, but after about three seconds they stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of the objects made 90 degree turns and went opposite directions, with the others staying motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two rejoined the group several seconds later after making some pretty impressive tight maneuvers (that ruled out meteor or satellite pretty quick) and they changed to a SE course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be at high altitude and were about 2-3 times the diameter of the stars in the sky.  They stayed the same color (red to light red) throughout the sighting, and no noise or other signs were noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to maintain visual contact with the objects for a total of about 15 seconds until they were close enough to the SE horizon that lights made viewing them difficult.<n>

I thought VAFB was doing another launch. I went outside and observed that it was not a missile (not the usual engine rumble and the trajectory was wrong).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was moving south at a good clip but not anything super fast, and it wasn’t rotating. I kept watching as it flew directly over my home. It was dark so I could not gage altitude, but I would guess under a thousand feet. It seemed to have a round cylindrical shape, with red and green lights. I was thinking it was an airplane-- it had to be, but with no engine noise? I saw what looked like a shooting star just to its left and thought that was a strange coincidence then, I saw another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked it until it was over the city of Lompoc then I saw it stop. A white light was coming from the top. This light had a strange look though. Instead of just a solid light it looked like it was a very fast strobing light. I was considering it might be some experimental, Air force thing. Then I saw what appeared to be an aircraft with a single white light coming from the direction of the VAFB flight line (that aircraft made a jet engine noise) and was headed toward the &#34;floating&#34; craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first craft then resumed its clip heading down the coast followed by the other craft until I lost sight of both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived on or around AFB’s for over 40 yrs and never have I witnessed anything like this, so I just wanted to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m curious if anyone else saw any thing odd tonight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, maybe I’m nuts and it was just my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks UFO guys.<n>

It appeared to be a bright light (cicle). It stayed in one place not moving one bit for about 1 min 40 sec. But getting smaller and fading as the seconds went on. On the video that I have caught it on it is a perfect circle and is flashing different colors. It eventually faded away completely. I&#39;ve never seen a light or whatever it is on the mountain like that and it was odd to see it so bright like that during the day. I had walked outside of my 3rd floor apt to smoke a cig as I do multiple times through out the day and night and the first thing that caught my eye was the light. I should add that to my eyes it was stead in color and shape and not really any flashing. But on the video there is colors flashing. I after I went inside to upload it to my computer I heard weird beeping noises (not sure what it was or if that matters, it was just out of the ordinary) and it took a long time for my computer to recongnize i was trying upload something.  Which was weird I had to restart my computer to finally get it on. I have the video on the computer and my phone which i had recorded it. Let me know if you want it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched as it streaked along the sky at a slow pace with what seemed to be sparks and embers trailing behind. It glowed orange and then red and back to a dark orange.

It looked like a satellite dish. I would of checked the &#34;saucer shaped&#34; box, but the bottom was moving in the direction of travel. Basically it looked like a backyard satellite dish, but it was so far away it had that blue haze on it, like viewing a mountain, or high altitude airplane from a distance. The sun was starting to set, but the sky was still lit fairly well. 3 other people saw it, but everyone just assumed it was a satellite. Now i might be wrong but this didnt look like your traditional NASA satellite with the solar arays and what not, and even if it was it would of had to been in a super low orbit, and ginourmous for us to of seen the detail that we saw. It moved in a constant direction, with a constant speed, until it disappeard into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it for the first time in either late September or early October. 2007, but during this time span, I have seen it on almost a nightly frequency. As was the case on Nov. 10, 2007, it did not appear in the 1 AM-2:30 AM time span I did not see it at all, although I did look for it, but it does not ofteh skip more than one night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen it before 1 A.M., and although I get tired and my somethat arthritic neck gets sore if I stare at this object more thas 15 minutes at a time, I have looked for it when I woke up around 2:00 AM and don&#39;t recall ever seeing it there at that time.  It is always in the sky southwest of my house and usually does not move very noticeably until it has been observable for at least 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance it appears to be a very tight cluster of very bright white lights, but only a minute or so later, I see a bright red light coming from somewhere in the cluster, which seems to be a triangular formation during more of the time I am observing it. It seems to be more the tight cluster while it is standing still and when it is moving on a steady line to my left or right. But when it suddenly begins to dart about, it is impossible to determine its shape. And last night and at least two or three previous nights, one bright white light about the size of the object when I first observe it, breaks off from the original cluster, and then both the originaly cluster and the more or less satellite which mimics the slower movements of the original. If have not watched all this long eough to observe the first object and the second re-unite, but I have obsered that the first one observed and the sattelite never seem to get closer together or farther apart. I cannot say precisely what the spacing is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD))<n>

A large, very bright ball of light dropped down into my field of vision in my windshield on the driver&#39;s side. It just hung there in the sky for several seconds before it suddenly zipped straight back up into the sky the same way it had come. It happened very fast. I stopped and leaned out to see if I saw it in the sky anywhere but it was totally gone. In my windshield, it was probably about the size of a big headlight but the light was very defined, edges not blurry at all. Not a very good comparison but that&#39;s about how big it looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen this once before sometime around the fall of 1977. I was lying on my back in the pasture with the horses one night around 8:00 in the evening. I was looking up at the sky when suddenly a similar ball of light appeared to fall straight down into my field of vision. It hung there for a few seconds, then it started to move straight back up slowly. I sat up because I started to get a little scared. All of a sudden it took off almost straight back up but angled off to the right a little bit. Then it just disappeared. I lived in Mississippi then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking my dog in Warren Park in Frisco, Texas.  I was standing on the sidewalk just east of the entrance to the park off of El Dorado.  Although there were activities going on at the west end of the park that were brightly lit, it was dark where I was standing and I had paused to see if I could spot Comet Holmes.  I knew about where to look for it; I was searching the sky around a third of the way to halfway between Cassiopeia and the southeastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a serious amateur astronomer but I have a pretty good knowledge of the night sky from my boyhood interest in astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the sky, I became aware of an object to the left and above where I was looking.  The object was moving from SSE to NNW, almost directly overhead when I began observing it.  It moved in a straight line at a constant speed and didn’t do anything tricky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for approximately 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent ...that is, I could hear nothing coming from it.  There was some road noise from El Dorado, which was close by, but jets that were flying at a much higher altitude (apparent altitude – see below) could easily be heard over the few cars that were passing, and when there  was no traffic I strained to hear something coming from the object but could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had an angular width of, I am estimating, 2 or 3 knuckles on my fist held at arm’s length.  I am aware that people overestimate the both the actual and apparent size of things they see in the sky and it is not impossible that its angular width may be less than that.  But it was not tiny in appearance – it extended over enough of the sky that it was plainly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not certain of the shape of the object, but I had the impression at the time that it was chevron-shaped and heading in the direction of the pointy part – like an old Northrup Flying Wing, but more angled than that.  I may be imagining its shape.  I have seen reports of triangle-shaped UFOs, and that is not out of the question.  The sky was dark but not completely black, and because of the light pollution of the DFW area there is not a highly populated starfield in any direction, but there was plainly some kind of silhouette that blocked out the sky and the few stars behind it as it moved through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I am certain of is that the object exhibited a series of orange disks in a shallow V shape (as though along the leading edge of the chevron), perhaps 6-8 down each arm.  They were distinctive but their “glow” was so dull that I am speculating that they were not self-lit but were reflectors picking up the lights from the ball fields.  Their round shape was very clear and not fuzzy or sparkling, as might have been the case if they were lit up.  The lights were very dull; I would never have noticed them if I weren’t looking right at the object when it came into my field of vision.  The lights were not moving around – they were apparently affixed to whatever was moving through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights or other typical aircraft running lights on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size and height:  Very hard to say.  Any estimate is complicated by the lack of any points of reference.  In fact, even if there had been buildings or trees in the field of view it would not have made much difference because there was no auditory cue to distance.  That there was no audible sound coming from the object suggests great height.  The orange disks were, although not bright, very distinctive and clearly circular, with hard edges.  And the object was had a fair angular diameter, which suggests closeness.  So either the thing was far away and enormous, or closer and smaller.  Put another way, It had a much greater angular width than the numerous jets that are approaching DFW and that were flying over Frisco at that time, so if it was flying at that height it was very large.  My unsupported “feeling,” however, was that it was not flying that high; the clarity of the shape and outline of the two rows of disks suggests that it was not at a great height, but neither was it anywhere close to the ground or nearby treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure how it disappeared, except that it did not speed out of sight.  It just kind of winked off (although not so abrupt as a winking), as though it had gone into a cloud bank (but the sky was cloudless).  This would be consistent with my speculation that the dull orange disks were reflectors, and that the angle between the object and the lights of the ballfields had become such that they no longer reflected my way.  I will say that the reflection theory suffers from the fact that I was generally between the field lights and the object, which was moving away from the field, so there was no angle-of-incidence = angle-of-reflection thing going on if the reflector were just a flat surface.  If the disks were reflectors, they were complex enough to pick up the field lights and reflect them slightly backwards towards me.  And they could have been picking up the many other light sources of Frisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to make a guess as to a terrestrial origin of this thing, it would be a large private aircraft flying at medium altitude with an engine quiet enough to blend in with the noises of the night at that height, with reflectors on the underside of its wings.  Not a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the opportunity to make this report.<n>

Individually each has flickering lights and they hover throughout the night in the same position but move rapidly left-right-up-down and sometimes in circular or semi-circular moves as they continue to hover in the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually couple of hours later 5-7 similar objects/light patterns appear more toward the West, the closest being straight above and the rest of them in some sort of formation stretching few miles apart. These are in much higher altitudes (our guess)50-70,000 ft or higher. These are very well visible once you have trained your eyes to pick each of them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is most obvious is that in the early morning at daybreak, the stars start to fade but these are still visible until the sun is almost up. Two days ago we observed a small light travel from Northern direction for about 2 minutes and judging from the altitude must have flown about 10 miles before being absorbed or joining the one parked above our house. The reason it is easy to pick them out is that the lights of all of them align in the same pattern no matter how far they are apart. There is a military base in Key West and we see the military planes fly but lot lower altitude also there are commercial flights.

It was about 1:30pm and it was a very clear blue sky.  I could see two wispy white clouds, high above to my right.  I was driving north on HWY 277 near the old PAVE PAWS govt. radar facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was plenty of traffic heading South but I was the only one at that moment traveling North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ahead in the distance, I could plainly see one large tree on the left side of the road.  The road turned a bit to the right and was at a higher altitude than where I was currently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly became aware of two disks or cigars shaped objects traveling West only a few feet above the height of the tree.  But they were not as high as the height of the cell tower on the right.   I became aware of them on the right side of the road and could see them crossing over the road in front of me.  I was traveling 70 miles per hour but they appeared to be going slowly.  They were not very big.  Maybe the size of a car.  They were traveling one in front of the other. They were the color of the white clouds near by.  They almost looked invisible but I could make out their shape against the background.  It seemed forever until I arrived to the top of the small hill where the tree was and I slowed down to look toward the west.  I could not see them again on the left side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the trip, I kept looking at other things trying to justify that I really saw them.  I spotted a big Texas vulture, but it still looked like a bird when I got close.  I spotted a jet across the sky with the white streak behind it but as I got closer, it still looked like a jet.  I spotted a small airplane near San Angelo, but as I got closer and it got further, it continued to look like a small plane.  I do not know what I saw, but it appeared to me like they thought they were hidden as they traveled slowly across the road. Almost like I was not supposed to have noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jet fighter hit by an object in the presence of four UFO&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a translation from an article in a Romanian newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the link:   http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=329959<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;MiG hit by a UFO above Ardeal  November 9, 2007  by Mihai Soica   A jet fighter from Campia Turzii was hit by four unidentified flying objects   Air force pilot Marius Mitrica declared yesterday that his MiG 21 Lancer craft was hit while flying at an altitude of 6,500 meters by an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The accident took place last week during a training flight in the area around the city of Gherla, close to Cluj.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet fighter piloted by commanding lieutenant Marius Mitrica was flying at over 850 km/h. &#34;I was flying at 6,500 meters [of altitude] and I didn&#39;t notice anything particular. Suddenly, however, I was hit by a sturdy object from the Right side of the airplane. The collision broke the Plexiglas covering the cockpit. The pieces pierced my helmet and injured my face. At first, I ducked as much as possible because the air current was very strong and the temperature reached -30 degrees Celsius. I came down to a lower altitude and I slowed down. I noticed that the airplane responded to my commands and I finally slowed down&#34;, explained Marius Mitrica who is an Air force pilot since 1991.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither a bird nor a meteorite   The pilot is convinced that the object that hit him was not a bird. &#34;I&#39;m 99,9 percent sure that it wasn&#39;t a bird&#34;, he said. Immediately after landing, a committee of specialists from the Air force inspected the airplane hoping to find the rest of the object that hit the MiG. &#34;When I landed, my first instinct was to look in the cockpit to find the rest but I just found Plexiglas pieces&#34;, added Mitrica who ended up with a Black eye due to the accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilot also added that it is impossible that he was hit by a meteorite because in such a scenario the impact would have been devastating. &#34;I don&#39;t think it was a meteorite because this one has a considerable kinetic energy. Had it hit the airplane, I don&#39;t think I would be here talking to you&#34;, said the pilot. He added that he was lucky with the Oxygen mask who helped him overcome the shock quickly. &#34;Had I not had the mask, I could have lost conscience due to the shock of finding myself without the plastic shield. The biggest danger was hypothermia&#34;, Mitrica said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the air controllers from the Campia Turzii Base during the training flight when the accident happened was the pilot&#39;s own wife, Carmen Mitrica. She declared that she could not ask her husband if he is all right through the radio because that frequency was used by the other pilots in the air. &#34;I gave him all the indications he needed to land safely&#34;, said Carmen Mitrica. Every fighter jet has a video camera recording training flights. However, the video analysis did not shed any light on this accident according to the Air force&#39;s 71st Base stationed in Campia Turzii.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video clip with the UFO is with the SRI  Air force general Ion Avram specified that the video clip shows four triangles the size of an A4 sheet each coming towards the aircraft from the right. &#34;We gave the video images to the Romanian Information Services [SRI, N.B. The Romanian secret services] to be analyzed and to tell us what hit the MiG&#34;, declared general Ion Avram. The general also added that birds do not fly during this season at such altitudes because it&#39;s too cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 71st Air force officials also verified if the &#34;UFO&#34; could be an object from another airplane flying in the vicinity. The hypothesis was excluded since the last airplane flying in the area passed by there more than an hour prior to the accident.&#34;<n>

The brightness was steady and there were no rotating beacons, sound, nor change of colors noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object tracked at about 100 degrees for approximately one minute, then angled to a new heading of approximately 120 degrees.  It remained on this heading for only about 30 seconds when it made another angular change to a heading of about 140 degrees, where it was at an elevation of about 45 degrees or thereabout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object dimmed after about 15 seconds and was no longer visible.  It did not go behind a cloud.  From this, I gathered that it was a reflected light and the object dimmed as it moved into the earth&#39;s shadow.

My wife was sitting just inside the glass door, sitting on the couch in her white nightly robe, and doing a cross word puzzle.  We were only about 10 feet from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting facing my southern back yard brick wall that was approximately 60 feet from me, with the back of my neighbor’s home on the other side of the wall approximately 120 feet from me. Both of our homes were single story family homes in east Mesa Arizona. Each home was approximately 60 feet in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just sitting there relaxing and everything was very quiet when I suddenly saw some lights that looked like professional football stadium lights, only in a single row (not 2 rows), very slowly rising from in front of my neighbor’s home until they were exposed barely over the home’s roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, in length, were looking to be about 10 feet past the west side of the home and about 30 feet past the east side of the home. This made the light fixture look to be about 100 feet in length and there looked to be about 10 lights, running horizontally. The light fixture looked to be about 6 feet in bottom to top height.  The lights were directly facing North, and my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was that I was smiling a little and wondering what my neighbor was doing rising up lights like that, that were very large, at this time of night. That changed when I suddenly realized that the lights were now barely over the peak of my neighbor’s roof and very slowly moving over it toward my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing this my next reaction, as I still sat in my chair, was that I realized the lights I was seeing were not on a pole, they were airborne, very low, and moving very slowly towards my home, with absolutely no sound.  It was then that I immediately stopped thinking about my neighbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights had slowly passed over my neighbor’s home and were now over my back yard approaching my home, I stood up and walked off the patio and into my back yard as the lights slowly now went over me.  Approximately 2 minutes had passed from the time I first saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up I saw that the area behind the lights was black and suddenly looked like a very dark roof over my yard. It was then that I suddenly saw a red light over the top of me, approximately 6 feet in diameter, with what looked like a glass cover that looked almost like the exterior of a golf ball, although I did not see the red light come on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the red light on directly over me I noticed that the light was not moving and that the front of the craft was just barely over the roof of my home and the rear of the craft was completely over my yard. It was now obvious that the craft was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that a noise was coming from the craft that was so loud I immediately looked at the ground and covered my ears. It was still very loud. I was immediately thinking that the whole block has to be hearing this and my wife is definitely coming out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise sounded like a combination of high wind and a high pitched engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the door of my home I did not see my wife coming out. When I saw that I ran to the door, stuck my head in, and told my wife quickly to come out side and see this, not describing what “this” is. She said that she is busy doing Sudoku, a form of cross word puzzle. I told her to come outside and I left the glass door open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise was still loud as I watched all of a sudden the red light start to move toward my roof. I ran back to the glass door and yelled at my wife to get outside and see this craft that’s over our home. It was then I was wondering why she could not hear this loud noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife immediately got up and ran out the door meeting me quickly. Everything was completely silent again and I could not see the red light under the craft any more as it moved forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife’s first view of the craft that I was seeing happened when the rear end of the craft was only now about 10 feet in front of us. My wife and I simply watched the rear of the craft move silently and very slowly to the front of our home.  There it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I simply were silently just standing about 30 feet from the craft. The craft just silently stayed there about 5 to 10 minutes. On the bottom rear of the craft we saw 2 red lights spaced about 10 feet from each other and a craft height of about 6 feet.Then the craft started moving again with no sound and very slowly away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is I do not, for some reason, remember how it left. My wife says the craft just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft was gone my wife and I went back to the patio and talked about this event for about ten minutes and then didn’t again for a very long time, not even to our families.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that due to the craft being so low I could not see the width of the entire craft and from the rear the front large lights were not even visible. I also believe that the sound I was hearing was just in my head as my wife, even with the door open, did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also state that there were no neighbors that even came out as the craft was hovering over me for that length of time and making that loud noise or just hovering in front of our home with absolutely no movement nor sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of this event was approximately 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the 3 years that followed this event I have had: Severe left ear infections and scabs that totally covered my left ear and back of my neck, and at times the left side of my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eye problems with swollen and red eye skin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year my mind stopped remembering names and various things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October 2010 I had brain surgery after a tumor was found in my brain and then removed. It was then that the surgeon said he was not familiar with this kind of tumor and it had to be submitted to be investigated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is called Glioblastoma Multiforme and I was told that most people die within 14 months which is December 2011 for me.

A speck of light in the mid-level eastern sky caught my eye because of the nature of its flickering.  It appeared to be multi-colored, green, white, red, brighter flickers at times. There appeared to be an almost rotational aspect to the flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to watch it closely, primarily because of the fact that when I first laid eyes on it, I thought I detected movement.  As I moved my position to be free of neighboring lights, I attempted to ascertain whether or not the object was moving.  Using two objects in the sky which I was sure were stars, the object in question was in such a position with respect to the two stars that it formed an isoceles triangle.  But then the object became aligned with the top-most of the two stars; minutes later it was aligned with the bottom star.  I was convinced the object was moving, but so slowly as to be indiscernible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I changed my position, I looked down at my feet for a moment, and when I returned my gaze to the object, it was no longer there.  I looked southward of where I had been looking and I thought I detected it somewhat lower in the sky but the same flashing pattern was evident, so I thought I had re-detected it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I studied its location in the sky for a few minutes but could not detect any motion, and after awhile I went inside, it being quite chilly out and it was getting late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally feel this was the first time I&#39;ve ever actually witnessed what I consider to be an authentic UFO, and I just turned 50!<n>

As I headed down my street I could see what I thought was an airplane flying due south at a very low altitude. It had two bright white lights that appeared to be at either end of the wing span.  I was concerned because I thought it was going to crash or might possibly be landing at springfield airport. I lost sight of it, but when I got to the main street and turned there it was coming right back at me. It then made a gradual turn to the west toward Wright Patterson Air Force Base and I lost sight of it again. When I turned into the parking lot where my daughter works there it was again, only this time there was a third white light on at the third point. It was distinctively triangular shaped, made no sound, was huge.I am amazed that this craft could make these turns at such a low altitude. I then got back into my car and no sooner had I closed the door and there it was again.I climbed back out and watched it as it headed back west toward the base. We drove several blocks to the west but did not see it again.<n>

We travel this road daily and have never seen an airplane in that spot in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark out so the exact shape was hard to determine but it seemed like a saucer with a row of lights toward the bottom.  The saucer traveled north- northeast very fast, low in the sky, and then stopped abruptly and hovered.  We watched it hover for several minutes as we traveled away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually we couldn’t see it any more because we kept driving.  The size of the craft in the sky (from where we were on the ground) seemed a little bigger than a quarter but smaller than a tennis ball so we estimate that it was a couple miles away from us, somewhere in Edina perhaps.<n>

As I was going around toward the driver&#39;s side of my car, I happened to look upward at the sky. It was then that I saw two round disks or saucer shaped objects gliding through the air side by side. They did not move any faster than if you were watching a bird fly against the wind. They appeared to be very dark in color, not reflecting any light from the sun which was now setting at the horizon. The two disks were gliding side by side with only what seemed like a yard or two of space apart. They glided over the two story building that I worked at, traveling west to east making no audible noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic nearby. I was trying hard to make some sense of what I was seeing. Not birds...not balloons...certainly not any conventional airplanes. Perhaps, they were very large round kites that got away from someone who was testing them out. But, there was hardly any wind at all. What is keeping them a float and moving along steady without much wind, I thought.  Satisfied with the idea of some new kite invention that went astray, I unlocked and opened my car door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before getting in, I looked upward once more just in time to see the two disk shaped objects begin tumbling through the air and then occasionally spinning around each other at a very rapid rate of acceleration and then in opposite directions. Obviously, this was a complete shock. Despite the crazy tumbling and rapid acceleration of spining around each other, the disks avoided a collision as though there was some kind of invisible force field that kept them from hitting each other. ALL the while, they still maintained a steady course in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place in no more than one minute before it passed out of view behind nearby trees. I would put the height of these objects at the same height you would see most small planes fly. I would give my best judgement that the diameter of these twin disk if at ground level could have been between 9 to 11 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last few seconds of this sighting convinced me that these objects were controled by some kind of advanced technology, because of the unusual accelerations and manuvers of the objects. Possibly, a new generation of nerds working on a special project for a start up company may be behind this. Time will tell!<n>

I had two events on my way home but only told my family once, most of them said I am crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on a main road fairly close to the West Michigan lakeshore.  I was driving from Holland Michigan to Grand Haven Michigan, heading in a northward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Durring my drive, I noticed the area being illuminated with an orange light.  I automatically assumed this was from the sun at first.  I got to thinking about it and it was way too early for the sun to be out. This was around 04:10.  I noticed the orange light becoming brighter and there were some clouds over Grand Haven that were glowing bright orange, there were no other clouds in the sky except the giant ones that were glowing orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving closer, I continued to keep my eyes on the clouds.  There were eventually three giant glowing orange what appeard to be thrusters, there was also a shape that appeared, could see the back where the thrusters were and the bottom.  This thing looked like a star destroyer from Starwars! It was huge! The backside where the thrusters were was possibly a mile across, maybe more. The craft was about as far off from the ground as low storm clouds, so not very far. I drove within a third of a mile from being under the craft and it just disappeared. The clouds it seemed to be hiding in went with it. The area also turned completely dark again, it had been brightly lit from the thrusters of the craft. It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting, I continued to drive home.  I was already worked up from the giant ship, which was very close to my home.  I continued down a back road so I could get home quicker.  As I neared my street, I saw a pair of red eyes glowing in my head lights.  The eyes were at the end of my street where I had to turn.  As I neared the creature, it stood up on its legs like a human!  It was thin, stood taller than my street sign and was black in color, it was standing in the middle of the road and I could see fairly well.  I planned on turning and hitting the gas to drive past it, however I was distracted by a flash that appeared to be like a camera flash that was in the back seat.  I looked in my rear view mirror to see what it was.  There was nothing! I had only looked in the mirror for a split second then looked back because I had to turn. In that split second, the creature had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry folks, I know how to defend myself quite well and even have a weapon in the car for self defense, but I was not about to wait around to see what that thing was! I have seen bears, it was way too thin to be a bear. People don&#39;t have red eyes and I don&#39;t see many people that skinny or black in color. I ran to the door of my house! That was a freaky night! I am glad to get it out there, I don&#39;t care if people don&#39;t believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date in November 2007 is approximate.

The  sky was clear around the object with dark clouds on the horizon. The object was of a large glowing white sphere shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked, the middle main lights of the object stood still while it was turning and spinning lights around its edges.

I had seen 8 round bright-lighted objects standing still in a hovering formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 minutes later at around 5:40am as the Chicago CTA Midway Orange Line Train pulled up to the Halsted station on the corner of Archer Ave and Halsted, these so-called round objects had started to move in a different formation just as they were playing a game called follow the leader, acting as they were doing some kind of a weird dance in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of these saucer shape objects had twinkling multi-colored lights with various color changes like: green, blue, red, orange, pink, and purple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the saucer shape object had flashed a very bright beam down to something or someone, I couldn’t tell because there were lots of obstacles in the way from where I was looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These object were about 200 feet off the ground and they were very close like about 2 or 3 city blocks from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DO NOT know what in the hell I had seen this morning, but it was the weirdest thing that I ever seen in my whole entire life! Man! It was weird! Strange and Bizarre!  Can someone out there please tell me and confirm this? And tell me what was it that I had seen this morning???…<n>

On I-75 at midnight pasing thru Auburn, there was an object on the right side of the highway so bright it looked like someone had thier brights on in the sky...except there were about three white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer there was a red light too. I got RIGHT up to it and saw it was a triangle shape and didn&#39;t move just above wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I actually saw a light blue beam go down into the woods from it, then it slowly disapeared over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car was pulled over with his hazards on and I believe they were watching it as well. It was fantastic!!!!!!!!<n>

We are in the middle  of a drought and I had not heard it was going to rain so I went to the  front door to look outside and see how hard it was coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I  approached the door I heard a strange noise that sounded like a low wooshing, almost like a high pressure fire hose off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  opened the door and looked outside into the sky, immediately noticing a  large dark triangular shape above our courtyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was  approximately 500-700 feet off the ground, passing overhead slowly and looked as  large as a commercial airliner.  It was an equilateral triangle with bright  white lights (not blinking) at each corner, one fainter white light (also not blinking) just in back of the forward light and a bright red  blinking light in the center of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in awe as it  cruised slowly west across Highway 395 and out of sight.  I saw it for perhaps 15 or 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live less than 5 miles from the Pentagon and we have military helicopters flying over our house several times a day, but I have never seen anything like this.<n>

What I spotted was what appeared to be either five individual lights traveling in a &#34;V&#34; formation from East to West or a single object with five lights. The lights were a dull red/amber color and as bright as an average star in the sky. The object(s) moved at a high rate of speed but made absolutely no sound as they moved across the sky. I immediately called to my wife to look at them, but they went behind some trees before she saw them. Just before the lights disappeared behind the trees the lights changed their relative position in relation to each other as if it were a single object that was beginning to bank and the lights were moving accordingly. Sky conditions were clear and there was no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed in the north sky a boomerang or triangle shape with many lights..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object came closer above my house the lights began to breakup out of formation, kinda of dancing.  It then formed back into the V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it disappear into the south sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I must be crazy!  I just stood there... about 2-5 mins lapsed, and I turned around to the east sky and looked up and it had circled around again.  Same thing was happening...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights broke out of formation then back into the shape of a boomerang or triangle. This time it disappeared into the west sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for many more minutes thinking I might see it again.  Nothing, I know what I saw was really there.

Totally silent.  No engine or noise. 10x50 binoculars revealed NO structure behind the lights and NO connecting structure from front white light to back white light.  Crossed the clear sky in 3-5 minute to disappear in the dawn glow to the NW.  If within flight path speed appeared close to small craft flight speed - if astronomical it was traveling fast. The only lights showing were clear, bright white with no other regulation lighting seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The general sense was that these were in the sky and not in space due to the vivid look and apparent closeness of the object.<n>

The lights almost looked connected as the brighter one seemed to lead the dimmer one. The two moved as if in formation but not like aircraft in that the dimmer light was directly behind the other. The light was white in color and there were no blinking lights like would be on an aircraft and I know aircraft don&#39;t follow directly behind one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the speed at between 200 to 400 miles per hour. I estimate the altitude at between 8,000 to 15,000 feet. It would seem that they were about 500 to 800 feet apart.

We were facing South and watched the object from horizon to horizon as it made it&#39;s journey East.  My friend is an Aerospace Engineer and pointed out two strange characteristics. The first odd feature were two non-flashing lights, one on the East side and one on West(nose &amp; tail).  It also was traveling very low to the trees, approximately 300-500 feet.  Lastly at a distance of approximately 1/4 miles or less, it made absolutely no sound, traveled at a good speed 200-300MPH, and we could hardly make out a shape.  It was a dead still, clear morning and we heard absolutely no sound from the object. At it&#39;s relative distance we should have heard the wind disturbance or hum of the engine if it were a plane. It was something we won&#39;t soon forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then a couple of seconds later I noticed a second object about a foot and a half behind the first object traveling at the same speed.  The objects appeared to be very high in the sky, possibly at commercial jet airliner altitude, but they were moving much faster than jets do at that height.  It is very quiet that time of the morning around my house and so I listened for the engines but there was not any sound at all. I watched the objects flying toward the north east until they disappeared in the trees on the horizon, the whole viewing lasted about 20 to 25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object consisted of 3 round lights in a triangular pattern, they were fixed white lights, no blinking or flashing or pulsating.  The second object had just one light, it to was fixed, no blinking or flashing or pulsating.  It was still very dark and I couldn’t make out the shape of either object.  The distance between the objects didn’t change.  I say they were 2 separate objects because I could see the stars between them as they passed over but they maintained the same speed and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first they were helicopters or airplanes but there were no sounds at any point.  Then I wondered if it was the NASA space station and the shuttle but when I mentioned it to a friend at work he said there are no lights on the space station that you would be able to see from earth that would be in that configuration.  So I don’t know what they were.  I have not see the lights again, I leave at the same time every morning and I look for them each day but I have not seen them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle.

The area is between my grandparents house and my great aunt house. I got out of my truck noticing my headlamp needed batteries. I had gotten out my gun and was proceeding to get my hunting clothes and some spare batteries, when I heard some dry palm fronds cracking about 50 to 60 yards away. The moon was about half full and I believe it was waxing at the time. I noticed a very tall figure that seemed to look ash gray colored and seemed to be looking straight at me. I was having a difficult time  realizing what exactly I was looking at. In just a brief second, the being began moving across in front of me at an amazing stride. I realized this was really happening to me and quickly grabbed  and loaded my gun, not knowing what to expect. the being proceeded across in font f me approximately 35 to 40 yards until it came to the end of the yard. Then, in this amazing stride it stepped over(not jumped) a 6 strand bob wire fence. The fence was about 41/2 to 5 ft tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 5 seconds U thought I was going crazy, and started to doubt my eyes. Then, all of the sudden, about 150 -175 yards away, a flock of sandhill cranes just erupted and went crazy cackling and slapping wings. I started thinking h my god,thi is really happening. then out of no where I saw a flash of light that appeared in the shape of an oval about 20 feet long to my left about 50 ft. the flash was almost that of a camera but only n the ground in a specific place to my left. I very quickly decided to get back in my truck and wait until day light to go hunting. As I calmed down, I realized this being didn&#39;t seem to have any body hair . I never saw the face. It was very slender with long legs and arms. I was VERY uncomfortable in the deer stand that morning and got out of the woods early that day. I reluctantly decided to talk to y grandparent about  what happened in fear for them because they are in their mid eighties. My grandpa told me he had heard something tapping on his window a few days before. they then told me to tell the police, who referred me to the local game warden. He suggested that I go out to the open field where the being had stepped over the fence and look for tracks. At that time only a few feet into the field (which was thick mud mostly). I found the first track. It was about 11 inches long about four inches wide at the toes. their were only three toes. It was about 3 inches wide at the  heal. I found a total of 3 tracks: 1 Full track and 2 partials. The stride was about 6 to 7 feet long. I reported it to the game warden who seemed to be uninterested in believing me. So I unintelligently decided to just leave this issue alone. Hunting early in the morning has been very difficult for me now since the encounter. I thought this happened in late October. after reviewing the star I marked in my journal, I realized the exact date was Nov. 4th. I apologize for letting you and other people down by not moving forward sooner. If ever given the opportunity again (which seem amazingly li! kely) to me, I promise to report the incident immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The aircraft or whatever it was flew across the sky moving kinda slowly but up and down and in a zig-zag pattern.  I watched it go fly across the sky for a while(maybe 15-30mins) and finally it kinda stopped in a stationary position for the rest of the time until the sun came up.  but it was moving like up and down and side to side the whole time i was watching.  At times the white light would have red lights going around it, and blue lights at times.  Also, i seen a big flash of light come out from under the object for a second or so.

To the left of the object was a misty cloud, in our picture there is four beings as to which they do not resemble human beings. the color of the objest was a light blue and and the other beings were a white cloud with black and gray markings. We have seem photos of apparent ufo’s and pictures of apparent “aliens” and what we see in the photo that was taken  resembles most photo’s.  upside down teardrop shaped lenses with a misshaped head.  Myself I am enlisted in the Canadian armed forces and have a hard time believing in the “other life form” but as for now due to what we have seen  I am no longer a sceptic.. we have witnesses and photo&#39;s of the event and want to share them with the world..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you understand And thank you for you consideration  sir<n>

I was watching in High Definition and there are cleary TWO different UFO scenes.  When I got to work today I searched Yahoo! for &#34;jaws movie ufo&#34; I found NOTHING.  I was shocked since so many people have seen this movie over and over and since Spielbeg is SO big in UFO movie history.  I was even move shocked when I searched google and found a link to a report on this website! Of course this is a most unusual type of siting for this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights are optical artifacts from the camera equipment.  The go in and out of clouds in the background and change speed and direction.  My only quetion is, did Spielberg, who is obsessed with UFOs/aliens even to the point of lying to people about his birthday so that it matches the Roswell crash.. add this in as a special effect, or did he just get lucky during filming and capture a real UFO on film?<n>

We were just going off the exit ramp off of 55. Our exit was 50B.  We were turning off when finally I said something to my uncle about these 2 lights directly next to each other that I saw and had been following us for about 5 minutes. He said he had noticed them too and thought he was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept going towards my house when finally we came close enough to the object to actually see it good.  He pulled over on the side of Canvasback Drive and we got out.  The object was close enough he said to &#34;shoot it with a paint ball gun&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very excited, myself mostly from doing about a year of UFO research so far.  It was a triangle with 2 lights and very large (about 30-50 feet from point to point).  Also, very thick probably a good 30 feet. My brother contacted a friend who lived close to where we were and he told him to go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boys first response when my brother told him to go outside was &#34;Holy Shit&#34;. At this point my brother hung up and took a picture of the object. The picture came out very clear and shows a triangle with 2 lights on the object. The three of us were astonished by the object and it flew over us very slow, we could see it for about 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds. After it got past us about 300 yards, it sped up pretty fast and just kept flying. I immediately called my friend who lived in the direction the UFO was going and told him to look into the sky. He saw the object and instantly said &#34;Wow, that thing is hauling ass.&#34; At this point we could start to see little red object all around the sky. They were flickering and we had no idea what they were (I researched this later and found out that a meteor had broke that night and was said to be red). But, that did not see the second triangle object we saw. After the red flickering started my uncle said he was actually getting frightened and we got in the car and went to my house. When we arrived my brother and him went inside to tel! l my par ents the news. I stayed outside and was convinced there were more out here. I know that a lot of the times people see UFOs they see more than 1. About 20 minutes later after my brother had came back out to try to see more with me we saw another triangle come from behind my house. This object was a little higher (probably 2,000-3,000 feet in the air. It was the same shape of the previous object with 2 lights again. The only difference with this one was that when it passed we could see these lights on the back. I noticed right away 5 lights across the whole back. They were as thick as the craft and were very fast. They blinked one after another very fast from left to right. It was amazing to see this and me and my brother were speechless. After this object passed I stayed outside till about 11:00 o clock and saw nothing else except an odd amount of planes. There were so many planes that my mom was checking the news, thinking about calling the police, and even thinking about calling the airport or air force. I know that on clear nights you can see everything but there were over 250 planes that night that I saw and they all came within 2 hours. That is an extraordinary amount. After being a believer I now believe that this is real and is a serious matter even more. If I could send pictures from my phone I would but my phone does not support that. I am trying to take a picture of the picture with a actual camera and send it via e-mail. Thank you for your time.   ((name deleted))<n>

Seen on 5 different occasions in 5 months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a particular “craft” five times in the last five months. I saw it again tonight at about 7:12 p.m. PDT. I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored “X” painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another report of a craft that might be similar can be seen here:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58560.html<n>

I was located on the NE corner of 34 st &amp; 8th Ave. in NYC. This object appeared at times to glisten in the sun, but would emit a bright light that would change in color from white to red, that gave the appearance of a spot light. At this time, I notice a North bound airliner which had generated four contrails south of the object in question. When the distance between the AC and the object closed several miles the object changed this tract to a southern direction, and appeared to pass the AC on the port side and pass through the contrails.  The object(spot light) would continually change in color from a bright white to red, but the object still reflected the sun. The Aircraft continued on its path, but I would think that they must have observed it also due to its proximity to the AC. I lost tract of the object shortly after it passed through the contrail. The object did not generate any observable contrail which I also found unusual. I have checked Heavens-Above for possible irridum flares, sattilites for that time and found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded sides in the air (I found out later he meant the sides were convex).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was white with a wide blue stripe and was partially hidden by trees in our yard, but was in front of trees further away in our yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described it as waving back and forth, then moving off to the right of his view further behind the trees where he could not see it anymore.  He said it seemed to be about 4 to 6 inches wide and about 18 inches long.  It was at an angle, not perfectly vertical.  He said it made no sound.  It did not give off light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He insisted it was not a balloon, nor a piece of windblown trash or a kite.  There was a very light breeze, but that area of the yard is shielded from wind by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I inspected the area a few minutes later.  There was no sign of any debris or trash (which would have likely been snagged in some pines trees, based upon the direction of the breeze).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is a very grounded person and does not make up stories.

They appeared to have a skeletal, wishbone like frame and moved across the sky like a glider might move. We could not make out any defined body but there did seem to be some kind of dark area within the frame. The back end or tail had no real definition it seemed to almost fade into the sky. The crafts were in sight for approximately ten seconds each, before we lost sight of them. These two crafts came out of what appeared to be high altitude cirrus clouds, moving in a east-southeasterly direction. The clouds were long, thin and transparent, localized to a specific area in the sky. The clouds themselves seemed to last no more then two hours in duration. I noticed them at eleven pm central time and had completely vanished out of sight at about one fifteen am. The crafts seemed to emerge directly out of the cloud bank(?) both crafts heading in a southeasterly fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She is 56 years old and works as an artist and designer.  She is very good at creating animation using her Mac computer.  I asked her to write down the experience she had so that I could report the incident as a possible UFO. She did that for me and she also supplied me with the picture and the animation that I have attached.  The picture (lightshape2.jpg) is a representation of the object on a photograph of the tops of the two trees where the object appeared to hover.  The animation (lightshapelayers2.mp4) is her attempt to represent the shifting nature of the object—at times amorphous and without apparent boundaries of edges, at times with edges more distinct.  She says it is a pretty good representation of what she saw. We both use Macs so I hope it translates well to PC computers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what she wrote about the experience:  We were being lashed by the remnants of Hurricane Noel (Nov 2 or 3, 2007-I can’t remember the exact date but I think it was the 2nd). There was gale force wind, thunder, lightning, heavy rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my computer room near the window in my second-floor studio when I noticed that there was something strange about the lightning. There was too much of it, it was like watching a strobe light, and the thunder didn’t seem to correspond. It was like the lightning was spelling out something in Morse Code. Dit dit dit dit, etc. And it was too near, too bright and very unusual. I started to feel a little uneasy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was just a storm so I waited. I decided that I should turn off the computer because it was the type of weather that causes power outages. Just after doing so I sat quietly in the darkness of the room for a while. Then there was a bright flash and a brilliant light illuminated the entire yard, driveway and all the nearby area about 30 feet in every direction (an estimate). But it still didn’t seem like lightning, and I did not want to look out for fear of what I might see. It felt strange and scary because the illumination lasted for several minutes without flickering or changing although it was clearly undulating. It was brighter than broad daylight-maybe10 times brighter than a cloudless summer day at noon. I wanted to believe that this was ordinary lightning but something scared me and something in me really did not want to know what it was out there, even though I was compelled to look. I had a sense of fear that made me want to crawl under the table. But I sat still and looked out of the north window at the yard and rooftop of the cottage next door. I could see everything clearly bathed in this brilliant white light. It was like there was a giant magnifying lamp, and it stayed unmoving and illuminated, undulating for a long stretch of time, possibly 5-10 minutes. All this time I was sitting rooted to my chair with a window in front (north-facing) and another window to my right (east facing window), both with wide-open views of the weather phenomena outdoors.  At this point in time, I was just witnessing what I thought to be a very unusual lightning storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the light just went out, or rather seemed to have rolled away. It was dark, save for the intermittent “dits” of light that I described as being regular and code-like. I felt a sense of relief-I noticed after the fact that I was very tense. During the episode I was transfixed, I could have moved but I was trying to focus with all of my senses because of the unusual nature of the lightning so I stayed seated in my chair. When the lights suddenly went out, I moved closer to the window on my right (east)- which has a parallel view of the cottage and property behind my house. I was glad whatever it was, was gone. I knew whatever it was, was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light suddenly appeared again, brilliant as ever, illuminating everything, making everything seem like bright and flat white light, filling the sky and everything reflecting it in a bright white glow. I got a really creepy feeling and then I looked out and up over the back of the cottage, in a space like a little valley between two treetops, there seemed to be a consolidated light-ball of some sort: large, like the size of a bus maybe, round and with a concentrated brilliance that was outlined by a thin gradated line - which made the shape seem to blend with the surrounding brilliance. Immediately I thought I was seeing a UFO, then I ducked under the table, the surface of which is about a foot above the window’s lower ledge. It’s an old drawing board and I had it backed up to the window. Under the table I could look out at it.  I looked at it, stared at it, frozen with fear but compelled by curiosity. I was watching it and almost couldn’t breathe. I saw it seem to change shape, as if the thin gradated line modulated, it reminded me of pixilation overlap used in film special effects to depict morphing, it changed from a round circle to a diamond shape, with what seemed like symmetrical filigree-like “steps” making the edges seem dimensional and not flat. It was like a ragged-edged diamond and the edges again were softly outlined by a thin gradated line. It reminded me of the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich’s painting “White on White”, a painting consisting of a tilted white square on a white backgound. Only a slight variation of brushstroke allows the viewer to see the shape emerge. As difficult as it was to stare for long at the object because of its brightness, the edges of the object were very unusual and detailed, with various tiers along the edges coming forward and receding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for a minute or two I got really scared and ducked down under the table. I felt like it was a UFO type of thing, even though I kept trying to frame it within my usual knowledge and expectations, all the while “knowing” that it didn’t fit into any frame of reference in my experience, and that there had to be an intelligence involved so I started to “talk” to it, saying “Please go away, you’re scaring me” and “I don’t want to get abducted” and stuff like that. I remember saying, “whatever you do, don’t hurt my cats”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I felt a sense of fear and panic that was undeniable. There was no thunder.  I crawled out of the studio on my hands and knees because I didn’t want to be “seen” even though I already felt like I had been seen and there was no escaping it. I entered the living room where there is a large picture window facing the same direction (east) as the window in the studio with the table. I stayed on the floor. The illumination in the general area remained for some time but fright kept me from looking anymore so I don’t know what might have happened. However, after a few more minutes the illumination dissipated, there was darkness and a few “dits” of light again, but then it was as if the storm had just quieted down a little, everything seemed again like a normal storm - there was regular lightning, but it was farther away and had the accompanying distant thunder, it continued to rain and the winds continued through the night. I had a feeling like I didn’t know if I had seen what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I constructed a still image showing the relative positioning above the trees, just to serve my memory and help me to realize that whatever it was that I saw, it was something unusual. I followed that with making a short animation as well to show what it looked like, which I think I have captured reasonably well although it is very difficult to “say” in film with so much whiteness. I have been experimenting with animation techniques for the last 8 years so I knew what I had to do to make the movie look like what I saw. I am self-taught and there is a certain roughness to it because of gaps in my technical knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

As I walked up to the Pickup I noticed an Airplane flying from west to east.  This was nothing out of the ordinary in my area since we live under several Transcontinental Air-lanes between Chicago, Omaha, and Lincoln, going to Denver or LA Etc.  I was tracking the Plane going to the east when I noticed a very bright light in the sky further towards Zenith from the Plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was standing facing North, I checked the sky to orient myself with the Constellations and I attempted to triangulate on the position of the bright light.  I found Cassiopeia and then Camelopardalis and found the bright light was between North star (last star in the little dipper&#39;s handle) and the Brightest Star of Auriga about half way between these two stars, but was not as distant. I would estimate this Light was in orbit, but holding stationary position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Doing a quick inventory of the sky I concluded it was not Venus Saturn or Jupiter because it was too far north and in a totally wrong place to be these planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To judge the size of this light it would be four times the size of Venus when seen in the South-western Sky at, or shortly after Sunset.  The Brightness was twice the Magnatude of Venus in the Morning Just before Dawn. But as I said this was not Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this light for 15-20 seconds it just winked out, not moving in any direction.  What I noticed was while the object’s light intensity was dissipating, I could see a round ball in the center, kind of like when a light bulb is turned off, you can still see the glow if the plasma formed around the element for a brief second.  But this was round.  I also thought I could hear something like the sound of what old flash bulbs made in the Camera’s of the 50’s up to the 70’s, that crunching boiling sound as the blue coating fried from the heat of the bulb burning out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for a few minutes waiting to see if this was all or if it would come back and I didn’t see anything else.  I came back in my home and checked the time which was 22:34.  I’d estimate I had seen the object no more than five minutes before.  I then made this report.<n>

Looking East from shore of the bay I saw a triangle with lights. The corners were acute and sharp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very bright white light in the center of the triangle.  The three corners each had a light.  The craft was a perfect triangle, yet it&#39;s west pointing corner had a red light. This appeared to be the leading edge as it moved from East to West.  The south corner had a blue light and the north light had a green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9:10-9:15 PM.  It was dark and cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the craft I would say was about half the size of a jet liner.  I was below the cloud cover which was perhaps 1 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it was moving west from over the bay to over land a few hundred feet then stopped immediately. It stayed still for only about three seconds.  Then it went straight up very fast a hundred or two hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped immediately and stayed there for only one second or so, then it shot off to the west and because I was in a car and the west view was obstructed by a hill (and the roof of the car), I couldn’t see it again.<n>

When I was approximately one mile East of Lost Mountain Road, I observed a row of bright white lights that were at an unknown distance ahead of me and appeared to be heading east. From my perspective these lights were slightly above the tree line. As the aircraft got closer I observed what appeared to be a large, light blue lamp on the bottom. This lamp blinked slowly, unlike strobes on other aircraft that I have observed. At this time, I estimated the altitude of the aircraft to be to be 4,000 to 5,000 feet and it was slightly to my left. This is when I was able to see that the aircraft had a distinct triangular shape. The surface was dark compared to the sky above, which was a lighter shade of gray. The fuselage and the wing were one in the same. From this perspective, almost below the aircraft, there was one white light at each corner of the triangle. The forward most angle of the triangle was slightly greater then the two angles that were equal in the aft section of it. I immediately turned left into a community ballpark in an attempt to continue watching this flying machine. Unfortunately, light pollution from the ball field obscured my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have just come from eating dinner in the greater Salt Lake City area, and were nearly home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandfather also lives in Eagle Mountain and was driving just a few minutes ahead of us in traffic.  We were driving west on S.R. 73 when my wife pointed out to me what appeared to be a row cars parked on the mountainside, facing us with their lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this row of lights was perfectly straight.  And within seconds it became clear that the row of lights was not on the ridgeline, but rising above it.  The thin horizontal row of non-colored lights was obviously in flight and heading toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within moments a massive, black, triangular-shaped craft (with lights everywhere on the front and bottom) was flying over our car.  It was huge.  Amidst all of the regular looking bright lights, there was one red light on the bottom, and one blue light.  (Note:  These were NOT on the edges of the craft, like on the wingtips of a conventional plane, but just slightly offset from the center of the bottom of it.)  I rolled down the window, and could hear no sound as the craft flew directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Relative to our direction of travel, it approached from the “1 o’clock” position when it was just a thin line of lights, and after it crossed the highway and flew over us it was going toward the “7 o’clock” position.) It was visible, start to finish for about 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other cars on the road appeared to slow down, pull over, or otherwise pay much attention to the craft, though, with it lit up as it was someone else had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that the craft would not have been noticeable, perhaps at all, if the lights had not been turned on.  It was dark at that time of night, and it would have blended in with the night sky if it simply would have turned its lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a jet-black colored triangle, with a slightly crescent moon-shaped rear.  My wife noticed what appeared to be a ‘transparent bottom’ of some kind.  We could not see in it, but she at least got the feeling that perhaps it was designed for them to see out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get an idea of size, if you had to hold something at arm’s length to cover it up when it was overhead, you would have to hold a large piece of paper, perhaps 24”x 24”- at arm’s length.  That “might” be big enough to block out how big this thing was when it was directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, my grandfather was arriving at the house when we were still on S.R. 73.  As I said before, he was about a 2 minute drive time ahead of us.  He can corroborate exactly the same object.  We live just off S.R. 73, so his vantage point was practically the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also reports that the huge craft made no sound as it glided over.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PDT, I went outside to view the Comet Holmes.  I used binoculars to try to get a better look, and as I was sweeping the binoculars, I noticed a very bright star to the lower right of the comet.  It appeared to have a cluster of lights above it, so I focused on the star and observed what looked like a “net of lights” that were white, red and green and pulsating.  I continued to adjust the focus, thinking I was not properly focusing, but determined that I was indeed focused properly on this object.    I called my husband over, pointed out the star, handed him he binoculars and asked him to look.  When I asked him what he saw, he described seeing a “Jellyfish” of lights above the star.  He confirmed that the lights were pulsating and the object was larger than the star.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars (7X35) and the object moved below the star, and to either side of the star, but with no apparent pattern of movement.  The bell shape of the “jellyfish” widened and narrowed, again with no apparent pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my neighbor and asked her to meet me outside to look at something.  Without telling her what my husband and I had seen, I asked her to observe the star using my binoculars.  She did and asked me what the lights were below the star.  I asked her if they resembled a jellyfish with lights and she confirmed that’s exactly what it looked like.  She also observed it moving, pulsating and changing it’s position around the star.  She then had her husband come outside and instructed him to look at the star, without telling him what she had observed.  He saw the same patterns of pulsating light we other three had seen.  I got another, weaker pair of binoculars, and saw the same thing, only appearing smaller. We continued to watch this anomaly for about ten more minutes.  None of us could explain it, nor had any of ever seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came inside about 8:40 P.M.PDT, and looked on-line with my husband to see if we could find any information regarding our observations. We found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was beautiful and must have been absolutely enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will look for it again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.

It lasted approximately 5 seconds.  It seemed to burn out toward then end, then all I saw was a blinking craft.  It turned the oppsoite direction and lit up again.  It was a bright light with a long flaming tail.  It kept moving in all directions randomly and sometimes it would &#34;burn out&#34; to a dim blinking (like a normal airplane).  After it continued for over a minute I called my 4 year old daughter to come see.  She thought it was fireworks.  We watched and the &#34;tail sparks&#34; turned into circular lights and glowed red at times and green.  At some point it looked like it was heading straight for the ground then it would curve up and the tail would light up like a tail of a meteor.  It continued for 5 minutes or more.  I kept telling my daughter to go get her grandma, she has to see this.  It kept changing directions and would glow red then white/yellow and then green.  I ran inside finally and grabbed my camera.  I was able to capture 3 short video feeds and one still picture.  I am convinced there must be some kind of explination for what we saw, I just haven&#39;t been able to find anything in our local news.  Maybe someone else saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both were similar in appearance and seemed to be joined to each other by a very small darkened area located directly between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, my attention was drawn to what looked like one long, thin, silver rod like appendage extending downward from beneath these two adjoining lights. I could also see a faint haze with a clearly defined outer edge located beneath each of the two luminous objects. Perhaps this was due to heat or propulsion, I don&#39;t know. Yet, each of these two very faint, hazy areas were clearly shaped like the letter &#34;U.&#34;  And the silver appendage was centered between these two hazy &#34;U&#34; shaped areas, in a very symmetrical pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total width of the two adjoined lights was at least as wide as a cruising jetliner. The vertical appendage beneath them was twice as long as this total width. The appendage gradually faded from view as the two disc shaped lights began to merge together to form one luminous cigar shaped object, though the small darkened area at the center remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my location, driving east on Dutch Ridge Road, near the Beaver Medical Center, I&#39;d estimate that the object(s) was hovering over Rochester or the Beaver River, at about a 2 o&#39;clock position in the sky. The sky was blue and perfectly clear. Winds were light.  I didn&#39;t see the object fly away nor wink out. I lost sight of the object behind trees near Maplewood Drive, as I was then leaving the top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the morning progressed and the day light crept in, a haze appeared beside it and it looked like a trail of smoke. This happened 3 times. At one point, a small plane flew under it and landed without incidence and the plane is on the video under the object.

I do not believe the UFO to have been any sort of craft, terrestrial or otherwise, though Freddy is near a military base (CFB Gagetown) so who knows. We were walking the gravel trails along the Saint John River at night, headed west, perhaps slightly northwest. I had seen a shooting star earlier that night directly above us. This was probably a latecomer amongst the Perseids from August. Then, ahead of us and at a seemingly low altitude, and pretty close distance-wise as well, a bright green fireball entered and left our field of vision in about 3-5 seconds. It was moving quite quickly and of a distinctly spherical shape. Whatever it was, it was certainly not a &#34;normal&#34; denizen of the night sky, esp. over harsh city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Paint sketch depicts the view from southside Freddy along the trail, with a bridge across the river, dotted with cars, in the foreground and the northside, dotted with lights, in the background.

We were driving in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to notice it. It appeared to have a greenish aurora to the metal body of the craft. The top three rows of windows and the bottom three rows of windows were square  and seemed to be windows, which were emanating an unearthly white glow. There were also two rows of circular shaped windows in the middle of the ship from my point of reference that emanated the same white glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also two red lights one was located towards the top, and the other was located towards the bottom. These red lights pulsed on and off every couple of seconds. There were also many white lights that were around the edge of the craft. The lights had the same glow as the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was located 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and was moving around 40 miles per hour.

It appeared across the parking lot flying very very low and slow for that time of night. If we were not familiar with these planes and it was not so low, I would not have figured out it was one. The plane had red and blue lights going all around it in a circle kind of blinking on an off as they went around. I could see the actual military plane, as it was so close. Following behind it, about 50 yards, was a very big bright white ball of light. I looked back to the plane to see how it was &#34;pulling it&#34; but I didn&#39;t see anything. The plane went over my building and the bright white light followed. We couldn&#39;t see it any more as our building was in the way.

At that point we were on Neal St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I turned onto Stanley Blvd. and all of a sudden I saw what he was talking about. There was no mistaking that it was a saucer shaped flying craft.  It was moving very slow and it was only about 50 ft. above the tree-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had two red blinking lights and it was illuminated. The saucer was lit up but not really with any kind of lights familiar to me. It was like the silver metal glowed somehow. There was a bubble shaped cabin on top of it with lots of small rectangular windows going all around it, that glowed white. This was a very big disk. If compared to the moon right beside it, then the disk was bigger. It was flying tilted on its side laterally coming from a northwest direction and flying southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not stop because I was in traffic and I had to get my son’s friend home. Now I wish I had my camera with me. It was just like in the movies the way it appeared and it was so vivid. I will never forget it.<n>

It looked exactly what you might see on TV or in the movies, a flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very big, I’d say about the size of a full moon. It had colorful (blue and red to be sure) lights blinking from the bottom. Then we stopped the car on the side of the road, I was scared and shocked, I wanted someone else (besides us) to see it so, I ran out of the car and asked a man walking if he’d seen it. He said no so I had him follow me to a place it where it was very clear to see and asked him “Do you see that thing? It is a flying saucer” and he replied “Yes, I see it” he didn’t seem as shocked as I was. It appeared to be hovering back and fourth, but not really moving too much. Then I got scared and told my fiancé to drive but while we were driving I kept my eyes on it until it was hidden behind a mountain. Then about 40 seconds later when we passed the mountain and it was in sight again, I saw it was (had turned into) a blimp. The weird thing is that it looked nothing like what I’d just seen. When I got a better look at the blimp it read “FOR THE ‘IF’ IN LIFE”. I have never seen anything like that before but-I really do believe that the thing I saw was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe we spoke with this witness, although we cannot be certain.

It was so bright it lit through the fog and mist along the Millers River. An object I want to call stealth shaped, maybe triangular hovered very low, maybe 100-200 feet above the ground. From my view I saw 3 lights on each side of the fronts underside and a bright glow from the rear. There looked to be a clear glass area on the bottom as well as a lit cockpit area..reminded me of a helicopter. Sooo bright, so low and not like ANY helicopter or plane Ive ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was not able to pull over to get a better look, too much high speed traffic.

Having originally planned on having the whole afternoon together, our lunch visit had to be cut short due to an unexpected appointment involving my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I live in Toledo, Oregon, I decided to take advantage of the unseasonable sunny weather that afternoon by stopping along the way home to take some scenic pictures. Being semi-retired and living on the scenic Central Oregon Coast, I have enjoyed taking pictures as one of my favorite pastimes. I stopped at the Seal Rock area around 2:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having a digital camera, I am able to take many pictures and then sort through them at home on my PC to choose my best shots. It wasn’t until after I downloaded my pictures onto my PC that I discovered that one of my pictures had an “odd” object in the picture. When first trying to zoom in on the object in the image, I thought that the “odd object” was possibly two seagulls that were casting an unusual or “odd” appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I zoomed in on the objects in the image, I felt that the unusual object was not simply seagulls as I had first thought. I instead felt that I had unknowingly taken a picture of some object. I also realized that I had not seen nor heard anything unusual at the time that I was taking the pictures. Of course, being right down on the beach, it was the sounds of the pounding wave action that was heard most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have been somewhat hesitant about submitting this report and my photo image to the National UFO Reporting Center, I have decided that I must try to find out just what the object really is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along with this report submittal, I am also emailing the image to the National UFO Reporting Center. I am hoping that the UFO Reporting Center might be able to determine the most likely explanation for the object that appears in that one picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe it is a creation of the military-industrial complex, (and it could be foreign-made, as in Russia.) As for the ability of this non-aerodynamic craft to hover motionless, and then fly away at high speed, I suspect scalar wave technology is in effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

His sighting occurred that day at 8:37 am and lasted approximately 4 to 5 seconds.  His sighting took place while he was driving southbound on Adams Dairy Parkway just before crossing the bridge which leads to Duncan Road.  He had turned onto the Parkway at Jellison Road from his home on Pink Hill Road in Independence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Marge and I were contacted to investigate the sighting as we lived close to the witness.  We arranged to interview the witness on Sunday, November 18, 2007 at 1:00 pm.  I arrived first at the witness’s house and met him, his wife, and younger daughter who were watching a football game on television.  John led me to the kitchen to talk.  Before beginning the interview I waited for Marge to arrive which she did within minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded to ask questions of John concerning his sighting while his wife and daughter listened in.  John reported that the object he saw caught his eye because of a metallic-like reflection from the west-facing side of the object.  He thought this was odd as the sun was in the east and the sky was clear and blue.  He later described the object as looking like a derby hat with a flat bottom topped with a dome.  The object did not move, wobble or oscillate, but remained stock still in its position which John estimated to be at about 30 degrees elevation in the southern sky.  The sighting was of short duration so I asked how it finally moved out of view.  John said that it simply disappeared.  One moment there was an object and the next moment it was gone without any apparent movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Marge asked whether he had a previous sighting of a UFO and John reported that he had only one near Colby, Kansas 17 years prior.   She asked if he had experienced any changes in himself after either sighting, but he said he did not notice any except for difficulty sleeping through the night since this last sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then asked to go to the location of the sighting so we could see the features of the area.  We parked on a side road just before the bridge crossing and all of us (John, his wife, his daughter, Marge, and myself) stood on the corner while John pointed to the location in the southern sky where he had seen the object.  He pointed out the series of lamp posts on the left side of the bridge and said he had gauged the object to be about the apparent size of these lamps but a distance beyond the 4th lamppost so that his impression was that the object was large. We snapped a photo of the sighting area and proceeded to wrap up the investigation at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though John asked us what the object was, I could not give him an answer nor tell him why he was seeing a reflection from the object on a side away from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report received by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP - http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

11/1/07 08:37|Blue Springs|MO|Disk|5 seconds|MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  FOLLOW UP - Looking at a distance past the upcoming stoplight, I saw a round object in the sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73246.html|373|ndxe200711| Unexplainable acceleration and deceleration in proportion to emitted light intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying out watching for meteors, facing North East. I noticed two lights traveling about two finger widths apart, one trailing the other, at equal speed. They were just slightly brighter than the average stars. I don&#39;t believe I can give an accurate altitude. Way up there. Initially I thought it could be the shuttle catching up to the space station. After about 2 to 3 seconds, the one trailing got about 5 times brighter for one second, and caught up to the leading one and returned to equal brightness. They were extremely close and continued a South West path till disappearing. The reason I believe it was a UFO is because of the change of the intensity of the light was directly proportional to it&#39;s speed. I also cannot explain it not overshooting the leading object after exhibiting such acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.
