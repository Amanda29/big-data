5/15/52 20:00|Allyn|WA|Disk|3 hrs.|Close encounter involving physical examination in unknown craft.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24042.html|1|ndxe195205| Close encounter involving physical examination in unknown craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object with many lights flew parallel to my mother&#39;s car for several minutes.  Then the car came to a gradual halt on side of rd.  Mother found herself inside the &#34;thing&#34; not remembering how she got there.  She told of being thoroughly examined by smallish grey creatures with large eyes. There was mention of something inserted into or behind her ear. Reiterated that she was &#34;not afraid&#34;.  Inside of craft had &#34;things on the walls which weren&#39;t maps&#34;.  I assume they were celestial charts.  As she was going to pick up my dad in Bremerton, WA there were three hours unaccountd for from the time she left me in Olympia, WA. Her life changed drastically after that and she began drinking.  She died at age 62,in 1976, and though the incident was in 1952, she told no one of it until about 2 months before she passed away. I believe she thought she was crazy, which was not in evidence, though I blame the incident for her troubles.  This all happened before the famous incident back east, involving the interracial couple, Betty  (&amp; ?) so I know it was not a figment of her imagination.  Too manythings happened after that that can only be explained by her trauma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in May 1952 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in that month so that the report sorts to that month and year.  PD))<n>
5/15/52 10:15|Pittsburgh (110 mi. E of)|PA|Cylinder|30|Senior corporate pilot and company officers witness a peculiar object from the cockpit of a DC-3.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57512.html|2|ndxe195205| As Chief Pilot for ((name of major company deleted)), I flew a group of their top scientists from Teterboro, New Jersey, to Wright Field, Ohio, on May 15, 1952.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in a DC-3 at 8,000&#39; on an IFR flight plan and about a thousand feet on top of all clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:15 and about 110 miles East of Pittsburgh, my copilot spotted a strange object flying with us and about 500 feet off our left wing.  It was a black, shiny cylinder round on each end and it had no wings, empennage, engines or windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called Pittsburgh Radio and asked if they had any aircraft in sight near us.  They reported none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called our passengers up. one by one, and asked if they could see anything.  They were shocked to see the object flying beside us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object shot ahead of us and waited for us to catch up.  It zig-zagged across our course for half an hour.  One of the scientists calculated its speed at 1,500 mph.  It ultimately disappeared ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all sworn to secrecy by the ((senior company officer)) on board, ((officer&#39;s name deleted)), because we were on our way to secure the largest research contract in ((company name deleted)) history from the Air Force and, at that time, just about anyone reporting an UFO was considered to be a wacko.   We couldn&#39;t even discuss the event with our families.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now ((age deleted--eighties)) and retired after 17,500 hours of flying for the Air Force and for corporations.  My copilot and passengers are all deceased.  I simply want to go on record that I and seven cool, competent observers calmly observed this object and never reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, while I was at Wright Field I asked one of their senior pilots what the fastest USAF plane could fly at. The answer was: around 500 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I prefer to keep this report confidential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate, and that he will check his flight logs for the precise date.  We spoke with this witness via telephone during a lengthy conversation, and we found him to be sober-minded, and we suspect that he is an exceptionally good witness.  PD))<n>
