I had just finished helping my girlfriend move into her new home, and was heading home myself. I was traveling west on a clear night, when I noticed an object racing across the sky heading east at an incredible speed unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. Then, without slowing down, it made a hairpin turn and headed back west and then just disappeared. What made this so unusual was that it looked just like a star except for it&#39;s movement. It first appeared just over the treeline and was almost overhead when it changed direction in just a matter of seconds. I could not even guesstimate it&#39;s altitude, although it seemed to be much higher than any manmade aircraft could travel.<n>
1/20/89 18:00|Bourbonnais|IL|Other|3 min|Large craft 2000 feet above ground|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55684.html|2|ndxe198901| Large craft 2000 feet above ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 20th 1989 I and two employees left my car dealership at approximately 6:00 pm southbound on route 45 in the town of Bourbonnais Illinois. We were in a large sedan. I was driving, one person in the front pass seat and the other behind me. Making a right turn westbound on Latham drive, a newly paved 4 lane road, I was talking to my friends and glanced to my left and noticed a large &#34;something&#34; above a K Mart shopping center approximately 1000 yards across a bean field. Being a private pilot I would estimate this thing at about 1500-2000 feet altitude. I immediately rolled down my window (electronically) for I thought there could be some kind of reflection. Not so. This structure, suspended in mid air was not aerodynamic and looked as it was a large building or even a group of buildings clustered together. I immediately commented to my friends &#34;now what the is that?&#34;  Both passengers with me noticed it and as I stopped the car on the side of the road it changed shape to a vertical cigar shape and looked to us as if it was going to crash right in to our immediate area, causing one of the passengers to scream. It moved towards us at an unbelievable rate of speed. It then changed back to the shape it was in (cluster of buildings) right above us. Dusk was changing to dark. There were many (6 or 7) small ships flying around this large ship at no particular pattern. Again I can not stress how big this thing was. I am from the Chicago area and it was for sure as big probably bigger than the sears tower downtown Chicago. Above us it moved slowly to the northwest, maybe one or two mile an hour for 500 yards. While directly underneath the ship we noticed three large circular lights or burners ignite with the highest intensity bright white light Iâ€™d ever seen. At that time the ship started to slowly become transparent meaning we could start to see through it until it had completely disappeared. Note as it disappeared it did not diminish in size.<n>

Two days and 15 minutes after seeing a silent craft fly over my house, I was at home sitting on the sofa in front of my pot-bellied wood-burning stove, which had a cozy fire burning inside.  I fed a piece of paper to the woodstove, which was immediately sucked up the stovepipe instead of burning.  Going outside to see if I could see the paper come out the chimney, I noticed a prominent off-white object with an orange tint aproaching from the southeast.  I went back inside to get my binoculars, and when I returned outside, the craft was gliding in complete silence over the house at about 1200 feet altitude and estimated speed of 85 mph.  It had a whitish or orange-white dome-light on top and red and green running lights below and to the sides, giving the craft a saucer-like appearance and also in compliance with standard aircraft lighting configurations.  The green nav-light was on its right and the red nav-light was on its left, the same as for airplanes.  The next morning, after taking a shower, I discovered more bleeding marks on my body.  There was one more mark on my right ear, three marks (scoops and tiny holes) on my left ear, and a large (1/8&#34; x 1/4&#34;) scoop wound on my back.  I was 27 years old at the time, trained in basic astronomy in college, and familiar with aircraft as a private pilot with nearly six years experience.  There was no missing time involved, and no strange memories have ever emerged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

I was driving home, southbound on US287 in Laramie, Wyoming, when I spotted an approaching flying object to the southeast.  It was white with an orange tint and was still approaching when I reached home three miles south of town.  I viewed the UFO through binoculars as it flew silently over the house at an estimated 1200 feet altitude and estimated speed of 100 mph.  It appeared oblong in shape, but all I could really see were four or five bright lights of various colors, including a white strobe and dimmer red and green lights.  The next morning I discovered a bleeding puncture wound on my right ear after showering.  This report should be studied together with another sighting which took place two days later, in order to appreciate the emerging pattern. At the time of this event, I was 27 years old, a private pilot and college student.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

My mom and I where in her room watching the talk show of Sally. Then my mom and I went to the kitchen so she could iron her clothes. When I came back to my room, there was no Sally. Nobody was in the house but my mom and I. The T.V screen had like planets and comets flying around. And then, as I turned around, something was sleeping under the covers of my bed. I touched it, and then I went running back to the kitchen. I think this was some type of alien or UFO experience. I will never forget that day. Everything was back to normal when my mom returned to the bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was winter, and my best friend (and neighbor) and I were sledding in their orchard behind their house.  We had just sledded to the bottom of a hill and were lying in the snow looking up at the sky, when an object that looked like a low flying airplane flew into sight above us.   We both stared at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object obviously came to a stop right above us and we had a great opportunity to view the lights around the craft, I believe they were yellow, red, green and possibly blue. They blinked on and off at different times, almost appearing that one light could blink different colors.  It scared us, as we had never seen an airplane just stop like that before.  Then, the wings seemed to fold back into the craft and it darted off very quickly and appeared to crash in a draw in the nearby hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran for her house as fast as our legs would carry us through the snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her mother instantly knew something was wrong, and listened to our frantic recaps of what we had just seen.  It bothered her enough that she called the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two police officers arrived at her house a short while later, and one took my friend into a room and one took me into a different room, out of earshot of each other.  They had us each tell them what we saw, and draw pictures of it.  Afterwards, the cops compared our stories and pictures, which were identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was before cell phones, and I distinctly remember the one cop asking to use the home phone to make a few phone calls.  I was able to overhear some of what he said, he was checking to see if anyone had special test flights going on, and no one did.  He also confirmed no planes were in the area and that no planes were reported missing and/or crashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then sent a crew up to the hills and they said they combed the entire hillside we pointed them to, and never found a single thing.  And that was the last I ever heard about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I can still picture what we saw.  It haunts me.   Maybe it was a UFO, maybe it was some special craft that was being tested that was classified, or maybe we hit our heads while sledding - though that is unlikely.  All I know is I have never seen or heard of anything like it since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This is the location of the U.S. Navy&#39;s top secret submarine program as well as a major Naval instillation.  My friend and myself went outside for a smoke and I saw some lights that seemed unusual.  I am what is commonly called an Indigo child so I am very open to these types of experiences.  I felt an urgency to get down to the cliffs to get a closer look.  The ligths appeared to be about 500 yards off-shore but they did not reflect off of the water so they could have been out over the horizon (20 miles).  They made no noise and  moved with incerdible speed OR there were many of them.  What made them unusual was that they created a changing pattern of triangles.  One light would go dimm then disapear and after it did another would appear in a different location creating a perfect upside-down or right side-up triangle.  I am sorry I can not give much more deatil for sure but I can say that growing up wathching every type of military and civilian aircraft take off and land from Mira Mar (Top Gun), Limburg Field, and Coronado Island I am 100% sure that what I saw that night is either a top secret program or not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At 17:32 I noticed a brilliant motionless white light about 20 times brighter than the star Sirius some 15 degrees above the southwest horizon.  I first thought it must be an airplane with its landing light on.  After 10 seconds, the light reduced to the magnitude of Sirius and stayed like this for several minutes.  Finally, I mentioned the object to my passenger, whereupon it immediately increased its brightness to 20 times Sirius for 10 seconds, reduced again becoming momentarily invisible, and then returned to magnitude of Sirius.  It held this appearance from 17:37 until 17:52, when it set behind a cloud bank in the position of the planet Mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this sighting, I was 27 years old, attending college in Laramie, Wyoming, had served four years in the U.S. Navy, and was a private pilot.  I had also had training in basic astronomy and astrophysics.  We had left Little America in Cheyenne at 17:00, and then checked for passengers at the Holiday Inn, which we left at 17:10.  The shuttle vehicle was an 11-passenger Ford van owned by Airport Express of Fort Collins, Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly 10 and 12 days later, I saw more Unconventional Flying Objects, so that this report is the first in a cluster of three.

Late one evening I remember walking accoss the parade square, returning from the naffi were I had purchaced cigarettes, must have been about 22:00 Hrs, As I walked between two vehicle Hangers I looked up and saw two small red lights about 20 or 30 feet apart. I thought at first they were radio antennas, but then was puzzled as I remembered my unit didnÂ´t have any and certainly not placed on top the vehicle hangers. I stood for a moment, watching these sationary lights, trying to work out what they could be. Then to my alarm they appeared to move closer towards me (the distance between them closed very slowly). As I continued to stare at the lights they apeared to very slowly rotate around some sort of solid body between them although the lights appeared to remain sationary!There was no sound!(difficult to explain) As to what happened next I am unsure- I rememeber being extremely Scared( this was one of the few times in my life i was so scared AND I MEAN SCARED! thats why i can still remember it to this day.)I then remember walking back to my accomadation in the the early morning and I belive I then went to bed. The reason I taken so long to tell anyone is I donÂ´t know what happened in between. I have always supposed it was just a bad dream I cannot forget but after nearly 12 years I had to tell someone even if it was a computer screen, you donÂ´t have to use this information, but it just felt good telling it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were going to be late for curf|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03062.html|13|ndxe198901| Summary : My friend and I who were both 16 at the time were driving to her house on state highway 51 westbound. We were going to be late for curfew so we were in a hurry. there were no cars coming in either direction. We were driving along and something caught my peripheral vision to the north. We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off. I believe this was a ufo on the ground there are no buildings or houses around where this happened only fields and trees a fairly rural area. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact date I only remember it was late spring or early summer in 1989 My friend Kristie VanBrunt and myself were driving westbound on highway 51 to her house we were going to be late for curfew and she didnt want to get in trouble. We were just driving along talking and all of a sudden out of the corner of my right eye I see these incredibly bright white lights shining straight up into the sky there were about 5 or 6 of them and they were arranged in a circle the lights were behind the tree line coming up from the ground. I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn&#39;t stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual. The lights started to turn around in a big circle  they stayed in their posistion but the whole thing was turning slowly at first then very fast. Then the lights just started going crazy criss crossing each other and we were both just staring with our jaws wide open in disbelief at what we were seeing I started screaming  to stop but she wouldn&#39;t. I am now 24 years old I have 2 children I am a supervisor in a telecommunications center and consider my self very normal. My friend is a homemaker mother of 1. We have not told very many people about this because people look at us like were nuts. Every since then I have had a firm belief in ufos.<n>
1/1/89 23:00|Memphis|TN|Light|varying|On sequential nights during the month of January, 1988, I witnessed from 2-4 bright amber lights hovering or slowly moving in the weste|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02821.html|14|ndxe198901| Summary : On sequential nights during the month of January, 1988, I witnessed from 2-4 bright amber lights hovering or slowly moving in the western sky over Memphis. On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of &#39;97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed &#39;flares&#39;, and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and &#39;texture&#39; to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a &#39;ballet&#39; in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than &#39;lights in the sky.&#39; But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don&#39;t that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.<n>
