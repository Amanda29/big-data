Seti is a load of crap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all true.  In 1956 I was interested in flying saucers and read the books of the time.  I was 12 years old.  I decided one day to pray to see some.  On May 17 1956 I was standing against a basketball pole outside during recess.  6th grade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was &#34;waiting&#34; but did not know why.  Suddenly a whole formation of concave on the bottom with a darker center metallic craft appeared in tight MILITARY REVIEW FORMATION.  They were soundless as death and went over the Portland cement plant going north. There were 5 groups of 4 each in offset Vs one behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I carefully noted all details and then started yelling to other kids.  Most were playing softball on the other end of the field.  A friend I had saw the last group of 4 before they went behind the smoke from the cement plant stacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran thinking they would come out the other side but nothing appeared except something that had a reddish green glow and seemed to be turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had the report placed in the local newspaper.  I received a letter from Civilian Flying Saucer Intelligence in Seattle.  I think the address was ((address deleted)) St. I was made OK State Director.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had a friend of my father who was in the Air Force Reserve send a report to the Pentagon and I received a reply from Timothy R. Johnson, Directorate of Intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike thinks I am a liar and has censored me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not the last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Read between the lines.  That is all I can say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Address indicated suggests to us that the witness had contacted the National UFO Reporting Center.  PD))<n>
5/15/56 20:00|Pine castle AFB|FL|Light|45 min|A large white light travelling slow and then at a great speed from low to great height in seconds no sound|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42949.html|2|ndxe195605| A large white light travelling slow and then at a great speed from low to great height in seconds no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after dark we were wating for our C-97 to pick us up. We saw what we thought  was the front nose lading light coming down the runway we wondered why the pilot did not turn on wing lights! Their was no sound and the light went vertical and went high enough to look like a shooting star it crossed the sky north and south at a great speed stoping and changidg direction instantly Finaly it turned east and disapeared out over the ocan ! We notified the officer of the day and he came out to the ramp and watched with us the radar station could not track the object! At this time pine castle AFB was part of the down range project! This is my first time telling this to any one I was in the air force a air craft machanic on the c-97 and kc-97 tanker I do not rember the exact date ! it should be inthe ariforce records at pine castle<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5/1/56 12:00|Canton|OH|Cigar|2 minutes|At first the silver disc was stationary. As it moved across the sky, it moved so rapidly, it could not have been man made.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46170.html|3|ndxe195605| At first the silver disc was stationary. As it moved across the sky, it moved so rapidly, it could not have been man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking south on Sharonwood Ave NW at Noon on a clear, sunny day, and the sky had a few white fluffy clouds against a bright blue sky. In front of me approx. 20 degrees above the horizon and slightly to the left of center was a stationary silver object, cigar shaped (if cigar is fatter at the center). I studied it carefully for some time, but in retrospect my guess is for about 2 or 3 minutes, though it seemed longer than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airport was about 8 miles north, so at first I assumed it might be a plane flying directly at me, making it appear stationary, or away from me, but it didn&#39;t move at all, and it didn&#39;t get larger or smaller. It was very smooth looking with no markings, windows, or protrusions such as a wing or a tail.  I was only 12 or 13 years old at the time, but I didn&#39;t really think I was seeing a flying saucer, nor had I seen or read anything prior that would make me think along those lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stillness of the object is what puzzled me, so I concentrated carefully thinking the stillness had to be an illusion, and it would soon give itself away, and I&#39;d be able to tell what it really was. Then suddenly it began to move to my right and slightly upward.  I didn&#39;t know how far away it was, but I was guessing a mile or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this moment I was convinced immediately I had seen something outside of man&#39;s technology. The speed at which it moved convinced me.  It moved so quickly and without noise or any appearance of accelerating.  It just moved quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only got to see its movement for maybe 20 or 25 degrees horizontally and slightly upwards because it went behind a white fluffy cloud. I expected to see it come out on the other side of the cloud, but it did not. It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another peculiar thing about this story is how vividly I remember it.  I&#39;m 61 years old now, and have never seen anything remotely like what I saw that day, and I can still remember it all very much like remembering what I was doing the moment I learned of Kennedy being shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mother what I saw, but there was something about her response (though she was very supportive) that made me not tell anyone else for many years.  I just couldn&#39;t expect anyone to believe me, yet I know I saw what I&#39;ve described here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reason for reporting it now is that TV shows on the subject have shown people describing what I described, so perhaps the center will have other people reporting they saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.
