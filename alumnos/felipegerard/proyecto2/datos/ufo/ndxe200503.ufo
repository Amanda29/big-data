I noticed 2 large white lights as those of an approaching aircraft as if coming in for a landing. There is an airport about one mile from sighting area (Addison). We were driving toward the object yet it appeared to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I realized it was not converging as fast as it should I became more curious. The craft was hovering at approximately 300 feet. I would estimate the length to be about 250 feet by about 50 feet and 50 feet tall. There were no strobes as an aircraft would have. There was a big white constant light at each bottom corner of the forward leading edge and one constant white light located on the lower center trailing edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver of the vehicle would not stop (on tollway) so we progressed under the object. I was unable to detect any real detail of the object other than dimensions. After passing the object it appeared to continus to remain motionless.The rear of the trailing edge where you would expect the tail of an airplane to be had a square box shaped area like 20x20 that had multiple small blinking lights (red,white,blue).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe the objects orientation as we proceeded away from it and it remained fixed. After pleading to the driver to turn around several minutes passed before we could exit and re-enter the tollway to backtrack. The object was gone upon returning.<n>

When we came under the lights my son told me this thing is a big black triangle so I pulled over and got out of the car.It was loudy here with no stare visible and the light from the craft was clearly illuminating the bottoms of the cloud cover It looked to be at around 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude and a few hundred feet from tip to tip The object was dark and featureless and in the shape of a perfect triangle except for three white lights. they were located at the corners of the craft, and a single non flashing red light on the bottom directly in the center of the triangle. The object was hovering motionless above us and no noise was evident. It remained there for two minutes began slowly moving and turned to the left and began heading north following the highway we followed it for approx 3 minutes more till the object disapeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then saw that there were smaller lights encircling the object and it was suspended in air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching the object because we couldn&#39;t decide if it was a plane or star, and while watching it, my 16 year old daughter exclaimed that it was a shooting star.  While we watched, the object fell very quickly in a right-sided arch and stopped suddently at a 3:00 point.  It did fall as fast as a shooting star before stopping. The object remained in that position without any further movement.<n>

Glancing to my right I noticed a white disc shaped object rising up from the tree line at an angle on the horizon moving in a easterly direction. The object moved straight east for a short distance before I lost sight of it behind a large double billboard. Slowing the car down I caught sight of it again just past F St. as  50th St. dips to head steeply down towards a tunnel. The object made a very quick turn and headed north just before I lost sight of it again due to the dip in the terrain. I went through the tunnel and under the interstate 80 bridge. I tried to spot the object again as I came up the hill on the other side. I was unable to get a good look at the portion of the sky where I had seen the object until I came up to Grover St. due to the amount of trees and homes blocking my view. When I got to the Grover St. intersection and looked around the sky as I waited for the green light. The object was nowhere to be seen. The Object was a smooth briliant white. It had no wings. Its movements were quick yet gracefull. Ive purchased a pocket sized digital camera as a result of this sighting. If I see anything like this again I will be ready to photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to the window to see bright flashing red, white and green lights about a block or two away.  The lights were so bright, they lit up the entire sky.  Ther was a low repetitive humming moter of some sort.  We could not actually see any sort of air craft, only the extremely bright lights.  Suddenly, the lights stopped and there was no more sound.  We are planning on going to the police today to see if any one else saw this and witnessed it.  My sister is 24 and a dental assistant, I am 27 and a college student, my mother who also saw the lights is 52.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She went to the window, in the dark, and saw three ufos with a horizonal light band of different colors flashing along the side of the craft high above the ground. the size was a spread hand at arm length each. The top one move to the left and joined two more farther left. She could not move because she couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. after a while she could hardly breathe and felt a pressure on her chest from being scared and ran to the phone to call us. when my wife asked if they were still there she looked out her windows but it was just dark with stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are not able to contact him/her.

3/30/05 22:28|San Francisco|CA|Teardrop|4 sec|A very bright shooting star-like event over San Francisco.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43261.html|11|ndxe200503| A very bright shooting star-like event over San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just last nite coming back from the airport (driving north on I 280 approaching SF ) my friend and I witnessed a possible  meteor spectacle.    I say &#39;apparent&#39; because it wasn&#39;t anything to compare with a normal shooting star.    It was about 30 to 40 times as large and bright as a typical shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d estimate it would have been the size of a dime at arms length approximately.   Put another way, appx. 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a full moon.  Appx. teardrop shaped.  It was glowing/burning extremely bright white similar to a shooting star but didn&#39;t seem to flash out, but more specifically kept going and going until it went out of view below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it appeared as if it was a near object.     So, if it was at the upper area of the atmosphere, stratosphere, or whatever, it might have been a rather huge object.   It was not however, bright enough to have brightened the nite sky as lightning would have for instance, but unlike a normal shooting star it would have gotten anyone&#39;s attention who was even generally looking in that direction at that time.  (10:28 PM wednesday nite)  There was no fracturing or breaking apart of the object.   It appeared to maintian its approximate shape for the 4 seconds or so duration of its visibility.   It did however, seem to have the characteristic incendiary burning brightness similar to a meteor&#39;s in that the intensity of its brightness did tend to be focused in its center and emanating outwardly towards its edges.   No smoke trail or smear effect tail was noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, who had never seen anything this profound was quite amazed by its size and brightness as was I as well.   I called it in to the local news radio station and 3 TV stations, none of them suggesting they&#39;d heard any similar reports at the time.    These calls that I made to the media were appx. a half hour after having witnessed the sighting.<n>

There were no clouds in the sky and it was about 35-40 degrees F. The sun had been above the hills for maybe an hour when I looked up from my cup of tea and saw a bright white &#34;star&#34; below and a little to the right of the sun (about 1 inch below the sun from my perspective). It must have been very bright indeed because it was  close to the sun and I was wearing sunglasses, and yet, it was still very visible. It was not moving. After 1.5 - 2 seconds the light faded quickly(it didn&#39;t just &#34;Blink&#34; off, but it still faded very fast).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a passenger jet that was reflecting the sunlight, but after it disappeared I saw no jet or airplane, there was no white trail, nor was there any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 seconds after the first light faded another light appeared (it sort of &#34;faded in&#34; instead of out) farther to the right of the first position. From my perspective the two object&#39;s positions were roughly 2 inches apart in the sky. The second light was just as bright as the first, at the same distance above the horizon, and it was also motionless. It lasted around 1 second, and then faded just like the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I looked for any sign of an aircraft but there were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived in this apartment for almost three years, and I sit on the porch with my tea almost every day (except during the winter) and I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple luminous spheres during thunderstorm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Received an email from a Clifton, Virginia man, reporting that his wife witnessed something strange late in the night, during a storm that hit our area the previous day  (Clifton is approximately 12 miles west of Springfield, in which I reside).  Email sighting account in part: &#34;We had a power outage last night and my wife was awakened by the answering machine clicking on and off as the power tried to recover, and then it went out completely. She went to the front door to see if it was raining or windy and saw a very large object hovering over a nearby house about an 1/8 of a mile from our house. It was larger than the house, seemed to be at an angle to her view with the bottom exposed and had lights all around it evenly spaced. When it began to move away, several lightning flashes were seen and then it was gone. The power returned two hours later&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second email was received the next day stating that he had a chance to talk to his wife about this sighting and he added that it would seem that his wife might have actually observed &#34;balls of lightning&#34;. He also wrote: &#34;what she describes sounds just like a multiple ball lightning display which she says disappeared as she watched it, and then a bolt of lightning went up into the space above the house from the ground to where the lights had appeared to be&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little more details were obtained during a telephone interview that was conducted March 31st. Sighting took place around 12:30 AM, March 23, during a thunderstorm, as she was facing south, towards Manassas. The length of the appearance lasted just a few seconds, from the &#34;balls of light&#34; formation to the vertical lightning flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my belief that this incident may have been a natural, Rare Atmospheric Phenomena (RAP) involving multiple ball lightning, or Mobile Luminous Spheres. To be a witness of one or two of these lightning balls are rare but witnessing a group of ten or more is phenomenal!  According to Dominion Virginia Power website, their electrical outage legend summary dated 3/23/2005, indicated that there were about 24 homes that were affected by this storm in the Northern Virginia&#39;s Fairfax County area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 23rd temperature: 44 degrees, cloudy with rain, average humidity 81, wind 13 mph NE.<n>

The recording will remain in the system until April 14 and still pictures can be printed and provided to the reporting center if requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We were not able to contact the source in time to request the photo.

My friend took some stuff inside and I stayed outside under the blakcets, we had been laying on them looking at the sky talking for a while, a few seconds after he went inside I turned my view and something with 5 brownish-orangeish lights on the bottom of it. My first geuss was that it was a plane or helicopter, but i was like &#34;thats flying really low to be a plane&#34; and then I relized there wasn&#39;t really any sound, so I thought it couldn&#39;t be what I first thought it was. Then my friend came back out side and I asked &#34;whats that?&#34;, he didnt know what I was talking about so I pointed at it, he did ended up seeing it, we both only saw it for about 30 seconds before we lost sight of it behind some trees heading in a north-eastern direction, it was a half circle moon type thing shape. We aren&#39;t quite sure what it is, but we are sure its some kind of UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly when I was going down 82 ave I see something orange fall, about 4 blocks away from me to my left... I speed up to see what it is when ssuddenly a little further down I see something that maybe was a circular shape(not sure) since it was high up in the sky... It was all white with one red light blinking every couple of seconds... As I keep speeding up to get closer to it it starts moving in circle to its left so I made a left and it stopped about 5 blocks from me... As im starting to get closer to it It moves real fast as a circle this time going down... I keeop speeding up to catch with it, once again i see it stopped at a place but far from me, so as I m catching up goes in circle again... Till i just gave up and left... I told friends/family members about this, asking if it could have been a placne a helicopter-a plane couldnt have moved in circle and stopp completely-a helicopter- couldnt possibly go that high/ or that fast... Ive told people that dont know me, people I meet and noone believes me, I sweard this was true me and my girlfriend saw it... thats the reason why im here today, to find out more about it...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/27/05 20:40|Brampton (Canada)|ON|Circle|12 seconds|Apparently one red hued object with 2 "lights" becomes 2 near Pearson International Airport at 20:40 HRS March 27 2005.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43202.html|34|ndxe200503| Apparently one red hued object with 2 &#34;lights&#34; becomes 2 near Pearson International Airport at 20:40 HRS March 27 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying on my front porch at the bequest of my little son (something I wouldn&#39;t normally do at this time of year) with my son and daughter.   We were simply looking at the stars.  We saw a couple of star-like objects move across the sky and I mentioned to them that they were likely satellites and that I had seen a lot of them in my years.  We were about to go inside when I saw two blurry redish hues (I can&#39;t really call them lights because they were not as clear as that, they gave off the sort of light you would see if you were to look at a black light.) I didn&#39;t think much of it at first as there is an international airport near us.  I told the kids to look at &#34;that plane&#34; and my daughter saw it but my son did not.  Just as I said that, the &#34;lights&#34; separated by about 8 times the distance they were when we first saw them!  This indicated to me that it was not a single object but two seemingly identical objects.  The speed with which they separated was quite quick, and they then proceeded to accelerate in a south-westerly direction far more rapidly than any plane could.  The duration of this observation was approximately 12 seconds and they covered 80% or so of our field of view in that time.  We lost sight of them due to the lights of the city.  I decided that I should call the ufo hotline center as I have NEVER seen anything as obviously unidentifiable as this before and I have watched the skies on and off in the Muskoka&#39;s and elsewhere thousands of times in my life just enjoying the stars and looking for events such as this!  I should include that I contacted the local air traffic control centre in Mississauga at Pearson International Airport.  I got no answer but a woman at Terminal 3 took my name and number and said they would call me back.  An hour has passed and they have not.  I find it a little strange that there are no airplanes in the area at this time - an hour since we saw these objects - and this being Easter Sunday and Pearson being a fairly busy airport, I would expect that there would be several jets in the sky!  Perhaps they did see something and have kept the air space clear because of this??? The phone number for the air traffic control centre is 905-676-3074 if anyone would like to follow this up in a more official manner than I am likely able to.<n>

However, there was no percussion heard for the five minutes I waited afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated elevation from Milton, VT, was around 35-40 degrees from horizon and distance is unknown so it could have been towards southern NH or Eastern MA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a large jet flying in that direction not 30 seconds afterwards and flew almost directly over my location.  The only reason I know it was large was due to the marker strobes displayed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t normally like to report these things because of the nature of general thought on UFO&#39;s but these were definite and unmistakable white flashes in an area relatively void of these sorts of things.<n>

3/27/05 02:00|Rochester|NY|Unknown|Unsure|Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88649.html|39|ndxe200503| Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experiences are always an extremely vivid dream, and I have had multiple follow up dreams as well.  Every fiber of my being tells me that my experiences were real.  I am not a ufo enthusiast by any means, and have always believed abduction stories, for the most part, are the result of an overactive imagination or mental/physical disorders.  Here is my story:  The first time I had the experience, I never experienced the actual abduction or saw any kind of spacecraft.  All of the sudden, myself and maybe four other humans were in some kind of adminstration building with windows all around, with a huge table in the middle of this stainless steel like atrium.  We were all terrified, and scattered to find a hiding place;  we had no idea how we got there, or who anyone else was.  We never saw the alien beings either!  Me and another human male hid in a closet.  There were no words spoken the entire time, not sure why.  All of the sudden, I wasn&#39;t afraid anymore, and ventured out into the atrium once again.  I walked to the big table in the center of the room, and some kind of a being or presence was showing me, telepathically, the secret to faster than light travel and their alphabet.  I was amazed, no longer afraid, just...awed!  Afterwards, I was lead, telepathically, outside of the atrium to their world.  It was beautiful beyond my ! imagination:  two suns; one brilliant blue sun on the horizon and another red sun on the other horizon.  The world around me had a desert coloring to it, but there were strange plants in the distance.  I was telepathically told that my time was up.  It is at this time that I woke up in my own bed, feeling like I had been blessed by god.  I was able to draw some of their alphabet, but had no idea what it meant.  I was also able to recreate the diagram for faster than light travel.  This experience has stuck with me throughout the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I had this experience, I suddenly found myself looking at the beautiful horizon with the two beautiful suns.  I wasn&#39;t afraid at all, but so humbled and excited that I was back!  Once again, I never saw the alien(s), but was able to understand, and realize that there were several beings near me, that meant no harm.  It is like someone was speaking over a radio directly into my brain.  Once again, I am unable to speak with my voice, but these beings must have been able to read my thoughts and emotions, because I got a tour of this facility.  As I am walking through the atrium, I notice the ceilings are over 30 feet high, the walls curved and there were no straight lines.  It was all a stainless steel looking structure.  Very interesting!  I walked past glass window, where I saw hundreds of human bodies suspended in some kind of clear solution with one tube going into their abdomen.  The tube had a florescent liquid flowing into each human&#39;s stomach.  I was hor! rified.  The being told me, telepathically, not to worry.  These were just generic shells that they had created through genetic replication many years ago.  The human shells that they had were devoid of any soul or spirit that made us human, and had no awareness whatsoever.  The alien then told me not to be afraid once again, they have no intentions of harming any human being, only a fascination and a need to experiment.  The only time they deal with real live humans is in a controlled and friendly environment with no intent to harm or frighten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden, in my mind&#39;s eye, I saw a small town just like any here on earth.  There were humans, happily living out their lives in a place that was created by these beings.  Almost like a scientific zoo, but the humans were blissfully unaware of their situation.  These were genetic reproductions of actual humans from earth that they created to learn everything about the human race.  Once again, the being reiterated that not a single human was harmed, and that these humans were farmed there strictly for research, and were able to live their lives to entirety without any intervention from these beings; these brings were merely there to observe, not interfere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again, I was suddenly outside of their facilities, gazing on the horizon, admiring their two beautiful suns.  I awoke, once again, in my own bed, with that same feeling of awe and being blessed with what I was able to experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was astonished to have what seemed like a &#34;follow up&#34; visit, like these beings are making sure to take it slow, not to overwhelm, not to frighten, just to make contact with real earthly beings and share some of their culture.  I believe that the biggest thing these beings were trying to show me is that they are real, they have been making contact with humans for thousands of years, and were proud of their experiments.  Kind of like a &#34;hey, we are here, and there is no reason to fear us, let us show you!&#34;  I have not had another experience since the second one, which occurred in 2010.  Nothing even close.  I am not afraid that it will happen again, and I hope I do experience it again.  To me, it is almost like seeing the benevolent face of god.  These are truly good and beautiful beings that are reaching out.  It has been a life changing experience, for the better.  I hope that my story helps others and that others have been able to visit these beings.<n>

We were hugging and I was looking towards the North while she was looking towards the South. When I started to notice a circular bright white light in the North Sky - and it kept getting brighter, thinking it was just an airplane turning towards Palm Springs for its final approach. When I started to notice there were two 45-degree lights emitting from the bright light at the base. Then there were two additional slightly less bright circular lights at the end of the two 45 degrees lights and then a light that was horizontal from those lights, to create a perfect symmetrical upside down triangle. Thinking - WOW - I said to my wife &#34;Look at the upside down triangle with the three bright lights in the sky that seems to be moving very slowly towards us&#34; She looked and then was shocked  - saying - &#34;what is that&#34; got scared then proceeded to run into the house. I stayed there and continued to watch all three lights and the angle lights get less bright and then all together disappear. It was unbelievable - I thought I&#39;d never ever see a UFO!<n>

Approximately 20 seconds later there were 3 aircrafts in the sky which did not appear to be commerical carriers then 4 more appeared for a total of 7.

We were all 3 outside at the time because our families were sleeping.At the same time (aprox) we all sighted one large fireball travel from west to east across the sky. I&#39;m bad with directions...but I think this is about right. This was followed by two or three smaller fireballs. The really weird part is we reside in different parts of the country. One in Tennessee, One in Texas, and myself in Arizona. Almost at the same time we all excalimed something along the lines of Holy Shit!! We all went in our houses and checked the news channels. I checked Nasa, Astronomy.com, SETI, and called Homeland Security who directed me to file a report with you. The first was a giant fireball! I thought a plane had crashed...or something to that effect. There are obvious explanations for what we all saw...but I wanted to report my findings just in case whatever srashed had lifeforms inside that may be in need of rescue.

I then looked up and and seen it also. I was shocked because I was always a little skeptic of ufo sightings. As I was watching it, it looked yellow as it zipped through the sky. I say it was about 1 mile in the air. it then went over the trees and vanished.Me and my brother were so confused and we just talked about it for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/25/05 16:30|Tucson|AZ|Diamond|30 seconds|Dual Diamond Swinging Kite Object(s)|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52941.html|49|ndxe200503| Dual Diamond Swinging Kite Object(s)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been trying to find out if there have ever been reports of the type of object we saw on the date above, and decided to file a report while I&#39;m here since the event continues to perplex me to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 4:30 in the afternoon on or about March 25 or 2005, my freind and I were out in my backyeard. I was sitting at my gold panning tub while he was looking into my side yard. My freind told me &#34;You need to check this out.&#34; I thought he was looking at some flaw on my roof or a cooler leak etc...I just made some joke about not wanting to see whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he repeated in a rather puzzled but stern voice...&#34;No, I mean it, come here and check this out!&#34;  I got up reluctantly and asked what he was looking at. He said &#34;I&#39;m not sure what the heck it is. I thought it was a parachutis in trouble but it just doesn&#39;t look right for that.&#34; He pointed in the general direction where he was looking. At first I didn&#39;t see anything, but then out from behind a tele pole I got my first glimpse of it. I tried to focus on ths object to tell what it was. Because of it&#39;s motion in the first few seconds of my seeing the object, I thought it was a kite. There appeared to be a tringular shaped object on top, with a smaller one below it. The lower craft appeared to be &#34;tethered to the upper, as it was moving back and forth in a pendulus swinging motion.&#34; Initially it looked like a kite. However after watching it a few more seconds it became apparent that whatever this was was moving across the sky far too fast for a kite busted off it&#39;s string. Also, the pendulus motion in a constant back and forth arc below the upper object was very precise and rythmic in pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement is really what made the sighting &#34;eerie/odd/unexplainable&#34; as with each cycle of back and forth motion (8 o&#39;clock to 4 o&#39;clock), the object(s) paused, then elevated and began another swinging cycle. At the end of each back/forth cycle, it paused, and elevated. I observed this happen aout 4 or 5 times and then the oddest thing happened...the little object on the bottom went in a full circle all the way around the top object in a matter of a second. It started in it&#39;s normal 8 o&#39;clock position, but then did a complete loop around the upper diamond object and stopped on a dime in the 4:00 position, and then began another back/forth swing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran through the house as the trees in my neighbors yard were now in the path of the object. I jumped on top of my freind&#39;s truck to see if I could find the object again from my front yard but it was no where to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, no lights. The onjects were perhaps shimmering a bit, but the odd thing is I&#39;m not sure if that was from it&#39;s reflective qualities or a &#34;blur&#34; as the objects were never crisply defined in my sight. I recall really trying to focus on them because of this aspect of their appearance, but to no avail. I could tell they were diamon in shape, with the shorter axis of the diamonds at 12 and 6 o&#39;clock. The objects seemed to be tan to dark grey and varied in hue over time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My freind and I remain pretty convinced this was something that defies any objects we could think of that might exhibit this sort of free flight. Again, it was the precise period of the swing, the repetitive precision of the starting and stopping points of the swing, the vertical elevation in between each cycle, and the swiftness of the loop around the upper object with it&#39;s rapid halt that made this sighting truly bizzarre to us. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my 48 years that still has me scratching my head. I&#39;m a bit mad that I didn&#39;t write everything down that day, as I struggle to recall if I actually saw a tehter, or if it was just the precision of the movement of the lower object that implied such a tether (sorry)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At first we thought it was an airplane, but when it began moving at a extremely high rate of speed, we knew it was not.  It travelled horizontally in the sky faster than I have even seen anything move, for a distance at would have taken a normal craft such as a plane 3-4 minutes.  It then disappeared.  It reappeared in the sky several miles to the left of where it had disappared, and continued along to the left, as before, at a high rate of speed.  It once again disappeared, and at this point my mother and I knew this was nothing either of us had ever seen.  Once it re-appeared in the sky, again, several miles to the left again, it was stationary.  It started to mave again on its previous course, to the left, when it started to move diagonally across the sky faster than before, again, faster than I have ever seen anything move before.  Me and my mother both knew at this time that this was not normal.  It continued along this path for about one minute, moving very fast until it disappeared again and never re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approx.  09:45 I was sitting near the wing, gazing out of the plane window when in the far distance I saw a  strange black sphere shaped object which had a black trail of vapour behind it this trail was approx. 3 times the size of the mysterious object. Then I watched as the object did a 360 degree turn and then continued to move a short way in a  horizontal direction.  The vapour trail disappeared from the back of it and seconds after the object just disappeared from my sight.  This whole process probably only took a matter of 1 - 2 minutes. I don&#39;t know whether anyone else on the plane noticed it or not but I am convinced that what I saw was very strange and likely to be an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One on the right moved up and down very quickly. They also moved apart a couple of times. They were very bright lights. They quickly moved across the sky over my house. I didn&#39;t have time to video tape or take a picture because they were moving so fast I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of them.

They formed a triangle (in the sky with one top light and two lower lights as a base), a slash (diagonal alignment) and a side by side formation a relatively straight line.  They maneuvered very quickly, changing positions in somewhat of an aero (astro) batic motion.  We followed lights for a distance of approximately 5 miles.  After 20 minutes or so, they suddenly vanished.  I saw red lights but my daughters who didn&#39;t have the distration of driving also saw white and yellow elements. After they disappeared we parked in an unlit area to maintain a watch on the sky.   We observed several very slow moving aircraft making a great circle approximately around the sighting area.  Could not tell if they were commercial or military flights.  While watching the sky we also observed some other very high and swift moving objects that were very likely satellites.  At approximately 21:30 we saw a very slow moving aircraft loop this area making a very severe right bank to change its southbound course, through the west to the north, roughly parallel to La Grange Rd. (Rt. 45);  that craft went north to the horizon and then proceeded along that north horizon to disappear to our northeast.  Unsure if this craft was related to the sighting.  We broke off our observations at 21:35 and headed home (Frankfort).  My older daughter thought she saw a smaller object detach from one of the three red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had seen one of the August 24th red lights take a similar route before it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stood there looking at the stars for a few seconds. That night had a few low cumulus clouds. As I looked at the clouds an odd craft silently came into view through a break in the cloads. After observing it for a little while I called my two friends into the room. As the object approached slowly It looked like two rows of three golden lights. I thought it was a disk at first, but when me and my friends ran into another room to get a view from below, we could see that it was triangular. From the bottom view it had three red lights, one on the tip of the craft, and two on the back. In the middle of the bottom of the craft it had a large blue speckled light. There was also small blue lights scattered all over the bottom of the craft. And like I said it made only a small humming noise and was low to the ground. It was traveling at about 20 mph. When it went over my house, me and my friends felt some sort of energy...I don&#39;t know what but there was a charge in the air. I had never seen any UFOs before and I wasn&#39;t even a believer but after seeing this craft, which was unlike anything that I had ever seen before, I have become curius.

I came out twice that nite, and the lites were there both times, they at one point seemed to be standing still. Third time I came out there was no trace of the lites.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of my interior lights were on so this light was very, very bright.  Airplanes and stars never grab my attention like this object did.  The light was north of my home and approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  The wind was gusting to around 25 mph at the time and it was overcast.  I stood up from the computer, dimmed the lights and went to the window to watch a tightly grouped collection of fast blinking lights that surrounded a very bright orangish light that would extinguish and re-light every two or three seconds.  The fast blinking lights were orange, red, blue, green, yellow and white.  They blinked so fast that it almost appeared like a giant scintillating star.  This object was low enough over the horizon to gauge it&#39;s movements in reference to trees which were backlit by Jackson, Michigan&#39;s orangish glow.  This weird collection of lights would rock back and forth in the air and seemed to rise and fall dramatically.  After approximately five minutes swinging, ascending and descending in the air it lurched upward and disappeared into a cloudbank almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting I&#39;ve had in the area over the past three weeks.  On Sunday February 27th, at approximately 7:45 pm I observed two brightly lit triangular formations of lights sitting above the eastern horizon while driving south on M50 between Napoleon and Jackson, Michigan.  The two formations of lights each consisted of three bright orangish white lights.  Two lights formed the triangular base and a single light at each apex.  They sat just a few degrees above the horizon from my position and were in view for about a minute before I lost sight of them behind trees.  I turned my car around to see if I could locate them but had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed it do this 3 times each time in a different position.  I intially thought it was a light on a tower. One to three minutes passed and I again saw the light appear this time centered above the road in the distance.  It moved relativly slowly in a 45 degree upwards angle to the right (west).  As it did so it dropped smaller lights in grouos of three, three times which slowly descented and vanished after a second then diasappeared.  Roughly 30 seconds later it reappeared in a lower position slightly to the right and began the 45 degree path again, again dropping the smaller lights.  It reappeared a third time again in a lower position and began its 45 degree path this time without dropping the smaller lights.  barely a second after it reappeared the third time a second light appeared to the left of the first light and began dropping the groups of smaller lights.  I then exited the Parkway at exit 88 onto Rt 70 in Brick Township.  Across the street from the tollbooth is a Best Western Hotel, the light then reappeared over the hotel and lingered for a few seconds. I then turned onto Rt 70 west and lost sight of the light. I&#39;ve lived in the area all my life and there are several small airports, and airforce base and a naval base within 30 minutes of the area of the sighting.  The lights did not appear to be or behave like aircraft, not could it have been a meteor as the speed was too slow and was headed in an odd trajectory.  Military flares also do not explain it as there was no aircraft in the area during the sighting, and the area is very densely populated as well as the military bases being only stop offs for larger cargo planes which fly low and are very noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Another sighting more recently, same kind of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside feeding my animals when I notice they&#39;re all looking at something. So I look up and I see a totally weird object. It&#39;s this white oval shaped object hovering in the sky. It was not a cloud, as it was moving too rapidly to be a cloud, and it was not a plane. I am certain of this. It was not a balloon or anything like that. I don&#39;t think it was from around here. Anyway, I look up to see it heading towards a range of mountains we call &#34;The Pinnacles&#34;. I watched it for a few seconds and all of a sudden, it was gone! I was astonished. No flash of light. No sound. Nothing. It was just gone. And the weird thing is, it was just this spooky object that made no sound. I got the chills, and I&#39;m not sure if it was because I was really scared or if it was because I was pumped that I saw this. But then I thought, &#39;Probably just my mind playing tricks on me.&#39; And that was that. Until a month or so ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside on the porch and I see that same white oval shaped object in the sky. It made no sound or anything, and it certainly didn&#39;t look like a plane. But the weird thing was, it was kind of near The Pinnacles where I saw the first white oval object. I rushed inside to grab the binoculars to see whether or not I could discern what the object was, and I couldn&#39;t find them so I rushed back outside. It was gone. I had only been inside for a few seconds, so I was puzzled. There were no traces of it whatsoever. It was totally weird. Then I look up to see another object, but it wasn&#39;t otherworldly or anything. Just a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The lights were about as bright as a plane in the distance, but they disappeared way too quickly and at the same exact time to be anything else but a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The crafts position made it apparent that it was an equilateral triangle slightly skewed due to its pan/tilt.  The three lights moved across the sky making it obvious that they were joined though the crafts shape was difficult to make out.  The lights dimmed (all in unison), seemed to brighten slightly and then dimmed completely.  By the time we had crossed under the bridge at Highway 60, there was no sign of the craft.  The sighting lasted between 15 and thirty seconds.  Both of us noticed the craft at the same time as it was pretty obvious that these lights were not stars or earth aircraft and the lights were moving slowly west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was walking, and there was a break between trees to the left, so I looked, I saw either one big triangle, or three small circles in the shap of a triangle, I am not exactly sure. It was pretty big, each dot was roughly 2 inches apart in the sky, I could not tell how close it was and was shoked to see it. It was three bright white, tinted blue lights, almost the color of those blue colored car headlights. I stoped at first site of it, at first I thought I was crazy and they might just be three bright stars, I looked around and it was a dirty hazy night and barley any stars in sight, so I looked back at them, and they started fading out and completly disapered. Today, before school, my brothers friend (ryan), who is 20, was talking to my dad. I brought up that I saw a UFO last night and they both looked at each other and said that ryan just got done telling my dad that he saw a triangle at about 12:00AM last night also. We talked about it, and we both saw the same thing. When I got home from school, a friend of ryan called him and the radio station she was listening to was talking about strange lights last night at 12AM, and they were wondering if anyone else saw them, so we called in and let them know. Thats it, So me, my brothers friend, and a radio jocky all saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to see if its out tonight also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I brought it to his attention and he said it was a plane.  If it were a plane, it would have to be massive or flying so low, anyone in the neighborhood could hear it (but there was no sound when we stopped).  After about 10-20 seconds, the lights began to dim off and on and eventually disappeared one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenley another light just like it appeared below it &amp; the first light slowley dimmed out than re appeared, than a third lit up below them, before fading out one by one going from center, top,than bottom. The lights lasted for mabey a minute to a minute &amp; a half. This is the second time I have witnessed an event like this &amp; it really has my curisioty going now. I had posted to this sight the last time I saw lights like this but have not seen the report posted yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway after getting home I stood outside for awhile &amp; witnessed several more lights again with my friend &amp; my wife. The first I had seen started with a single light in the NW than one to the W than three more in between them spaced a good distance appart, I would guess a couple miles or more. Each light dimmed out(dont recall the exact order)one by one until they were all gone, than two in the center re appeared shortley, followed by the first one in the NW for a couple seconds before they all faded out. These lasted for around two minutes. We all stood waching for about another 15 minutes &amp; witnessed three more single lights through the W &amp; NW sky, all acting the same. They would light up than slowley dim out &amp; usualy re light for just a second or two before dimming out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also noticed there was quite a few normall aircraft flying around, most of them were noticed directley above us or to the East with a couple coming from the NW &amp; heading &amp; all heading North. Or from where we are, heading directley in the direction of Grissom Air Force Base. No (normal) planes were noticed around the lights or where they were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were driving home, I happened to see two orange lights up in the sky to the SouthWest. I was looking at them, and after we had went around a building they were gone. A few minutes later, the rest of my family in the car had spotted the lights. We sat in the car for a few minutes and watched the lights. There were 3 - 6 of these and they began circling around one another. Again they had disappeared. We waiting a little while longer and saw nothing, so we went to the house. My father and I were curious and went outside to look some more. We stood outside and a few minutes later we saw the lights once more. This time the lights were lined up and each blinked on then off once. That was the last we saw of them. We also saw a few passenger air planes but they were not any where near the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The lights were perfectly synchronized when they began to appear, the first one then about two seconds later the second and two seconds later the third and then the forth one was visable. The first three lights were all in a perfectly straight line and the fourth one was above them but offset a little. They did not move at all for about ten to twenty seconds then they just faded out. A couple of minutes went by and they began to appear again in the same fashion as they did the first time one right after the other except this time only three of the lights appeared, not four and they were visiable for about ten seconds then they also faded out. These lights were identical to the first ones I saw and were in the same area of the sky as the first ones. Immediately after the second appearance faded out I saw a faint white light from the exact spot of the sky where the last three lights faded out shoot across the sky at an incredible rate of speed heading east and it was gone.  These lights looked like big balls of fire in the sky, they didn&#39;t look anything like airplane lights plus they just sat there and didn&#39;t even move. It&#39;s nice to get on this web site and see that other people saw the same lights that night, now I know Im not going crazy.<n>

It was visible only briefly and left no trail as would a meteor. Within a few seconds, a bright white light appeared to the right and above where we saw the first light. Momentarily, another white light appeared to the right of the first one, some distance from it. Sequentially, a third light appeared equidistant from the second light, to the right, and then a fourth. As the fourth light came on, the first light went out. A fifth light came on and then the second light went out. The distance between the lights and the angle the array created would suggest a chevron shape. We stopped the car, got out to observe, but by then they had all vanished. We could not determine the altitude of the object[s] and I’m guessing it to be 2-3000 ft due to the partly cloudy skies. It did appear to be moving slowly from the west to the east. We didn’t have enough time to determine if the object blocked out any stars or clouds and couldn’t determine it’s general shape, other than that of being not quite straight across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to 20:30 hrs., consistent to the time in the text of the report.

Last night (3/21), there were very strange orange lights in the sky near the south end of town.  I currently live just south of 350 off of 18th street and am aware of the flight patterns of the Purdue students and the airport...and this had NO affiliation with that.  These orange lights were much farther away and too high to be a Purdue training plane.  These orange lights would appear for 3 or 4 seconds and then fade out to nothing.  I first noticed 1 around 8:30pm.  1 quickly turned into 2, then 3 and finally 4.  These lights would appear in a row and fade in and out at different times.  Once they would fade out, it would be around 5 or 10 minutes before they would appear again...usually in the same spots, but sometimes in different spots as well.  It was completely random...as sometimes only 2 would appear, other times just 1 would appear and again 4 would appear.  It was VERY odd and strange to see.  I tried to take pictures of this event...but was unable to capture any good evidence.  I am fully aware how strange this sounds.  I wanted to try to think of a logical explanation....and...I have come to the conclusion that I have no explanation (couldnt be a shooting star or meteor shower because there was no visual movement of these object, etc).  I would like to know if others have reported seeing this event?  Also, is there any other possible explanation related to meterology that I am not thinking of?  Again, I know this sounds crazy...but I am compelled to find answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve never seen anything like it....ever.  Brighter than stars, almost fire-like in color.   Tonight there was something like a pattern of three fireball lights in a row (like a straight line) and then a fourth fireball appeared...then they faded out.    1st sighting late summer/early fall 2004: The first time I seen these &#34;lights of fire&#34;....I was a mile west of my home coming to a stop sign.   I&#39;m an aviation freak, so I&#39;m always looking for small general aviation planes (day or night).   The lights were so bright, it naturally grabbed my attention.   It didn&#39;t look like airplane lights flying directly toward me...looked like fire.  I seriously started to wonder if there was a mid-air with two planes, a plane with an engine fire....or even a flare from a flare gun.   Totally unexplainable ...it only lasted about 30 seconds to less than a minute.  (thought I would never see it again).   Months later it happened a second time (later 2004).   I was on the same road in my truck heading in the same westerly direction....towards that same stop sign.  After turning north at the stop sign (where I sat a few secs longer this time), I drove slower and tried to keep an eye out to my left.   (nothing else that night).  I couldn&#39;t believe it saw it again.   So this evening, I&#39;m taking the dog out to potty and up in the night-time westerly sky are those very same looking lights or fireballs again.   All times were around 8pm with night sky.  Now I&#39;ve gotta know.....what is it?   I&#39;m get a little crazy sometimes, but seeing this same phenom three separate times on different dates only confirms that I&#39;m really seeing something. I surely cannot be the only person in central Indiana who is seeing this happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a High flying plane. The light pulse of the object was unusual in that it pulsed about every 5 to 10 seconds and was very bright...about the brightness of a medium to bright star.

At the next intersection I turned eastbound toward the area where the formation appeared to be hovering about 500 feet above a nearby church structure.

The object accelerated quite rapidly and was gone in a blink of an eye after that two minutes.

They were straight ahead of me, and although I couldn&#39;t really estimate their distance I guessed that they were a few miles away.  I first assumed that they belonged to military aircraft flying in formation, since they were in a patch of sky that was too light to see stars, and they were brighter than any stars and an unusual color that I don&#39;t recall ever seeing in the sky before.  I watched the lights for a full minute or two.  They possibly had red or green flickers, and my rational mind was thinking that these could be additional small lights.  I was thinking at the time that the formation moved very slowly, since planes always move, but looking back I&#39;m not sure it moved at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this minute or two, as I watched with mild curiousity, the lights just vanished.  I figured.... um.... well, the planes must have turned to an angle where I couldn&#39;t see the lights any more.  I kept watching but they never came back.

There was a hospital exit sign that I passed during the time I saw the object, and I was in the center lane. I saw what at first appeared to be three spotlights, maybe from 3 police helicopters, except brighter and flying in perfect symmetrical formation. They got bigger, brighter, and farther apart as they seemed to descend to 1000ft or so over the highway while moving East. At this point I decided that these were one object, and the space that would make up the triangle between the lights seemed darker than the sky. Each side seemed about the same as the width of both lanes of the highway. At the point that I decided that this was not natural, and not typical aircraft. the lights had gotten brighter and the object started to climb in altitude while still heading east. It accelerated quickly, and at the same time the lights dimmed to black. Like it smoothly &#34;popped&#34; out of existence. I have worked with Boeing at both commercial and military sites for about 10 years, and seen many funky aircraft. This was not one of them. There were other cars on the road also, and they had to have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was hard to mke out at first but it was soon clear it was not a flare as i thought.  A very bright red ball fell very slowly in the distance.  I grabed the camera but by the time I had it ready it was long gone.  It came back in the exact same place but ounse again i did not have the camera ready.Me and my father still debate on what it was.We lost visual of the object after it went behind the trees.It made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked up towards the moon and saw 3 objects 2 were not blinking and 1 was one was blue and the other was white as it got closer it turned out to be that the blue object was being followed by a jet, we live just a few miles from Dyess Airforce Base the 2nd object was off to the side of the blue object kinda far away but I focused mainly on the blue object that was being followed until it got out of sight and I could no longer see it. I see jets flying around here quite often and they usualy have some sort of blinking light. But this object didnt and just looked like a tiny blue orb going across the sky at the same altitude that the plane was flying at, if I were to take a guess i&#39;d say it was about 15,000 ft up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I guess technically what I saw was NOT a UFO...becuase it was not flying. However, there is no other way for this object to get where it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a National Park in Canada. I commute each work day in and out of the park. I know this stretch of road very well. When you travel a route as often as I do...you recognize things that are not usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular day, the sky was fairly clear of clouds...and the sun would have been to the south at the time of my sighting. I&#39;m thinking the object would have been...as the crow flies...maybe 5 miles(8km&#39;s) from the highway. And up at the top of the mountains that surround our town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was the classical UFO Flying saucer. It was perched up behind 2 mountain peeks. Probably 2/3rds of this object was visible. It was VERY large. I suppose that if you were not from this area...and saw this thing..you may think it was some kind of manmade structure. But I assure you...there is NOTHING at the top of this Mountain Range. Not before my sighting...and not since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I can find someone who can help me to measure the distance from the highway where I saw this object more accurately...or the distance between the 2 peeks where I viewed it...I will pass this information on to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that I find very curious about my sighting is what &#39;I&#39; did. Nothing. I just stared at it. In disbelief. I didn&#39;t even stop my car. I do not know how long it stayed there or which direction it flew to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But since that time...I have seen incredibly bright lights &#39;behind&#39; those peeks. I even took a pic with my digital but when I zoomed in on it...all you could see was distorted pixels. I keep my eyes posted on that hill on a daily basis now. I hope I&#39;ll be able to supply you with a REAL picture some day soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Nights are very nice there so i would sit out side for an hour after work. I had been sitting out side staring at the stars maybe seeing a shooting star once in a while. I was doing this for maybe 3 nights prior to seeing this, and was actually thinking how id like to see a ufo, and so i sat peacefully staring and pondering about et and life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when it almost scared me because three stars(lights just dimmer than stars) started to move in unison, in a triangular shape(a triangle that was flat with the earth that distorted with distance) it was heading nw slowly. i tried not to blink because the glair from city lights there made it harder to see the farther it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping to see it pass a star through the center of the object to determine if it was solid of not but never noticed it happen, just floated silently to disappear in the orange glow of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think i held my breath the entire time so event was very short  Also seen same lights in Colorado, so see my other report Ill file shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ill call it Triangle, lights, front range ,CO, summer 05<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were coming home from a family birthday party and our kids were in the car behind us. Out of nowhere, coming from behind us and swooping over us was this incredibly bright white light moving silently past us. It was so white that I remember thinking that the on-coming head lights looked like a dull yellow. I have seen what looked like falling stars in the past, but this wasn&#39;t like that. It came right over us and everyone else on the freeway at that time.There was no noise. We called our kids in the car behind us right away and they too were in total amazement. It flew or glided horizontally unbelievably fast and when it reached the horizon you could see colors below it. I don&#39;t know how high it was, but if the IDS building were standing in the middle of the freeway, it would have smashed into it. What was it that we saw? and why didn&#39;t it hit the news? scary stuff<n>

As I watched the light stopped and started to go back up. I brought this to the attention of my friend who was standing on his front porch. He and I both watched the object move in several different directions. It would move to the right , then back to the left. At times it would make zig-zag movements and appeared to go in circles. The movements were very fast.  I can&#39;t think of any known aircraft that is capable of the speed or the movements that this object was making.  We both tried to get a better look with binoculars, but we couldn&#39;t keep up with the movement. It appeared at times to turn to the side and when it did, it appeared to be two lights instead of one. The object appeared to pulsate, not blink on and off.  After leaving the house I stopped and lined up my sight with a stationary object (a power line pole) just to be sure that it wasn&#39;t my eyes causing the object to appear to move.  The object continued the erratic movements until I finally lost sight of it about twenty minutes after first sighting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I approached the building where I work, I noticed an object that looked as though it were hovering in the sky. At first it looked like how a planet might look if it were too close to the earth. Then I noticed it was kind of trianglular in shape with the edges rounded off. Also, it had a greenish-white glow to it. It seemed to get bigger and that made it look like it was getting closer. I thought to myself, &#34;Oh it must be a jet airplane approaching. In a minute I&#39;ll see taxi lights as it gets closer&#34;. My interest was lost right then. I turned my attention to a coworker who was walking accross the parking lot to enter the building through the front doors. Watching her, it was impossible for me not to see what the object was doing, because she was in between the object and me. Just before she reached the front door to go in. The object shot down from the sky at an incredible speed. I thought it was going to crash right into the ground, but right before it got to the treeline, it shot forth at 45 degree angle in the opposite direction and disapeared in the distance in the blink of an eye. The whole think happened so fast that I was completely taken by surprise. I remember that it was moving faster that any aircraft that I have ever seen in my life. It left green streaks accross the air as it fell then shot off. My coworker didn&#39;t even see it, because it wasn&#39;t directly above us. It was at a distance that would have put it over the freeway of where route 2 and route 140 meet (1/4 mile away) in Gardner. It was also a few hundred feet in the air. Another thing I noticed was that, during the whole incident, the object made absolutely no sound. This morning, I called the Gardner police and they said that no one had reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once was a flightline mechanic in the US Marine Corps. I&#39;ve been around every type of aircraft that you could imagine. In the past I&#39;ve taxied aircraft for many years, at night, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And one object several times the size of the other seven flying over 40,000 feet from the groud.  The seven objects where extremely high, if I had to gest it must be flying at least twice the high of the sigle object,  The simgle object was flying at a very slow speed and the other seven objects where flying at the same speed as the single object in  a uniform pattern.  The direction of all the objects where flying from south west to a north west direction from the observer.  Ther was a commercial airplane flying at about 10,000 feet from the big object flying from east to west direction<n>

At approximately 10pm, I went outside for a cigarette break. It was a particularly clear night with not a breath of wind and the stars were out in force. Whilst studying the night sky to my west, I could not help but notice a fast moving object heading in my direction (east), flying at a guestimated height of 10,000ft. It passed overhead and was gone in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observations I made that struck me as being odd (in no particular order) were;  the circular shape of the object the &#34;reddish&#34; colour and glow associated with the object the lack of vapour trails no flashing lights no sound whatsoever the speed at which the object was traveling (it was immense even by a modern jet fighters standards!)

After it passed they felt this big gust of wind where there had been calm before it. The kids ages 6,8,10,&amp;11 were on the patio in the dark playing when they saw it. They all came in the house screaming telling us what they had seen and I stepped outside the house and felt the wind. I am their grandmother and I made them all sit down and sit so they couldn&#39;t see each other and had them draw on a piece of paper what they had seen before they had a chance to talk it over between them. Their drawings were eerily similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then witnessed more lights going north<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 people in our party traveling to our a home in conway nh. we were in 2 separte cars 2 in each car.We just paid at the last toll in rochester nh and were traveling north. I remember seeing the ten rod road sign(driving and all it all meshes together) but shortly after all these cars in front of me started braking for no apparent reason. I looked over to my left and noticed a craft hovering over a mountain and it had 10-12 lights and it was cigar shape it was like seeing the biggest jet hanging in the air and not moving. I was driving so I had to watch the road and couldn&#39;t concentrate on the object. I pointed to object to my brother driving in the car behind me. But later he said he nocticed me point but couldn&#39;t see anything but trees. He was in a car and I was in a suv. My brother and mother said there Radar detector(it was an old detector) was going crazy the whole way up and my brother made the comment maybe it was a ufo.But in my truck I had a newer detector and mine was fine. The object was an hr and 15 min from our destination. along the way I saw 2 planes traveling northeast but they had fcc blinking lights. But then just as i was about 30 min from my location I noticed this object with lights scatered about the object go across the sky and the lights dim as it went to the point you could see it anymore.this was on my left side of my vehicle object was traveling northeast. Also I saw what looked like this bright light hovering over an open space right around the vacinity of Indian mound golf course on my right and it had white lights but again I couldn&#39;t concentrate cause I was driving. This all happened within an 1hr and 15 min on rte 16 in nh. The passenger( my Mother) in the car traveling with us noticed the 2&#39;nd phase of lights not the original sighting. My father who was driving with me noticed the lights but was more nervous about the road and said he would never travel with me again. Oh well how often to you see this much activity in the sky. I almost wish I could have pulled over and observe the whole time that way I could have made better head and tails with the whole thing. I know you need to eliminate any possible earthly explanations before you can say it was alien. But all I can say it got my attention and I hope someone will also put in a report cause there were a lot of cars on the road being ski season and all and being a friday night and all. Plus if the cars didn&#39;t brake I wouldn&#39;t have seen the 1st object in the 1st place. I&#39;m just putting in a report and hope others do to<n>

The object looked like a charcoaled grey ball floating across the sky.  It produced no sound.  I was shocked and ran to get my binoculars to get a closer look but when I returned the object was gone.  I ran outside and searched the sky in the front and back of my home and there was no sight of it and again, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Millstone, Ky.  A Large Black Object, oblong, with rounded corners, and no lights on or coming from the oblect.  A large rumbling, (slight vibration) sound coming from the object.  The night was very clear, and a sky full of stars.  Temp at 33 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was asleep, and a very large explosive sound awakened me.  I live in Coal mining country so I know by the sound that this was not a surface or underground mine explosion.  The sound was too different.  I went outside to see what had caused the noise, and I heard a new sound start.  A very loud, large rumbling noise made me look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound just started, it did not start low and get louder, the sound just started, very loud, and seemed to stay at the same level.  A very large, oblong object, seemed to be solid, no wavering around the edges like a cloud or smoke. Shape stayed constant. The sky was full of stars, and that is the only way I could determine the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their was no light coming from the object, and none of the outside light reflected off the object.  I tried to get a picture, but the object was so dark, all of the pictures turned out black.  It seemed to be just a little ways above the hill tops, but with the object so dark, an exact height can&#39;t be determined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can estimate the length to be about 270 feet, approximate based on the width of the hills in front and in back of my house.  Width of the object, is a little harder, it seemed to be about 1/3 width of the object as compared to the length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very slowly, and I watched for about 3 minutes.  The sound continued all the time the object was in sight, then the object was not there, and the sound stopped.  There was an object, and then it was just gone.  No take off, not waving lights, no anything.  The object just was not there.  Since is was so dark, I could not tell if the object accelerated upwards, or even if the object moved sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any ideas as too what this was are very welcomed.<n>

It streaked across the sky, at a 45 degree trajectory. It was already low when it came into view and disappeared over some trees, probably about 2 to 3 kilometres away, moving further away. The were no distinguishing features to the object. It was moving too fast to be man-made. I would have said that it was a meteor, apart from the fact that it was glowing green.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As far as i cold see it was one craft but i may be wrong. There were four lights and two of them kept changing colours. They span around in a circle together whilst flying and it was all going so fast. It made a kind of &#34;wooooooooo&#34; noise as it went of. I only saw for about 10  seconds but i&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;ty a plane or anything as mundane as that.. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it might be someone setting off some kind of fireworks as it was very low, just above the tree line.  I tried to watch to see if anything else appeared, but trees and hills got in my way.  Approximately 10 minutes later I pulled into my drive way and saw more lights in the western sky.  Twice in about 10-30 second intervals there appeared to be an orange light with 2-3 smaller orange lights emitting from them then they would disappear.  As I got out of my car I could hear a very loud airplane, but didnt see one.  I know that sometimes in our area the military practices night manuvers with some kind of tracer lights, but I have never seen them before, so I dont know if this is what I saw or not.  For the past 3 nights I have heard very loud airplanes.  They sound larger and slower moving than the jets we see during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ilooked up into the night sky and saw what I first thought to be &#34;Kleig Lights&#34; making dancing patterns in the sky - but only in heavy clouds. As I continued walking I noticed that these four lights were moving a bit too erratically to be ordinary advertising lights. Throughout the night I kept going outside to find that these &#34;dancing lights&#34; had changed positions in the sky many times. Sometimes they were hovering right at tree level and other times they were way up overhead. At one point a low flying aircraft flew overhead and the lights disappeared briefly only to reappear down the roan and below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I gazed at them, I almost became mesmerized by the patterns they were making and my eyes were drawn to the meeting point when they would all suddenly dart or dive together. They appeared to change color slightly to light green, pink and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have absolutely no doubt that this was not a normal occurence. I ran in and got my room mate to come out to witness and she agreed that these lights were not from an airport or advertising display. Neither of us have ever seen anything like it in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved slowly above the clouds and had a slight wobble as it moved<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way home from work, Thursday, March 17, 2005. I noticed in the sky @ 1/2 mile from my car a black triangular looking craft coming towards my car. I was on Westheimer close to the Highway 6 intersection in Houston, Texas. I continued to watch it from my car but as it passed my car, I decided to turn my car around and find a nearby parking lot to park at so that I could get out of my car and continue to observe this object. It was a little cloudy but only a little. This object didn&#39;t seem to be going very fast, though. What was strange to me besides the triangular shape is that it seemed to have a slight wobble to it as it flew towards my car. Also, while other planes and helicopters in the air had lights on, this craft did not have lights. It almost looked as though it was hiding in the clouds because it seemed to stay in the clouds as it moved and would occasionally come out of the clouds. I would like to know if anyone else saw this object which was seen Thursday, March 17, 2005 near Westheimer and Highway 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!  ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

Many people witnessed.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43533.html|127|ndxe200503| Circling lights over Lafayette.  Grad from Purdue flight program here and these were NOT airplanes.  Many people witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to confirm a report in Lafayette that somebody else made for this date.  I even called it into the cops and they were receiving calls as well from others.  I was driving in my car on US Hwy 52 between West Lafayette and Lafayette.  To the Northeast, I saw one bright orange light moving through the air... too fast for an airplane and no strobes so I was instantly interested.  Then I saw a second one light up right behind it followed by a 3rd, 4th, and 5th.  They ascended and the light went out, but I could see the dark craft circling around and light up again when it came to the bottom part of the circle.  They did this for about 3 cycles and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a graduate from Purdue University from the flight program, so I know what planes look like.  THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT FROM THIS WORLD... unless it was some secret government aircraft, but the military operations area is NOT near either city and the bases around here are not known for producing abnormal activity.  I am absolutely convinced it was some kind of alien craft and have reported it to the student newspaper and the local newspaper and am still waiting for a response.  I will write letters to the editors to try to get others to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told all of my friends about this and most did not believe me.  One who didn&#39;t believe me was at work Sunday when a co-worker brought up how she saw UFOs around 10PM on the same night and he was stunned.  I am convinced there were MANY who saw this.  The woman who told him about her sighting said she saw all of the lights merge together and disappear.  The other witnesses listed were in the car behind me and pointing toward the UFO&#39;s.  Please watch the local papers!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Supplemental report:  I talked with the Tippecanoe County Police tonight and the officer stated that they have confirmation that the military was dropping flares last night.  The objects I saw were to the Northeast, which is in the direction of the Military Operations Area (MOA) for Grissom AFB.  I do not believe they have fast, highly maneuverable aircraft station at that base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer also stated that it was unusual that the AFB did not announce any flares or military operations to the FAA.  The area of the sighting would be in control of Chicago Center, which the officer said did not see anything on radar.  The officer stated that the flight controller in chicago was really mad because he saw nothing on their radar and was not notified.  I believe I estimated that the objects were around 5 or 6 thousand feet.  From my flight experience, I know center will not see objects below about 6,000 feet.  The officer assured me that the AFB had the aircraft on radar and it was their planes.  The bottom line is that nobody knew of any military operations beforehand, which makes the event more interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other problem with the flare excuse is that the lights did not last long.  Also, I would estimate the lights were only lit for 5 seconds at a time and I believe flares should last longer.  The biggest problem with the flare excuse is that all of the lights started at the exact same point in the sky.  The only way the flares could start at the same point is if the airplane is flying directly toward or away from me.  If that was the case, the flares should not have had such lateral movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were also at a constant speed and did not descend much or slow down as you would expect.  Assuming the aircraft stayed in the MOA, the speed of the lights should have been much slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my professional opinion as a graduate of the Purdue flight program, the lights originated from an aircraft beyond the capabilities of modern fighter jets that the public is made aware of.  Due to the silence and disappearance of the craft (which I could see when the lights turned off during the circling maneuver), I tend to think it may be extraterrestrial, but then again, I didn&#39;t see it enter orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told all of my friends about what I saw and none of them witnessed the event, however one of my friends who dismissed my claim was at work when a co-worker started talking about UFOs that she saw.  She stated that at the end, the orangish lights all came together and then disappeared.  I will be trying to get more info ASAP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

One set of lights was ahead of the other two. The other two sets were behind and a few feet apart of each other. The set to my right was just a little higher than the set to the left. All I saw were lights. I could not make out any type of shape that may have been attached to the lights. I saw them when I was around one maybe two miles away. They were to the right. As I got closer I realized that they were not towers of any kind. They were too low and oddley shaped to be towers. When I was abreast of them and a little in front of them, I pulled to side of the road and looked at them, trying to figure out what I was looking at. After just a few seconds, the set in the front started to move slowly forward. When I saw movement I pulled back onto the road and continued straight ahead (the same direction I was traveling to begin with) The lights went in the direction in front of them which was opposite to direction I was heading in. After pulling back onto the road, I looked into my rearveiw window, and the lights were gone. No reflection of lights remained,all I saw was darkness. After a couple of seconds, I reached a stop sign and made a U-turn and went back. There was nothing there. No lights anywhere. I went back tonight and again, no lights. I checked there today during full daylight and saw nothing that could be mistaken for lights seen at night. Before I sat down to write this, I went again. Remember, I saw the lights at least a mile before I pulled up beside them. No lights in the sky anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

On 03/16 around 6:36pm I was going out to my car to put some dishes in it to take to my grandmother&#39;s house.  Well, I had parked on the side of the road in front of my house so my wife could get out of the driveway earlier and when I was at my car I heard an airplane above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see it, and it was pretty close due to me living not far from the Lew/Aub airport.  I was checking out the lights on the plane and thinking to myself how cool would it be to see a UFO that close with the lights and all. I have a prior interest in the subject.  No sooner than that, I looked to my left (while still gazing up) and I saw a bright white light traveling from left to right far off in the distance but above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was and when I realized that there were no blinking lights, I went into my house and grabbed my video cam and got about 20 seconds of footage before it disappeared. It didn&#39;t zigzag at all, just a straight path across the horizon.  It moves behind some trees and then disappears.  The sky was clear except for a haze around the horizon so I think it just may have moved into the haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My plans that night were to go to my grandmothers first and then to church for worship team practice and then to my friend&#39;s house to hang out with some buddies one of who is a huge UFO buff. Since I know he loves this stuff, I brought my cam in the car with me to show him the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I get to my grandmothers and pull over to the side of her building on Lincoln Street in Lewiston and before I got out of the car I called my friend on my cell to tell him what I got.  Two seconds later as I&#39;m talking to him, I see the light again! Still going in the same path (left to right). I told my friend that I would call him back and threw my phone down and grabbed the camera again and caught some more footage before it disappeared behind a building.  This time was much quicker but clearer than the first.  I had zoomed in too much on the first and totally distorted part of the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really have no idea what it was but I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was a solid bright white light only, no flashing lights or colored ones.  I called Lifeflight the next day to see if maybe their copter was in the air and they said that it was around 7pm but they said the only lights they use are landing lights and only when they are landing. Lifeflight is an emergency service for our local hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was did not make a sound as far as I could tell. It was too far away when I shot the vid at my house and when I shot the vid at my grandmother&#39;s there was too much traffic driving by to here much of anything other than the cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some more research in the next few weeks and a friend of mine got me in touch with a local newspaper reporter.  I brought the video to him and he wrote up an article about it and tied it in with a recent visit he took to Nevada and Area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can read the article by following this link:  http://www.sunjournal.com/search/story.php?ID=102716<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also checked with the local drug enforcement agency and unofficially they stated that they did not have a search copter in the air on that night but officially they would not confirm nor deny that they did.  He also checked with the local airport manager and they said that he checked his flight logs and helped the reporter rule out other possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine mentioned the possibility of it being an iridium flare so we checked into that and found out that there was one in the area on the night in question but the altitude was too high and flares do not last as long as the light I videotaped and are of a different shape.  Mine was totally round and white and very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tape was taken in a Hi-8mm format.  I have made only one copy on VHS and that was given to the reporter.  My video camera is a Sony CCD-TRV68 which has an s-video out so I will try to have a friend of mine transfer the video into a digital format on his PC in the near future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be more than happy to provide the original for analysis if needed, as long as it can be returned to me because it has one of a kind footage of other family events on it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will contact the witness, and invite him to submit a copy of the tape for our examination.  We will confirm whether the date was March 16, or April 16.  PD))<n>

Tower response we have nothing and see nothing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I check our search radar ASR-11 aka the REAL big radar you see in movies like pushing tin etc basically anything bigger than a moped and above 100ft msl it picks up... NADDA no target no iff (identify friend or foe or squak im notgoing into detail but those who know will go ok no secondary)  now this same par we have is able to pick up some other &#34;Stealth&#34; a/c ive seen it first hand so im freaked out as the &#34;target&#34; got to the approach end of the runway stopped and shot up!!!!!  The reason this is crazy is again the par is anolog... no digital target anomlies are gonna happen it painted something big and umm sorry birds dont stay on course and glidepath for 10 miles!!!!  not done yet .... so all 4 people in radar who see this are like wtf .. 15 minutes later call form the tower.. a EF2000 is inbound ??? huh we never get those.. and he wants to shoot a PAR to the same runway? WHA? we have a 10,000 ft ceiling and no vis problems? and its 1 in the afternoon... so the ef checks in we vecotr him for the approach prior to turning him to final the pilot says thanks for the approach i quip well at least you asked! :).. no reply lol  well we tracked mr ef2k he did his approach climed to 10k and took off at 340knts for the atlantic went there nice and leve 10k over the atlantic then all of a sudden turned north and shot off at well lets just say not legal speeds towards sevillia to the north just west of there he starts climbing and decending at a rate that made me quesy ( i dont envy the approach controller tryin to keep traffic out of his way...<n> <n><n> <n><n> here is the flipside out over the ocean we have warning areas setup for the military guys to go play around why the feck would he fly level at 10k over WATER and then go all roller coaster tycoon over residential areas and in between commercial traffic? trust me as an air traffic controller that was the strangest thing ive ever seen...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In order to get to the beach you have to cross a lagoon by boat. Since we arrived at around 11:00 PM there were obviously no more boats so we knew we&#39;d have to wait until the morning to go across.  The lagoon is not that big.  I parked my car in front of the lagoon and sat with my friend watching the sky.  We&#39;d been driving for several hours, so we were kind of tired.  Suddenly a huge, bright pink/orange colored round object departed from the ocean, and went into the sky.  If I had been alone, I would have thought I was hallucinating but my friend saw the same thing.  We were both speechless as we saw this object take off into the sky.  Instead of disappearing into the sky, it hovered about the ocean for several minutes.  The radiating colors of this craft were unforgettable.  When it was still, the light that it emitted would shine brighter.  But when it moved it would become more dim.  Finally it disappeared.  My friend and I had shared a strange moment that to this day, few people believe.  We slept in the car that night.  The next morning when we went across, we asked several people who lived and worked on the beach if they had ever seen something similar.  Apparently it is something very common to that area.  Everyone we talked to had seen these things, and it seems to be something very common.  If someone ever wants to see one of these, I recommend going to this same beach and watching the sky.  It has been happening regularly for years and I imagine it will probably continue to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He seen one back in the early 70&#39;s...quite different from this one.  Anyway, all of the sudden this bright light appears in the sky right in front of us and then it bursts into 4 or 5 other lights in a line then dissappeared so quickly.  He was yelling...what the H**l was that?...then it happened again.  He pulled over and as I was looking out my window, again, a bright light bursting into other lights.  I yelled....go....go ....from that point on all we could see was two lights in the sky off in the distance and we watched them till they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh my, Ive always wanted to see something...Ive always been fascinated by the prospect of UFO&#39;s.

They were very low, and compared to a star in the sky, very large.  They made absolutely no sound.  They flew across the sky together and then made a very sharp turn towards each other - I thought they were going to collide.  They crossed paths and then vanished.

Exactly the same. Same dark object, same number of salmon/orange yellow colored lights, same no lights in back, same turn and disappearing act.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night early last spring I stepped outside about 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening to look at the sky. Some storm clouds were passing through and the tail end of a fast-moving weather system was just overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my front yard I looked east and could see the dull reflection of my small town on the low moving clouds to the east.  Just then, as if travelling in this weather system, the triangular object appeared to descend from the fast-moving clouds and travelling in the same direction, as if escorting the weather system. The craft descended rapidly in north-to-south direction, then turned east, in the direction of the weather movement, at which time it disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious to know if others had seen the object, I called the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office and reported it. I&#39;m not certain of the date, but if the Sheriff Dept. keeps a log, I could trace back the exact date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My point is, the object I saw was exactly like the one on your webpage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Did not hear any engine until it had passed over and was still above us.  The sound was low, quite and did not sound like more than one vehicle.  The vehicle was pretty low.  The lights were very bright and big.  We all agree that it looked like a check mark shape.  The right side was longer than the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/15/05 19:00|Grand Junction|CO|Other|20 mins.|silver elongated clam shaped craft over grand junction, colorado|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63156.html|147|ndxe200503| silver elongated clam shaped craft over grand junction, colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 03/15/05 my friend Debbi and I were walking from her house to my house next door. Grand Junction, Colorado has a busy airport with lots of jet traffic so seeing aircraft is a very common occurrence. As we walked the short distance to my house I spotted a very unusual craft flying and pointed it out to Debbi. This craft appeared to be approximately 140 ft. long, approximately 50 feet wide and nearly 40 feet thick. The craft had no lights, markings and no control surfaces. It was silver on the top and sides and appeared to be flying at approximately 150 m.p.h. as it approached our location. The craft approached our general location and gradually slowed to a hover. We had to look up to see the object at about 65 degrees above our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best I can estimate, the object was perhaps a quarter of a mile (south) from our location and stopped flying and began to hover about half a mile (east) from our location at perhaps 8,000 foot level. Grand Junction is approximately 4600 above sea level and is surrounded by mountains that reach the 10,000 foot level 12 miles to the east. Craft was flying from west to east in direction. The craft made no noise at any time during flight or hover. The weather was clear and had scattered puffy cumulus clouds from 8-11 thousand foot level. Air traffic was light on that day. Craft was between the airport and the usual traffic pattern for the airport. No planes approached the craft or airport during observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total observation time was perhaps 20 minutes. At first we watched the craft fly toward our location then after passing our location it slowed to a stop and began to hover. After a couple minutes I went inside and obtained a pair of binoculars to see the craft better. It was easy to see with the naked eye but since I could not see markings, lights or control surfaces I was sure binocular would show some kind of control surfaces. After I brought the binoculars back outside I used them to see the craft with lots of detail. The binoculars were easily able to see lots of detail and confirmed that the craft was slowly rocking side to side; the craft had no control surfaces on the back or sides, no visible vent holes or windows or light fixtures. No markings of any kind. The texture of the crafts skin appeared to be similar to silver metal but no rivets or visible joints. It had a distinct division from top to bottom and the underside was shadowed from sunlight with a line half way between top and bottom with sharp edge in the middle of the craft running from front to back. The back was wider than the front but was very similar to the front of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have about 200 hours as a student pilot but have not been active in aviation for nearly 10 years but love aircraft; this was no aircraft I have ever seen before. I am retired from California state service as a psychiatric technician and currently work part time for the state of Colorado in the same capacity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My assumption is and was that this must have been some kind of experimental unmanned craft; perhaps a small electric powered gas filled craft. I was unable to understand how the craft flew with no noise and the only way it could hover without noise was if it was filled with gas. It was not a conventional design because the power source for flight had to be inside the craft but there were no signs of vents or rudders or elevators. A rotating jet of some kind inside the craft with vents that close up seemed the only possibility to me based on my limited knowledge of lighter than air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no memory of seeing the aircraft power it self after reaching our location and after some twenty minutes the clouds obscured our view of the aircraft. A general description of the craft would be a streamlined, smooth surface elongated clam shape. Stopping a craft near the approach pattern of an airport, behind a cloud seemed very foolish to me at the time. No reports heard of that or other sightings. Reluctant to mention the sighting because have no reason to believe that it was other than a man made experiment craft, but just not sure what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

So my attention was suddenly very focused. I stood there and watched what looked like a solid contrail slowly move from the northeast to the west (I think anyway, but I am not the best at direction, I use the sun to judge). I also noticed that despite the sunny day, and the position of the sun, I couldn&#39;t see a tiny shiny point at the head of the &#34;contrail&#34; like there would normally be, as the sun reflects off of the metal of a plane, because there was no plane, and what I was looking at, along with about 6 others now, was something other than a plane, or its contrail..<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;A moving contrail; fixed in size, shape and consistency&#34;. so it was white, with a slightly transparent look to it and a blurred perimeter. I cannot judge the distance. after about 15 minutes it was out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/05 15:00|San Marcos|TX|Rectangle|30 minutes|two interrelated objects larger rectangle and rotating cube on one end changes shape, speed direction gas filled|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55719.html|149|ndxe200503| two interrelated objects larger rectangle and rotating cube on one end changes shape, speed direction gas filled<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subject: a couple of first hand incidents plus a family information exchange    First hand incident number 1  Spring 2005 husband and I were riding our bicycles on the access road of Interstate 35 between Wonder World Drive and McCarty Lane (we lived on McCarty Lane at the time) outside of San Marcos, Texas.  It was approximately early afternoon and the wind was really blowing very hard.  We were approaching Auto Outlet (a car dealership).  It was common practice for the car dealership to have balloons (this month I seem to recall single purple and yellow helium filled balloons) tied to the front posts and lot lighting fixtures.  Due to the velocity of the wind the balloons were straining against their ties and leaning towards the Auto Outlet buildings and away from I-35 in the direction of the wind.  I was right at the northernmost corner of the Auto Outlet property and my husband was approximately 4 bike lengths ahead of me (he is a faster stronger rider in a hard wind or just about anytime).  We were on the western side of I -35 on this access road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on our way home from a pleasant ride that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Auto Outlet property has a bill board, or it did then, on the McCarty side of the lot where south bond drivers on I-35 can read about their car dealership.  This bill board is about a standard large bill board size that businesses pay for ad space so highway driver&#39;s can read the signs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I look above the roof line of the Auto Outlet buildings and observed a very strange sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a rectangular, 3 D object floating slowly straight up above the buildings.  Next to that object was a 3 dimensional square cube object.  This object changed over time in appearance and navigational mode so I&#39;ll do my best to try to explain what I observed.  The larger object was the rectangular object.  From what I observed the side closest to me, the bottom, the back end and  the front end were a purple grey type of material that had no seam lines.  The object appeared to be filled with gas and the fabric covering the shell without seam lines did not undulate but kept a rigid straight line appearance on all edges and sides that I could observe while lifting slowly up at first.  On the end closest to the billboard side of the building there was a short distance to the cube, and there were no connecting ropes, guy lines etc.  The cube was rotating on a 360 degree pattern, always remaining at the same end of the rectangle.  The cube rotated that 360 degrees at a faster rotation rate than the lift rate of the two objects together.  The cube straight up lift rate was the same as the purple grey rectangle.   The cube appeared to have a purple bottom and alternating purple grey on one side, red on line side and yellow on one side and black on one side of the cube accounting for a 4 sided cube.  The cube like the rectangle had no seam lines, appeared to be of some kind of fabric, without seams, and kept the edges and sides perfectly straight and rigid there was no undulation in the fabric like a cloth baloon would be expected to have.  Also surprising there was no visible frame structure such as internal piping retaining the outer edges of either the cube or the rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects continued to slowly rise, I noticed as did my husband, that if these objects were filled with a bouyant gas, it sure did not move away from I-35 as the Auto Outlet yellow and purple lot balloons did.  The objects did not respond to the very gusy wind that day in terms of speed and direction.  The objects were going straight up slowly as though no wind were present at all!!  It was so gusty it was hard to ride the bikes sideways to the wind.  The winds slowed our speed.  It took a lot more effort to pedal against this kind of wind and move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very surprising to my husband and myself that no one on I-35 tried to pull over on the shoulder and stop and look at these two objects.  It was as though they did not see the objects as unusual or they had no frame of reference with which to relate to the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects did not make any sound at all as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the objects got above the height of the &#34;along the access road power lines&#34;, they changed configuration.  The purple grey rectangle shifted somehow as on an invisible axis and moved from horizontal view to an up-ended view and as it did so the cube moved with it, still rotating as it did so in relationship to the very same end of the rectangle.   The cube ended up above the straight ended up rectangle and continued its rotation at all times.  Remember please, there were no guys, no ropes, no attachments between the cube, the space between and the end of the rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once up-ended in a vertical arrangement, the purple grey fabric of the rectangle began to undulate like a catepillar&#39;s segmented body trying to move up a leave blowing in the wind.  Pockets of gas started to undulate upwards inside the rectangle towards the top end of the object.  As more gas was moving upwards, gas from below leaving the lower portion, caused the object to lose the rigid rectangular shape from the original lift, sinking in in that region and narrowing the formerly rectangular lower end section.  The top section closest to the cube was rounded now and the fabric was bulging out from the increased gas pockets inside.    The overall structure looked like it was climbing up not just floating up.  All this while the cube kept its perfect cube shape and continued rotating without attachment on the same end of the other object it always stayed in configuration with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued until the object was quite small and as high up as the air space normally traveled by a stunt plane pre-jet.  At that height, it appeared to resume the shape originally seen during the lift and turned the cube end west ward.  Originally the cube end was facing the south.  With the cube facing west I could only see the bottom of the purple rectangle and the back end of the original purple grey rectangular larger object.  At this point, the objects took off at a vastly increased speed, while not as fast as a jet air plane it was noticeably faster than any derrigle I have ever observed.  The rate was possibly faster than a private beechcraft plane going approximately 120 miles an hour or more.  My brother owns one and I have flown as a passenger in his plane before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move like this before, constructed like this before, change shape like this before, and my husband and I do not believe the objects were man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do believe it was some kind of  surveying unit or probe for close observation of the environment.  Something like a mobile environmental collector.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area is close to the Balcones fault line, the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, Canyon Lake area.  So there are geographic anomalies close by.  San Marcos River is entirely spring fed from the Aquifer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Close in calendar time, we read an article about the US Government considering budgeting funds for high flying spy derribles.  However, this was before that project was funded because the news story stated lobbying was going on to obtain support for a bill in Congress to fund the spy derrigibles.  Such spy derrigibles were to be extremely high altitude units.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects we saw flew close to the ground and in normal air space.  They simply moved as nothing else ever observed and were constructed in a unique way out of unique materials.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would appear from when we first saw the rectangular 3 D with rotating cube on one end that it had just lifted up from the lot behind the Auto Outlet and we had arrived at the frontage access road just as the slowly rising object topped over the top of the buildings.  We did not take pictures.  I do not know if my husband would consent to talking about this to anyone for fear of derision.  I want to protect my anonymity because I am a licensed state professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second first hand account  My husband and I were driving into Austin Texas on I-35 and observed two grey apparently gas filled tubular shapes, the length of a standard pick up truck undulating in movement floating very close to the ground but never touching the ground, down I-35 next to a concrete divider wall (units for use while road construction is in progress), between Onion Creek and Town Lake.  We both were amazed.   The objects paced our vehicle perfectly, we were going about 65 mph because traffic was heavey in broad day light.  The objects were directly in front of us and over to the driver&#39;s side closest to the concrete divider.  Then we watched in total amazement as one object went straight throught the concrete divider having turned with the movement of an eel towards the  concrete divider it had been traveling next to.  The other object  undulated sideways and up and over the top of the concrete divider unit and down the other side.  Both left our view at that point.  We both agreed they did not appear man made, had no seams.  These two units were grey gas filled like tubes that undulated like eels and/or worms,  were longer than a man is tall, and seemed to make decisional changes in direction and speed. They also appeared translucent, which the tow objects described in first hand account were definately not translucent at any time that we observed.  It was almost as if the grey tubes were life forms.  No eyes, no mouths, etc.   The skin on these two objects did not look like any kind of fabric but rather like a membrane.  The closest thing I can think of is imagine a picture of a cell under a microscope without the internal elements and cilia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not take pictures.  No camera on hand at the time.  I am not sure that my husband would agree to talk to anyone and I am a licensed state professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Family related experience  My California Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is now deceased) had a home on private land that adjoined the Tahoe National Forest.  This couple owns more than one home.  They had a hill top home with a sliding glass door and outside deck overlooking a forested valley towards Tahoe National Forest.  They get so many grazing acre rights inside the forest for having land adjoining the forest.  This is why they located there or so my mother has told me.  One night they were both sleeping with the curtains open where they could see out through their sliding glass doors as they feel asleep.  At the same moment they awoke to see a blinding white light fill their bedroom and the space outside the sliding glass door.  As if mesmerized they felt drawn to go outside on the deck to try to discern the shape of the object and make out what it was.  The object they told me later was huge and appeared to be round due to the light.  They never could see the defined edges of the object because the brightness of the light never diminished enough to make out the actual edges.  The object made no sound and drifted or floated towards the valley floor below them.  After a while it appeared to land and the lights went out.  When the lights went out, because they were out in the country there were no surrounding lights to reveal the ship.  In the morning they got up determined to attempt to travel to a road closest to where the ship landed and to hike on foot to try to find the landing sight and see if the ship was still there.  They wanted to know what was going on where the ship had landed.  When they got approximately where they would have to pull over on the shoulder of the road and hike to the site, they saw a man that looked exactly normal from a distance.  They drove right up to him, stopped and got out to speak to him.  The man was dress in a white shirt, white pants, white belt, white socks, white shoes, all in white.  His hair was soft and his face was unlined.  The man was normal height and had black hair, black eyes with undiscernable pupils from the color portion of the eyes, fair skin like a caucasian and normal looking features.  However the air there felt charged and something about this man did not feel right to my aunt and uncle.  At this time my aunt and uncle  were in their mid fifties.  The man appeared no older than his thirties.  He was lean and fit.   They asked this man if he had seen the bright light in the sky last night and if he was there looking for what had landed.  They asked him where his car was.  The man was in the middle of no where so to speak and there were no other people around, no animals in view, no bicycles in view, no motorized vehicles of any kind save my aunt and uncles car.  They asked him if he needed assistance or a ride somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man at first listened to their questions but said nothing.  When my aunt and uncle fell silent and stopped asking questions the man looked at them like he really meant business and told them that it would be in their best interest not to try to find the landing site, not to hike in the woods that day, not to stay in the area and that they should leave the area immediately.  They left feeling not at all comfortable with the situation.  Having driving less than a car length away my uncle said he stopped the car to look back towards the man to see if he had failed to observe anything else important.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  There was a distance of at least 100 feet or more between the road and the tree line of the forest and nothing man made or geologic for the man to hide behind.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  They said they never saw anything like this before or after this experience.  They told me they were certain the ship was a UFO and the man was not a human born on this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My aunt and uncle did not give me permission to release this information but they told it to me first hand.  They did not take any pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly the object came from the dark sea, size of a full moon, hazy, red-yellow,totally silent, circular ball, which flew at a breakneck speed accurately horizontal. I saw the object about 30-40 degree angle where I was sitting and then it disappeared after 2-3 seconds behind the hotel silhouette on the right side. Inside the ball there was 5 circular smaller yellow shining balls in V-shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment I was really very confused when thinking what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t ever believed in Ufos, but after that event I really look at the sky quite often. I cannot explain that phenomenon with my sense, because the object was totally evident, and not any kind of reflection or other delusion. I noticed it going through the light clouds and the colour of the object was changing little at that moment also. Against the clear sky the phenomena was seen totally clearly, although I could not see any visible framework, only big hazy circular shape and clear yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any manmade appliance cannot fly like that object without making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance and height I could`t estimate, but the phenomenon was huge in my eyes..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next night my daughter and my friend saw propaply just the same object with those lights, when it flew in the sky above their heads at night about the same time, when they were having time on the beach. They could`t hear any noise then either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were seven lights that were red, yellow and green.  I grabbed my digital camera from the nightstand and shot four pictures.  The first didn&#39;t come out as the flash was turned on.  The other three taken without the flash showed the lights.  After the last picture, I glanced down to the camera&#39;s preview screen the be sure the pictures were good, and when I looked up, the lights were gone, so I can&#39;t say if they moved or just went out.

Both of us were in different cars and driving to the same destination but on different routes.  I saw the light appear in the sky and move away quickly.  It was obscured by some trees and when I got past the trees, I lost site of it.  I called my friend to tell him and he saw the same thing.  A mile or so ahead, as I was turning my car on a different road, I saw the object again.  I was now traveling north while it moved east.  I saw it appear to vanish as it went off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is worth noting that I a few nights ago, while standing outside near this same location, I saw a light in the sky go off in one direction, then another light appear and travel in the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sound seemed to go away as I stepped into my front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could clearly see that one part of the object was spinning. I ran inside to get the digital camera, binoculars and the movie camera. The digital camera picked up the object not to clear, but when you hit the quick fix button , the shape becomes very distinct.

There was a loud roaring sound, unlike an airplane or jet. This caused me to look upward when I saw a strange shaped craft with bright non flashing lights, white or clear in color.  The image was very clear, it appeared very large and was hovering low in the western sky. My 11 yr old  daughter and I were the only ones that saw it, she was frightened because it was so close and clearly recognizable. I ran in and got the digital camera, movie camera and binoculars,. Through the binoculars you could see a portion of the object spinning. The pics didn&#39;t come out too clear but you can tell there was something unusual there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky directly overhead however was particularly clear and black, and the stars more visible than common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I saw it somewhat well, it was much more the movement that made me see it to start with, and follow it, otherwise it sort of blended in with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be moving at a constant height or altitude and faded into the sky within about 15 seconds as towards the north over town the sky wasn&#39;t as dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clapped my hands at 1 point to see if it perhaps it were a bird and if I could get any reaction from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not really estimate how high overhead except to say when I thought of it as a bird, it seemed to be maybe 100 to 200 feet overhead. When I thought of it as an aircraft it seemed to be like a low flying plane, maybe 1,000 feet or so overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But again it seemed way to big to be a bird, perhaps the reason the thought &#34;pterodactyl&#34; or prehistoric came to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made note of the constellations overhead, it seemed to have moved between or through the constellations Leo and the big Dipper, right to left as I faced East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cold out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated the time to be around 11:43 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up for a few minutes afterwards without stopping but saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then was looking up for much of the remainder of our time at the track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will make a few drawings of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Misc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An example of the way it blended into the sky, in the movie &#34;Close Encounters&#34;, when richard dryfuss&#39;s character is in the power company truck at the railroad crossing, as he sees the lights,and then it becomes silent, and he looks up directly overhead out his front windshield and you see the object moving in the sky, it reminded me of that somewhat, although this was moving faster and more steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thought came to mind, the government tested the stealth aircraft in this region back in the &#39;80s, and for a few years people in this region, particularly a county maybe 30 miles away, were reporting sightings of a ufo in the shape of a bat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was later learned this was the stealth aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a rural county airport, Mercer County airport&#34;, directly to the north in the direction this object was moving, maybe 6 or 7 miles as the crow flies from this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a south to north flight path for low flying aircraft for this airport. Aircraft approach the airport from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like such,, or something that I haven&#39;t been able to explain before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We (a group of atleast 12) were having a conversation about our game. All of a sudden the lights to the park turned off around 11:15pm. We stayed in the front entrance of the eastside of the park. Everything happened about 10-15 minutes after the lights to the park were turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were talking we were in a circle formation, the people that were facing south of the park were about 4-5 of us.  I yelled at the rest of the group and told them &#34;look&#34;. We saw about 6 lights came close to each other forming one solid light for about 5 seconds. Then in a matter of 5-10 seconds the lights moved away, trailing from each other in every direction (going up and down until they dissappeared). About 6 of us saw the same thing from the beginning. The rest of the group only saw when the lights were pulling apart in every direction. Very interesting!@!!!<n>
3/14/05 20:30|San Pedro|CA|Oval|5 - 6 seconds|multiple UFO sightings over San Pedro, CA.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42997.html|162|ndxe200503| multiple UFO sightings over San Pedro, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in San Pedro, CA around 3rd and Gaffey up from the harbor. Last night I was standing on my back porch which faces in a westerly direction. I was making a crude star chart to research and i.d. some of the constellations I could see. It was a beautiful, clear night with a few small clouds and a nice crescent moon. I was fairly intent on the sky trying to make sure I got the major stars in their proper position. The time is approximately 8:30 PM. As I’m looking up I see off to my right 2 glowing orbs moving directly together at what had to be a high rate of speed. They were moving in a very straight line in a generally south west direction side by side, closely together. Their path from horizon to horizon took maybe 4 to 5 seconds and then they, for a lack of better words, disappeared. The objects appeared to be glowing and were orange in color. If I had to guess at their size from my viewpoint, I’d say about the size of dimes, maybe more oval than perfectly round. I have an amateurs interest in astronomy and have done lots of star gazing over the years. I’ve seen meteor showers, comets, missile launches, etc. This was like none of those. After they passed, I was a little shaken, not quite sure what I had just seen. I walked back in and called a friend. I had to share this with someone! After I got off the phone I walked back out and was staring to the skies, a little stunned. After about 5 minutes (approx. 8:45) to my amazement I see another group of those glowing lights, this one containing a fairly tight cluster of maybe 5. These were higher and looked a lot smaller. These were moving  in a more westerly direction and their passage lasted maybe 3 seconds. These appeared to be flying higher or further away, so I couldn’t comment on shape, but they definitely had that same orange glow. I go back in call my friend again. I come back out and continue to stare at the skies in amazement. I guess about 10-15 minutes later, (around 9:00) I see one more cluster, maybe 6 or 7 of this time, moving at about the same position and direction as the second cluster. I continued to scan the sky for maybe 20 minutes more, but didn’t see anything else after that. I went in and made some notes and drew a picture of what I saw on the “star chart” I was making. I’ve been checking the news and the internet, hoping to find something that would explain this sighting, but haven’t seen anything other than similar sightings from different times in the past. I called the local police station to see if possibly there were other reports or info. they might have. They directed me to call NASA, which I haven’t done but may. I was really hoping there would be a logical explanation for this incident, but haven’t found it yet. Any help, comments or collaboration anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was also 2 white lights on the tip of the wings .  The lights were not blinking . The aircraft appeared to be heading in the direction on the Warwick state Airport .  But as it got closer it looked like  it was coming in for a landing too prematurely .<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got over us it was about maybe between 30 to 50 feet over the tree line s.  The weird thing was it  seemed to ahve slowed down in speed . My girlfriend said it wasnt moving .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving the car so it was hard to determine its true speed .

I observed an aircraft in the distance traveling on a course that I have observed many commercial aircraft to take in a Eastern to Western fashion.  My location was North of the objects flight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to screw the light housing back on and was anxious to get inside out of the cold.  As I stepped down from the task, I noticed that the object that I previously observed was making a wide turn and was approaching a northern direction.  The craft was approximately 1-2 miles south of my location.  What really grabbed my attention was the wingspan of the craft.  It was low to the ground and had a truely wide wingspan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise at this time, and the aircraft reminded me of a &#34;glider&#34;.  I stood fixated on the object and I was amazed as it passed over, directly over myself and the house.  I could see that there were no wings protruding outward at any part of the craft.  The craft was a continuous solid diamond shape, with the &#34;tail&#34; longer than the front.  It looked like a giant kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was noisy as it passed over, but I could not recognize what its propulsion system was.  It was not a &#34;prop&#34; sound, and it was not a &#34;turbine&#34; sound. The object had three dim white circular lights 3/4 to the rear.  There was a bright &#34;headlight&#34; or &#34;searchlight&#34; on the front tip, red and blue beacons on the &#34;sides&#34;, and a blinking white beacon on the &#34;tail&#34;.  As the craft passed over, I ran into the house to get my girlfriend and have her take a look.  By the time we were back outside,(30 seconds) the craft was on the N.W. horizon and looked like a conventional aircraft.  My assumption of my sighting was a secret military craft or extraterrestrial.<n>

The object had a slight purple color to it.  I would not have paid much attention to it, except that it was so bright and seemed to be falling/moving.  Perhaps more accurately, it appeared to be moving towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This naturally made me think that it was an airplane.  However, I saw no red lights and the movement of the object was unlike that of any airplane.  The object would move a bit, then stop, and then would seem to move a bit more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

I kept my eye on it as I drove because I drive this route every night and had never seen this light before.  The light was no longer in view when I drove through the town. However, there was a craft hovering over the road at about the level of the tree tops.  I saw a blue light on the left and a red one on the right.  As I passed underneath I got the impression of a dark fusilage.  I immediately pulled into a parking lot and turned the car to watch.  From this angle I saw three lights.  A white light on each end and a red light in between and slightly above the other two.  The craft glided off.  I believe it realized that I was watching because it had been completely motionless as I approached and drove underneath it.  It did not appear to be a large craft.  Perhaps only about ten to fifteen feet across.  I did not hear an engine but my windows were up and the radio and heater were on in my car.  To be honest, if it hadn&#39;t been for the strange white light, I would have assumed it was a remote controlled toy.  Also Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne are only a few minutes away by air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This hotel is located on Queen Anne Hill, just south of the Aurora bridge.  At approximately 7:45pm, our computer, Xerox machine, and several lights in the lobby all seemed to blink and then began to hum for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being the only employee on the premises, I was worried that the hotel might be in the middle of an electrical outage.  I looked at the clock on the wall, which read 7:45, grabbed a flashlight, and headed towards our parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once outside, I found that our parking lot was completely dark.  Four of our exterior lights, and one street light, were all out.  I then walked to the sidewalk which runs along the east side of Aurora avenue and looked north.  Several street lights, including those at the corner of Aurora and Halladay avenue, were out, along with several near the Canlis restaurant nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was walking towards a utility room to search for the circuit breaker the lights suddenly came back on again, they were out for a total of three minutes.  It should be noted that the four exterior lights which went out are not activated by sensor, they are turned on by timers at the same time each night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not have been bothered by this occurrence until later when I heard on KIRO radio that some sort of object had passed over the Pacific Northwest at the same time (7:45pm).  I also heard from the radio that a variety of other electrical problems occurred in the Queen Anne, Fremont, and Ballard areas of Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a very strange feeling about the entire episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be both objective in his description of the events, and quite credible.  Given that the presumed meteor was at least 200 miles to the south of Seattle, we doubt that its presence could have anything to do with the power failure here.  No power failures in Oregon have been reported to NUFORC, as of the date of this writing.  PD))<n>

(guessing that hight, because there was a plane on the horizont that was barely visable) There wasn´t any noise, (the object was to far away anyways) and the object didn´t leave any contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imo it was travelling at a relativly high speed. it crossed the horizont in the 2-3 minutes we were watching, a plane (in my opinion) takes about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The video is not very helpful in establishing what the object might be.  It moves in and out of the frame of the camera frame, and it is very small, approximately the perceived size of a jet airliner overhead at cruise altitude.  We do not know what the object is.

It was coming from the north-west and looked to be on landing approach at the Ashland airport.  As the plane passed overhead I noticed an odd spherical object much higher in the sky. The object was chrome and looked like a bright star-though it was noon on a nearly cloudless day. The object seemed to &#34;fidget&#34; in the sky moving *slightly* in random directions. At first I thought this was simply the movement of a band of sirus clouds above it but when I lined up the clouds with a stationary treebranch above me the movement did not correspond. The size of the object is difficult to discern given I have no idea how high it was. After watching a jet aircraft fly over later I would say the object was about twice the size of a jet flying at 42,000ft. I left to get binoculars after watching it for about three minutes. The object was gone after I returned about five minutes later. I would stress that I never would have noticed this object had the plane not drawn my attention. The plane flew directly over head, bisecting my line of sight between myself and the object. Also, the object didn&#39;t appear odd to me until I ran out of explainations for what it could be. I took several digital pictures of the object from my camera phone; though I havn&#39;t bothered to look at them as the resolution is very poor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not registering that it was something like i have never seen before.  He laughed and then stopped and looked confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved fairly slow but slower than an airplane or helicopter at this height.  It was heading over the trees to the right of us with 2 big white lights.  Not regular sized lights but lights so big that they do not exist on this earth.  It headed over the road and stopped to the left in the sky no more than a 1000 ft. high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It  completely stopped moving when we stopped to check it out.  When we completely stopped the bright white lights tured into two red lights with a yellow light in the middle.  It was too dark to see because the light just overpowed the view of any object behind it.  After ten secods it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
3/11/05 21:30|Des Moines|IA|Disk|3 minutes (maybe)|Two objects leading a third, or was the two  objects being followed ?|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42957.html|210|ndxe200503| Two objects leading a third, or was the two  objects being followed ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ( I am in my 50’s ), and at approximately 9:15 p.m. CST on Friday, March 11th 2005, I took my dog out into our back yard. It was a very clear night and the stars were bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 10-15 minutes had passed by and I looked up at the sky just to gaze at all the stars.  Then something caught my eye.  Coming from the East was a pair of objects that looked about as bright as a star and traveling side by side and maybe 100-200 yards across from each other.  Both were a steady white color and traveling at what seemed like a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, behind them, and maybe at a slightly lower altitude, was also another object.  It almost looked as if the front two objects were leading the back object, or the back object was following the front two. I could not see a shape or anything other than the white lights of the first two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The back object had what looked like three colors that rotated and they appeared to be towards the bottom. It had red on the starboard side, white in the center, and blue on the port side.  These lights were all about the same intensity as far as brightness. To me, it reminded me of a toadstool. That is, it looked like a disc on top and then like a short stem in the center and that is the area which the lights appeared to be coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched these three objects approaching the Des Moines area, the two white objects traveling together made a gradual turn and took a new heading of SSW.  As they made the turn, I could see stars in between them so this seemed to rule out the idea of them as one large object. No contrails could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object with the rotating lights continued on its east to west path and as it passed over head I did not see any lights, but once it passed over, I could once again see these rotating colors.  The first time I saw it I was going to dismiss it as a jet that maybe had its landing lights on, because that would explain the white light in the middle. But on planes, the lights are apart and you see a black gap between them.  These lights appeared to be side by side and reminded me of the lights on top of a police car, only larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time was noise ever heard.  Between the time I first spotted these objects until the time they passed out of sight was probably 3 minutes.<n>

The exact day was the second Friday in March of this year(no calendar handy). These craft may have been military technology. The witness in this incident is the same person with me in the 08-31-05 Kentfield report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend were sitting above Pantoll in Muir Woods on Mt. Tam. We had noticed high airline traffic during dusk with jets flying at 10,000 and 30,000ft range traveling north to south which is typical. Two crafts were observed exactly fifteen minutes apart before complete darkness. The first craft was definitely a military jet flying at approximately 60,000 to 70,000 ft leaveing contrails the jet was very quiet but an engine still could be heard and it was painted black. Fifteen minutes later a glowing orange disc was seen on the same exact path as the military jet and was moving at around the same speed which could only be estimated at 2,500 to 3,500 mph. I thought it could have been a test run of the SR-71 and our captured redesigned alien technology at work. This orange craft was slighty higher in altitude and was noiseless and stayed the same color at all different angles and was observed for about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The craft from the 08-31-05 report was traveling upwards from the ocean and was white/yellow/red verses this craft that was on the same military route and glowing more orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The craft from 03-97 was in the upper atmosphere and was traveling north to south along the coast but it was stopping and starting over and over. This craft changed from black(cool to orange to red to white(high speed) and then back to black when it would stop. It did this maybe 20 or 30 times and also had about 30 to 45 seconds of air time before disappearing verses a jet liner that averages 3 to 4 minutes to traverse the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was going from east to west, which even my husband thought was strange.  We both watched it from our front porch for about five minutes, until it dissappeared.  This was enough time for me to see the shape, a wide cylinder, along with the color in the lights-we noticed white, red, yellow and blue-which spanned the width of the object.  It appearred to fly erratically, in a &#39;zig-zag&#39; pattern, as my husband stated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was almost gone we heard a loud noise, similar to a plane, but much bigger, and too high and too late to be a plane.

It was unusual at the least. I&#39;ve been riddiculed at work all day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last nite (03/10/2005)at approximately 11:30 pm. I was on our front porch having a cigarette with my girlfriend. Then I noticed a small bright orange glowing light in the sky. It started to get bigger and bigger. Then it stopped in the sky. And slowly moved towards lake superior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I aksed my girlfriend if she can see it. She just spat out it&#39;s probally a helicopter. I told her I grew up as son of a loadmaster in the air force. And that is no helicopter. It had a orange/red glow on the bottom like molten steel. In the middle section it had pulsating lights of different colors. It moved extremely slow towards lake superior, then hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it hovered the blinking lights got really fast and colorful. Then it slowly decended to the lake and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No Sound. I was In the navy for 4 years on an aircraft carrier. That was not any aircraft that I know of. I don&#39;t know if anyone else has seen or reported this. But I know We could not of been the only ones to see it. The orage/red bottom side of it was really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s till last nite. I&#39;m still trying to believe what I saw. I can draw a picture of the craft and how it looked.<n>

Drawing attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a object in the evening sky about 20 degrees above the western horizon.  It seemed to be stationary for quite some time. I gave the object notice because with naked eye it seemed to display a combination of red, blue, and white lights.  I got out my 8x30 binoculars and viewed the object.  I could not determine the distance of the object, but I may guess it to be 4 to 5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The binoculars were not bringing in the detail so I got out a inexpensive telescope from Costco and focused onto the object.  At first when the object came into focus I thought something was wrong with the telescope and I checked the lens and then turned it onto a star.  The star seemed normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a 3/4 spherical framework.  Almost like the infamous Death Star in the movie Star Wars, except it had no skin just the framework lines and what appeared to be black sky in between the framework. After viewing it for several minutes I asked my wife to take a look.  I didn&#39;t tell her what I saw.  I just asked her to take a look and tell me what she saw.  She saw the same object.  Then I asked my 10 year old daughter to take a look and she saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing about this object is with the naked eye or field glasses the observer could only see the red, blue, and white lights and viewing the object through the telescope the observer could only see the framework with no colored lights visiable. What was that all about?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The location is near Latham Circle, and between Route 9 and interstate 87. The time was almost exactly 8:10 PM, as I was just about to attend an 8:15 meeting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a fair amount of light pollution in the area, but the night was very clear and I had good visibility of the stars.  For example, I had full visability of the Big Dipper.  I am an avid sky watcher, and am accustomed to observing airplane traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing approximately East NorthEast. From my position, I was facing in the direction of the Hudson river, which was about 4 miles to the east, but out of my line of sight. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement above and I looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At an approximate altitude of between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, I saw a black diamond shape lit at each corner with a dim orange light. Specifically, one each of these four dim lights marked each point of the diamond. I will call these lights &#34;corner lights.&#34; The lkights did not blink or flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle blocked the stars behind it as it passed with absolute silence, as best I could hear. Bear in mind that the area was fairly noise polluted. I was lucky to see it, as the entire presentation, while flatly unmistakable, was quite subtle. Neverheless, it was HUGE. I would say that it was a couple of hundred yards long and a hundred yards wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gliding to the North at a constant speed (probably about 100 MPH), and I believe that it was roughly following the Hudson river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This next part is very interesting. There was a fifth, and possibly sixth light of the same size and color weaving between two of the leading corner lights.  This more rapidly moving light spun apparently random circles and figure eights around the leading (northern) corner light and the around the western corner light. I have never seen anything manmade move with such speed and maneuverability in the sky as did this fifth light. All of the lights moved ahead together as a unified group, notwithstanding that there was internal movement within the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, and as the vehicle drew away from my position, all of the lights drew together into a tighter cluster, and then a very tight cluster, and eventually a single point of light that I lost among the stars and the light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pulling together of the lights was not merely a function of increasing distance from my vantage point. I happened more quicly than that. A truly amazing, and awe inspiring experience. Please feel free to e-mail me if you would like further information.<n>

He asked me it if was an airplane. I watched it for a few seconds to be sure that it wasn&#39;t and told him no. I had he watch it while I got the 2 sets of binoculars out of my car and handed one to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched it as is droped small orange lights down out of the bottom of it at least twice. All the time the light would get real bright then a few seconds later it would be so dim as to make it hard to see it with out aid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it with unaided eyes it slowly moved in almost a u turn towards Boise Idaho witch is to the southeast of where I live.

Much too low to be a satelite. I had my girlfriend grab the binoculars. I could see no navgational lights on the craft. When I first spotted the object it was directly South of our house. When it got to about 15 degrees above the horizon, from my vantage point, it disappeared, as it entered the shadow of the earth. So it was reflecting light from the sun and was very shiny.

The sky was calm, no motor or engine sounds were present, and the evening was very still.  It is not clear to me what this was, it is clear to me what it was not.  It was not a bird.

I would estimate this object was 50-60 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be a bright star, except that the weather is sunny today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was blue and bright, so it did not make sense to me that this was a star.  I thought it could be an airplane, except it was not moving.  I watched the object for about 10 minutes to see if it moved (using a nearby pine tree as a gauge), and it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had attracted the attention of my 8-year-old sons, one of whom also spotted the object once I pointed it out.  While he watched it, I went into the house to get my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be a spherical shape and I could tell it was either white or metallic - it was very reflective.  I could not see any other details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the object had started to drift to the north or northeast.  We watched it for another 5-10 minutes until it slowly drifted behind some tall trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire viewing period, I would estimate the object moved a total distance of the length of my thumb held at arm&#39;s length.<n>

I studied the object for about 20 seconds trying to determine if it was just a plane or helicopter or even a star but the object seemed to be not moving in anyway and did not have flashing lights.  It appeared to just be a white orb from the distance I was viewing from although could have had a more physical nature if seen from closer I presume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for about 20 seconds then pointed it out to a friend I was driving with.  Who at first said he thought it was a plane. I said look again, does that look like a plane?  Is it moving?  What shape is it?   He proceeded to say what the hell is that thing? We both just stared at it for as long as we could while driving up this strait road but there were large pine type trees that obscured our view of the object for about 7 seconds.  Immediately after passing the point where it would be obscured, the object was gone.. vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see it fly away or land or anything it was just gone.  From where this thing was and the clear nature of the sky there is no way if it was a plane or helicopter that it could of flown far enough that I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It suddenly moved, for lack of a better description I would say darted into the cloud formation. It darted back out of the clouds and stopped in midair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more objects of similar appearance darted out of the clouds and began to move in an orbital fashion around each other.

Beach towards the Langley airforce base. Right over the highway there was a very large craft. It was just hovering over the highway, there wasn&#39;t any movement of the object, but it was a very very large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the object it looked round then triangular, but underneath it seemed very long. We drove under the object and there were several triangle lights underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to travel down the highway , but when I turned to view the object from behind, it had dissapeared.<n>

We were stunned as we sat there and watched them, when all of a sudden two of them it seemed as if they threw something out of the craft, looked  just liked &#34;fireworks&#34; or like a cigarette butt being thrown from a car window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they disappeared from the sky. We sat there and waited for them to come back because we could still see the blinking &#34;plane&#34; lights, about a minute later, they flashed again, and did the same thing, except they were in different positions than the last time, and only one craft acted as if it was throwing something out of it&#39;s craft. It was very bizarre but yet exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only lasted about ten minutes, we watched the blinking lights get brighter and start to move south very quickly and they were gone, and we knew that it wasn&#39;t goingto come back for the evening and that our show was over.<n>
3/9/05 19:23|Coal Hill|AR|Light|approx. 10 minutes|Return of orange lights in SW sky, different than previous sighting.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42842.html|245|ndxe200503| Return of orange lights in SW sky, different than previous sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Meade LXD55 AR-5 telescope had been set-up and aligned for viewing Saturn and Jupiter tonight. While scope was tracking Saturn and waiting for the optics to cool down for better views, the SW sky was being observed just in case any more orange lights like the ones sighted on 02/24/05 might reappear, which, surprisingly, they did. The first instance happened at precisely 19:23 {the hand controller for the scope can display the time among other useful information} involving 3 orange lights flashing once sequentially one after the other, spread out at roughly a heading of 238 degrees and 12 degrees above the horizon plus and minus around 3 degrees for each coordinate to encompass the total area in which the phenomena was first noticed. A quick GOTO of the scope to the star, Aldebaran, and then switching the &#34;targets&#34; submenu to &#34;terrestrial mode&#34; {disables the RA motor so it no longer tracks celestial objects} before slewing to middle of the region of sky containing the orange lights via the use of the scope&#39;s red-dot pointer/finder is how these objects can be precisely located and documented by me. The second incident occurred at 19:27 and was quite similar at about around 3 degrees lower above the horizon than the initial group. The third and final incident was at 19:32 hrs. I was able to slew the scope&#39;s red-dot precisely onto the location of the center light as they illuminated a few seconds longer than before, they were also tightly bunched together this time at a precise heading of 242 degrees/ 13 arcminutes and an altitude of exactly 5 degrees/17arcminutes plus or minus 5 arcminutes - the average accuracy of GOTO slews to celestial objects after a precise polar alignment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights did not stay on long enough to get a peek throught the scope, unfortunately. Whatever these things are {satellites? Iridium flares?} must of moved below the treeline and eventually the horizon after the last series of flashes. Absolutely no nav lights flashing while briefly observed if these are some kind of aircraft. Numerous aircraft were spotted travelling towards the general area of Ft. Smith at the time, which were definitely adhering to FAA regulations. Location of observations is at 35.26N by 093.40W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with the Milky Way next to Orion easily visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/9/05 19:00|Yorktown|VA|Triangle|1-4 minutes|Possible UFO- but more importantly, the alien experience|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42856.html|246|ndxe200503| Possible UFO- but more importantly, the alien experience<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be certain whether this was actually a UFO, because I live approximately 5 miles from the Airport.  We see and hear jets/planes/cessna&#39;s/helicopters everyday, all night long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the odd thing about this craft was that, it was triangle shaped, and it had odd patterned lighting.  They were arranged to illuminate the craft, and the lights were all white.  Whereas, on the normal aircraft that we observe everyday, there are an array of colors like yellow, white, blue, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, the lights were not only arranged oddly, but they blinked and glowed in a very transe like manner.  They blinked so fast and in some sort of pattern, it really stood out like an oddity, nothing that we&#39;re accustomed to seeing.  I was on the balcony of our third floor apartment when i saw it, so I called out for my sister, and she came out and dismissed it as a plane.  But, I just had that &#34;odd&#34; feeling in my stomach.  Anyway, this hasn&#39;t been the first time for me to have these &#34;supernatural&#34; occurences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I was visited by &#34;aliens&#34; one night while I was sleeping.  I woke up several times, paralyzed, and couldn&#39;t speak or move, but I was able to think clearly.  I could not see a clear figure, but I was very terrified and frightened and the being that was in front of my face was telling me to go back to sleep, and was putting something into my ear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second or third time that I awoke, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, so I started praying telling the being that in &#34;Jesus Christ&#39;s name, to go away, and leave this room&#34;.  And it finally left me.  I did research and found out that there are a lot of people who&#39;ve had the same experiences as I, and there is a site that you can learn more at:  www.alienresistance.org<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Believe that all of these sitings and experiences are part of what Christians believe to be the &#34;Great Deception&#34;.  What this means is that Aliens are going to show themselves and try to get people to worship them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reality these &#34;aliens&#34; or &#34;Gods from above&#34; are really demons.  Why do you think that every alien abduction or experience like mine is always so frightening and terrible?  &#34;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.&#34;  1Timothy 4:1-2  &#34;For there shall arise false Christ&#39;s, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&#34; Matthew 24:24<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

While walking I always look at the sky. This morning I noted what looked like two very bright stars high in the western sky. they were close to each other and were as bright as the brightest stars and planets.  I had never seen them before.  After I watched them for about three minutes, the lights went off.  I do not know how long they were visible before I saw them.  After the lights went out I could see other faint stars in the area. I am 72 years old and a retired Postal Inspector and subsequent insurance investigator. I have been looking at the sky for many years and this is the first time I noted anything this unusual<n>

Or reddish orange sun type looking ) objects in the western skyline. I was going to get kerosene for our portable heaters I had bought earlier in the day. They were sitting still (hovering)  Where I first noticed them. Then they each sped straight up at a incredible speed. I thought I was seeing things at first  like a jet or plane helicopter. I knew what I saw was no plane or helicopter! I ran into  the house to get my camera that was close . They were back at exactly the same spot. They would go straight up and zig  zag, doing incredible loops and turns that no human being could ever stand the g-forces involved. They came to the same spot again and went left at 45 deg. Right 45 degrees, until  they went out of sight. Accelerated very fast, No sound! Maneuvering as it would seem. They would blink out or disappear and return to same spot  in a  s! traight line formation just like you would turn a light on off? They returned to same spot about 1 week later I observed them do similar maneuvers as first sighting. They have not returned since Dec. 2006. I have heard about other people who have had similar sightings here in Va. As mine.

It looked circular but was pulsating in formation next to each other so close, it looked like the final pulse was rectangular. As we watched, it moved in 4 different sections before disappering. (mile marker 94)<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later my husband looked to his left out his window and said &#34;Look, there it is again&#34;. When I looked over and saw the same bright yellow/orange light, I told the kids to look to make sure we were all seeing the same thing. This time the lights were definitely circular and was descending in a diagonal downward angle spaced out in 4 different sections before it disappeared. (mile marker 63)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, just a few minutes later I looked to my right and noticed brightlights coming towards us at such high speed and flying low. I asked my husband what it was and he said it looked like an airplane. I jumped forward to watch as in flew over our truck, this object was huge and the kids and I kept watching it as it circled over some buildings or RV homes. As it flew over it would flash different colors: white, blue, red, and green, one at a time. It flew over the buildings doing unremarkable moves and came down like it was going to land but flew right back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept asking my husband what it was and he said it looked like a military flight training exercise known as touch and go, they fly in like they are going to land but fly right back up. Then I said &#34;why would they be doing training exercises at 10:00pm and flying that low to the buildings. He said the military trains at all hours of the night and it was probably the El Centro base. I looked at him with some concern and told him that we were still driving through Tacna and haven&#39;t reached Yuma yet, and El Centro was after Yuma. (mile marker 35)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, right before we headed up the mountain towards Yuma, again my husband looked to his left and said &#34;there it is again&#34;. This time it was one solid circular yellow/orange light descending towards the mountain top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband to keep his eyes on the road and that I would keep my eyes on the light. As the light reached right behind the mountain top it just got BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, it completely lit up the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looked in front of us and started to see the lights from the city, we looked back up to the mountain top and that is when it disappeared.

Last night I saw a triangle with a light on each corner of the craft, and it was very high in altitude and it was huge is size.  It had to be at least 40,000 feet up if not higher and it was moving slowly from west to east.  It was located slightly west of the big dipper and soon cloud cover obscured it&#39;s sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt that most people would see something like this because it was so high up and the lights on each corner were like dim stars.  If I didn&#39;t have a grid above me that allows me to track movement, I would have never seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t possibly say what they were doing except maybe they were going to check out Mt.

At first we heard a faint noise-almost like a prop. plane- then that went away as the object neared us.  There were white lights that would at times combine with a blue and a red.  the object was white(or silver?), triangular in shape, but the bottom of the craft bowed down like the hull of a boat.  the back of the craft had two round red lights (like tail lights on a corvette!)  the size was approximately 18 ft. long and 14ft. wide.  The two crafts passed over identiticly ( about 3 minutes apart from each other) kept the same speed and then when almost out of sight, gained altitude and continued going south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3rd craft (which would have made the left corner of the triangle)  then proceeded forward and went over EXACTLY as the others did<n>

I always look up at the stars to see whats out. There were many planes in the air beacause we are close to DFW and Love Field. I also am familiar with the flight patterns and what planes look like at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up there was a very bright yellow light moving at the speed of a normal plane. Nothing spectacular, only bizarre thing that kept my eyes fixed on it was there were no FFA lights on it. Nothing was blinking at all. It also made no noise that I could hear. It just stayed a solid white/yellow color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually as a planes landing lights move away from you they dim.  This object stayed the same brightness from directly above me to as far as I could see it move across the sky, from NE to SW.  It was just very different from the other 5 planes that I could see.  Could it have been a helicopter?  I don&#39;t think so it was pretty high but unusually bright and with no noise.  There were planes much higher than this object and I could make them out with no problem. Most of all because of their FFA lights.  This was something different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date of the incident to March 8th, since the report was submitted at noon on March 9th.

There was a slight haze (maybe reflected light off of clouds) around the lights. My first impression was fireworks or flares of some kind, however, these lights were hovering, and not falling, (like flares) or extinguishing (like fireworks). The large cluster was visible for about 2 miles (driving at 45mph), then were cut off from view by a shelter belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing said shelter belt, three were still visible. We then drove towards the holyrood area just to gawk. (Hey, it was interesting OK?) The size of the lights never seemed to change, though after six miles, perspective demonstrated the lights to be over 300 feet in the air. Only two were visible at this point, and much higher than the red warning light on Holyrood&#39;s grain elevator, and possibly at great distance, since they seemed to stay in a given area thought the red lights postion changed with distance our vehicle traversed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two remained until 10 to 15 minutes after we returned home (three more miles). I do not know or claim as what they were, as I just saw hovering lights. However, the color was wrong for any type of aircraft searchlight (second though I had) or aircraft designator or landing lights (third thought).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

M. and his friends and from Mrs. E. that we are glad to submit to your attention (sorry for the bed translation in english)<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;On the day 8 March, at the 19.20-19.30, together with other 6 friends we  were stopping by the motorway restaurant near Milan, direction Genoa; the sky was clear,<n> <n><n> <n><n> suddenly an enormous bright sphere appears at an altitude of around 5000 mt., west-east direction, in front of the constellation of Orion. The bright sphere slowly stirred, lightening more and more ; the sphere has remained suspended without moving for about one minute, then two airplanes have arrived, one would have passed under it, the other on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The globe first went out and then it comes on again, becoming bigger than before and again it starts moving quickly, to go off then suddenly when one of the two airplanes was passing under it . I had already heard about the &#34;globes of light&#34; and seen the video-tapes of the Ligurian Ufological Center, but I was at the same time captivated and sceptic. Now I am even more intrigued since I have seen with my own eyes this extraordinary event and I am not alone, also my friends and their wives have seen it. We all agree in to say that what we have seen is an ufological phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we wonder: what will they say those pilots of the airplanes that have surely sighted it? F.M. &amp; c.&#34;  &#34;I am passionate of UFO, even if have never be so luck to see one. But yesterday evening 8 march around 7.30 p.m., from the balcony of my home I&#39;ve seen a great brighting star running in the sky; suddenly it went off when two airplanes were arriving near it. Was it a globe of light like those in New Mexico?&#34; E.<n>

3/8/05 18:00|West St. Paul|MN|Sphere|5 seconds|Blue glowing sphere descends to Earth between ground witnesses and jet pilots in Twin Cities, Minnesota.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44082.html|263|ndxe200503| Blue glowing sphere descends to Earth between ground witnesses and jet pilots in Twin Cities, Minnesota.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a licensed private pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my kitchen in West St. Paul looking out the window west northwest towards downtown Minneapolis 11 miles away from me. I saw a bright light over Minneapolis. I knew it was the landing light of a large jet on a downwind leg to land at Minneapolis International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 10 year old son was the only one home with me at the time. He was in the living room watching t.v. The jet was coming directly toward me and also decending, so it looked from my perspective like a stationary light in the sky that was just growing larger and larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought it would be fun to play a joke on my son, so I said come quick, there&#39;s a U.F.O!&#34; He came running. We looked out the window at the landing light on the jet growing larger and larger. My son was in awe!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 2 minutes and then as it became near enough to us, we could finally see the red and green wingtip navigation lights and a blinking white strobe light on it&#39;s belly. I said to my son &#34;oh boy, I guess it was just a jet plane after all!&#34; (At this point, I would say that the jet was about 2 miles from us, maybe a bit farther).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner  had I finished saying that, both he and I saw a large spherical ball, I would guess about 50 feet in diameter, descend to Earth from an altitude much higher than the jet was flying. We were right at the window, and the object entered our fields of vision from the top of the window opening, so it must have come from an extremely high altitude. I have seen many meteors, and this was no meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it first appeared, it was falling in a slight arcing travel path from northeast to southwest, but very quickly changed into a strightline fall directly down all the way to Earth and disappeared behind the treeline. We didn&#39;t see it rise up again. I think it struck the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t a meteor because it fell much more slowly than a meteor would, like it&#39;s speed of descent was being controlled (imagine a meteor with a large drag chute, if you will.) The object was glowing in a very faint, light blue aura that reminded me of what a blue topaz gemstone looks like. It was EXTREMELY beautiful!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my son looked at each other in amazement and we both said &#34;what was that?!&#34; at the same time!  I say there were 4 witnesses to this sighting because the object came down in it&#39;s path of travel directly between me and my son and the two pilots of the jet.  I know that there is NO WAY that those 2 pilots could have missed seeing it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the T.V. news and the newspapers for a few days afterwards hoping that there were many more witnesses and that there was a story to be told, but I never heard a word about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not exactly sure of the date being March 10th, but I am sure it was in early March at about 6 p.m. I&#39;m reporting it now, because as the weeks have gone passed, I am at an absolute loss to explain what I saw and I&#39;ll just bust if I don&#39;t tell somebody!<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this object indeed came to a rest on Earth, I would estimate it&#39;s current location would be along a line between the north end of the city of West St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis about 2, maybe 3 miles from West St. Paul toward Minneapolis. I would guess it hit the ground near Cherokee Park in St. Paul, or perhaps in the Mississippi River between the Ford Dam and downtown St. Paul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget it&#39;s slow fall and beautiful faint light blue glow! Like an angel&#39;s halo!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi! The best I could do to reconstruct the date was to look at our calender back in March for any unusual events. My wife gets home from work at 5:30 p.m., so she would have been home, but she wasn&#39;t. The only thing the calender shows is that on Mar. 8th, she was gone in the evening to our church for bible a study, so I believe now that the sighting was on Mar. 8th, 2005, not Mar 10th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t contact any investigators or authorities because this sphere was just so unusual that it just couldn&#39;t have been anything easily explainable (from Earth!). I figured if I watched the news carefully, the two jet pilots or the FAA controllers at Mpls. International would be speaking about it, or the fact that this thing came down near sunset but still very much in broad daylight in the center of a major metropolitan area would mean there were probably many thousands of witnesses, but nothing in the news ever appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I ever see anything like that again, I will certainly take careful notes, now that I have somebody like you guys that I can tell about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 48 yrs. old, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like that in my life! I kinda hope I don&#39;t see one ever again! Kinda scary in a way, not knowing what you just saw, you know?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date above to March 08, 2005.  PD))<n>

Now I feel lucky that I&#39;m a small percentage of people to witness something like this.  I remember the date and time as I had started a new job that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took our two dogs out to go to the bathroom around 8:30pm.  We had no fence around the yard at the house we had just moved into, so I had to stand outside with them.  The sky was clear that night and the weather in eastern Oregon in March at night is usually not to cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing west, watching the dogs when something caught my attention.  I don&#39;t remember a sound, so I don&#39;t know why I turned to look.  I looked to the SE over my left shoulder and saw 4 or 5 white lights moving towards me on a NW path, a little more west than north.  The lights seemed to trail the one in front of it, but had its own flight path.  They appeared like one side of a triangle with the other side gone and no back side.  I would guess the lights to be no more than 2000 feet above the ground and traveled at a slow speed, between 50 and 100mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was the wing of a very large plain with lights on it.  But the lights were only a block or so away and I didn&#39;t hear any noise.  This also ruled out helicopters.   I watched the lights fly over the neighbors house directly to the south of my house and where I was standing with no sound at all!  At this point I was not worried, my brain was just trying to figure out what these lights were.  As I watched the lights move in the WNW path something happened that put fear into me.  Once the lights were 2 or 3 blocks past my house, the lights started moving into a circle pattern.  The first light started into the circle pattern with the others following, keeping the distance between them.  The did one or two circles, continued NW and moved out of range of my vision.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the forward momentum stopped when they started to circle, or if they continued to move forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife outside in the event they might come back.  She said she could tell by the tone of my voice that something was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 4 years in the Air Force and have watched countless plains fly.  What these lights did (with no sound) is not something I believe our technologies are capable of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/7/05 20:00|San Antonio|TX|Light|5 minutes|What did I see last night?|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42803.html|271|ndxe200503| What did I see last night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, around 8 PM, I was on the back porch, sky watching. I noticed a very bright light in the western sky. I focused on it, expecting to see the strobes of typical aircraft. There was only a constant, bright white light. It was quite high and far away, traveling from southwest to northeast. I thought that as it neared my position, I would see strobes. This never happened. After a couple of minutes, I decided to go inside and get my binoculars (9x35 Leupold).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While once again looking at this object, I noticed a high flying jet, crossing the below the path of this object, although they appeared very distant from one another. As the unknown object continued its northeast path, at least two other hight flying jets came into view (separately) but again, this object was higher and much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under magnified vision, I was unable to ascertain the true shape of this object but, the light was a solid mass (no smaller lights), and the white light had a silver tint to it. What really made it different for me was that it was one large area of light. I kept thinking that this object was much larger and brighter than all the satellites I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For all I know, I was viewing the space station. I just don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes, it went out of viewing range, still heading northeast. At one point, when it was passing between the earth and Polaris, I thought I detected a directional change, to the east but, I may be mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was the first clear night we&#39;ve had in days and the temperature was around 70 degrees. Ugain, under magnification, this object was qhite large and just a solid bright, white (silvery) light and of course it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If what I saw was man-made, I apologize for wasting your time but still, I did want to report this. The last thing I&#39;ll say about this is it was quite spectacular in that I had plenty of time to watch it and the magification gave me a pretty clear view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He wrote the article off a paper I wrote describing what had happened. It describes better than I can, the events that happened that night. I have used *** on last names and street addresses. My editor later wrote a follow-up editorial on April 7th, 2005. Here is the article as follows. If you would like me to send you an actual paper, that is available also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was in that March 7th sky? So you think your Monday was a bit taxing do you? Elaine ****, webmaster and graphics artist at the Modoc Cuonty Record and her family were jolted by some very strange skies over Alturas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it all started about 8PM when she saw something odd from her living room window, &#34;I saw a large hovering aircraft with five lights, shaped like a boomerang,&#34; she said. &#34;I stared at it for at least five seconds before jumping up and looking out another window. I didn&#39;t see it from there, so i shut off the lights, but didn&#39;t see it again.&#34; Elaine said she ran outside and the object was gone, but several jets were flying in different ares of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I called my dad and told him I thought I just saw a UFO,&#34; said Elaine. &#34;He told me to come over to his house, so I bundled up my son and raced over to their house on East *** Street. When I arrived my dad and sister were outside looking at the 12 or so jets flying back and forth over the night sky.&#34; Then things got weird. &#34;A big bright ball of light appeared from the north,&#34; said Elaine. &#34;I pointed it out to my dad and we watched it come towards us. As it did, it morphed into a triangle. As it got closer to us, we could see the belly and notice it was indeed a triangle with little red lights creating the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;On the right side was one green light. It flew over our heads flying in circles and turning at sharp angles. It&#39;s flight pattern defied logic. The lights were steady, not blinking once.&#34; The craft flew south towards Likely and then it turned back, appearing to head straight for the family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Once it was over our heads, it flew back and forth, like a bird flying in all directions. At that time, we noticed a second one to the north. It was white. Once the two triangles met, they started a dance in the sky, gliding here and there,&#34; Elaine recalls. &#34;Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, one of the triangles suddenly burst into a bright ball of light. I thought whatever it was, it was going to crash land, but it broke away from the ball of light. The lights hovered over **** Street near the Alturas Cemetery, just sitting there until they slowly disappeared.&#34; Elaine said the triangle then shot off towards the north, followed closely by the second one, hovered a minute or so, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There was no sound at all when the burst of lights appeared and when the triangle appeared,&#34; said Elaine. &#34;It was pretty freaky, but we all saw it.&#34; There was no reports to the police or sheriff&#39;s office and the military has not returned calls. If anyone saw what Elaine saw on Monday night, contact the Record at 233-**** and let us know.<n>

Airport (SEA)- At approx. 1935 the sky conditions over SEA were dark/ clear, with some haze from light pollution on the east and west horizons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing south and noticed a high-altitude aircraft passing southbound directly over the SEA VOR (Nav. Aid located on the SEA airfield) the aircraft appeared to be a small / corporate or military plane with a red beacon traveling at a typical jet speed at approx. 40,000 - 45,000 ft..<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the aircraft was at approx. 80 degrees up / to the south of the airport / VOR, I noticed one movement of light coming from approx. 080 degrees mag. / ESE, at first I thought it was a meteor, as the light came into focus from haze on the east horizon at approx. 85 degrees up and south of the airport I could make out a rectangular shape of considerable size with 3 to 4 white lights in parallel at an altitude way higher than the small jet aircraft.  It crossed my entire field of view from initial spotting of the movement of light ESE, overhead and to the 260 degrees mag. / WNW hazy horizon in 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rectangular series of lights did not trail any type of light or streak like a meteor, no sound / sonic boom, it was distinctly high in altitude, but not of the movement of typical faint star type light of a satellite passing over.  I checked the Intl. Space Station orbit for 3/7/05 for Seattle, and it was to pass at approx. 1905 12 degrees on the horizon for 2 minutes.  The sunset here in Seattle was approx. 1820 ?, being that the object was distinctly observable high overhead may have been due to the angle of the sun over the horizon shining on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background includes approx. 17 years of operational work in aviation.

It had a faint vertical line down the middle, and was not uniformly smooth on the left-hand side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were travelling in a car, and observed the object while travelling south from the highway until we were well into the city. It appeared to move irrespective of the wind (clouds went past it without it deviating from its course). It seemed to be moving up, and it got bigger as we got closer to Goulburn, not leaving a trail of any kind. My mother and I tried to identify what it was (going through rocket/ ultralight/ gyrocopter/ helicopter/ airplane), but could find no rational explanation other than that it could be a blimp/zeppelin/derigibal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the most convincing part of the experience was the way it disappeared. The object seemed to dissolve in orange-red sparkling lights (almost like glitter - like in those old-ish movies where someone disappears by magic into a bunch of sparkles. This took about 3-5 seconds), before completely disappearing, leaving only a relatively bright star-like light in the sky, which I watched for another 2 minutes or so, before losing sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason we thought it was a blimp was because it was dusk, and it could have been reflecting the sun off its side, then turn around and stop reflecting in our direction. But why, then, did it sparkle orange lights and turn effectively into a star?<n>

It was a cylinder shape with three balls of lights in a triangular pattern on the bottom of it, you can tell it was a cylinder shape because its lights were reflecting off itself to reveal its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered overed the parking lot for about 5 min. and then began to move south east - we then caught up with the flying object and got out and looked at it, we heard no sound of a engine, or no smoke or any sign of a normal aircraft. And it was small, about 1 to 2 ft. in diameter and about 3 to 4 feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way, then we followed it south east down the street and parked and watched this object fly real high into the night sky, as it got higher in the air the lights got brighter. It then reached a point to where it stop getting higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, one of the little balls of light broke off and fell then quickly disappered. Then after about 2 min. the whole thing disappered. It disappered for about 30 seconds then reappered. It sat in the sky for about 1 more min. then it just flickered away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing is, having seen it at about 25 ft. above my car and hearing no engine, and then watching it go as high as planes, i cant figure out any aircraft that can silently move from above my head to that kind of altitude as silently and smoothly as it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not the only witnesses, in the wal mart parking lot, people were snapping pictures with their phones and pulling over to look at this light. For me and my girlfriend this is the first time we have ever encountered anything like this.

There were four dim orange lights in a straight line moving at aprox. 175 kts. in a NNW direction. As the craft passed at aprox. 1200 feet away and at about the same altitude, I noticed three more dim orange lights across the after end of the craft.  The craft was definitely triangular in shape as outlined by the lights on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was NO SOUND from the craft what so ever.  There was 4 orange lights from front to back and 3 lights across the rear end, the underbody was grey as iluminated from the reflection from the bridge lights reflecting off the intercoastal waterway.  That is how I was able to determine the distance and height of the craft, and as well the direction and aprox. speed. There were NO STROBE LIGHTS either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temp. was 48 deg. wind 8 kts. out of the NNW and light overcast at about 1500 ft. Duration of the observation was about eight seconds.<n>

The speed varied, (ie it was not constant like a satellite), it stopped, it remained motionless for several minutes, it changed direction about 50 degrees from the original path, it then appeared to accelerate away from the earth, (that is, it got fainter so you could barely see it), it &#34;returned&#34;, and was stationary for another period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a constant light, no strobe light, perhaps one or maybe two magnitudes less than the brightest star, &#34;very&#34; noticeable.  It was a very clear night, no cloud, no wind, approximately zero Celsius, with practically no ambient light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The viewing site was on the north shore of Lake Erie, approximately 8 kms west of Dunnville Ontario, Canada. I have one very impartial objective witness who saw it with me. The viewing area has a very clear 180 degree line of sight East/West, and 90 degrees from the horizon to overhead, so it is clear of interference from other sources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 15 imnutes, before leaving.

He looked up to what was his right and said, &#34;not sure.&#34; I said, &#34;it&#39;s looks to bright to be a star.&#34; It was a large, round, bright light with a kind of stripe or some type of band around it. It began to fade straight back, away from us not across the sky and fade out as would a &#34;shooting star&#34; nor did it have any type of flashing lights and move across the sky as would an airplane.

My friend said &#34;Ey what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking he was playing with me I didn&#39;t look at first but when I eventually did what follows is what I saw...In total at least 5 of us saw all of this and were calling our wives/girlfriends/friends to see if anyone else had witnessed it:  It was still sunny out and there appeared to be something extremely bright in the sky.. It could&#39;ve been silver but it was just BRIGHT (and mind you the sun was still out)…<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just a star or something but it was moving sorta side-to-side, up and down..just hovering around that general area..Then when we looked to the right we saw 2 more bright lights making the same movements and to the right of them, there was a pack of maybe 5 smaller (but still pretty bright) lights doing the same movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my job, there is an Air Force base (strategically put there I begin to wonder??) about 15-20 mins car ride away...After observing the lights for several minutes, an air force fighter jet flew across the sky from west to east and then disappeared...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or two of the fighter jet leaving, the pack of 5 smaller lights broke up and moved side-to-side up VERY quickly until they all disappeared.  (From the moment they started ascending til they were no longer visible must&#39;ve been about 20 seconds)  Then the two lights that were next to the brightest one also broke away and ascended very quickly..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last and brightest one ascended quickly but did not fully disappear...Most of my co-workers had stopped watching at this point, however I followed this bright one as it moved in the SE direction for close to 45 mins and eventually disappeared...I checked the next day the see if anyone had reported anything and I tried googling but nothing ever came up...After reading descriptions of sightings on here, I had to post because some stories are EERILY similar to mine.  Had I been the only person to witness this, I might&#39;ve thought I was crazy but to have the backing of my co-workers makes me believe something was happening and my eyes weren&#39;t just playing tricks on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My hands are 8 1/2 inches long, so I feel conservatively confident concerning the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In regards to the structure, I couldn&#39;t see any visible shapes connecting the spheres. It caught me slightly off guard. No sooner than I could look left, this object silently swoops downwards moving south passing directly over me, when I put my eyes into the eyepiece of my camera It was already over my head. Then veering southwestward beyond the trees and over my house before losing sight of it in 5 seconds. Using the same size-scale as in the prior chevron sighting with five lites, I would surmise that it&#39;s very likely that this would be the same object having all three center lights off, and an altitude of within 200 feet. As incredible as it seems;I would further add that it&#39;s far too coincidental of the timing and the speed of direction unless the first chevron during it&#39;s surveying, instructed the second object to come down for a closer cross scanning over me.<n>

At arms length about 2 inches wide move due south, from about 45 degrees above horizon to around the same angle south. It crossed roughly 90 degrees of space in  at most 7 seconds, before going out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this because of unsuccessfully trying to videotape it upon audio playback of my description. I also realize that estimating altitude is unlikely to be very accurate, when you get past a few hundred feet because of the given unknown size involved-even with tall trees for a background. However because I have a further reference to a similar object much closer at around 200 feet, using the length of my side yard as a close comparison. the first sighting would be close to 1000 feet because it was five times smaller in relative size. Weather conditions: clear but humidity was 90% and temperature was seasonly cold at 28 degrees but without much wind. the subsequent encounter was much closer,I believe to be the same type of craft; happened at 5:12, just 5 minutes later-of which I will file in a separate follow up report.<n>

She told me that she had seen these exact same objects hover real close to the tops of trees and then shoot straight up and disappear. She saw these objects three straight nights in a row in the same exact location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

At first I thought It was a motorcycle head light in the distance. When it got closer, I slowed down to let it go by because it was right on the yellow line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was about 100 meters or better I saw that it was just a ball of light and nothing else. It passed me about six off the ground and was just a sphere of light about the size of a large medicine ball about two feet in diameter. I watched it in my mirror as it disappeared down the road. I slowed down to about 50 KPH (30MPH) and it maintained its speed. It wasn&#39;t moving very fast maybe 100 KPH (60MPH).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for reasons such as on coming traffic or lights from any where. There was nothing in the sky ,it was daylight and there were no other vehicles coming my way or behind me.<n>

My friend who was with me was very superstitiose and spotted the light first. He jumped out of the car and we all laughed at him. We told him that it was a plain and we should go. He then hoped back into the car. And  then suddenly he jumped out again and said &#34;there are two of them, the lights look.&#34; THe light flew around then they turned white from yello and blasted of. We all were shoked.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped at a traffic light and was looking around while waiting for the light to change when I  saw a small cigar-shaped object traveling horizontally across the sky in front of me and towards the south. I nearly dismissed it as a plane until I realized there were no wings. It was very bright silver, vivid against the daylight sky and the sun seemed to be glinting off of a spot on the left (back) end.   I watched for several seconds while it continued traveling in a straight flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it shifted, looked like the right (front) end bent in toward the center, the glint of the sun changed position from the left end to about the center, the entire object rippled once and then disappeared completely from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this particular intersection, there are buildings and billboards, but none of them were high enough to hide the object and the day was clear, the sky without clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Nearing the Pittsburg Bart Station, to the north east area of the sky we could see, looked like a comet of some sort - like something was burning in our atmosphere, then we noticed there were more.  one in the center and two on the right side of us.  These were not aircraft or planes.  There was a white tail on all of these &#34;things&#34;  one seemed to float and then move quickly to the left of us.  they were situated at different angles so we were not sure it was a meteor shower we were seeing.  then the one on the right seem to seperate.  There was a ball or round shape sepereated from the burning white tail.  after it seperated, the tail seemed to dissipate.  we looked to the left and there was another which seemed to seperate, but since we were looking towards the sun, we could not see it as we drove closer to Antioch, CA.<n>

It travelled very slowly at a low altitude towards us, just above the tree line. As we neared the object, the object appeared stationery about one mile from the car we were travelling in. We could see more yellow lights -approximately 5 to 6 lights-randomly placed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopped vehicle for another look, shut off radio, car continued to idle, observed the object hovering in the north sky for about 5 minutes, above trees.

I made a comment to those who were in the house about the light. I told them I didn&#39;t think it was a plane because I saw no signs of flashing lights. My friend, who was on the phone, came out to look at what I thought was a UFO. He didn&#39;t believe it at first, but when we continued to watch for about a minute, it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is, last night (March 3, 2005) around 7:30 PM Eastren Time, I was coming home from baseball practice when I saw the same exact thing.

I cant say it was ufo for sure but i have always been wanting to see something different and i can tell you that was definetly something new the lights they never moved for the whole 3 minutes they then just dissapated i kept looking up to see if i could see anything but nothing was there.

After knocking on the door i realised i had left my car lights on so i went back to my car which was parked out by the road. It was a very clear night and the sky in Canberra is great for a star gazer because it is a small city thus their is little glow in the night sky from buildings or city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i walked over to my car i looked into the sky and directly north i saw what i initially thought was a satellite. I have seen many satellites before but this one appeared to be a little different. It was moving at a slow pace and in a straight line from right to left in the sky, it was a whitish/yellowish colour and it had no flashing lights apparent. The difference between this satellite to others i have seen before was that instead of maintaining a smooth trajectory the object seemed to be slightly bobbing up and down. I knew this was strange for a satellite so i kept watching. The objects trajectory then changed and it looked like it was moving downwards rather than in its straight line. It did this for about 30 seconds and then the object stopped and was sitting stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then came outside and i called him over to look at the object. We looked at for about 1 minute as it sat still and then to my amazement the object began flying from left to right back which meant it was flying back at a slow pace in the opposite direction as to when i first saw it. My friend and i watched the object fly for about 1 minute until it stopped again. It stayed stationary for about 2 minutes then simply disappered to my friend&#39;s and my own amazement.<n>

We have never seen anything like this before also my car radar detector was going haywire, I reset it only to have it freak out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally found a place to view them at the New Hampton Fire department when the lights lined up then disappeared leaving only a star in their place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then jumped back onto I-93 N. to track where they went, followed all the way to Plymouth but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

(Dulles) about mid way into the flight somewhere over North Carolina during beverage service, I looked out the window of the plane to the left and saw this long thin black line suspended at 35,000 feet.  I looked again several times because I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw.  I summoned a flight attendent and she also looked out the window.  I asked if it was a weather balloon, and she said no.  She said she needed to notify the pilot.  After calling the pilots, she returned to my seat and said they had never seen anything like this either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was observing the long black line which was VERTICAL,it slowly  began to rotate from the bottom to the top to now become horizontal.

It was around 11:40pm and I was fixing a friends computer while he was playing a video game on mine. I decided to take a break and go outside for a cigarette to kill time while i was updating his computer...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on my front porch as I looked to my right and noticed a bright flashing object. Now at first i figured it was a star... but then I looked at the usual spot where the north star was and saw it. I compared that star to the object and saw that the object was flashing wildly. It changed colors from orangish to reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the objects glare which made it look like a star faded for approx 1 second and came back. So I ran inside to grab my friend and told him to check this out. I noticed it had moved a little bit. It was slowly travelling to the left. But It was so slow that I could hardly tell it was moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my friend and he couldnt explain what it was. The object then seemed to be coming towards us. The star like object was getting brighter and bigger so my friend started to run. I grabbed hold of him and told him not to be scared and that it was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the object came into clear view and the Star like appearence faded and the object turned out to be a pure black diamond shape object with red blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I thought... OK.. Its starting to look like a plane, but there is no noise, it was a silent night and why is it pitch back compared to the blueish night sky and diamond shape. It was close enough to see... Im not good at measuring but probably got as close as a few thousand feet from us. It then looked as if it was gliding in the air. Its flight pattern was that of a half circle or as a curve ball would be thrown. I have seen other UFO&#39;s that I could not explain but this was the closest I have ever gotten.<n>

She cold hear no sound coming from the object. It had a bright white light shining out and other bluish green lights as well.

About 500 yards out. Horizontaly crossing the runway, which I was faced parallel towards. About 1 1/2 quarters long. Pyramid shaped body, about five stars all together. And a three star nose. Travelling about 40 mph. No higher than most helicopters fly. Southwest to Northwest, 1 mile from Missouri river. Almost following up river. The jaw droppingly odd light formation and its silent cruise through darkness was amazing. I do question my recall on this experience. Though, whatever it was. Did take my eyes to great amazement.

I called for my daughter to come and watch it since her eyesight is better than mine. For several minutes the object moved very slowly and then became stationary for approximately 5 minutes. While we were lamenting the fact that we didn&#39;t have a telescope the object began moving again in the same direction. My daughter observed that the object appeared to be made of two separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the garage and retrieved my binoculars and we went into the back yard. Upon viewing the object through the binoculars it appeared to made of 3 smaller objects. As we traded the binoculars back and forth the object seemed to be changing in its light intensity. There were several instances where is appeared to disappear completely from view. While I had the binoculars the object began dropping shafts of very brilliant white light (10-12 of them) that seemed to last only a second or two. This lasted for less that 15 seconds. My daughter was seeing the same brilliant lights with the naked eye. After the last white shaft of light appeared the object faded from view a few seconds later and was never seen again.<n>

Na Rodovia Anhangüera, o tráfego era bem calmo, exceto alguns caminhões. Eu dirigia tranquïla, ouvindo música.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O céu estava escuro e não me lembro de ter visto muitas estrelas no céu. Então, deparei-me com 5 luzes brancas e intensas que brilhavam no céu.  O que mais me chamou a atenção foi o posicionamento dessas luzes: elas estavam uma embaixo da outra, na vertical e imóveis. Olhei para todos os lados para observar se era um reflexo de outras luzes no vidro do carro. Mas, não.  A janela do carro estava aberta. Observei melhor em volta, para comparar com as luzes de torres de TV que existem naquela redondeza. Também não eram. Talvez fosse uma corda de luzes presa a algum avião. Fiquei tão intrigada e curiosa, que fiz uma loucura: parei meu carro no acostamento, para observar melhor. Eu estava sozinha, e não deveria ter feito aquilo àquela hora da noite! Desci do carro e observei as luzes por algum tempo. Não era nada preso a um avião, nem a nada. Percebi também que estavam muito altas para serem de alguma construção térrea, porque comparei com a altura das torres de TV. Fui sentindo um mal-estar, não só pelo ambiente, com aqueles caminhões passando, mas também por aquelas luzes estranhas, sobrepostas e imóveis, como algo que eu nunca vi antes. Fui embora e as pude observar até perdê-las de vista pelo espelho retrovisor. Nunca dei muita atenção para isso.  Mas, recentemente achei que era melhor procurar informações a respeito.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

In the northwest I could see the constellation Cassiopeia and underneath it, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon was a amber colored spherical light. It was larger than a star and wasn&#39;t moving so I assumed it was probably Mars. The light was slowly fading and getting brighter like thin clouds were passing in front of it, but I could not see any clouds in that direction. As we drove along it became obscured by trees, and I lost sight of it. I didn&#39;t really think it was unusual until I checked 2 separate sky maps and there were no planets in that area on the maps. The object was somewhere between the constellations Andromeda and Lacerta. An airplane flew past approximately 5 degrees above the object, but I&#39;m not sure whether it was at the same distance as the sphere. I told my brother there was something in the sky, but he missed it because the trees hid it when he turned to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an extremely clear evening and cool out. As I watched the jets, a closer and brighter object caught the corner of my eye as it moved in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say it was approximately 1000 feet up and tumbled in place. I say tumbled because the object appeared pare shaped only if you took a knife and cut the very top of the pair off giving it a flat top. The bottom half of the object was an extremely bright reddish orange glow. I only saw this glow as its (what I call) bottom end being the wider end of this object, came into view with its stationary position in the sky tumbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over and watched this object as it tumbled. When the wider more bright part of the object left my view, the object seemed to almost disappear except for a faint visual of the object in its position until its wider brighter part rotated into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object wasn&#39;t traveling left or right or toward or away, as I said, it was stationary in the sky as it tumbled. The body of the object appeared very dark in color or black from my point of view. And if I held a dime up an arms length in toward the sky, it would just have barely covered the object from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object finally vanished with a single flashbulb effect and absolutely NO sound the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on my back porch smoking a cigarette like I normally do and all of a sudden several dogs started howling like I&#39;ve never heard before (just like a pack of wolves would howl) and cows started to moan/grunt loudly right after. This quickly caught my attention and I walked from my back porch a few steps into my back yard to see what could be going on. The streets were fine and there were no neighbors out at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gazed up a bit and noticed this light flashing a few colors extremely fast in the distance which looked like a combination of mostly red and white with some possible blue/green colors. This &#34;light&#34; was sitting perfectly still flashing right above a tower. At first I thought it was some kind of new addition to the tower but couldn&#39;t make sense of that because the lights on the tower are solid white, do not blink, were much smaller and not as bright as this flashing light. I looked at this light for about 2 minutes while it just sat there and I tried to figure out what it was. All of a sudden it started to move slowy E almost towards the city and eventually disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a bright flashing star that a person would see when looking up at the stars at night, except this object was near the surface above a tower and flew away. At first I tried to pass it off as a helicopter but I couldn&#39;t figure out why a helicopter would sit idle in one spot and not move for a few mins and flash that many colors that rapid with no projected sound.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nine spherical objects in the night sky, one  flew overhead, changing into some sort of flying machine!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property. I live in a rural area in Ohio where, for some reason, just about anything can happen. The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started one evening on the 2ndof March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO’s flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO’s, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO’s almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO’s. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn’t anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO’s, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband’s shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO’s to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO’s started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO – you know, burns and radiation – so I didn’t need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. …I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO’s, when I realized I couldn’t get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, “Please come over so I can take your picture.” And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over….I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn’t stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off…with the sound of a click. I thought, “Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.” I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look…this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginni! ng of th e object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky – about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn’t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. …I don’t know, I couldn’t really tell. Something was rotating… it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-thru, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn’t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... “I feel so primitive.” I ran into the house and didn’t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO’s again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day something very unusual and strange happened at the License Bureau – no less,  of all the places. I had to renew my license and had to take the vision test. I don’t need eye-glasses to drive, so I was looking into this vision-testing machine (it was a new one) and the weirdest thing happened. In the beginning of the test, I saw a series of patterns that I was to relate back to the clerk. I did that, and as the test progressed the clerk seemed to tell me that I wasn’t seeing the board properly. Or I wasn’t getting it right, somehow. I told her that what she was asking me to look at just wasn’t there; that that part of the board pattern was there, but the part in the middle was not. I said to her that I think the machine is broken. She said that it had worked all morning and that there wasn’t anything wrong with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave her the machine (for her to look into) and she began to draw what she saw. She said that this is what is in the machine, at the moment, and this is what she needed me to describe. I looked at her drawing and recognized the pattern, immediately; I had seen this pattern and column at the very beginning of the test. I quickly looked into the machine so that I could see this pattern, too, and I was flabbergasted. It wasn’t there! The column in the middle, the one she was talking about, was gone; it was blank, now - when I  looked into the machine -  with a white background. Her drawing with the column in the middle and the symbols on it, was not there. I started to realize then that there was something going on, and it was inside of me. It had to do with my unusual experience the night before …. I just somehow knew this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She didn’t laugh at me or anything, just directed me to another building where I cold take another vision test with a different machine – the older type machines they had had the last time I visited the license bureau. This time a police officer was at the helm and I passed the test quickly and got my license. I know that this had something to do with my UFO sighting the night before. It’s almost as if the individuals who controlled the UFO were telling me that they could come into my mind and change what I see… change what I see through my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intriguing. They made me NOT see what was there at the license bureau clearly that day on the machine….and, possibly, just maybe, they made me SEE something that might not have been there, the night before, with the UFO’s. Who knows what it was I really came upon that night? The UFO experience seemed like magic to me. I don’t know…maybe it was all hallucination…or maybe I did see something the night before, a real UFO, and then the individual controlling the object (probably from afar as I didn’t sense a being in it) showed me that he could get inside my head and change my vision. The individual or controller of this experience, my experience, is God-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ….Maybe all this is just me doing all these miraculous things, mentally bringing these things about. But what about the UFO my husband and I photographed a month later? My husband and I witnessed another UFO and actually photographed it! It was a different type UFO, in that it was a red/orange sphere…but that’s another story to tell.<n>

It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn’t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. …I don’t know, I couldn’t really tell. Something was rotating… it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-through, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn’t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... “I feel so primitive.” I ran into the house and didn’t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A month or so later my husband and I had another visit but this time from a red/orange (circular) UFO. We actually got a photograph of it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

A brilliant blue-white light appeared approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon to the west-southwest. I continued to observe it as I turned south on Harco Road.  I spent 10 yrs+ in the USAF, I know what landing lights look like, &amp; this wasn&#39;t landing lights.  I turned west on Brown Road to follow it.  I stopped near Somers Church Road; a perfectly dark, country gravel road, and got out to observe it.  It went into a cloud bank that was forming to the west, and backlit the entire cloud formation.  It was similar to the auroras I saw in Alaska, but it had a pale, blue-white appearance, not to mention being in the western skies. I looked up to observe the sky over me, which was moonless and clear except to the west, and saw five aircraft (with FAA approved illumination) at a very high altitude heading towards the lighted area, and two commercial jets heading north and southwest at a lower altitude.  I got the heebie-jeebies and set a new land speed record towards home.  I got my grandmother to go outside, and she seen the lighted cloud bank too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and checked the NWS radars at Paducah KY, St Louis MO, and Evansville IN. All showed ground clutter, but the Evansville radar showed several red (heavy) returns over Williamson county to the west, which I saved and printed out.  I also looked at the GOES visible and infrared which showed nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but I know it wasn&#39;t any aircraft that I have seen, and it wasn&#39;t a meteor or Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.

THE LIGHT WOULD FLASH AGAIN FIVE TO SEVEN SECONDS LATER, IN ANOTHER POSITION NOT FAR FROM THE LAST ONE SIGHTED.  THEN THE LIGHT TRAVELLED SOME WHAT FURTHER BETWEEN FLASHES, DESCRIBING AN ARC THROUGH PERHAPS TWO DEGREES OF SKY, SEEN AGAINST THE BACKROUND STARS. THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT REMINDED ME OF A BEE IN MOTION AROUND A FLOWER, ONLY THE MOTION COULD ONLY BE INFERRED BY THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN IT FLASHED. THERE WAS ONE OBJECT.  ITS BRIGHTNESS WAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS  THE STAR BETELGEUSE IN THE CONSTELLATION ORION.THE FLASHING HAD A &#34;SOFT&#34; QUALITY; IT DID NOT RESEMBLE A STROBE LIGHT SO MUCH AS AN INCADESCENT LIGHT.

It continued across the sky and little pieces seemed to burn off and disappear.  The light disapated and continued all the way to the horizon and dissappeared beyond the tree line. It was not like other debris or meteors I have witnessed in the past because it lasted so long. It headed from west to east in the sky starting at about 11:00 position and ending finally at the 5:00 position behind the trees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is white, wing-less (from what I could tell) and cigar/oval/cylindrical shape with no contrail and no noise.  There is always alot of military aircraft flying here since we are close to Vandenberg AFB.  The second sighting it flew at the same time as two military aircraft at a higher elevation, flying past each other, one multi-engine jet, the other smaller, single or twin-engine, both high altitude.  My first thought was that the white object was a drone, pilotless sort but have not seen anything like it in the archives.  I thought it might be a blimp, but the second viewing it was traveling at an accelerated speed.  I can&#39;t think why a &#34;Black operation&#34;, or X-plane or whatever would fly so conspicously in the day light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In fact, that is one of the important points I would want to make about this.  There were several other planes in the sky that day, and they ALL made contrails.  This object, or formation of jets, made these white &#34;balls&#34; instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They would appear the way an image can be &#34;swiped&#34; onto a screen with a special effect.  Each group of rows were confined within in a rectangle-shaped area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it is possible to have jets sky-write with a similar teqhnique, the width of the rows and the fact that we could not see any planes at all makes me doubt it.  Even though we could see all the other planes in the sky, including high altitude ones, which you could at least make out the mass of the body, i.e., darker area in the front of it&#39;s contrail, we could never locate the objects that were responsible, with the naked eye.  Also, this didn&#39;t take place in a small corner of the sky, it covered miles in several directions...back and forth several times before they disappeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited and watched for two more days, but it has been raining here, ever since we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was heading north bound on the highway and as I was coming up to the 95th St. exit, an object in the sky caught my attention.  The time was 5:20am,(I had just looked at the clock when I changed the radio station).  The object was moving across my vision from left to right so it should have been from west to east at that point.  I couldn&#39;t tell much about the shape so I will describe it as more of a spherical point of light.  It was a white light that strobed in and out fairly quickly.  Every few seconds it would change color to red or green.  Sometimes I could see the two colors at the same time.  I was able to watch the object on and off from the 95th st. exit to almost I55.  I lost it around there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I merged onto I55 a similiar object appeared in front of me again.  This time a little bit closer but I still could not make out the shape.  It moved in the same general direction as the object I had previously seen but headed a little bit more south east than directly east.  It didn&#39;t change colors as often and it seemed to flash faster as the object picked up more speed.  I glanced back at the road and when I looked at the sky again the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and the moon was bright this morning.  I could see some stars through the city lights.  I do realize I was traveling through an area with two major airports and the objects could have been aircraft but they didn&#39;t act or look like any kind of aircraft I have seen around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then when I came into a lighted area with another Officer approaching me with his work vehicle, I noticed the bright object lift up into the sky appearing to have a flat light grey bottom, white lights in all three corners, clear sky with few stars around area, unidentifying object gliding and heading North-East, with no sound at all.. This all happened very suddenly. &#39;wish I had a witness to what I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is possible that because of the night sky and the brightness of the object that is bigger and higher than my perception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was struck by how perfectly round the object was. It was a self illuminatined ball bright blue in color traveling northwest directly accross the roof of the town home beside me. It was a clear night and I by shear chance I was looking directly at the spot where the object appeared or I might not have seen it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed it hard to guess but the object was visible for no more than a second or two and disappeared beyond the houses a few hundred yards away. There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an air traffic controller earlier in my life and have seen lights appear to be many things they were not. The clarity, brightness, and speed of this object is something I have never encounted before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked out the window and noticed a flying object no more than 500 ft in the air. At first I thought it was a airplane, but then then it picked up speed, and moved one mile in less then 3 seconds. Then it dissapered. The second sighting, it was the same object, over the same area, flying the exact same route, except this one just dissapered into the after 3 seconds........the lights on the craft were weird, they were yellow, green, blue, and black. Funny thing, is it made no sound.....if you would like to contact me, please do so through email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I expected noise because it was flying at a very low altitude. Aproximately 2000 feet. Flying from West to East in direction.  Also, no cloud cover that night.

But i remember it like it was yesterday.  I was outside in the field behind my house when I saw lights in the sky.  I looked up, and I saw 2 objects with lights on them.  The lights were blinking around the middle of the craft.  At first, I thought that what I was seeing was just airplanes.  But then as they got closer into view, I monticed that the objects I was seeing was definetly NOT planes.  They were circular in shape and they produced no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the objects for the whole time they were in flight.  Until I saw them land in the woods that are about 1 or 2 hundred yards behind my house.  The way they landed was something I&#39;ve not really seen.  They were flying forwards, until they got over the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they stopped in mid air, and floated directly downward.  When they were flying, they were right next to each other the whole time.  The objects were i think silverish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That sighting was pretty cool. Because I have never seen anything like it!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were two very bright lights on the end of this object, and one dim light in the middle. As we got closer to the object it appeared to be more triangular in shape. It then veered off to the north and revealed a fourth light, and when the fourth light became visible it looked like a kite the size of a B-52, possibly a little larger. When it was in this kite shape it appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the exit on Grand to get closer to it and get a better look. We went north and it then revealed a fifth light and we lost track of it very quickly as it headed east over a group of houses. We caught up with it again about a mile further east and it was in the triangular pattern again. We followed it going north for a while but took an eastbound road again to follow it more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point that the object flew directly over our heads (the object was heading south), and when it did that it seemed to be 5 lights in a boomerang shape, the three leading lights were dim and the tail lights were extremely bright. while it flew overhead we stopped the car and rolled the windows down to see if it made any noise, and it did make a very odd sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then did an about face and started heading north again. We began moving further east as it did this, and  when it had gotten a couple miles north of us, it went back into the line pattern and landed, very shortly, and then took off again. We lost track of it for a short time after it took off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We caught up with it again going southbound on Lakeside, and it was in the boomerang configuration at this point, and we saw it going at an amazing speed in a southern direction. We were going about 70 miles an hour south, but it was almost overhead to nonvisible in a matter of seconds.<n>

It moved very slowly, but was moving at a rate visible to the naked eye when we passed under it. As we passed under it, I tried to get a glimpse of it&#39;s shape and deducted it to be a solid form, either circular or triangular, maybe cubical. The friend sitting in the passenger seat leaned his head out the window and said he thought it looked like a triangle. There was a single light at the side moving forward, rather large and seeming to take the entire corner of the object. Roughly 1 and a half minutes later, after leaving the highway then returning to it, the object had easily moved another 4 miles - much farther than the pace it had been going should have allowed. It was continuing to move south when I again left the highway, a change from the western course it had been taking. The object was clearly not a plane or helicopter, nor any other flying craft I&#39;ve ever seen for myself. My counterpart sitting in the passenger seat agreed, and also accepts that what we saw was likely some sort of UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/05 20:05|Sumner|WA|Light|10 minutes|5 lights hover in a circle around one odd shaped lighted object in Sumner, Washington|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42634.html|348|ndxe200503| 5 lights hover in a circle around one odd shaped lighted object in Sumner, Washington<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upstairs looking out my bathroom window, warm evening, scattered, thin clouds that you can see through in the dark-otherwise the night sky was clear in spots. Looking to my left towards town, lots of airplanes in the flight path, one right after another~probably 3 heading towards Sea-Tac International Airport. I look to the right after hearing someone talking kind of loud and excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see 2 lights in the sky very low and bright. As I lean out my window to get a better look, suddenly I see 3 more, they&#39;re spaced as if in a circle around 1 different looking thing. I figured the 5 positioned around the center light must be those low flying &#39;planes&#39; (that hardly make any noise at all). All of them seemed to hover including the center one. They weren&#39;t very high in the sky either, lower than planes fly (by the way, they weren&#39;t in or near the flight paths) and I&#39;m not hearing anything other than cars going by and loud voices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My binoculars are old and they don’t get real clear images but the center light especially should’ve been easy to see if I had good binoculars! Anyway, they all sit there for about 3 or 4 minutes and then the center one starts heading to the left. At this point the lights on it looked as though it could be a saucer shape 2 big white lights with a thin blue light behind them with 2 other smaller lights next to the big ones but spread out a little. When it leaned to its right to leave, it got very, very bright. Once accelerating in that direction, it looked like 2 round sections-one on top of the other - one light white and the other a pinkish purple but very soft. I believe they were flashing as it came by pretty close, maybe a couple of blocks away heading towards Edgewood sort of diagonally. Half way there it began jerking back and forth very quickly maybe 3 times and then continued on. After it got by the Yeast Plant it then looked like it was made up of 4 sections that were staggered and they were all a goldish-white almost amber. Turned to look at the other 5 lights and one was already moving in the same direction but was closer to me. It too got very bright as it banked to follow the other one. As it went by, it looked to me like a Thunderbird design. Can&#39;t really explain it that well but could draw it. I didn&#39;t think about watching the others, not sure if they were still there but wanted to call someone to see if other people had called it in. I figured there were a lot of calls, it being early evening and all the cars I heard go by and the voices I heard must&#39;ve been watching them too but the officer sounded surprised when I asked him if anyone had called in about them. He said nobody else had called other than me! That really surprises me - I don&#39;t know what they were but I really got the feeling at first when I seen this, was that they&#39;re actually letting themselves be known. There has been so many things happening around here for months that we can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this really covers everything I watched because I am so excited and needed to get this written quickly for future reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing that has been happening around here for maybe 3 or 4 months, we hear loud popping noises kind of like it sounds if you live close to a military base practicing, sounds like artilliary. But we&#39;re too far away to be hearing that, never heard it before and it&#39;s at all different times of day and sometimes night, like right now (21:05). They stopped for about 2 weeks recently but started again on Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

I don&#39;t know what it is, but it has had the same characteristics both times. Last thursday (yes, the night of the jennings special) I spotted a vehicle in the air, lower down, and stay stationary in the sky. White lights and red lights alternating blinking. I tried to take a pic with my camera phone, but the photos didnt come out well (damn sony ericsson phone). Tonight, same object, about 30 min from where I originally saw it last week, this time I pulled over to try to snap a pic with the camera phone, but could not even get it to show up on my camera for some reason (even with night mode on). It was just stationary in the sky. I sit there and attempted to take two pics (which neither picked it up) and then it just whizzed away, not blink of an eye fast, but faster than most planes I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Freaked me out both times, enough where my back was sweating this last time. I almost wanted to run up to somebody and tell them to look at it (was pulled out by a gas station) but in Arkansas, I figured I would be attacked for being a nut or something (my wife even thinks im going crazy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen one a long time ago, totally different, but something is going on down here right now, 2 in two weeks is just insane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were three lights on the craft that were not blinking.  This was followed shortly by another identical craft.  Neither one of the aircraft emitted any type of sound.  Refer to file attachment.  This is being submitted for my neighbor who does not have internet savey.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/05 17:50|DeWitt|IA|Light|at lease 30 minutes|March 1, 2005 outside of Dewitt IA on I30, there were 6 lights grouped into 2 triangular configurations near the eastern horizon|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42646.html|351|ndxe200503| March 1, 2005 outside of Dewitt IA on I30, there were 6 lights grouped into 2 triangular configurations near the eastern horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling on Interstate 30 East out of Clinton/Dewitt Iowa.  The sun was behind the horizon causing a red hue in the sky.  We noticed three lights near the eastern horizon (off to our left a little bit) in the grouping of a triangle.  As we continued to drive eastward, we no longer could find them, but we noticed another triangle grouping of lights slightly to our right (northward).  They did not seem to descend.  They were too high off the horizon to be towers.  They did not blink, but seemed to flicker. We eventually drove on the 61 southward.  We caught glimpses of them through the trees, but as the darkness took over the horizon, we lost sight of them. From the time we noticed them, to the time we could not see them anymore, a total of about 30 minutes had passed.  We also noticed during this time, other light orbs not in triangular groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/05 16:00|El Paso|TX|Sphere|three seconds|silver shpere climbed slowly then shrank away and disappeared.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44085.html|352|ndxe200503| silver shpere climbed slowly then shrank away and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time is approximate. We were driving in the northeast area of town, quite populated, when my wife said &#34;look in the sky!&#34; There was a small (looked about the size of a pencil eraser) silver orb in the sky near the mountains (Franklin Mts.). We were pulling into a gas station when this happened. It moved from where it was to the upper left slowly and then seemed to shrink to nothing and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shadow could be seen as if on a orb-shaped ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies were mostly clear with wispy clouds. Airliner planes were in the air too from the local airport but didn&#39;t pay it any attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the intersection of Dyer St. and Hondo Pass. Please leave a message if you call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the source of the report implies a daytime sighting.  We have amended the time above to 16:00 hrs..  PD))<n>
3/1/05 03:30|Palatka|FL|Triangle|approx: 20 seconds or so|Large, Slow Moving Triangular Shaped Object that seems to suddenly disappear...|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43825.html|353|ndxe200503| Large, Slow Moving Triangular Shaped Object that seems to suddenly disappear...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work night shift and happened to be speaking to someone outside, when, over their head I noticed something. I looked up and there was a large, slow moving triangle shaped object...the shape that I saw was not the actual body, but the three lights at each corner that defined a triangular description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;WHAT is That!?!&#34;, the other person turned around, saw it and was unsure themselves...this all happened in a matter of seconds and then , it seemed to just disappear.  The object was definately low , though, not low enough to get a detailed description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shared this information with my family and then, nearly one week later , my husband and I were outside and he noticed something amidst the tops of the trees, over the St. Johns River..I saw him looking, but just disregarded it and he asked me to come over and look, but by that time it was gone .<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described to me nearly exactly what I saw, only , his description had it closer to the ground with a center light as well...I did not see a center light on the first occasion. He said it moved extremely slow and , then, after disappearing behind trees, he no longer saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remember these experiences QUITE well because neither of us have ever experienced this type of thing before and we know of no Military Aircraft that fit this description and just disappear, it seems , into thin air. This also happened just before and right after our youngest son&#39;s birthday, so , that makes the dates easy to remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been looking for it again , yet, have had no luck. We have also been trying to find something that looked like it online , and we ran across this site and figured, well, we obviously are not the only ones to have this experience and what could we lose by sharing our experiences? Does anyone recall having a similiar experience in Central Florda around this time? Does anyone know if this could POSSIBLY be Military Aircraft? We recall absolutely no sound, no fire..just a very subtle , large, slow moving craft that seemed to be triangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both nights had clear skies and we have not heard of anyone else&#39;s account of this.<n>

Object was decreasing altitude.The entire object would light up red very often. Object then changed direction and flew to the right without changing altitude.  My view was then blocked by neighbouring houses.  Was not seen again. I am 27 years old.  In my entire life I have never seen a aircraft that flew so smoothly or was entirely lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/05 01:00|Newport Beach/ Laguna Beach|CA|Sphere|3 hours|I took some pictures with my new Brookstone CaptureView of some boats over the water, the next day 2 were not boats.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42618.html|356|ndxe200503| I took some pictures with my new Brookstone CaptureView of some boats over the water, the next day 2 were not boats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping testing out my new brookstone CaptureView Binoculars, and I was snapping some shots of boats over the water when I noticed two boats had soart of been rocking back in forth in the same place for a long time. I figured they were boats so I snapped some pics of the two little lights. The next day I plugged my camera into the computer  and the first 2 pictures on the camera were tiny spheres!...at first the picture looked black and that it didnt work, but I blew it up a few times and saw what looks like a sphere being lit from the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed up and watched for awhile but the clouds were rolling in and lights werent doing much of anything, I wonder if the other boats saw them, or if maybe the camera/binoculars made the light look like that and it was just a shrimp boat or something?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No photos provided by witness.

3/1/05|Humble|TX|||Mr Davenport....I periodically visit your site and even though I have never seen a ufo....I do believe very much in their existence....|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42631.html|358|ndxe200503| Mr Davenport....I periodically visit your site and even though I have never seen a ufo....I do believe very much in their existence....I really wanted to say thank you very much for keeping this site active and realistic.  One day, as we all know, we will see the physical proof of the truth and perhaps until that day you will be the bridge from our so called dark age that will help us keep a finger into the esoteric aspect of existence.   As it is, so many of us already know the truth, we just would love it if the truth would physically manifest for the disbelievers and nay sayers not in retaliation for their riteous repudiations but simply so that we can finally say that we live in a universe of multi civilizations ,both from physical planes of existences and other dimensional worlds.  Thank you again for your valiant efforts and energies and I wish for us all and you especially the very best.  ((name deleted))<n>
