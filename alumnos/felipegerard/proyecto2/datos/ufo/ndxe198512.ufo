I turned around and witnessed the UFO the person I was speaking to saw my face and new something was strange. I said look out side what is that she was in shock also. We both became pretty excited. We just could not explain the object. We both got up and ran down the stairs and opened the front doors and out into the yard. That’s when it became kind of scary...this thing didn’t go away and it was really there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was massive hovering about 100 to 200 feet above our front yard. It was a circular object on its side just sitting in the sky there was a pulsating glow around the edge of the object I don’t know if it was lights or just energy but it was amazing to me because for such a huge object there was almost no sound. The only sound was a humming pattern but not anything I have heard before like it was in your body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time becomes hard to explain when your adrenalin kicks in but when we both looked at each other and new it wasn’t going away we yelled for our family to come and witness it also. When the family got to the front door. This massive object created a cloud and slowly rolled behind it. Never to be seen again.<n>

This was during the time that Haley&#39;s comet was appearing, and I assumed that this was what he was seeing. I looked out of his bedroom window and saw a diamond shaped object above the neighbor&#39;s house, just as my son had said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I took our binoculars and went out to the front lawn. This object wasapprox. the size of a nickel held out at arms length. It had yellow lights on the top and bottom, and red and green lights going around the center of the object-like rippling on and off. The object was not moving and was not making a sound. My son said he first noticed it about and hour and a half before he even came and got me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband made a comment that maybe someone had strung a huge Christmas ornament on a flagpole. I also called a neighbor and asked that she come and witness this because we all thought we were seeing things. My son and I were petrified. He and I both even today remember the feeling of being scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house after an hour and called the yarmouth Police Dept and asked if they had any calls on a UFO sighting, and the dispatcher laughed at me. He offered to give me a phone number of a UFO reporting organization, but I refused because this is a small town and I knew what was going to happen (and it did...a few people made jokes about this..like we were crazy).  I even went as far as to run around my house and double lock all the doors and windows (my heart was racing). My husband made the comment &#34;Do you really think that if this is a UFO that locking doors and windows will keep them out?&#34;. But, to this day, 18 years later, my son and I still talk about it.<n>

It had red and green blinking red lights and seemed to stand still on all but one of the occasions.  On that one occasion, it came closer, hovered for awhile and took off at a right angle.  It seemed to go straight up at this right angle, but very fast.  It seemed to be close enough that I would have heard a sound but there was no sound.  I have been telling people about it ever since it happened but have never filed a report, telling myself there must be a logical explanation.  Nevertheless, I saw what I saw and decided that I should report it.  Maybe someone else also saw it and my report will help to corraborate what others saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and the sky was filled with stars. I noticed there were several cars pulled to the side of the road in front of me. There was no other traffic and they still had lights on etc. People were standing by their cars and looking southeast over a field and above a pine forest. When I looked I saw a triangular shape that was indescribably huge. It was defined by colored lights. I think they were red blue and green, and I think they were in the corners and maybe along the edge of the triangle. It was hovering not far above the trees at a distance of maybe a couple or three hundred yards from yhe road. Even at this distance it was enormous, as if a football stadium had taken flight. Of course, as things go, this is all I can remember. I didn&#39;t even remember this for a long time and even then I wasn&#39;t sure it was real until I heard someone describing the same thing on Coast to Coast with Art Bell. The memory loss I can not explain but I understand that it is not entirely uncommon, although these days more people seem to be seeing these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t imagine that it was man made...we are simply not that scientifically advanced. It was huge, motionless, and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/15/85 17:30|Auburn|AL|Unknown|5 min. +|Bright lighted object 30 feet above me, rose, sped away, emitted shower of sparks in distance|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42434.html|7|ndxe198512| Bright lighted object 30 feet above me, rose, sped away, emitted shower of sparks in distance<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is very inexact.  I know the decade - the 80s; I know the day - Friday; I know the time - 5:30; I know the season - winter. I know the time and day  because I was meeting my husband, a University Professor, after he left school, at the house of friends for a drink before going out for dinner. It had to be winter because it was already dark. I took back streets to avoid stop lights, had stopped at a two-way stop and, because there were no other cars in sight, was preparing to cross the intersection when  all at once  shining above me was a  bright, bright white light, not a searchlight type beam, but a hovering object with light diffused all around and about, seeming to come from within. It could not have been more than 30 feet above me and made no sound at all. I was so startled that I couldn&#39;t take note of any particulars.  It just radiated light.  I couldn&#39;t move, but after no more than a minute, the light rose straight up to a great height and sped away in a north westerly direction, very straight and purposeful, very rapid.  I followed it with my eyes and headed in the same direction in my car but it was moving much too rapidly and I couldn&#39;t of course follow a straight course. When it was just a speck of far-away light,  a shower of sparks fell from it and it was gone. When I got to the home of our friends, I told them my story and then called the police to ask if anyone had reported an unknown object in the sky.  No one had.  I can&#39;t imagine that I was the only one who saw it.  Perhaps there were those who wondered at it but didn&#39;t report it, or perhaps those seeing something streaking across the sky didn&#39;t think it unusual.  I probably would have been among any of those except that I had seen that object rise from just above me before it sped away. I had no idea what to do with such information and, too, didn&#39;t want to be among those being laughed at for  telling  outlandish stories about flying saucers.  So - I filed it away in my memory bank and thought of it seldom until I saw the Jennings program the other night.  This inexact description of events of that evening probably does not advance knowledge re UFOs at all but at least  and at last I&#39;ve told it.  I am a feet-on-the-ground sort of person;  never before had I experienced something of that kind, nor have I since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had just driven into the parking spacein front of my apartment and had gotten out of the driver&#39;sseat when I looked north and saw a glowing ellipse, justlike the bowl of a street lamp. The ellipse was absolutelyfeatureless and absolutely still, and its bottom thirdportion was hidden by the tops of some nearby houses.Now I had never seen such a light before in that position,nor did I ever see such a light again during the remainingfive years that I lived in the village of Walden. I looked atit with considerable surprise, and I remember sayingto myself, &#34;This must be a UFO…But I will never see aUFO, so it cannot be one…&#34; I looked at it for about fiveminutes, and then I went into my apartment. I now realizethat the UFO must have been hovering over the WallkillRiver, midway between Walden and the hamlet of Wallkill,which are about two-and-a-half miles apart on the WallkillRiver.	About 75 minutes later (about 7:30 PM), I waswatching the evening news on television after having eatendinner when I suddenly heard the most deafening soundover the house in which I lived. It sounded like a helicopter,but much louder than any helicopter that I have everheard before or since. The sound was so loud that it wasactually shaking the house. I flew out the door to see whatcould have been causing the sound, and but I could seenothing flying over my house. But at that moment, I knewin my heart that I &lt;had&gt; seen a UFO earlier that eveningand that the sounds that I had heard &lt;must&gt; have beenthe military in camouflaged helicopters in hot pursuit.(Stewart International Airport, by the way, is locatedabout five to seven miles southeast of Walden, and it hasbeen rumored that there is still a military presence on thatinstallation to this day.)	The next day I read in the local newspaper that aUFO has been seen going down the main street of Monticello(about thirty-five miles to the northwest) with police cars inhot pursuit. I have never seen a UFO since, but I am now amember of the UFO research group at Pine Bush.	Thanks for listening to my story. I hope to hearother stories, particularly from those living in the Hudsonand Delaware Valleys of New York State.Regards,Joe QuinnJoequinn@monroe.ny.frontiercomm.net<n>
